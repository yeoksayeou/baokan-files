### Chairman Chiang of the National Senate Explains the Knowledge That Should Be Possessed for the Implementation of Constitutional Government.

Chongqing: On the day after the fourth session of the National Senate passed the "Motion to Convene a National Assembly to Enact a Constitution and Implement Constitutional Government," Chairman Chiang gave a detailed explanation of the specific knowledge that should be possessed for the implementation of constitutional government. The secretariat of the National Senate has obtained a record of this explanation, which is hereby published to draw the attention of those who are concerned about constitutional issues. The original text is as follows:

Regarding political facilities, the various ministries and commissions of the government have all made detailed reports. What I want to talk about is the constitutional issue that everyone is concerned about. I believe that this session has two major gains. First, we passed the motion to promulgate the constitution early. Second, we resolved to convene a National Assembly on a regular basis to designate the constitution. Promulgating the constitution early, so that the country can have a permanent fundamental law, so that the scale of national construction can be completely established, so that the people can strive for national affairs, and have a clear and common standard for obligations and rights, is not only what the national sages expect, but also a major event that the central government has been constantly striving for in the past ten years. As for Zhongzheng personally, since the government promulgated the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage in the Republic of China in 1931, so that the people of the whole country jointly shoulder the responsibilities of the country, I have always felt that the unfinished business of the Premier and the ultimate goal of the revolution must be completed by us catching up. My eagerness to have the constitution formulated and promulgated as soon as possible must be deeply understood by all of you and the compatriots of the whole country without my own explanation. Now we are building the country in the midst of the war of resistance, in order to raise the awareness of our people's responsibility and to lay a lasting and solid foundation for our country's future. The bill for convening the National Assembly on a regular basis to formulate the constitution that was passed yesterday will certainly occupy a very important page in the history of the Republic of China. We and all colleagues, in the relationship of being in the same boat through wind and rain, are not only sharing weal and woe, but also sharing fate. In view of the enthusiasm of your discussions and the sincerity of your discussions, I would like to offer some frank opinions to you today.

(1) Regarding the relationship between constitutional government and political tutelage, it has been discussed in detail on the scene yesterday. Under the common belief in the highest principle of nation-building, the Three People's Principles, we sincerely discussed and said everything. This is a very good phenomenon. My personal opinion is that promoting constitutional government and implementing political tutelage (to be continued). (24th dispatch)

Editorial

### Japan's Political Season

Following the Abe Cabinet, which was in power after Hiranuma, the Abe Cabinet's debut came at a time when Japan had been tragically abandoned by the Nazis and its international position was completely isolated. Therefore, the Abe Cabinet's declared general policy, in addition to preparing to resolve the China Incident with all its strength, was primarily aimed at breaking the diplomatic deadlock. However, for the past four months, despite Abe and his cabinet members constantly comforting their anxious and disappointed people with optimistic tones, the fact is that not only has there been no improvement in foreign relations, but even the fundamental diplomatic foundation of the entire government is still shifting and wavering. No wonder the military has gradually become impatient and suspects the current cabinet's ability to resolve the China Incident and adjust the complex disputes with third countries. The general public is also in a state of bewilderment, awaiting clarification of the government's foreign policy.

The 75th session of the Japanese Diet has convened. This is Japan's political season, and also a current hurdle for the current cabinet. Based on its unique constitution, the Japanese Diet has never had the same effectiveness as the legislative bodies of constitutional countries from the beginning. Its power to guide and control the government is already extremely weak, and even the only major power to pass the budget is subject to significant restrictions. After the "May 15 Incident," politics deviated from the norm, and the Diet's function was further reduced to what Ms. Utley said was equivalent to a rubber stamp. The 73rd and 74th sessions of the Diet, which were convened during the Sino-Japanese War, also had some routine questions and debates, but the passage of budgets and military spending was easier than in previous sessions, and no one dared to criticize the military's aggressive policy. As for this session of the Diet, it will not have any fundamental achievements, but considering the difficult situation of the current Japanese government, the lack of solutions for domestic and foreign affairs, and the plight of the war of aggression against China, all of which are far more serious than before, the debates in this session of the Diet will undoubtedly be more激昂 vehement and heated than in the past, and the government will inevitably be unable to circumvent or conceal its own weaknesses. In the past three or four days, the Diet has been handling routine matters, and will have to adjourn for the New Year. Major debates on national affairs will probably be delayed until mid-to-late January, which is also the period when the US-Japan Treaty and the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty are about to expire and become invalid. In these twenty-odd days, if the various operations of Abe and his colleagues fail to achieve tangible results, then under the agitation of various internal and external situations, the recurrence of the Japanese political turmoil is feared to be unavoidable. The sudden and active appearance of the Minsei and Seiyūkai political parties is a noteworthy event. Even Abe himself has repeatedly broken precedent to invite the leaders of various parties to ask for cooperation. This cannot be immediately recognized as having the meaning of a revival of party politics, but it also shows that the Japanese political situation is in an undercurrent of recession, thus giving the political parties some opportunistic chances to be active.

These situations and difficulties have of course been imagined by Abe and his cabinet members, so for more than a month, they have almost exhausted their efforts to conduct various foreign talks and contacts, hoping to achieve some gains in diplomacy to ease the internal crisis. On the one hand, in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Nomura and others held talks with the ambassadors of the great powers to Japan. On the other hand, Ambassador Horinouchi to the United States, Ambassador Shigemitsu to the United Kingdom, Ambassador Tōgō to the Soviet Union, and Ambassador Sawada, who has just taken office in France, engaged in negotiations with the diplomatic authorities of various countries in Washington, London, Moscow, and Paris. At the same time, in view of the strong attitude of the United States toward Japan, and the slim hope of renewing the commercial treaty, it hastily announced its readiness to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and continued to declare through the navy that it would try to realize this within two months, in order to reduce international suspicion and distrust. Its anxious situation fully illustrates the eagerness of the Japanese government to achieve tangible results in easing international resentment before the Diet meets. Therefore, it also pleaded with the zaibatsu to temporarily endure inconvenience and temporarily sacrifice some of their interests.

In the past one or two days, various optimistic airs have been constantly transmitted from Tokyo, and it is said that the stock market has also seen vitality. But in fact, the most that Japan has gained is that the United States is not prepared to adopt economic punishment measures against Japan for the time being, and that the decade-long gold loan case between Japan and France has been substantially resolved. These are all gains on the negative side, and cannot be said to have any concrete improvement in Japan's current international position and diplomatic relations. However, the Japanese government has greatly exaggerated and praised its optimism. Undoubtedly, these types of events are stimulants, used to cope with the Diet's difficulties and ease various grievances among the people. Japan's current difficulties are all the inevitable result of its aggressive actions against China. How can it be saved by simply improving diplomatic relations with various countries? To go a step further, even if Abe and Nomura can truly achieve their wishes and obtain the conclusion of the US-Japan, Soviet-Japan, and French-Japan commercial treaties, as well as the Soviet-Japanese fisheries treaty, it is a big question how much benefit this will have for the current situation in Japan, let alone that it is only Japan's unilateral wish. What Japan can offer to various countries today is, at most, to use the sharing of looted gains as bait. But judging by common sense, the leaders of the great powers will not be so short-sighted, and for the sake of coveting some short-term gains, they will put everything aside and indirectly support the Japanese factional regime, which is shaking in danger, so that it can continue to invade China and make the world further away from stability and peace. Therefore, the optimism of the current Japanese government itself is not worthy of much attention. Even if the Abe Cabinet is temporarily spared from danger, if its major attempts to resolve the China Incident and open the diplomatic deadlock do not fundamentally abandon the idea of invading China and the so-called "New Order," it will ultimately prove to be a futile effort and have no effect at all.

### The Burmese Delegation to China Left Chongqing for Yunnan and Returned Home. A Meeting Was Held in the Airport Lounge, and Representatives of Various Groups Presented Souvenirs.

The Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions

The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is as follows: "The Society is gathering together, gathering experts from all over the country in one hall, reviewing the facts of the progress of our engineering circles since the War of Resistance, and studying and solving the practical problems experienced firsthand in wartime service. I believe that there will be many valuable gains to comfort the expectations of the whole country. Our country, as a country with backward industry, is engaged in a comprehensive and protracted war of resistance. To win against strong enemies, we must rely on the united mobilization of our national technical talents to do their best. As far as post-war nation-building is concerned, whether our country can leap forward to become a modern country is largely the responsibility of the engineering circles. In the past, the Premier's grand vision of catching up with science, restoring inherent knowledge, and creating an industrial plan was the basis for realizing the Three People's Principles. Now, when the country is urgently reinvigorated, it is an opportunity for our engineering circles to rise up and devote themselves to serving the country. I deeply hope that your society will advocate the new atmosphere of serving the country with technology, inspire the enthusiasm of our national engineering scholars, concentrate the strength of our national engineering scholars, and guide people to do things and treat things with a spirit of quick and practical work, and engage in creation and cultivation. Many of your members are teaching in schools or serving in careers. Although their efforts are different, their responsibilities are the same. It should be known that the rise of emerging countries in modern times has been caused by technical talents cutting through thorns in extreme hardship. If pure technology is combined with ardent patriotism, then any difficulties can be overcome, and the revolutionary cause will surely succeed. Overcoming the wartime difficulties of material and financial resources, and seeking the most economical and effective construction methods; how to train a large number of mid-level technical cadres to guide young people on the road of serving the country in practice; how to improve the management of enterprises to save consumption and increase efficiency; how to communicate between the technical and administrative aspects to make flexible use; how to promote skilled workers in the work they are responsible for, love and care for workers, and show sympathy for the laboring compatriots who are serving in the military; and even how to guide the national engineering personnel to establish the same national belief, so that they can enthusiastically devote themselves to the construction of the Three People's Principles country, are all things that your society should pay close attention to in addition to discussing academics and reading papers. Strive together to meet the great achievements of a thousand years, and I have high hopes for your society." (23rd dispatch)

### China Sternly Rejects Peace Proposal

Chongqing - According to reliable sources today, France recently advised China to negotiate peace with Japan as soon as possible. However, France is not willing to act as a mediator. When France made this proposal, the Chinese government immediately and sternly rejected it. The reason is that the only condition for a ceasefire and peace negotiation between China and Japan is the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. The peace that China is willing to accept is a peace of honor. According to the same source, France is paying close attention to the battle of Nanning. It believes that after the Japanese army occupied Nanning, it has obtained a land stronghold for attacking Annam. At present, the French army stationed in Annam has only 50,000 troops, which cannot effectively defend the border area of Annam, and it is even more difficult to resist the Japanese attack from the sea, air, and land. Therefore, the internal situation is extremely anxious. However, France believes that after the cessation of the Sino-Japanese War, Annam can be spared this threat.

### Britain Considers Solutions to Tianjin Silver Issue, Plans to Divide Silver into Two Parts for Safekeeping, Chinese Authorities Express Impact on Chinese Sovereignty

Chongqing - A senior Chinese official told a United Press reporter last night that the British government is planning to resolve the Tianjin silver issue, roughly allocating a portion of the silver to be managed by an international committee, and another portion to be kept by a neutral country's bank. Representatives from both Britain and Japan will participate in the international committee. He said that Britain is seeking a solution to the silver issue and is seriously considering dividing the silver into two parts. The silver handed over to the international committee will be used to relieve flood victims in North China. The official stated, "We naturally oppose both plans, because both affect Chinese sovereignty. Silver is 'completely Chinese property, and China legally retains full rights to manage and use it.'" China does not intend to consider this plan. China has its own funds to be used for disaster relief, and London has assured China that the silver in Tianjin will never be handed over to the Japanese.

### Roosevelt Cables Pope, Cooperates to Promote World Peace, Builds New Order with Spirit of Religious Faith, Appoints Taylor as Personal Representative to Vatican

Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday the appointment of Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican, to cooperate with the Catholic Church "in parallel efforts for peace." The President stated that the appointment "should not be seen as the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Vatican." The appointment announced by the President yesterday is part of a new program of his efforts to restore peace and aid victims in conjunction with people of all faiths. The President sent similar letters to Pope Pius XII, Mr. Butler, head of the Christian Evangelical Church of America, and Rabbi Adler of American Judaism, requesting their cooperation to achieve his broad goals through religious faith. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

New York - President Roosevelt has appointed Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican. Taylor is the chairman of US Steel Corporation and is currently a leading member of the International Committee for Disaster Relief. He will go to the Vatican with the informal title of ambassador. The White House emphatically stated that this move does not restore the diplomatic mission of the US government to the Vatican, which ended in 1870. When appointing his personal representative, President Luo also sent a long telegram to the Pope in Rome, stating: "Now, on Christmas, at a time when worries envelop the world like a dark age, it is especially appropriate to send a telegram to pay tribute. Politicians are now considering the new order of the world, and he is convinced that the new order will eventually be established. He believes that even on this day, billions of people are quietly engaged in building this new order, and although their voices have not been heard, their common faith will eventually shape the history of our era. He now wishes to send his personal representative to the Vatican to assist each other in seeking peace and reducing suffering. In the future, when there is an opportunity to establish world peace on a more stable foundation, common ideas should be consistent. This is extremely important. He hopes that all churches that believe in the same God will devote all their strength to this great task." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

The Pope Responds with a Telegram Expressing Gratitude, Sternly Condemning Violent Policies

Vatican City - US President Roosevelt telegraphed Pope Pius XII, saying that he intended to send Taylor (Chairman of the International Relief Committee for Exiles from Germany and Austria) as a personal representative to the Vatican to cooperate in promoting peace and reducing suffering. The Pope responded with a telegram expressing his gratitude. He then addressed the matter when he received the Cardinals for Christmas greetings (note that the Cardinals pay their respects to the Pope every year on Christmas), and gave a speech clearly mentioning the current war in Europe and elucidating its possible impact on the economy and society. The main points of the speech are as follows. The Pope condemned violent policies, with particular emphasis on the Soviet invasion of Finland.

He stated, "We have unfortunately witnessed various actions that conflict with the provisions of international law, the principles of natural law, and the most basic humanitarianism, proving that the concept of law has been obscured by the purely omnipotent concept. There is a country that, under the pretext of being threatened, deliberately inflicts aggressive actions on a small nation that is diligent and peace-loving. In fact, the so-called threat not only never existed, but was impossible. This kind of aggression should be listed among the aforementioned actions. It abuses destructive tools and inflicts all kinds of atrocities on women, children, and the elderly, disregarding life and trampling on freedom and rights, and will surely be condemned by heaven in the future." I have made efforts for peace, but have not achieved anything due to the mutual suspicion of various nations. Every time I think of the possible impact of the current war on the spiritual, material, economic, and social aspects, it is chilling.

"The rulers of all countries bear the responsibility for the fate of their nations, and should also consider the goals and consequences of the war based on this concept, and determine the basic points for a fair and honorable peace at the appropriate time. If there is an opportunity for negotiation, do not reject it outright."

### Basic Conditions for Honorable Peace

As for establishing a fair peace, the following principles can serve as an outline: (1) All countries in the world, regardless of size or strength, should have the right to exist and be independent. This is the basic condition for a fair and honorable peace, but no country should condemn another to death simply because it has a desire to exist. (2) In order for the international order established based on the above conditions to be lasting, the heavy burden constituted by the arms race and the crisis of using material power to destroy justice must be eliminated. Indeed, gradual spiritual and practical disarmament that can be accepted by all countries is of utmost importance. Any peace proposal that does not take this into account cannot be lasting. (3) Regarding the reorganization of international life, all participating countries should be aware of the shortcomings of the past and reform international organizations based on the experience gained. In order for countries to accept peace treaties based on a sense of honor, without unilaterally interpreting them arbitrarily, it is essential to establish legal institutions to protect various treaties and ensure their faithful implementation. (4) With regard to Europe, in order to establish a better organization, the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, nationalities, and minorities must be taken into account. Even if these demands conflict with existing treaties and are not sufficient to constitute strict laws, they should be considered in good faith and satisfied in a peaceful manner. When necessary, existing treaties should be revised in a fair and wise manner. (5) If nations and their leaders cannot take into account the status of mankind at all times based on a sense of responsibility and the simple and unshakeable principles that are in accordance with natural law, then any good solution cannot be said to be perfect. All these five points must be kept firmly in mind. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### German Government Protects Illegitimate Children, Valuable Assets of the State Entrusted to Commissioners for Upbringing

Berlin - German Deputy Leader Hess issued a statement on the issue of illegitimate children, saying that in times of national crisis, children born out of wedlock are also valuable assets of the state. Therefore, the National Socialist Party has appointed protection commissioners to take care of these children. The National Socialist movement regards the family as a solid cell of the state, and in a war that sacrifices many lives, newly born children are especially important to the state. Therefore, the children left behind by young men who enlist in the army without having time to hold a wedding will be regarded as valuable assets by the state and brought up. It is reported that recently, a young woman who became pregnant without being married and whose fiancé had been killed in Poland wrote to Hess requesting relief, so Hess issued this statement in response.

### Trade Agreements Initialed Between France and Yugoslavia, Economic Negotiations Between Britain and Yugoslavia Reach Compromise in Principle

Capital of Yugoslavia - Despite Germany's strong opposition, Yugoslavia completed the procedures for concluding a new trade agreement with France yesterday. It is reported that the new treaty shows that Yugoslavia has made many concessions to France. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

Capital of Yugoslavia - The economic agreement between Yugoslavia and France was initialed yesterday and will take effect on January 1, 1940. According to this agreement, France will purchase large quantities of meat, timber, tobacco, mineral sand, and ramie from Yugoslavia. According to estimates by the local political newspaper, the annual amount will reach 100 million dinars (the Yugoslav currency, totaling about 3.6 million pounds). Most of this amount will be deducted by France to repay Yugoslavia's debt principal and interest, so that Yugoslavia does not have to remit cash. In addition, France's exports to Yugoslavia will remain at the same level as before the outbreak of the war. France was originally a producing country, but after the outbreak of the war, it has transformed into a consumer country. The economic agreement it has concluded with Yugoslavia is to adapt to this new situation. In addition, Yugoslavia is also conducting economic negotiations with Britain, and an agreement has also been reached in principle. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### Sweden's Policy Adheres to Neutrality, Willing to Strive for Peace, Maintaining Friendship with Germany

Capital of Sweden - Sweden's new Foreign Minister, Gu Sri, met with Mr. Coster, a reporter from Haitong News Agency, for a conversation of more than an hour. The main points were that Sweden will strive for peace, and the Swedish people are eager for peace. Regarding Sweden's foreign policy and the Soviet-Finnish war, the Foreign Minister said that many Swedish people have joined the Finnish army, and that the Swedish army is concentrated on the northern border only to defend Swedish territory. Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have all adopted this precautionary policy. Gu Sri mentioned the relationship between Germany and Sweden, and solemnly reiterated the Swedish government's desire to maintain friendly relations with Germany. Sweden's policy is based on strict neutrality, which the belligerent countries such as Germany will surely agree with, because Germany does not want Sweden to be drawn into the war. Commercial negotiations between Germany and Sweden have ended, and an agreement has been signed to exchange goods, which is the basis for maintaining commercial relations between Germany and Sweden. In order to maintain the livelihood of its people, Sweden must exchange goods with other countries. Mr. Gu briefly talked about the reorganization of the Swedish cabinet, saying that the former Foreign Minister Sandler and Prime Minister Hanson had conflicting opinions.

### Twenty-One American Republics Protest to Britain, France, and Germany, Combat on Uruguay Sea Violates Neutral Zone, Twenty-One Countries Will Jointly Prevent Such Incidents

Washington - Regarding the battle between British and German warships on the sea of Uruguay, violating the American neutral zone, President Boyd of Panama issued a note to Britain, France, and Germany this afternoon on behalf of the twenty-one American republics, expressing his protest, and said that if the warships of the European belligerent countries engage in combat activities within the neutral zone, the twenty-one American republics will jointly prevent these warships from approaching the American coast or entering the ports of the American countries, and will also prevent them from carrying out repairs. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

Washington - Regarding the battle between British and German warships on the sea of Uruguay, which violated the American neutral zone, after President Boyd of Panama issued a note to the belligerent countries on behalf of the twenty-one American republics yesterday, diplomatic officials here said that although the belligerent countries have not recognized the neutral zone delineated by the "Panama Declaration," the American countries have the same opinion on this matter and attach great importance to it, which can be seen from this action. The attitudes of these countries, especially Argentina, are the strongest and can be cited as satisfactory. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

Washington - Regarding the issue of the American neutral zone, after the twenty-one American republics jointly protested to the European belligerent countries, Senator Norris, an isolationist senator, issued a statement commenting on this matter: "We are now arbitrarily delineating a neutral zone within 300 miles of the sea around the American continent, and are not allowing battles to take place or a single cannon to be fired in this area. In fact, we have no unrestricted rights to the belligerent countries, nor do we have the power to govern such a vast area of the sea." When the US Congress discussed the Neutrality Law Amendment, Norris strongly supported President Roosevelt's proposal. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

Washington - The twenty-one American countries issued a declaration of neutrality, the main points of which are that the governments of the American countries have received official notification that on the 13th of this month, a British warship and the German warship Admiral Spee fought on the northeastern coast of Uruguay, and there is also a notification that British warships detained or sank German merchant ships such as Dusseldorf and Usukumo in American territorial waters. According to the first paragraph of the declaration issued in Panama on October 3 of this year, the American countries, when maintaining neutrality, may protect the ocean near the American continent so that belligerent countries outside the Americas do not engage in belligerent actions within the American safety zone. Now, according to the above-mentioned declaration, and in order to prevent the recurrence of the situation claimed in the aforementioned notification, the American countries have decided to protest to the belligerent countries, and will negotiate to pass various rules that can strengthen the joint defense system, such as any ship that has engaged in belligerent actions in the American safety zone will not be allowed to repair ships or purchase any supplies needed in American seaports. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

Capital of Chile - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué saying that in the future, if the warships of the European belligerent countries deliberately violate the American neutral zone delineated by the "Panama Declaration," the government of this country will impose sanctions, such as prohibiting these warships from entering the ports of this country.

New York - Local business people say that this year's Christmas will be the sweetest and happiest Christmas in ten years, because 1929 was the peak of American prosperity, and the economic situation has not been as good since then.

### Festive Scenes in Paris and Berlin

Paris - The French military authorities issued an order that during the Christmas holiday, all hotels and other entertainment venues may operate until 2:00 a.m. The French people have always liked to spend Christmas in hotels. With the issuance of this order, they can still spend the holiday in hotels, and they can have fun day and night. The only fly in the ointment is that the military authorities have not extended the operating hours of public transportation. All buses, trams, subways, etc., must still stop operating at 8:30 p.m. The general public still cannot fully enjoy going out at night. If they do not return early, they must walk home no matter how far away they are. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

Berlin - During this time of war, Germany is still celebrating Christmas as usual. It is celebrating for three days from today. Christmas trees and other seasonal scenes are everywhere. Churches are holding Christmas services. The Christmas after the war is truly the same as before. The lively scenes are no different from in previous years. However, Berlin is still implementing a blackout on Christmas night. Today, all stores are still open for business. Customers are all going to buy daily necessities, because all businesses will be closed for the next two days. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

### US Unwilling to Renew Trade Agreement Before Far East Disputes are Resolved, Talks Underway in Tokyo and Washington, US Officials Explain US Attitude

Washington - Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and US Ambassador Grew are actively engaged in talks in Tokyo. On the other hand, Japanese Ambassador to the US Horinouchi also met with Secretary of State Hull for a long time today, extending on some points in the Tokyo talks. This matter was commented on by well-informed sources: According to the current US tariff law, there are only two import tariff rates, one is the general tariff, which applies to all countries regardless of whether they have a trade agreement with the US, and the other is the retaliatory tariff, which applies to countries that discriminate against the US. So far, only German goods are subject to retaliatory tariffs. In addition, the current US navigation law contains a clause stipulating that various goods transported to the US by ships from countries that do not have a trade agreement with the US shall pay an additional tax of 10%. However, former President Grant issued an order in 1872 stipulating that this clause does not apply to Japan. This order is still valid. Therefore, after the US-Japan trade agreement expires on January 25, 1740, Japanese goods imported into the US can still be subject to the general tariff. However, if the US government wants to impose various restrictions on Japanese imported goods, it is possible for Congress to enact laws. Japanese newspapers reported that US Ambassador to Japan Grew assured Foreign Minister Nomura that the US would still maintain trade relations with Japan. This must be transferred depending on the attitude of Congress towards Japan, and the diplomatic attitude of Congress often only follows the lead of the State Department. However, the points that Ambassador Grew told Foreign Minister Nomura have caused a good response in Japan. This is very satisfying to the State Department, and it is said that the Japanese government is now working hard to get closer to the US, which is commendable. However, responsible officials all said that Japan has repeatedly violated its promises to China, and has repeatedly obstructed the interests of foreign countries in China. The disputes between Japan and the US have arisen from this. Regarding these disputes, the US attitude is still extremely firm and has not changed slightly. If Japan wants to conclude a new trade agreement with the US or negotiate temporary measures, it must first resolve the various issues in the Far East so that the US government can be satisfied. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Tokyo - Newspapers here today praised the US's measure to stop levying discriminatory tariffs on Japan, but solemnly stated that this step cannot be a permanent adjustment of US-Japan relations. "Nikkei Shimbun" praised US Ambassador to Japan Grew and claimed that "the fair response of the US has removed the barriers obstructing US-Japan relations, but the success of Nomura's diplomacy cannot be guaranteed." "Asahi Shimbun" declared that "it is too early to interpret the US decision as indicating that the US intends to revise the trade agreement." (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

This telegram has been drafted and is being solicited for the consent of this government. This government fully approves of it. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### Severe Cold in Finland Halts Fighting; Kemi River Valley Returns to Finnish Control; Soviet Strategy Suffers Another Setback

Copenhagen: According to reports received here, the fighting in northernmost Finland has come to a standstill due to the severe cold. Both sides are only trying to maintain the status quo this winter and are unwilling to advance. North of Salla, the Soviet High Command has deployed only two regiments, a rather weak force. However, the Finnish counterattacks are also weak, so they have been able to maintain the status quo. In short, the Soviet army is unwilling to launch an offensive this winter. Therefore, if any major battle occurs, it will be launched by the Finnish forces. Reports in local newspapers about Soviet defeats in the Salla area are somewhat exaggerated. However, since the Finnish army recaptured Salla-Koski northwest of Salla, it has regained control of the Kemi River Valley. The Kemi River and Kemi Lake are natural barriers in eastern Finland, extending for 400 kilometers, making it the most advantageous terrain for Finnish defense. Currently, the Finnish army is trying to strengthen its control in this area to prevent a Soviet breakthrough. It is reported that the Soviet army has already sacrificed 2,000 men in attacking this area. However, with a force of 10,000 in this area, the Soviets still have plenty of reserves, and a more violent offensive is expected soon. However, if the Soviet offensive is not to fail and is to achieve its plan of cutting Finland into two, it must protect its flanks and the security of the Murmansk Railway. To date, Finnish guerrillas are constantly threatening the Soviet lines of communication in their rear. Furthermore, news from the Swedish capital claims that due to Soviet failures in northernmost Finland, the Finnish army has captured 5,000 Soviet soldiers. Unconfirmed reports state that since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, Soviet losses have been heavy, with 25,000 killed, 39,000 wounded and missing. According to Soviet deserters, numerous Red Army officers have been executed since the failure of the Soviet offensive. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Moscow: According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, "There were no major developments on the front lines on the 22nd and 23rd.

Helsinki: A communique issued here today stated that after fierce fighting, the Finnish army has recaptured the entire Salajärvi area. The Soviet army resisted fiercely in this battle, but suffered heavy casualties and eventually collapsed. Some surrendered. Finnish forces in the area are continuing to advance. It is reported that the captured war materiel includes six artillery pieces, eight tanks, and eight anti-tank guns. In the battles of Tolvajärvi and Aglajärvi, the Finnish army captured over 600 prisoners and killed 2,000 enemy soldiers. Finnish forces in the Salla area are currently continuing to advance.

### British Government Controls Pound Transfers

London: According to a new cabinet order published here yesterday, any resident transferring pounds or pound securities to a non-resident must obtain approval from the Treasury. Non-residents refer to those residing outside the United Kingdom, its Dominions, British territories, British protectorates, British mandate territories (except Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong), Egypt, Sudan, and Iraq. This order supplements the 1939 Defense Regulations concerning finance and will take effect on January 8. However, non-resident pound accounts remain free and unaffected. The order includes an exception: income received by non-residents from the sale or liquidation of their pound securities, or dividends or bonuses on securities registered in their own name or the name of their nominee, or interest on bearer securities collected by a custodian bank, may be credited to the non-resident's account without any formalities.

### Dutch Aircraft Manufacturer Fokker Dies

New York: Famous aircraft designer Mr. Fokker passed away here at the age of 49. Fokker was born in Java and returned to the Netherlands with his parents at the age of four. He displayed a talent for aircraft manufacturing from a young age. At the age of 21, he made his first flight in an aircraft he built himself. Germany admired his talent and persuaded him to go to Germany to found an aircraft factory. In 1913, the factory flourished. The following year, when the European War broke out, the factory received a large number of orders from the German government and undertook the training of aviators. The most famous of his aircraft was the Fokker D.VIII fighter. By the end of the war, Germany had handed over no fewer than 1,500 of these aircraft. After the war, Fokker moved his factory to Amsterdam and established the Dutch Aircraft Manufacturing Company. In 1922, a Fokker aircraft flew from east to west in the United States, achieving remarkable results. Fokker then went to the United States and founded the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. In 1926, he built the first three-engine aircraft, and the test flight results were excellent. Admiral Byrd, the leader of the Arctic expedition, immediately purchased it for his expedition. Fokker aircraft became increasingly renowned, and no fewer than 25 airlines in Europe and elsewhere used his aircraft, and 19 airlines in the Americas used them as well. The Atlantic Aircraft Corporation was later renamed the General Aviation Corporation, and Fokker served as the director of the mechanical department until he retired in 1931.

### British Admiralty Announces Laying of Mines in North Sea to Protect Shipping; Two Swedish Ships Sink After Striking Mines

London: The British Admiralty announced yesterday the procedure for laying mines in retaliation for German mine warfare and to "better protect ships sailing in the North Sea." The Admiralty communique stated that it will no longer issue notices when laying mines in designated areas because "Germany is laying automatic anchored mines without notice in the North Sea outside British territorial waters." Therefore, the Admiralty announces its intention to lay mines to protect ships sailing in the North Sea off the east coast of England and Scotland. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Oslo: The Swedish ship "Mars," carrying a shipment of coal, was sailing from that country to England when it struck a mine and sank in the [blank space in original] Sea on the morning of the 21st of this month. Another Swedish ship, the "Garhäll," arrived shortly thereafter to rescue the crew of the "Mars." Unexpectedly, it also struck a mine. As there was not enough time to lower the lifeboats, the crew members who fell into the sea drifted away with the waves. A Norwegian ship arrived and rescued one crew member from the "Mars" and seven crew members from the "Garhäll." The other 28 crew members from each ship are missing. The Norwegian ship has arrived at Kristiansand in this country, and the eight rescued crew members have landed. Two of them have been taken to the hospital for treatment due to serious injuries.

### Britain and France Will Not Stand Idly By If Sweden and Norway Are Attacked; Two Methods of Assisting Finland Have Been Drawn Up; Negotiations Will Be Held with Nordic Countries

London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that in the coming days, the British and French governments will be most concerned with the issue of assisting Finland and will therefore hold negotiations with the Scandinavian countries. According to statements made by French Prime Minister Daladier and certain British cabinet members, the joint meeting of the British and French Supreme Defense Committees recently discussed two methods of assistance. One is direct assistance, that is, the direct shipment of military supplies to Finland. It is expected that Britain and France will supply the country with hundreds of aircraft, as well as a large number of rifles, machine guns, field artillery, anti-aircraft guns, war defense guns, and gas masks in the short term. At the same time, according to news from Rome, Italy will likely not remain inactive. If Berlin still refuses to allow Italian arms shipments destined for Finland to pass through Germany, they will inevitably be shipped by sea to Sweden and Norway, and then transshipped to Finland. Some even believe that the Italian government will allow a batch of volunteers to go to Finland to serve in the army. The second is indirect assistance, which will be broader than direct assistance. That is, it is hoped that the Scandinavian countries can assist Finland's resistance to the greatest extent possible. However, there is a great risk if these countries participate in the Soviet-Finnish war. Therefore, if these countries are attacked by the Soviet Union or Germany because of their assistance to Finland, how Britain and France should protect them should also be considered. As far as Germany is concerned, it has long coveted Sweden's iron ore. If it does not receive a sufficient supply of ore in the future, it will become increasingly difficult to fight against Britain and France. Therefore, it is expected that the country will take advantage of any pretext to seize this iron ore. Regarding this, it is heard that if the Scandinavian countries are attacked for assisting Finland, Britain and France will not stand idly by. If Germany occupies Sweden or controls it economically, Norway's situation will also be precarious. The situation is extremely serious. Furthermore, Norway's west coast has significant strategic value. If it also falls into the hands of the enemy in the future, Britain and France's overseas trade and even naval activities will be threatened. Therefore, for these reasons, Britain and France are conducting talks with the Scandinavian countries and will certainly try to reassure them, so that they will earnestly assist Finland's resistance without fear of future troubles.

### The Post-Fall of Nanning Situation; The Japanese Army's Edge in the Battle of Batang Has Been Greatly Blunted; The Lines of Yongbin and Yongwu Have Become Stalemate

Guilin airmail, after the Chinese army's victory in Northern Hunan, the Japanese forces are increasingly exhausted. Although they have had a short period of rest and replenishment, they have not reached the capacity to launch a large-scale new offensive. However, the Japanese army finally made one last risky attempt, landing along the Qin-Fang coast on November 16 and invading the border of Guangxi. The following is a record of the fighting in that area:

Last winter, when Beihai was under pressure, the Chinese army once gathered on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, preparing to confront the invaders head-on. Later, the situation changed, and there was no need to control the southern route with heavy troops, so some were transferred elsewhere. According to the observations of Chinese and foreign military observers, the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties in the fighting over the past two years, and its forces are already insufficient. If it wants to invade Guangxi, it must have at least five divisions or more. Before the Battle of Changsha, the Japanese army could not draw and concentrate so many troops. Moreover, the Battle of Northern Hunan depleted its vitality, making it extremely difficult to launch a new offensive. However, it disregarded everything and took the risk of invading Guangxi. It is said that the guide for this was Huang Mingtang. Huang was originally from Guangdong, and the Shiwan Mountains on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi stretch for thousands of miles, with undulating hills and dangerous terrain. Over the years, it has been an area where bandits have emerged. Huang knew this situation well and secretly incited ignorant bandits, who were then used by the Japanese army.

When the Japanese army landed at Qisha Longmen Port, it initially did not expect to make any progress. The Qin-Fang coastal area is a famous "vast sea of sand," an indefensible area. However, after landing, they had to pass through the unprotected sandy plains, which was a good terrain for the Chinese army to unleash its firepower. Unexpectedly, the bandits guided them, and the defending army was trapped and unable to display its power. As a result, Qin-Fang was lost, and the Japanese army gained a foothold. One side sent troops north, while the other side continuously reinforced them, infiltrating through secret routes, heading towards Xiaodong Datang, crossing the Yu River secretly, and detouring to Santang and Sitang on the Yongbin Road. As a result, Nanning could not be defended.

The fall of Nanning occurred at 2 p.m. on November 24. Its vanguard was actually a bandit force from the Shiwan Mountains. The defending army resisted heroically, and after a fierce battle, they withdrew. Nanning was originally a key hub for southwest transportation, but all manpower and materials had been evacuated in advance, making it an empty city. When Nanning was under pressure, the Chinese army moved south in large numbers. Wei, Li, Su, He, Dai and other units were ordered to rush to block them. The vanguard of Dai's unit was Shao Yizhi's regiment, which arrived near Nanning at 2 p.m. on the 24th. By that time, Nanning had fallen, so they stopped at Ertang, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Japanese army, guided by the bandits, sneaked into the Santang and Wutang area. While Shao's regiment was on the march, they suddenly encountered Japanese cavalry. After determining that they were the Japanese army's outpost, they quickly dispersed on the spot to intercept them, thus unfolding a fierce battle. At that time, Shao's regiment's situation was quite unfavorable, as they were attacked from both the front and the rear. Fortunately, the soldiers of his unit were well-trained and did not panic when faced with the change, so they were able to confront the Japanese army, fighting while setting up defenses. On that day, dozens of Japanese aircraft took turns bombing and strafing the regiment's position. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers attacked more than ten times. The officers and soldiers of the regiment resisted calmly, annihilating each wave of attacking Japanese soldiers in front of the position. The presence of Japanese aircraft did not have an effect. Within a day, 600-700 Japanese soldiers were killed. That night, the Japanese army significantly reinforced their forces. The next day (November 25) at dawn, they launched a massive assault on the Chinese army's position. The battle was extremely fierce, but they were gradually repelled by the Chinese army. Although the Chinese army suffered many casualties, the Japanese army's casualties were at least three times those of the Chinese army. Soon, the Japanese army launched a smokescreen and a general offensive across the entire line, but they still failed to achieve their goal. Throughout the two-day battle, the Chinese army never gave up an inch of territory. A certain rifleman in the unit was extremely accurate in his shooting, killing six Japanese machine gunners on that day, eventually forcing them to shift their position, which is particularly commendable.

The next day at dawn, the regiment was ordered to break through the encirclement. Regiment Commander Shao Yizhi personally led two companies to charge. In an instant, they captured two hilltops. Shao then used binoculars to observe the enemy situation on the high ground. Unfortunately, a bullet flew over and struck a vital spot, causing him to sacrifice heroically. The regiment's deputy commander Wu Qisheng saw the regimental commander fall and immediately led his unit to rescue him. Unfortunately, he was also shot by Japanese machine guns. Deputy Regiment Commander Wen Mo heard the news and rushed to continue the command, ensuring that morale did not fall. Soon, Deputy Regiment Commander Wen was also hit by shrapnel from a Japanese artillery shell, suffering four wounds on his back. However, he finally bravely commanded, repelling the Japanese army. In total, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, the unit killed and wounded as many as 900 Japanese soldiers. The regiment's losses also reached 300-400, showing how intense the battle was. After the fall of Nanning, the two armies' positions were stalemated on the Yongwu Road at the Great and Small Gaofeng Ridge, and on the Yongbin Road between the Seventh and Eighth Pond. Both places have undulating hills and dangerous terrain, leading to fierce battles for control, particularly near the Eighth Pond. At that time, the Japanese army, riding the momentum of a small victory, approached the Chinese army. If the Eighth Pond could not be defended, Binyang would be in danger. Therefore, the Battle of Batang was of great importance to the security of the southern front.

At that time, Dai's division Gao's regiment arrived one after another and were ordered to defend the area in haste. Regiment Commander Gao was the battalion commander when Guan Linzheng served as division commander. He had fought heroically at the Great Wall in the past, annihilating countless enemies. During the defense of Wuhan, he served as the regimental commander of Du's division, and his isolated defense during the Battle of Wujiazhuang repeatedly chilled the enemy's courage. Later, he was transferred to Dai's division. After receiving the order this time, at dawn, after the deployments were completed, the order to attack was given. All the soldiers wore light clothing and moved out of the trenches, crawling forward. When they approached the Japanese army, shouts of killing rang out, the sound of hand grenades echoed, and bayonets danced, rushing into the Japanese formation in a storm of rain and wind. The Japanese soldiers relied on aircraft and artillery in combat, but when faced with the Chinese army's bayonet charges, they often fled in fear. At this time, the Japanese army was caught off guard and panicked. After a brief engagement, they collapsed, with several hundred killed by Chinese soldiers' bayonets and bullets. Corpses filled the trenches, and blood filled the ditches. Batang was immediately recaptured. The Chinese soldiers, encouraged by their victory, pursued with all their might, halting at the Seventh Pond due to a broken bridge. The results of this battle were significant, and the casualties among the Chinese soldiers were less than half those of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, for the first time, dared not underestimate the Chinese and dared not invade again. The stabilization of the Guangxi-South front was no small feat.

After the southern front was stabilized, the Yongbin and Yongwu lines became stalemated. The Yongwu Road faced each other at the Gaofeng Ridge area, while the Yongbin Road used the Kunlun Pass as a barrier, with the vanguard still near the Eighth Pond. The Japanese army, with insufficient troops, had previously relied on the help of bandits, but now it could not use the same tricks again. In addition, the Chinese army carried out powerful attacks from time to time, and the guerrillas were active on the south bank of the Yu River and on both sides of the Yong-Qin Road. The Japanese army often felt threatened, and the destruction of the highway made reinforcement even more difficult. Therefore, they were at a loss for what to do. The Chinese side was digging deep trenches and building strong fortifications to prevent the Japanese army from fleeing north, while actively preparing to annihilate the Japanese army at the appropriate time.

### Yang Hu's Talk in Chongqing

Chongqing Correspondence, the fifth of this month was the anniversary of the revolt of the Zhaohua warship. Yang Hu, a central commissioner who presided over the event, recently made a speech saying, "The central government is now jointly commemorating the Zhaohua revolt and the Yunnan uprising. The two commemorations have the same meaning and are causally related. In terms of revolutionary means and meaning, they are inseparable, so they are held together. Today's situation is more tense than it was then. At that time, it was Chinese against Chinese, but now a powerful enemy is pressing in, and we are facing a great disaster. We should use ten times the spirit of the "Zhaohua" and "Yunnan" revolutions to deal with the current environment. We are looking forward to the greatest national memorial day in the near future. As long as we work hard and do practical work, success is only a matter of time. I am a revolutionary soldier, and there is no word "difficult" in the dictionary of a revolutionary. When the central government first raised the slogan of "final victory", the people of the country were afraid of difficulties and thought that it would be difficult to achieve, or that it would take a long time. Now there are facts to show us that victory is getting closer and closer. The facts are like this, so no matter what, we cannot shake our belief in the war of resistance and hinder our path to victory." He also said, "I regard Shanghai as my second hometown. I have a harmonious relationship with the elders and brothers in Shanghai. Although we are in different places, I am still very concerned. I read Shanghai newspapers every day and I deeply understand that the citizens of Shanghai are suffering in a painful environment, and I greatly admire them for upholding justice. I sincerely hope that the people of Shanghai will continue this unwavering determination and not lose heart, and strive for future glory."

### More Than 300 Boy Scouts in This City Have Served in the War Zone and Achieved Great Merit; They Have Participated in the Nanjing and Xuzhou Campaigns; Now They Are Working in Political Training and Medical Rescue in Various Places

The Boy Scouts of Shanghai City, under the guidance of the Boy Scouts Council after August 13, participated in battlefield service work and made great contributions. Since the Chinese army moved west, more than 300 Boy Scouts have continued to work in the interior, and have established the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service, led by Leng Xueqiao. Now an office has been established in Chongqing, a mobile regimental headquarters has been organized, and work has begun. The following is a communication from Leng, the regimental leader, to the Boy Scout community in this city, describing the current situation of the regiment:

Past Service Conditions

Since the outbreak of the August 13 War, more than 3,000 Boy Scouts in this city have participated in battlefield service, and their achievements have been known to the people of Shanghai. After the fall of Shanghai, more than 300 male and female members were distributed in the battlefield to continue serving, such as the crossing outside Nanjing, the breakout from Xuzhou, the flood in Kaifeng, the retreat from Mahui Ridge, the destruction of Wuhan, the fall of Guangzhou, and the great fire in Xiangyuan, all of which had Boy Scouts from this city participating in service. In the rear, personnel were also sent to Gansu and Shaanxi to serve in rural areas. Last year's December 25th Grand Parade in Chongqing and the protective work during the air raid in Guilin were all commended by the government.

A Glimpse of Recent Work

In the past, the members were scattered in various battlefields, relying entirely on communication to connect. Now, in order to achieve closer contact, a delegation from the Shanghai Boy Scout Council has been established as the command mechanism, and a resident office has been organized at No. 3 Zaliang Street, Chongqing, to facilitate closer access to the Ministry of Education and the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts. The First Regiment under its jurisdiction is in Chongqing and Guilin, and the First Branch Regiment recently moved from Changsha to Qiyang and will go to Guiyang. There are also several directly subordinate teams, one in the Ningguo and Yicheng areas of Anhui, engaged in political training work, one in northern Guangdong engaged in medical rescue work, one in Jiangxi engaged in propaganda work, and one in Ji'an engaged in rear work.

Organizing Mobile Regimental Headquarters

In order to facilitate the inspection and command of the members' service in various places, the regiment specially sent Deputy Regiment Commander Ni, Department Chief Zheng, and Chief Executive Chen from Chongqing to inspect various places. They are currently actively preparing and will depart within days, and will also organize a mobile regimental headquarters. The first phase of the planned route will pass through the provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. In addition, with the special permission of the Ministry of Education, members entering Sichuan can enroll in school free of charge, and all food and lodging will also be subsidized by the Ministry of Education.

### General Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (13)

Secondly, regarding the area of strict criticism, their position is to avoid the majority of young people being deprived of education. They hope that universities can accommodate as many as possible, aiming to cultivate versatile talents to serve the country. Their intention is nothing more than planning for the future of the nation. In this period of simultaneously advancing the War of Resistance and national construction, it would be a misfortune for society to have too many young people out of school. There will be even more need for talent in post-war construction, and it is necessary to plan for this in advance. However, from another perspective, universities are for talent education, and not everyone can or should enter. The purpose of universities is to cultivate specialists, not to provide relief to those deprived of education. If all middle school graduates must be accommodated by universities, then universities would not need entrance examinations at all, and the unified entrance examination would lose its meaning. I have already stated earlier that it is not currently feasible for all middle school graduates to enter universities. In fact, universities cannot accommodate them all, nor is there a need to do so. As a result of last year's unified examination, the Ministry of Education established preparatory classes and various specialized courses to accommodate those who did not pass. The purpose was to both provide relief to young people deprived of education and to cultivate practical technical talents to meet urgent needs. This year, students with weaker results will be admitted to preparatory classes, giving them the opportunity to improve and retake the exam next year. Furthermore, the number of preparatory classes has been expanded from over ten to over twenty. The government's painstaking efforts can be seen here. We can say that the establishment of preparatory classes in the unified examination is to provide relief to those deprived of education while providing them with sufficient training in basic subjects. The admission of university freshmen still maintains the standards of university level. If we compare the number of admissions with the capacity of each school, we can see that this year's admissions are still more than two thousand short of the number required by each school. In terms of departments, except for various departments of engineering colleges and departments such as political science and economics, almost all departments have not admitted the full quota. If we were to lower the standards, it would not be a problem to admit more than two thousand more people this year. It can be seen that the unified examination still maintains its high standard for university level, and for candidates below the standard, preparatory classes are set up to provide relief. As for the three-quarters of students who were not admitted, what methods are there to remedy this? Among the students taking the exam this year, nearly five thousand have equivalent academic qualifications. These students have not yet graduated from middle school and can still return to middle school to study. Some can apply to military schools and other technical schools to meet the urgent needs of the War of Resistance. Some can apply to vocational schools and various specialized courses. If they are determined to enter university for further studies, they can still apply to provincial and private colleges and universities. The number of students these schools are approved by the Ministry of Education to enroll is about five thousand. Students also have plenty of opportunities to retake the exam. Therefore, students who were not admitted to this year's unified examination will not necessarily be deprived of education.

(2) Disparity in the Number of Arts and Sciences: The disparity between the number of students admitted in arts and science subjects in the unified examination is also a common criticism. The ratio of students admitted in arts and science subjects in the past two years is listed below:

(A) In 1938, there were 2,942 students in science-related subjects (including agriculture, engineering, and medicine), accounting for 53.9% of the total. There were 1,427 students in arts-related subjects (including literature, law, and commerce), accounting for 26.2%. There were 1,091 students in teacher training, accounting for 19.9%. The total was 5,460 students. (B) In 1939 (excluding Shanghai), there were 2,706 students in science-related subjects, accounting for 59.4%. There were 1,182 students in arts-related subjects, accounting for 26.1%. There were 665 students in teacher training, accounting for 14.5%. The total was 8,503 students.

According to the above statistics, the number of students in science-related subjects is higher, especially in engineering (1,752 students). However, in terms of actual needs, it is not considered many. Therefore, this year, various universities with engineering departments have had to increase the number of classes and expand the enrollment due to too many quotas and the inability of the original classes to accommodate them. The Ministry of Education has added more than ten engineering classes this year as a result of the enrollment. This is to adapt to actual needs.

### Chairman Chiang Allocates 100,000 Yuan as Loan for Students from War Zones

(Kunming, 24th dispatch) Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned that poor students from war zones in various colleges and universities here are struggling to maintain their lives due to insufficient loans. Chen, a department head, has come to Yunnan and specially allocated 100,000 yuan in national currency for relief. Mr. Chen is currently consulting with the authorities of various colleges and universities to discuss the distribution method, so that students from war zones can study with peace of mind.

### Nantong Middle School Registers Students

The Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Middle School previously appointed Xia Shichang as acting principal with the approval of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, as reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that Mr. Xia has taken office a few days ago and is reorganizing the school. He has also convened a meeting of the school's teachers and staff, including Zhang Yunjin, Meng Xinping, Zhang Shunyu, Feng Yuhou, Chen Yongfeng, Qian Yuanru, Shi Zejing, Song Zijing, Cao Yu, Yan Disheng, etc., to discuss and work hard to rectify the school. The school's students have been flocking to the school's registration office at 53 Sima Road, 3rd floor, to register and prepare for classes.

### International Cup Football Preliminary Round: China Defeats Russia Yesterday; Poor Ball Luck in the First Half, Trailing 0-1; Finally Changes Formation and Scores Two Goals in a Row to Win

The International Cup football tournament, in which eight countries are competing, has entered its second week, including England, Portugal, and Scotland. Yesterday morning, under a hazy sky and biting wind, China and Russia met at the Recreation Ground. The Chinese team, with its strong lineup, expected to easily win against the Russian team, whose football skills were mediocre. However, after the start of the match, the enemy's atmosphere was unexpectedly arrogant. The Chinese team's ball luck was extremely poor, and every time they reached a good position, they ultimately fell short. In the end, they unexpectedly conceded a goal first. Although they fought hard to counterattack, they still found it difficult, causing the four thousand spectators to sigh in disappointment. It was not until the last fifteen minutes that the Chinese team showed improvement after changing its formation. Within ten minutes, they scored two goals in a row, and the final victory ultimately belonged to China. They joined England, Portugal, and Scotland in the second round. The initial lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:

China

Qin Bigao

Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren

Wu Qixiang, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang

Russia

Naisidanwen, Nuogeluofu

Nikolaiev, Kailuo Liequ

Bosaweiqu, Kairu, Laobusi Tuofu

Ha Fuyu Fu, Baoluoning

Guan Lu Fuofu, Kaipusiding

First Goal Conceded

Russia kicked off and attacked first. The five forwards advanced, and the Chinese army was caught off guard, forcing a corner kick. Nuogeluofu kicked it, and Qin Bigao calmly patted it away, leaving the dangerous situation. The Chinese army counterattacked, and the military situation was extremely strong, but there were many good opportunities. Xu Wenkui, received a long pass from Wu Qixiang, and the audience cheered, thinking that it would be a success, but unexpectedly Xu Wenkui kicked the ball high. The Chinese team's poor ball luck reached its peak. Therefore, the Russian general took advantage of this depressed moment and divided his troops to make a surprise attack. Meng Yiliang accidentally lost his footing and was invaded by the yellow hair. Fortunately, with the help of Bigao, the danger was turned into safety. One wave had just calmed down, and another wave rose again. Naisidanwen took advantage of the corner kick that Qin Bigao patted out and made a unexpected surprise attack, but he was too hasty and shot the yellow hair's heel. Naisidanwen's feet were sharp, and he once opened a free kick in the middle of the field, straight to the door of the Chinese team. Bigao received it, but slipped into a corner kick. The Russian army continued to watch and finally, at six minutes, Kepu hit the upper right corner and fell into a city. Although the Chinese team tried hard to counterattack, it was not helpful. Russia took the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half.

Defeat into Victory

After lemon, the three armies rose up and made a desperate move. However, the ball luck was very bad, and everything was on the left. Akui's feet did not recover, and the shot was either biased or skewed. Nikolaev fouled, and Yichen's very confident 20-yard free kick also skimmed the crossbar and escaped. The two guards of the Russian side were indeed amazing. For more than ten minutes, the five Chinese forwards could not get the ball. It was not until more than twenty minutes later that Sun's captain ordered to change the formation, with Wu Qixiang transferred to the right wing, Akui in charge of the center forward, and Huang Kehou retired to the left midfielder. The situation suddenly took a turn for the better, controlling the overall situation. Although Xu Wenkui missed three shots and Li Yichen missed the wood twice, making the audience regretful, Qin Bigao brought out Baoluoning's dangerous shot, making the momentum even stronger. At thirty minutes, Yichen shot from a distance, and Youliang kicked it high. Wu Qixiang topped it near the door and broke into the door instantly. The Chinese team's voice was strong. The Russian army became angry and their actions became wild. Li Yichen was kicked in the left eye by Kaipusiding, his face was covered with blood, and he retired. Sun Jinshun retreated to the defense, and there were only four forwards left. However, the offensive was not diminished. After nine minutes, Wu Qixiang went deep into the light ride, and the left passed to the center. Akui deliberately used smoke screens, not shooting but picking up, Bosaweiqu was induced out, and Qiuting took advantage of the situation at the door and lightly tapped the right ankle, and the ball entered the net safely. The Chinese team defeated the Russian team in less than ten minutes under absolute depression. In the last six minutes, the Chinese team encountered two dangerous situations, but there was no theft. As a result, the Chinese team defeated Russia 2-1.

### Today is National Renaissance Festival: Shanghai Celebrates Enthusiastically; All Agencies Have Holidays and No Ceremonies; Education and Cultural Groups Send Telegrams to Chiang to Pay Respect

Today is the National Renaissance Festival, and also the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day, and the Zhaohe Uprising Memorial Day, which have also been merged and held as stipulated by the central government. All sectors will enthusiastically celebrate this glorious and great memorial day. All agencies, public groups, schools, etc., have holidays as usual, but there will be no hanging of flags or elaborate celebration ceremonies. Three years ago, in the Xi'an Incident, the leader showed the spirit of "not being careless in the face of adversity" and "not yielding," which is what every citizen should emulate. All sectors are aware that to complete the great cause of resistance and construction and revive the nation, all 400 million people have a responsibility, and they are determined to fulfill their responsibilities under the overall national policy, and to vigorously promote the movement of frugality, saving for national use, and helping refugees.

In addition, all sectors, in order to save waste and get rid of old habits, previously planned to print and sell Renaissance Festival commemorative bookmarks during the Renaissance Festival to replace New Year cards.

A Letter to Compatriots on the Movement of Integrity and Shame

The City's Committee for the Movement of Integrity and Shame is issuing a document to honor our compatriots for the National Renaissance Festival, the Yunnan Uprising Memorial, and the birth of Jesus. The document states: Today is the National Renaissance Festival, the Yunnan Uprising Memorial, and also two important milestones in the history of the Chinese Revolution, because the establishment of the Republic of China is the crystallization of the sacrifices of Sun Yat-sen and the majority of revolutionary martyrs, and it is also the cornerstone of the world's great harmony by implementing the Three Principles of the People. Unfortunately, at that time, due to a few politicians who sought to苟安妥協, and Yuan Shikai's obsession with becoming emperor, the revolutionary cause was interrupted invisibly, and the revolutionary cornerstone was almost destroyed. Fortunately, Cai Songpo, Li Liejun, Tang Jiyao, etc., organized the National Protection Army and launched an uprising in Yunnan, and various provinces responded one after another. The cornerstone was re-laid, otherwise the Republic of China would be even more unimaginable.

The Xi'an Incident was formally a display of power and coercion, which did not conform to the great righteousness, but in spirit, it was indeed an inevitable reaction to the overwhelming and intimidating invasion. The President was able to turn danger into safety and return to the capital because of his great national personality and determination to believe in doctrine, and with the support of the people of the whole country. At the same time, this historical transformation has entered a new stage, uniting the entire nation and launching a sacred war of resistance, working hard to strive for China's territorial

Sovereign integrity and independence and freedom, especially on this day, which is the birth of Jesus, Jesus reformed Judaism, because at that time the Jewish people were under the rule of foreign races and were deeply oppressed and exploited by bureaucratic landlords and gentry, using the teachings of religion to develop a great force, unite people's hearts, but in the end, they were not tolerated by the Jews and Roman officials, so they were nailed to the cross, and died for the sins of others, none of the above three facts is not to promote

Human righteousness, a great personality, unyielding, and transforming people's hearts, especially when the integrity and shame are lost, and we encounter this day with three meanings, we feel even more profound meaning. However, what is the lesson we have learned on this day? I think first, in today's day when the victory of the War of Resistance is getting closer and closer, as long as everyone takes on the responsibility of the three major meanings of the Yunnan Uprising, the President's hardship, and Jesus' salvation, and add to it the hard work,

The spirit of advocating integrity and shame, no one will fall for the tricks of others. Second, the Three Principles of the People are the most suitable revolutionary highest principle for the Chinese national character, and it is also the inevitable destination of historical evolution. As long as everyone loves themselves, no violence can stop or destroy it. China's War of Resistance, of course, was decided after the Xi'an Incident, but it also数千年一贯精神 of the four virtues and eight virtues. At the last moment, even without the Xi'an Incident, we had to uphold justice and unite,

Country for self-help, there is of course no shortage of pain and sacrifice in the War of Resistance, but these are temporary phenomena, temporary endurance, and the determination to hold on to 寗爲玉碎, 小爲瓦全 is the price of permanent happiness and glory in the future. Third, Jesus, in view of the suffering Jewish people, without a country, without a leader, did not委曲求全, greedy for life and afraid of death, regardless of everything, rose up to lead, just like the Yunnan Uprising, which made the giants cold, smashed the imperial system, and like the Xi'an Incident, preserved the national righteousness and promoted

The unyielding spirit, in order to create a situation of turmoil and uneasiness in the enemy's country, is the same meaning. We have come to these three meaningful holidays, how can we be silent and not tell our compatriots? All my compatriots, regardless of class or status, must stand firm in their positions, not be lured by profit, not be threatened, to promote the four virtues and eight virtues, benefit Wujiang, the future of Kangjian, is really deeply relied on.

### Zhongnong Corner Tickets Arrive in Shanghai; HSBC Bank Issues and Exchanges; Three Batches of New Tickets of the 26th Edition Are Issued in Separate Volumes

The lack of panic in the Shanghai market for sub-coin notes, subsidiary coin notes, and one-yuan notes has gradually subsided after the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the General Office of the Four Joint Banks of China and China to instruct the banks to find ways to remedy it.

Please attend on time to discuss."

Loyal Advice to Colleagues

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association also issued a notice to all members yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: "Respectfully, the current rice price is soaring, breaking all previous records, and the livelihoods of the poor people are greatly threatened. The authorities have strictly set a limit price in order to maintain security, and are not allowed to exceed it. People's hearts can be slightly settled. However, in recent days, due to the scarcity of domestic rice, the market situation has become tense again. We are sincerely afraid that colleagues will need high-quality goods and endure dark plates and buy in excess of the price. It must be known that such behavior will cause hidden pain to themselves, and will also violate the authorities' ban. If discovered, they will be severely punished. For this reason, we earnestly inform our member colleagues that they should absolutely abide by the limit price for import and export sales and purchases, and should not exceed it in the slightest. If there is any violation, we will present it to the authorities for strict investigation and will never be lenient. Please abide by it."

### National Trade Surplus, Foreign Exchange Eases, Legal Tender Value Rises, Equalization Fund Replenished

After adjustments to China's foreign trade, exports of domestic goods have surged, especially to the United States, with 23,166,600 yuan in September, 28,009,000 yuan in October, and 43,852,000 yuan in November. This has become the largest share of domestic goods exports in trade with all countries. Imports of foreign goods have sharply decreased since October due to the government's ban on luxury and non-essential goods, amounting to 99,670,000 yuan in October and 84,009,000 yuan in November. Beginning in November, the overall foreign trade has shifted from a deficit to a surplus, with a surplus of 49,492,000 yuan. Consequently, China's foreign exchange reserves have become increasingly abundant, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai has eased, the value of the legal tender has implicitly increased, and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's fund has been further strengthened. This situation is rare since the start of the war of resistance, and it greatly benefits the domestic goods industry.

### Yesterday's Paradise, Today's Hell: The Tragic Life of the People of Hangzhou; The Poor Rise Early and Sleep Late, Struggling to Get Enough to Eat; Many Children Die Due to Lack of Food and Clothing

The North-China Daily News reports that, according to Bishop Curtis, many people in Hangzhou are currently impoverished and unable to support themselves. Therefore, he is appealing for donations during the Christmas holidays and the weeks that follow to alleviate the disaster in the area. Donations can be given to the Baptist Church (Mr. Nasmyth), the China Inland Mission (Mr. Edwards), and the Presbyterian Church (Pastor Van Evera or Pastor Huss). According to reports from church workers in the area, the weather is severe, and many poor people are dying.

Those who lack clothing, food, and shelter, or those who do not have enough, are unable to cope. Poor families rise early and sleep late, and even if they find work, they struggle to get enough to eat. Prices have risen sharply recently, making even one meal a luxury. Furthermore, women and children eat less to leave more coarse food for the men. Half of the children inside and outside the city lack sufficient food and clothing.

Starvation and cold easily lead to death. The church has done its best to distribute rice and warm clothing for relief. One meal is distributed every day at noon, with about 200 children eating, and a varying number of adults. Leftover food from the hospital is also distributed to the poor. Each day, several poor people line up with bowls or jars to receive food, including a boy who is only four years old, accompanied by another boy to collect it.

There are also sick and elderly people who are completely destitute. Moreover, some poor families often accidentally start fires at night, fleeing in panic, exposed to the cold or burned. The sight is heartbreaking. To understand the suffering of the people of Hangzhou, one only needs to look at the approximately 200 men, women, and children who attend the gospel lectures twice a week, including exhausted rickshaw pullers, blind people (the number of blind people has increased greatly recently), and disabled people (some of whom are men forced to do hard labor and mistreated), as well as elderly women in their seventies who can only move with the help of a stool, their heads bandaged because they were injured when they did not quickly understand the sentry's instructions when entering the city. Many other women have suffered terrible wounds on their arms and legs for the same reason.

### A Tour of the Literary and Art Exhibition

— Ji Ya

Yesterday was the first day of the literary and art exhibition organized to raise production funds for the Shanghai Refugee Cooperative. I felt that China will fight to the end and will not stop until it wins the final victory. The invaders are in a dilemma, unable to dismount their tiger. Therefore, these refugees whose fields have been destroyed by ruthless artillery fire must be permanently maintained. Relying solely on donations for endless consumption, although there are many charitable people, ultimately does not seem like a good solution. Furthermore, the refugees, with nothing to do all day, may become accustomed to idleness over time, developing lazy habits. Therefore, the gentlemen of the Refugee Cooperative want to provide the refugees with productive work so that they will not have to rely solely on others for support in the future. This is a very meaningful thing, so I took some time to visit the exhibition.

At 9:45 AM, I arrived at the venue and immediately bought a ticket to enter. I didn't see the opening ribbon-cutting ceremony at all, but that wasn't my purpose. I wasn't there to see movie stars, so I didn't care if they weren't there. However, many spectators were crowding the entrance, seemingly to see these actresses. I don't know if they were able to feast their eyes. I only heard one student say, "They just have two eyes and a nose. What's so special?" This is a practical statement. Many calligraphy and paintings were hung on both sides of the entrance, mostly by Shen Shengyong, followed by the elder Shen Enfu. At the end of the entrance, I turned into a small room, which displayed stamps and cigarette cards. I enjoyed looking at them carefully and learned about the history of Chinese stamps. The earliest stamps were probably from the fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The paper quality was poor, the prints were rough, and the colors were purple, green, and yellow. They featured a coiled dragon in the center, with the price in the upper corners. The Empress Dowager Cixi's 60th birthday stamps featured a seal character for longevity in the center. The paper quality and colors were the same as before, but the shape was slightly larger. It was not until the 24th year of the Guangxu reign that they were printed in England, and the quality of the materials was also improved. There were also Soviet stamps, sent by the Political Department of the 1st Division of the 5th Army of the 3rd Army Corps of the Chinese Red Army to Liu Jicai in Pingjiang, Hunan. These are rare to see. The other stamps from various countries were all available, truly dazzling. The cigarette cards included ancient beauties, flowers, plants, birds, animals, thirty-six trades with proverbs, and scientific knowledge, in various forms. It can be said to be a grand collection of cigarette cards. Entering the hall again, in addition to calligraphy and paintings, there were photos of movie stars, diagrams of language evolution, and dynamic photos of Miao and Yao people. Browsing through them one by one, I truly broadened my knowledge.

Among the calligraphy and paintings, I loved Chen Tianxiao's "Su Shi Exploring Plum Blossoms," "Amitabha," "Willow Horse," and "Double Perch Double Habitat" the most. They used few strokes, but the expressions were lifelike, majestic, and contained endless meaning. They cannot be learned without artistic talent. Through the introduction of Mr. Huang Jingwan, I had the opportunity to meet him. After talking for a moment, I could say that the four words "refined and intelligent" could be used to describe Mr. Chen Daxiao without any shame.

The ancient paintings included "Cui Bai Flowers and Birds," "Li Tang Landscapes," "Jiayou Imperial Brush," and "Wang Zhongyuan Flowers and Birds," all meticulously painted and lifelike, and the prices were not high. If one could obtain one and hang it to the right of one's seat, one could appreciate it at leisure, which would give one a sense of elegance, especially as a souvenir to aid refugees during the war of resistance!

### Various Institutions Take Holidays, Celebrating Christmas Together

Today is Christmas Day, and foreign merchants in Shanghai are celebrating it enthusiastically as usual. However, with the fires of war raging across Europe, the celebrations are slightly less grand compared to previous years. The British Church on Jiujiang Road in this city is scheduled to hold a celebration ceremony this afternoon. The church hopes that expatriates will bring their children to participate. Yesterday was Christmas Eve, and the church held a midnight celebration at 11:45 PM, rejoicing until this morning. The church on Jing'an Temple Road is scheduled to hold ceremonies separately from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM this morning. Various churches and foreign hospitals will present Christmas gifts to patients. Foreign banks, trading companies, the British Consulate, the US Consulate General, the French Consulate General, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the French Municipal Council are all taking a holiday as usual to commemorate the day. Chinese banks and money shops will also close for the day. However, the Shanghai Post Office and its branches will remain open as usual. The curfew will be in effect as usual tonight. As for third-country nationals passing through the Waibaidu Bridge, according to the Japanese Navy spokesperson, they will not be restricted during the New Year period. The same applies to those who wish to pass through the Hongqiao district.

### French Books Shipped to Shanghai

The French-language Shanghai Journal reported on the 21st that the French bookstore Qing Si in this port had previously shipped 14 boxes of French illustrated magazines due to the European war. They are scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai by a special French mail steamship within days.

### Chinese Tannery Robbed by Armed Bandits, People Injured; More Than 30 Accomplices, Each Holding Weapons; Stealing Tanning Glue and Injuring Three People

The Chinese Tannery on Tian Du Li, Xingan Temple Road, Shanghai, is a large-scale operation producing high-quality products. Recently, it received 29 packages of tanning glue (used for tanning leather), each package worth 80 yuan. Suddenly, nearby hooligans discovered this and gathered more than 30 accomplices, some carrying long guns, box cannons, and handguns. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, they broke open the main gate and stormed inside. Several workers in the factory resisted, but they were outnumbered and the bandits were armed. After a fierce fight, one worker, Weng Yingyue, 40 years old, from Ningbo, was shot in the right knee, the bullet piercing through, and he was bleeding profusely. Zhu Fulai, 39 years old, from Luodian, was hit in the head with a gun butt. Zhu Xiuming, 28 years old, from Luodian, was shot in the left shoulder, a serious injury. The 29 packages of tanning glue in the workshop were all looted, and the bandits fled, yelling. After the incident, the factory supervisor called an ambulance, which arrived and transported the three injured workers to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Japanese and French Police Arrest Traveler; Arrested Person is Ding Daxiong

At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese sent personnel to the French Concession to cooperate with the French police, rushing to Room 5 of the Yuebin Hotel at 165 Mintini Road, where they arrested a local traveler named Ding Daxiong (28 years old). It is reported that Ding now runs an ironware store on Xinza Road. The reason for his arrest is unknown.

### Theft of US Dollars Leads to Conviction

Wang Changgui and Xu Damin, both from Jiangdu, who jointly ran a brothel at 7, Lane 25, Guangxi Road, took advantage of the fact that a prostitute, Wang Xiaomei, was accompanying an American client, Noble Row, to sleep on the night of the 10th of this month. They colluded and entered his bedroom, stealing 150 US dollars from Noble Row's wallet and dividing it for their own use. After Noble Row discovered the theft, he reported it to the police. Wang Changgui and others were detained and sent to the court. After questioning, they were convicted of theft. The previous morning, the case was brought to trial, and Wang Changgui and Xu Tianmin were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint theft. Wang Xiaomei was convicted of receiving stolen goods and sentenced to 30 days of detention.

### French Municipal Council Departments Take Holidays Today and Tomorrow

Today is Christmas Day. Chinese and Western Christians will gather at the Great Church outside the New North Gate at dawn to attend Mass with the priests and sing blessings for the Holy Spirit's descent. The ceremony will last until noon. The French police have dispatched Chinese, French, Russian, and Vietnamese detectives to direct traffic in front of the church to prevent congestion. In addition, all departments of the French Municipal Council will be closed for two days as usual to mark the celebration. Due to the French police department taking a two-day holiday, the Second Special Court will suspend the processing of criminal cases. Therefore, criminal public prosecution cases will be suspended for two days, but civil cases and criminal private prosecution cases will continue to be heard as usual.

### Public Toilet Dispute in the International Settlement; Both Sides Tend to Extremes

The 1940 contract for public toilets in the International Settlement was won by the Dongfang Cleaning Company at a high price. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that as the contract period is about to expire, the company sent personnel to negotiate with various small subcontractors yesterday. The small subcontractors are unable to accept the contract because the bid price is too high and the Shanghai Municipal Council has regulations posted in each toilet stating that entry is free of charge and the sale of toilet paper is not allowed. However, the company has indicated that if the small subcontractors do not accept its fixed rental price, it will hire its own workers to sell toilet paper. It is said that it has already ordered worker uniforms and other items to forcibly take over. Both sides are tending to extremes, which may lead to further escalation.

### Rickshaw Rent Increase Case; Shanghai Municipal Council to Reply Next Month; Contractors Also Request Rent Increase

Rickshaw merchants in the Special District have repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to reconsider and increase rickshaw rents due to rising prices after the war and the soaring prices of rubber and metal after the outbreak of the European war. The Shanghai Municipal Council organized a special committee to conduct an investigation. The investigation is now complete and will be formally decided by a meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Council has now replied to the guild that it must respond to the rent increase issue by the end of January 1940.

Conference of Representatives of Rickshaw Pullers in Five Districts

Yesterday at 10:00 AM, rickshaw pullers in the Special District held a conference of representatives from five districts. The results of the discussion were: (1) The weather is cold, but the hat-snatching trend is still rampant, causing a significant decline in business. Please order the police authorities to strictly crack down. (2) Organize the "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Relief Association," and elect Liu Zhuqing and eight others as preparation committee members. (3) Organize a legal team to fight for the takeover of the Mutual Aid Association by the rickshaw pullers. (4) Request rickshaw merchants to increase rickshaw rents, but not excessively.

Contractors Request Rent Increase

Rickshaw contractors in the Special District act as agents for rickshaw merchants, handling rickshaw rentals on a monthly and daily basis. For monthly rentals, the contractors are responsible for all repairs and painting. Recently, the prices of paint and metal have soared, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, they are requesting rickshaw merchants to negotiate an increase in rents as soon as possible to alleviate the contractors' burden.

### Male Worker Accused of Seduction; Acquitted After Trial

Li Changfu, a young man from Huaicheng, 23 years old, residing at 14, Meiquan Li, Jiale Road, works at the Liangxinji toothbrush factory on Xujiahui Road, Panxing Road. Recently, he was sued in the criminal court of the Second Special Court for disrupting family affairs by Lin Li, the mother (37 years old, residing at 47 Mofang Street) of Lin Xiulan (17 years old), a female worker in the toothbrush department of the same factory. According to the complaint, on the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, Xiulan was seduced by Li to see a movie at the Ameng Grand Theater at Taiping Bridge, and then taken to Room 15 of the Yongxing Hotel on Wangzhi Road, where she was forcibly raped and released only at night. After learning of the situation, the police were reported to and requested to investigate. However, because an examination showed that the victim's hymen was not broken, the case was not pursued. Therefore, the plaintiff further accused the defendant of being unreasonable and filed a lawsuit according to law, and also filed a civil suit requesting the court to order the defendant to pay compensation of 1,000 yuan. Based on the complaint, Judge Miao Qingbang of the court held a hearing the day before. The plaintiff mother and daughter presented their case, and the defendant, accompanied by defense lawyer Qian Xingzhong, appeared in court and denied seduction and rape. According to the defendant, on the 22nd, he went to see a movie with a male worker from the same factory surnamed Bao and two female guests. At the theater, they met Lin Xiulan, who offered him cigarettes and melon seeds, but he did not accept them. After the movie, she asked them to go to her house to play, but because there were four of them, men and women, they refused to go. The next evening, when they were leaving work, Xiulan publicly pulled him to open a room, but he refused. The conflict arose because she wanted to marry him, but he refused because he was already engaged in his hometown, which led to the false accusation. He asked the court to investigate. The court also summoned witnesses surnamed Bao and Huo Xiangting for questioning. As the case was clear, the court ordered the defense to be made, and then immediately acquitted the defendant in court and rejected the civil suit.

### Refugee Cooperative Literary and Art Exhibition; Visitors Flock; Exhibition Extended to the 26th

After the Shanghai Refugee Cooperative held a literary and art exhibition the day before yesterday (the 23rd) to raise production funds, people from all walks of life flocked to visit the exhibition in unusually large numbers. The cooperative originally planned to hold the exhibition for three days, ending today, but because many of the exhibits submitted by various sectors were not yet displayed, it was decided to extend the exhibition by one day, ending tomorrow (the 26th). Yesterday was Sunday, a holiday for various schools and institutions, so the number of visitors was even more crowded than the day before, estimated at more than 6,000 people. In terms of groups, there were several groups, including the Fine Arts College and the Peichu Elementary School. The new exhibits added yesterday included dozens of photos of armed Miao people, open-air gatherings, and other photos in the language and culture section, all of which were rare and valuable treasures.

### Fruit Vendor Brothers, One Killed and One Injured by Thugs; Police Arrive and Arrest Two Criminals

Near Xinza Road and Chengdu Road in the International Settlement, at around 8:30 PM last night, two fruit vendors, Shi Zhengxiang, 26 years old, from Chongming, and his cousin Shi Qinfu, 25 years old, were carrying oranges on a shoulder pole, selling them along the street. Several customers came to select oranges and started bargaining, which suddenly led to an argument, and then to violence. Unexpectedly, several customers used a bamboo shoulder pole to strike Shi Qinfu, who was hit in the head, causing a hole to be punched through and blood to flow straight out. At that time, Shi Zhengxiang, who was standing next to him, saw his cousin being injured and falling to the ground, and tried his best to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, several customers' remaining anger did not subside, and they surrounded Zhengxiang and beat him severely, using both fists and feet, injuring his abdomen and vital organs, killing him instantly. Afterwards, the police at Xinza Police Station No. 50, together with street police No. 958 and No. 1776, arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested two perpetrators at the scene, detaining them at the police station for investigation. Shi Qinfu, who was injured, and the corpse were sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance.

### Arrest of Japanese National for Fraud: Eiji Kageyama Escorted Back to Japan

According to news from the agency, a Japanese man named Eiji Kageyama, 53 years old, came to Shanghai last year and then went to the interior. He returned to Shanghai again in January of this year, residing at No. 310 Huangpu Road, Hongkou. He usually behaved extravagantly, dressed luxuriously, and had the air of a gentleman. He often claimed to be a university professor, having served as a section chief in the Accounting Inspection Institute and as a consultant for the Toyo Tobacco Company, etc. He boasted to the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai that he had considerable connections with various Japanese military and political circles. In reality, Kageyama was a vagrant with no permanent occupation. Recently, he even impersonated a member of the Japanese military police and solicited various Japanese businesses in Shanghai to commit fraud. Unaware of his deception, more than a dozen Japanese businessmen were deceived, with the amount swindled reaching 12,000 yuan. After obtaining the large sum through fraud, Kageyama went to Nanjing and spent his days squandering money like dirt on the Qinhuai River, indulging in a life of pleasure and extravagance, which aroused the suspicion of the Japanese military police. After a detailed investigation, he was arrested, and recently escorted to this port. The Japanese Consulate then escorted him back to Japan.

### Foreign Steamer Crew Members Penalized for Smuggling: 6,000 Yuan Fine for Smuggling Hides; Sending the Smuggling of Tung Oil to Court for Punishment

An employee of the mou-fu steamboat of the Laihe Shipping Company previously smuggled hides from Ningbo for export to Shanghai. After being discovered by the Ningbo Inspection Office and reported to the provincial government for handling, a reply telegram has now been received from the provincial government. In addition to fining the employee 6,000 yuan, he is suspected of violating Article 6 of the Regulations on Prohibiting Aiding the Enemy and has been transferred to the court for interrogation. Furthermore, during an inspection by customs officials on the Manlixun steamboat of Anli Shipping Company between the time it left Wen and started to set sail, 21 cans of tung oil were found in the cargo hold and were immediately detained. Upon investigation, tung oil is a prohibited item for aiding the enemy and is also a commodity under government unified sales. The customs office has already sent a letter to the local government for punishment according to regulations. Subsequently, Jin Dazhong, the agent of Anli Company, stated that the smuggled tung oil was the doing of a sailor named Jiang Azeng, who was immediately arrested and sent for punishment.

### Shanghai Charity Groups Discuss Unifying Disaster Relief Efforts in North China

This year, the provinces of North China have suffered severe flooding. Various charity groups in this city have successively carried out relief work, such as the China International Famine Relief Commission, the China International Relief Society, the Yanping Guild Hall, the Chinese Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the China Jisheng Society, etc. It is now learned that these charity groups are planning to further promote relief work in North China and are discussing the formation of a Unified North China Disaster Relief Committee to unify the relief work in North China in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It is reported that they have held several meetings. According to the provisions of the plan, the duties of the Unified Committee are: (1) to raise and allocate relief funds; (2) to entrust North China organizations to carry out relief work; (3) to supervise the use of funds. Representatives from various organizations in this city that handle North China relief, or individuals who agree with the purpose of the committee and are approved, may participate in the committee as members.

### The Weather in This Port is Turning Cold: Beggars Sleeping on the Streets are Freezing to Death Again

Yesterday was the day after the winter solstice in the old lunar calendar, and the weather is also turning cold with the seasons. The north wind is blowing tightly, and the sky is gloomy. Pedestrians on the main roads are shrinking in the cold. Beggars sleeping on the streets were found frozen to death again yesterday morning, a tragic scene.

### Letter to the Editor

To the editor,

According to the person concerned, Yu Xiaoyue, on the 24th of this month, the Shanghai News column of the Shen Bao published a news item about a factory owner suing an apprentice for breach of contract. It stated that in the 25th year, Mr. Song introduced Yu Xiaoyue to the plaintiff to learn the skill of making soy sauce. This is inconsistent with the facts. It was found that Xiaoyue entered the factory to help Chen Genzha with his finances, and he had chemical experience. Therefore, he was a supervisor of finance and an assistant in manufacturing, not a student. The plaintiff, Chen Genxiang, falsely claiming that he was a student, is related to Xiaoyue's reputation. I am particularly requesting that you ask the newspaper to declare a correction so as to clarify the truth.

Sincerely,

Attorney Pan Zhensheng, December 24.

Economic Special Issue No. 300

### A Review of China's Economy Over the Past Year

— Yu Bianlin

During this past year, China's economy has undergone major changes, such as the fall of foreign exchange rates, the slump in foreign debt market prices, the sharp increase in international trade, the increase in currency circulation, and the rise in prices. The outbreak of the European War has changed everything and has already entered a difficult environment. Now, the economic situation and statistical figures of the past year will be analyzed in detail as follows.

Foreign Exchange Rates Over the Past Year

After the implementation of exchange controls in March of the 27th year, a black market for foreign exchange was created in Shanghai. In September of the same year, the black market exchange rate fell to a low of eight pence. The government authorities worked hard to maintain the exchange rate, which was stabilized. In March of this year, the Sino-British cooperation on the foreign exchange equalization fund was established, and the black market exchange rate became more solid. However, maintaining the black market exchange rate and using huge amounts of funds for the Japanese and puppet regimes to absorb and for luxury consumption in Shanghai does not seem to be a good idea. On June 7, the implementation of the cessation of foreign exchange supply was carried out. As a result, the downward trend suddenly rose, from eight pence to below six and a half pence. However, this downward trend was not enough to adjust the reverse trend of international trade; and although the absorption of the Japanese and puppet regimes was slightly frustrated, it still failed to stop. Therefore, it was allowed to fall again to five and a half pence. Those who did not understand the truth and were short-sighted became alarmed and panicked; speculators and ordinary traitors took the opportunity to spread rumors and fueled the waves, thus causing a large amount of capital flight, causing the foreign exchange black market to continue to shrink sharply. On July 25, it was 4 pence 5625, on August 1, it dropped to 4 pence 3125, on August 8, it dropped again to 3 pence 875, and on August 11, it fell further to 3 pence 25, creating an unprecedented low price for the legal tender.

After that, the European situation became tense, and the foreign exchange black market was stimulated by this, reversing the past sharp decline and turning into a sharp rise. Former foreign exchange speculators and capital flight people sold off one after another. The supply of foreign exchange in the black market at one time exceeded demand. On September 4, the black market price reached 4 pence 75. There was a brief period of weakness, especially the decline in the US exchange rate was greater than that of British gold. At that time, the pound price in the New York market fell sharply, so the HSBC quoted the lowest price of 5 and a half yuan for the US exchange rate. At the end of September, the exchange rate rebounded again, and the continued upward trend lasted for more than a month. At the end of October, it had grown to a level of 5 and a half pence for British exchange and 8 and a half yuan for US exchange. For a time, it was close to 6 pence and the exchange rate of the US dollar. The reasons for the high rise can be attributed to the following: (1) Due to the outbreak of the European War, imports decreased sharply, and exports were still able to be maintained due to the strong sales in the United States. Therefore, a large number of export bills of exchange appeared in the black market, while the need for import foreign exchange decreased. (2) Since Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia implemented exchange controls, the Hong Kong gangs and others came to Shanghai to sell foreign exchange one after another. (3) Capital flighters returned one after another due to the consolidation of the legal tender's credit, and foreign exchange positions increased sharply. (4) The Japanese absorption weakened, and there were also small amounts of selling, and the need for foreign exchange decreased further. (5) The credit of foreign currencies themselves was shaken, and general speculators went to other places. Therefore, the black market price had one less pressure. Often, when foreign exchange rates were high, news of victories from the front came, and people's hearts became more stable. This upward trend began to stabilize in mid-November and hovered around 5 pence. However, although exports increased, imports also increased. For example, the cotton of textile factories and the food rice, which is the main food of the people, must now be supplied overseas. Therefore, importers are paying a lot. In addition, the movement of international hot money is uncertain, which makes the foreign exchange black market fluctuate from time to time. Speculators also took the opportunity to participate, so it fell slightly again from the end of the month. At the end of the year, the demand for legal tender increased, so the foreign exchange market was rising again. The HSBC quote and black market closing prices are recorded as follows:

(Note) The British exchange rate is the number of pence per national currency yuan. (1) is the foreign exchange rate on December 19.

### Domestic Debt Market Prices Over the Past Year

The domestic debt market prices over the past year have been relatively stable. Although there have been three changes in the meantime, they have all been able to rebound afterwards, and the current prices are similar to those at the beginning of the year. This shows the good financial situation of China.

At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Finance had a plan to move to Chongqing to pay the principal and interest due, which promoted the first change. Afterwards, it was paid in installments in Shanghai, and the situation calmed down. Afterwards, the debts rebounded, and on June 13, a record high since the start of the war was created. On June 19, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed that the unified debts guaranteed by customs duties would also stop being paid due to the seizure of tax revenues. Therefore, the second change occurred. When foreign exchange shrank sharply in July, the unified debts also plummeted, creating the lowest price since the start of the war. This was the third change. After the outbreak of the European War, the debt market was strong, and the unified debts tended to recover.

### Foreign Debt Market Prices Over the Past Year

At the beginning of the year, foreign debt market prices were generally low, but there was a rebound trend afterwards. After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange in June, Chinese foreign debt in the London market plummeted. When foreign exchange shrank sharply in Shanghai in July and August, foreign debt also continued to fall. It began to stabilize after the European War. In mid-November, there was a sharp rise, with an average increase of more than 10 pounds compared to October. On November 15, such as the Anglo-German continued loan reached 57 pounds, the Sino-French public bond reached 52 pounds, and the Anglo-French loan reached 50 pounds, which was much higher than Japanese foreign debt. On the same day, the Japanese 5% British public bond was 49 pounds, and the first 4% British public bond was only 40 and a half pounds. From this, it can be seen that China's national credit is better than Japan's, and China's national fortune is brighter than Japan's. The average price of China's main foreign debt in the London market is recorded below:

(Note) The unit is pounds. (1) is the highest price from November 1 to 18. (2) is the average market price from December 5 to 18.

### Foreign Trade Over the Past Year

Foreign trade this year showed a leaping trend, and exports increased faster than imports. Since March, the total value of imports each month has been more than 100 million yuan. After the outbreak of the European War, imports decreased slightly, but they are now gradually returning to their original state. And it is a good opportunity to promote exports. (Unit: 1,000 yuan)

The deficit figures reached their peak in May and June. After the cessation of foreign exchange supply, it was sharply reduced. It decreased further after the European War, and was only 5 million yuan in October. With the current trend, there may be hope for a surplus in the future. It is worth noting that import trade is still so huge under government control and the fall of foreign exchange rates. The reasons for this are: the increase in consumption in Shanghai, one; using Chinese foreign exchange to purchase raw materials needed by Japanese factories, such as cotton, etc., two; daily necessities such as food rice and coal are monopolized by people, and we have to rely on overseas supply, three; Japanese goods are dumped, four; speculation is strong, and hoarding is rampant, five; the increase in income from non-labor profits leads to indulgence in consumption, and the increase in the import of luxury goods, six. If the above six points are not eliminated, it will be difficult to drastically reduce import trade. The main reasons for the increase in export goods are as follows: the development of transportation in the rear area has made transportation more convenient than before, so the export capacity has increased, this is one. Japanese businessmen scavenge local products in the occupied areas and transport them for sale to Europe and the United States to seize China's export foreign exchange resources; this is also one of the key points; this is two. The fall in foreign exchange makes it easier for goods to be sold overseas, this is three. Shanghai's light industry has returned to its pre-war state, but manufactured goods cannot be sold well in the occupied areas, so it has to seek overseas sales channels, this is four. The increase in overseas demand, such as the sale of raw silk to the United States, the sale of animals and animal products to Europe, and the sale of manufactured goods to Southeast Asia, are all at the highest records in recent years, this is five. Now there is another good opportunity for the European War. As long as the people of the whole country work hard, exports will definitely increase again.

### Commodity Prices Over the Past Year

Commodity prices rose sharply in the middle of the year, and people's lives were greatly threatened. In the past, the items that rose sharply were limited to imported goods and non-essential goods, so the general public did not feel difficult. Nowadays, treacherous merchants are targeting daily necessities, hoarding and stockpiling to wait for a good price, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. Now, let's look at the wholesale price index compiled by the National Tariff Commission, as follows:

Year 28 Year 27

January 162.1 133.6

February 165.5 132.4

March 172.1 133.2

April 173.2 136.7

May 176.1 135.8

June 190.7 138.9

July 195.5 146.4

The above is limited to the commodity price index for the first seven months, and the degree of high rise is already alarming. Moreover, since July, the upward trend has become even stronger. Try to look at the cost of living index in Shanghai, and you can know it. It was 188.56 in July, 234.17 in August, surged to 183.23 in September, and fell slightly to 248.22 in October. The main reason for the high prices today is mostly due to hoarding by treacherous merchants, followed by inconvenient transportation and uneven supply. If this continues, the lives of ordinary people will become even more insecure. Therefore, our government is working hard to adjust commodity prices. (December 20)

### The Past Week

Selling Rice at a Lower Price, Robbery According to reports, a rice store in Caojiadu, seeing that a crowd of people were surging to rob rice, the boss accepted the store clerk's suggestion and implemented a flat sale of 38 yuan per stone, avoiding being robbed. This is really knowing the reason for the rice grabbing trend, and at the same time, it is actually better than the good method of half-opening the door to prevent robbery. Worth introducing All-pervasive In order to achieve their goal of using war to support war, the Japanese puppet regimes have exploited every opportunity for profit in many ways. In the past, they organized the "Fish Market" to control the fish industry, and organized the "Livestock Market" to control the cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. transported to Shanghai, and they have also obstructed the grain transported to Shanghai in many ways, adding levies. Although the high rice price in Shanghai has various complex factors such as hoarding, the exploitation of the Japanese puppet regimes is also one of the main reasons; now, according to reports, the Sihang Warehouse, which is firmly guarded by the isolated army, is now being repaired to prepare for the opening of a "Vegetable Market" to control vegetables and salted goods. In this way, the small people will be under new threats under the pressure of rice, coal, oil, and noodles. It is really not easy to live in Shanghai.

Everyone is Happy The end of the year is approaching in a blink of an eye, and all industries are busy closing accounts. This year, due to the changes in foreign exchange and the rise in prices, all industrial and commercial enterprises have made huge profits, so recently, the prices of stocks such as yarn factories have risen uniformly. It is said that the most profitable industries are rice, cotton, yarn, oil, etc. It is estimated that yarn factory employees will have 100 months of bonuses to share; those in the banking and finance industry who are engaged in foreign exchange speculation have also made amazing profits. Shanghai has such huge profits to be made, of course, they are happy and forget Shu, and they have completely abandoned the important task of investing in the southwest and building the rear area, which is really heartbreaking to say. And those who profit are all happy, and they are oblivious.
— Hong

When Will It End After the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee implemented emergency measures to limit rice prices, general rice stores closed their doors at the same time due to the popularity of rice grabbing, and operated in a small hole. In some people's homes, the hole is so small that even a washing basket cannot be stuffed in, making it very inconvenient for small people to buy rice. If there are too many people, they have to wait for a long time at the hole, which is unbearable. Although there was a saying that all rice stores would reopen from the day before yesterday, some rice stores are still closed, and even write "This store's stock is sold out and business is temporarily suspended. Transactions will be carried out when goods are received." Most of the small rice stores are taking a wait-and-see attitude, only selling and not buying, selling out the stock first. As a result, some have japonica rice but no indica rice, and some have indica rice but no japonica rice. If you go to buy rice, if you are not careful, you will have to go to several stores in a row. This situation is really too inconvenient for rice buyers. We hope that the rice industry authorities will quickly find a way to make the rice stores open their doors uniformly to reduce the inconvenience of rice buyers!

### Market Knowledge Consultant

This publication has reached its 300th issue. It is really a very gratifying thing in China that a rigid supplement can be maintained for such a long time with the love of readers. Therefore, it has been decided to start with this issue the plan to add a "Small Mailbox" to this publication as requested by readers; on the one hand, it will help readers solve all their questions to thank the old readers for their love for this publication; at the same time, it will also be regarded as a commemorative issue for the 300th issue of this publication.

Chen Jiejun asked: The Central Bank quotes the Shanghai Standard Bullion price, which is obtained by multiplying the daily Guanjin market price by a fixed number of 57979. However, the fineness of the bullion is 978, and the purchase price of pure gold in China is less than 5 yuan higher than the standard gold price. For example, on December 13, the Central Bank quoted the Shanghai Standard Bullion price as $1,366.20, and on the same day, the purchase price of pure gold in China was $1,370.90. Please show its calculation basis and method.

Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan replied: The Shanghai Standard Gold price and the pure gold purchase market price quoted by the Central Bank are both calculated based on the London gold price as the standard. The calculation methods will be explained separately on the left:

(A) Standard Bullion

One bar of bullion is equal to ten taels of Shanghai weight, with a fineness of 978. Each tael of Shanghai weight is equal to 1.0047107 ounces. Therefore, one bar of bullion is actually equal to 9.826070 ounces. 10 x 0.978 x 1.0047107 = 9.8260707

Now that the London gold price is 8 pounds and 8 shillings per gold ounce (equivalent to 2016 pence), and the Central Bank's quoted British exchange rate is still one shilling and two and a half pence (equivalent to 14 and a half pence), the following equation can be obtained—

2016 ÷ 14.5 x 9.8260707 = 1366.16 Rounding off, we get 1366.20 yuan

(B), Pure Gold Purchase Market Price Although it is called pure gold here, its fineness is only 999. If it is ten taels of pure gold, calculated according to the above ratio, it is actually equal to 10.03706 gold ounces

40 x 999 x 1.0047107 = 10.03706 The London gold price is 2016 pence, and the Central Bank purchases pure gold at a foreign exchange selling price of one shilling, two and three-quarters of a pence (equivalent to 14 and three-quarters of a pence). The calculation formula can be obtained—2016 ÷ 14.75 = 10.03706 = 1371.84 Rounding off, we get 1371.80 yuan.

The purchase price of pure gold in China on December 13 mentioned in the letter was 1370.90 yuan, but the Central Bank quoted 1371.80 yuan, which may be a misprint, and the fixed number 579.79 is an error of 507.79.

Chen Jiejun asked: In the commercial news column, the prices of foreign currencies in various countries, British gold notes, and American gold notes are calculated based on the foreign exchange market. However, there are also two types of market prices for British gold pounds and American gold pounds. For example, on December 13, British notes were $46.00, British pounds were $95.60, American notes were $13.12, and American pounds were $98.00. I don’t know what standard the prices of the above British pounds and American pounds are based on.

Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan replied: The "British gold notes" or "American gold notes" listed in the commercial news column refer to the paper money of that country; as for "British gold pounds" or "American gold pounds", they refer to coins (those cast in gold). The former is paper money, so its price is calculated based on the foreign exchange market; the latter is gold coins, so its price is calculated based on the amount of pure gold it contains.

According to the ratio of conversion to Shanghai taels (one Shanghai tael is equal to 31.25 grams, which is also equal to 482.26 grains),

The amount of pure gold contained in each British gold pound is approximately equal to 23 cents of Shanghai tael. (7.32 ÷ 31.25 = 0.23)

The amount of pure gold contained in each American gold pound is approximately equal to 24 cents of Shanghai tael. (116.1 ÷ 482.26 = 24)

Now the black market gold price in Shanghai is more than 4,000 yuan (calculated per ten taels), so the prices of British and American gold pounds are each more than 90 yuan.

Mr. Pan Hengqin replied, Mr. Lu Xiuchuan asked, because there are too many questions, they will be published in the next issue. Please forgive me!

### Grains: Imported Rice Prices Rise, Nearing Those of Second-Grade Japonica

Yesterday's rice market was initially quiet. Generally, customers have recently favored imported rice as their primary purchase. Now, with the price of imported rice increasing, it is approaching that of second-grade japonica. Buyers are hesitant to make further purchases and plan to wait and see. As a result, the morning market was exceptionally deserted with little activity. Later, it was announced that the market would be closed today for Christmas. Local merchants, anticipating increased demand, started buying, focusing on imported rice. Consequently, the demand for Saigon and Siamese rice increased sharply, with some interest in japonica as well, tightening the market. However, transactions remained sporadic, leading to a brief surge followed by a decline. Ultimately, prices fluctuated by only two or three cents. Saigon early market "tuantuanli" (round grain) opened at 37.5 yuan, closing at 37.8 yuan for "tuantuanli" and 37.5 yuan for "changli" (long grain). Siamese rice was priced at 38 yuan, an increase of about three cents compared to the previous day. Prices for thick and thin japonica rice had mostly reached their limits, with only a small difference between medium and second-grade rice, around half a yuan. Low-grade "hudou" (coarse rice) opened at 37.5 yuan per "hu." "Lujian te" (reed tip special) was priced at 39.5 yuan, "shi" (market grade) at 39 yuan, and "yangjian te" (sheep tip special) at 39 yuan, with "shi" (market grade) at 38.5 yuan, varying according to quality. It appeared that there was a hidden increase of two or three cents. White yuan rice, a seasonal necessity, increased by half a yuan. "Kejian" (customer grade) saw no activity, with total market transactions lower than before, only about four to five thousand bags.

Recently, the supply from inland sources has been inconsistent. After over 500 bags of "qingjiao" (greenhorn) rice were transported by truck, the supply stopped. According to merchants, this year's rice production is generally good, with each area having about 80% of a normal harvest. In areas such as Changshu, Xixi, and Danyang alone, the rice production is estimated to be in the millions of "shi." Including Jiangsu, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Songjiang, Sishui, Nantong, Jiangbei, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the total production would be at least three to five hundred million "shi." Therefore, if the supply channels can be opened up and not restricted, the rice price in Shanghai will naturally stabilize.

### Finance: Silver Bullion Rises by Three Cents, Ornament Gold Market Stagnant

The selling price of jewelry gold per "liang" was 420 yuan at Dahongxing, with the same price at Xinhongxing. The buying price was about 15 yuan lower. The selling price of silver bullion at Dahongxing increased by three cents per "liang," changing to 3.8 yuan.

"Sha Chi" (refined red copper) had no market yesterday due to the holiday.

### Money Exchange Businesses Closed Today, Foreign Banks Take Two-Day Holiday

Today (the 25th) is the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day, and the entire financial sector is closed for one day as usual, resuming business tomorrow. Foreign banks are closed for two days today and tomorrow for Christmas (commonly known as Foreign Winter Solstice), resuming business on the 27th.

### Coal: Coal Dust Prices Reduced, Coal Balls Sold at Original Price

The price of white coal dust has risen repeatedly since last week, affecting the costs of coal ball factories, making it impossible to ship goods. The industry association was asked to raise factory prices, but Yitaixing believed that coal ball prices had already risen several times, making further increases difficult. Therefore, starting today, they are willing to reduce the price of coal dust by two yuan to support the business of small factories. The prices are now: Hongji first-grade dust, 73 yuan per ton; second-grade dust, 68 yuan. Therefore, the price of coal balls will remain unchanged for the time being.

### Winter Solstice Hygiene

— Su Shaoqing

The Materia Medica of Food states: "Pheasant meat is sour and cold, and non-toxic. Although a delicacy from the wild, eating it is more harmful than beneficial, except in the eleventh month when it is nourishing." Shaoqing notes that pheasant is commonly known as wild chicken. According to the Materia Medica of Food, it is beneficial to eat it around the Winter Solstice, but harmful during other months. Western customs dictate eating turkey during Christmas (commonly known as Foreign Winter Solstice), which is similar to our country's tradition of eating pheasant during Winter Solstice.

The Essentials of Nourishing Life states: "During the Winter Solstice, yang energy returns to the abdomen, making it easier to digest hot foods." Shaoqing notes: Hot foods are easier to digest in the abdomen, not only during the Winter Solstice, but also during other months and times. However, the price of firewood and charcoal is several times higher than before, leading to lamentations that firewood is as expensive as cassia. Even middle-class families find it difficult to afford, let alone the poor who cannot afford hot food to nourish themselves and maintain hygiene.

The Principles of Following Nature states: "Five days after the Winter Solstice, husband and wife should sleep separately and refrain from intimacy, or their lifespan will be reduced." Shaoqing notes: During winter, all things should be stored, and we should take care of our health. Excessive activity without storage harms the foundation, leading to illness and reduced lifespan. This principle is easy to understand. As for the statement that husband and wife should sleep separately five days after the Winter Solstice, I disagree. The way of husband and wife should be observed at all times, but especially during winter when separation is necessary, and abstinence is essential after the Winter Solstice. Wealthy men and women take tonics in winter, presumably to remedy the damage caused by not sleeping separately. However, the power of medicine cannot compensate for the fundamental loss. Today, on the Winter Solstice, I urge those who habitually take tonics to follow the ancient precept of sleeping separately, save some money, and support the clothing and food of the poor to foster harmony with nature.

### Christmas Dinner

— Zhang Mengzhao

The Christmas holiday is not just a season for "play," but also a season for "eating." Tonight's "Christmas dinner" unfolds with splendor, amidst bright lights and resounding music. The most indispensable highlight is turkey.

Those plump turkeys (another name for turkeys), in shades of reddish-yellow, bronze, black, and white, meticulously prepared by master chefs using rich oil and sweet sauces, are arranged in large platters on tables covered with snow-white cloths. Exquisitely seasoned and delectable, the "Christmas turkey" is considered the most fashionable food of the "Christmas dinner!"

Red, yellow, green, and white "Christmas puddings" (commonly known as Christmas cakes), in square and triangular shapes, are similarly arranged next to the turkey, as a delightful treat after the "Christmas dinner!"

Speaking of "Christmas dinner," in British customs, it is regarded as our country's "reunion dinner." During dinner, the whole family sits together to eat. Even distant travelers who cannot make it home for the reunion dinner must have an empty seat reserved for them, along with prayers and blessings.

In India, there are no "Christmas hotels" to provide a Christmas dinner gathering for Englishmen residing far away.

Christmas festivities in Singapore are exceptionally lively. It is said that fishermen "living on the sea," even during foggy weather, must rush home for Christmas, just like "sitting together and happily chatting" in their home country.

As for the "Christmas dinners" eaten in places like New York and Chicago in the United States, they are a world for those with a penchant for Liu Ling (a famous drunkard) and the legacy of Li Bai (a famous poet). Drunk on wine, revelers sing, dance, and often vomit, reeking of alcohol, with many collapsing on the streets, sound asleep.

I would also like to make an additional appeal: Let us not be too unrestrained in our behavior at today's "Christmas dinner" in Shanghai. Why not embrace Jesus's love and compassion, moderate our desires for food, and everyone save a portion to help the suffering and helpless refugees?

### A Study of Holy Communion Foods

— Ying Dai

On the Christmas banquet table, the menu offers many dishes. According to Western legend, in the ancient halls of the Saxon people, at the beginning of the banquet, the drinkers were blessed, and then fragrant ale was passed to each person. The heyday of this type of banquet was probably during the Elizabethan period when the Christmas Eve banquet had as many as one hundred and twenty dishes. Royal Christmas banquets were generally similar. The enthusiasm for celebrating Christmas at that time can be said to have reached its peak.

The arrival of Christmas is an annual event, and traditionally, up until now, Holy Communion is held on Christmas Eve. On the banquet table, the usual turkey, roast beef, plum pudding, meat pies, and orange juice are indispensable. However, the situation was somewhat different when Holy Communion was held at Buckingham Palace in England one hundred and thirty years ago. On the menu, the plum pudding course was removed and replaced with a very thick bowl of strawberry porridge, which was served as the first course. However, in the Duke of Blackingham's house, meat pies were served twice, and there was also no plum pudding. Orange juice was an indispensable course, and it was made from real fresh oranges, with the Chinese variety being preferred for its sweetness and delicious flavor.

At the Holy Communion table, there were also many vegetables, which might surprise some people. At that time, one of the chefs in the British royal palace was British and had studied cooking under a famous Welsh chef. His skills were indeed very high, and no other chefs could match him. After serving seven meat dishes, at least six vegetable dishes were offered, either on the dining table or on another table. On December 25th, Christmas Day, he first served rice porridge, followed by a turkey and a truffle dish. On the other side of the table, there was a plate of chicken and duck congee, and a plate of beef kidneys. Truffles could be found in many parts of England.

Other meat dishes included lard bread decorated with asparagus and peas, a plate of salted pork, a beef tongue, two plates of rabbit meat with sour sauce, roast lamb with gourd, stir-fried beef and kidney, stir-fried mushrooms, lamb shanks with hyacinth beans, spring chicken with parsley, oyster cakes, partridges, guinea fowl, six snipe, and a pheasant.

Vegetables included cauliflower, Jerusalem artichoke roots, spinach, French beans, asparagus, red cabbage, and mushrooms. Desserts were not very abundant, including a powdered sweet cake, a cabbage cake, a cheese cake, sweet buns, small steamed buns, sponge cakes, and cream cakes. From what has been said above, it can be seen that a hundred years ago, the Christmas banquet table was far more abundant than it is today. However, while Christmas banquets are simpler now, many are still based on past traditions.

### Christmas Pudding

— Xinfang

According to Western custom, this item is always indispensable at banquets or feasts during Christmas: Christmas pudding. This "Christmas pudding" can be made into various styles at any time, depending on the skills of the housewife or chef; therefore, it is also a difficult task. The following are unique customs for Christmas pudding in various countries:

In Sweden and Denmark, Christmas pudding is made to look like a pig's head and is not eaten until after Christmas Day.

In Germany and France, Christmas puddings are made into the shapes of strange animals.

In Poland, it is first mixed with water and flour before being made, and on the surface of the pudding are engraved sentences used by monks, which cannot be eaten until the evening of that day.

In Romania, there is a custom where "Christmas pudding" is just pieces of hard, dry biscuits, which must be eaten with honey and other sugary sauces.

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Eating two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes every day, over and over again, it's always the same, and there's really no way to change it up. Now, I have a way to adjust it, which is to eat noodles or vegetable rice once a week, which can also change the taste. When eating noodles, you can follow the "crossing the bridge" method in noodle restaurants and have stir-fried shredded pork with bamboo shoots, or braised beef or mutton. When eating vegetable rice, all you need is a big bowl of soup, whether it's chicken blood tofu or meat slices with egg drop soup, and you won't feel the vegetable rice is too dry. As for how to cook vegetable rice, it can be economical or not economical. Economical: just use green vegetables or shepherd's purse; if you want it to be more chewy, you can add some yams or bean sprouts. If you want to be more particular, then you can put as much diced winter bamboo shoots, fresh meat slices, and diced cured meat as you want, or even replace them with chicken or duck slices.

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation During Christmas

— Yinhong

Every year at the end of the year, people inevitably think of Christmas. Indeed, in Shanghai, whether in the windows of major stores along the streets or in various places in newspapers, you can see an old man in red with a white beard, carrying a full package on his back, driving a reindeer sleigh. This is the "Santa Claus" that people love the most! And especially children feel the happiest, because Santa Claus will give them all kinds of candies they love to eat. But what about the general public? They regard Christmas as a carnival. Whether in "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," everyone wants to celebrate a joyous night. Now, let's talk about "clothing, food, housing, and transportation" related to Christmas.

Christmas was introduced from Europe and the United States, so in European and American countries, every year on this day, whether parents or children, they wear brand new clothes and bring many gifts to give to their relatives and friends. When they arrive at a relative's house, people see that your clothes are so brand new, and they expect that you will definitely receive the happiness of Santa Claus. In theaters everywhere, there are new costume competitions, mostly participated in by young girls. They wear especially bright and dazzling new costumes to compete with each other, and invite visitors to judge. If they can be selected as the first place, everyone confirms that she will definitely receive unexpected good luck in the coming year.

There is the most to eat during Christmas, such as Christmas cakes and Christmas puddings, which are necessary foods. Among them, the most famous and only delicacy is the American turkey. However, because it is delicious and fatty, the price is also very expensive. In European and American countries, buying a turkey requires about twenty US dollars, but this year, since the outbreak of the European War, cargo transportation in various places has been blocked, and turkeys are certainly no exception, so prices have soared to more than double. In Shanghai, in addition to American turkeys, turkeys produced in Dinghai Zhoushan are also very famous, and the number shipped to Shanghai every year is very large, but unfortunately Zhoushan has now fallen, so the source is scarce and the price is also more expensive. There is also a custom during Christmas to invent a novel and delicious food to predict future wealth.

In several towns on the Mullinson Islands in northern England, there is a long-standing custom of camping in the forest on a hillside on the night of Christmas every year, and even the children go. The next morning, as soon as the children get up, they see that their socks are filled with many candies and foods, so they are very happy. The parents tell the children that Santa Claus gave them, so the children will always like that old man. In fact, these are all put in the bags by their parents!

On Christmas Eve, people in every city and town in Europe and the United States become like lunatics, and everyone celebrates enthusiastically. Whether it is in dance halls, bars, cinemas, ice skating rinks, etc., they are filled with a joyous atmosphere, happily enjoying a night of fun. In fact, isn't it the same in Shanghai? The cost of a night of fun is at least dozens of yuan per person, which can be said to be extremely luxurious. However, although Shanghai this year is still playing all night as usual, because of the gunpowder atmosphere of the war in European and American countries, I am afraid that there will not be the same joy as before!

Current Affairs

### Tram Fare Increase

— Ji Fang

The tram fare increase issue, which has been causing a lot of turmoil, was finally passed at the most recent meeting of the Public Works Department and has been officially implemented by the tram company since the 22nd of this month.

Originally, the tram fare increase issue seemed to be a very minor event, not worthy of our attention at all, and even less worthy of being discussed in the newspaper. However, in today's Shanghai, with its turbulent society and expensive rice and firewood, it is not easy for the average person to ensure a continuous supply of three meals a day and worry-free clothing to keep warm. How can they withstand another burden on their living expenses in terms of transportation, namely, the tram fare increase? Therefore, the tram company's proposal to increase fares today has become a social problem, and it has also added another direct blow to the general middle and lower classes. Here, let me analyze its established facts:

First, from the tram company's own reasons, it is due to the contraction of foreign exchange, huge expenditures, and the inability to balance income and expenditure. Therefore, it believes that increasing fares is the best way to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Regarding this, we know that from the tram company's point of view, there is a considerable reason, but in fact, it is seemingly correct but actually wrong, and very far-fetched. Because the contraction of foreign exchange today is indeed a fact, however, if we recall the period of this year's July and August, when the foreign exchange market was most harmful, it was probably the lowest. But why didn't the tram company immediately increase fares at that time (because it had already increased once in early July this year), at least it would be more in line with the facts than now.

Second, it is said that this tram company's fare increase is not only to increase fares, but also to change the station distances, and the amount of fare increase per station distance seems to be set too high.

Third, this time the tram fare increase is only for the British tram company in the Public Concession, and the fares of the French tram company have not been increased or changed. From this we can know that although the two have different systems and different administrations, why is it that the French tram company does not consider this, and is so generous?

In short, the tram is originally a publicly operated enterprise, and its purpose is to facilitate the people. Moreover, from the perspective of the characteristics of a publicly operated enterprise, it is not entirely for profit. And we can also clearly know that most of the people who take the tram are from the middle and lower classes, because they benefit from its speed and cheapness in price. And now, in the midst of the difficult life on the isolated island, and the endless voices of rising prices and speculation, another unexpected burden has been added, which really makes people unable to help but shout out the cry of "It is not easy to live on the isolated island." The reason why I see this as a serious social problem is precisely here.

Finally, the tram company's fare increase is now an established fact, and it has already increased almost twice as much as when the "August 13th" Shanghai war just broke out. However, I still hope that the Public Works Department and the company authorities will carefully consider it, and that once the situation in Shanghai improves and the company's income increases, they will immediately reduce and re-establish it, and do not make "it is easy to increase prices but difficult to reduce them" a successful conclusion.

### Give an Example

— Hu Di

The Public Concession tram fares have increased again from the 22nd. According to the company's stated reason for the fare increase, it is due to the contraction of foreign exchange, and the inability to balance income and expenditure. The contraction of foreign exchange is a fact, and the inability to balance income and expenditure, then we small people dare not make wild guesses. However, judging from the situation that can be seen, even if the income and expenditure are really unbalanced, then this "inability to balance income and expenditure" cannot be compensated by a fare increase. (Regarding this point, the company authorities are probably very clear.)

After the Shanghai War, the population of the "isolated island" increased sharply to five million. The tram is a public utility, and with the increase in population, the tram business naturally also increases. This can be known by looking at the passengers gathered at the station, who often cause disputes because the passengers in the car are crowded, and the ticket seller refuses to open the door. At the same time, in order to provide convenience to the citizens everywhere, two new routes, the 24th (connecting the British and French Concessions) and the 20th, were added after the war. How is the business on these two new routes? There is no need to examine the accounts in detail, the company authorities are always very clear.

Perhaps this increased income still cannot offset the losses on foreign exchange, and forces the company authorities to resort to raising fares, which may be possible. However, please forgive me for being long-winded, the tram is a public utility, and cannot be compared with second landlords and unscrupulous merchants. With such high living standards and the decline in the vitality of citizens' lives, the tram company should make overall calculations within the possible scope, on how to reduce unnecessary expenses, and block huge loopholes.

At the same time, those who take the tram are mostly people from the middle and lower classes. The fare increase is indeed a prerequisite for increasing income on the surface, but in reality, it may not be entirely the case. Let me give an example:

I once talked to a rickshaw puller about the "business" problem. According to him, the rickshaw business is far inferior to what it used to be, but the rice price has risen to more than forty, and the rickshaw price cannot be raised too much. For example, the distance that used to cost a dime, now at most can be bargained for one dime and five cents, any more, and you can't find a customer.

Everyone living on the "isolated island" cannot deny the truth of this statement. From this, it can be seen that many people can no longer afford to ride in a rickshaw. And this is not comparable to being hungry and being forced to snatch rice, our legs, walking a little more distance, is also its due obligation.

From this example, taking it a step further, after the tram fare increase, some people will inevitably also descend from the tram class to the sidewalk.

Now the fare increase is a "fait accompli," but for the sake of the tram company authorities, please use this example as a memorandum, and in addition to the fare increase, please think about whether there are other ways to compensate for the "inability to balance income and expenditure."

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Forming a Family; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Skill in Pregnancy

According to the manufacturers of those family travel cars, "These cars can be equipped with heating in winter and air conditioning in summer, just like a person's house." Originally, these family travel cars were called "mobile homes," and they were considered a mobile family and a house. Since it's impossible to carry a house around everywhere, you can go wherever the car takes you. Furthermore, the curtains and carpets are all complete in every color. At the back of the car, there's a small platform. If there's a pair of lovers, sitting knee-to-knee, chatting intimately, watching flowers and appreciating the moon, it's the most suitable place. If the car is parked in an area of clear water and lush trees, a secluded and beautiful place, with beautiful flowers as walls and fragrant grass like carpets, wouldn't that evoke an indescribable joy? Since Jin Danyun had agreed to Mrs. Su Liya to test all three types of cars, then during this honeymoon, she planned to travel around the scenic areas near Shanghai. However, she didn't approve of some newlyweds who leave for their trip on the very night of their wedding, some even quietly leave without telling anyone where they're going, which is truly like running away. There's another matter. For that kind of family travel car, you can either ask the company to send a driver, or you can drive it yourself without a driver. Like Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun, they both know how to drive cars, but they've only driven cars for personal use. Driving such a large car, even if they both can, would be too tiring. To still be accustomed to labor during the honeymoon would be to lose the purpose of rest. Having the company send a driver would be best, but newlyweds inevitably lean on each other and whisper sweet nothings. According to Eastern customs and etiquette, they don't want to display overly intimate behavior in front of a third person. Moreover, perhaps lingering over the night view, a couple would stay in the car, as the travel car is equipped for this. But the driver would have to occupy it, otherwise, "How can one allow another to sleep soundly beside one's bed?" However, Jin Danyun had another idea. She said, "Since the test drive has been agreed upon with Mrs. Su Liya, I'm thinking of having some friends come along to travel and make it a public honeymoon trip. Then, let the company send a driver, and whoever is happy to drive can drive themselves." She also asked Lin Jiancheng, "Do you agree? Do you have any male friends to invite? If not, I'll invite my girlfriends." Lin Jiancheng always obeyed Jin Danyun, so he said, "I don't have any male friends, and it's meaningless to have a stranger come. It's best to invite girlfriends." Therefore, this matter was discussed before they got married. Her friend Wu Junsu's visit was for this very reason. (219)
