### Wang Jingwei in a Dilemma, Colluding with the Beiping Side, Japan Encourages Him to Go to the Puppet Government, a Letter to the Central Government Published in Hong Kong Intended to Confuse the People

Hong Kong: Wang Jingwei has returned to Hanoi. Military and political leaders in various regions mostly advocate for his arrest and prosecution. The central government is not yet planning to take this step. If Wang takes further action, then the final measure will be adopted. (Special dispatch, 2:30 AM, August 9)

Chongqing: Political circles here are paying close attention to Wang Jingwei's attitude after the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet. Well-informed sources say that Wang had colluded with the Beiping side before fleeing, but was not related to Liang Hongzhi, so the Nanjing side opposes him serving as president of the puppet central government. Japanese special agencies are strongly encouraging him to go to Guangzhou to form a puppet government, which Wang opposes. He is now in a dilemma. As for Wang's whereabouts, it has again become a mystery. Several sources believe that Wang has never been to Hong Kong, but some sources claim that he has already passed through Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai, hibernating in Hongkou under Japanese protection. This claim comes from the fact that the Japanese military police have implemented special martial law in the Hongkou area. According to well-informed sources, Wang is currently residing in a certain village six miles from Hanoi. This claim is considered more reliable. It is believed that Wang, encountering difficulties in his conspiracy, has today departed for Yangon, preparing to go to Europe immediately. (Associated Press telegram, August 8)

Hong Kong: Tonight, Wang Jingwei's associates stationed in Hong Kong publicly released a letter from Wang to the Central Executive Committee and the National Defense Committee, dated December 28 of last year. The letter stated in part: "On December 9, I expressed to Chairman Chiang the opinion that both China and Japan now realize their difficult situations, so peace is not impossible. Regarding foreign relations, we can hope for the assistance of Britain, the United States, and France, the tacit consent of the Soviet Union, and the non-interference of Germany and Italy. However, the key is that Japan realizes that China cannot be conquered by force, and that the entire Far East cannot be placed under Japan's hegemony. The declaration issued by the Japanese government on December 22 indicates that Japan has appropriately realized its position regarding China. I recall that before the fall of Nanjing, the conditions proposed by Japan through the German ambassador, although not as good as they are now, nor as certain as they are now, Chairman Chiang still did not hesitate to recognize them as the basis for negotiations. However, later, due to Japan's own hesitation, and because Japan changed the previously proposed conditions after the fall of Nanjing, the matter was shelved. Now that Japan has reconsidered its attitude, we should issue a declaration of the basis on which we can negotiate, as a pseudo-response, in order to restore peace and stabilize the overall situation in the Far East. Know that such an opportunity to end the war, once missed, cannot be regained. The assistance of Britain, the United States, and France is now gradually being realized. However, this assistance can only put us in a better position to engage in peace negotiations, because it absolutely cannot enable us to win the final victory through military planning, and achieve the substantial result of war. It is obvious that the Soviet Union cannot provide large-scale assistance to China alone without the cooperation of Britain, the United States, and France, and Germany and Italy will certainly not fail to support the restoration of peace. As for the internal situation, apart from the Communist Party and other undesirable elements, I see no reason for anyone to oppose honorable peace. After careful consideration, I dare to make this proposal. I have expressed my humble opinion to Chairman Chiang, and I now write to the Committee, hoping that you will appreciate my foolish sincerity and give your approval." (Reuters telegram, August 8)

### Central Daily News Commentary: The Hiranuma Cabinet

Chongqing: This morning, Chen Bosheng, editor-in-chief of the Central Daily News, published a special commentary in the newspaper, stating in part that, in terms of the selection of personnel for the Hiranuma Cabinet, those who agreed with the policies of former Prime Minister Konoe have all remained in office, while those who opposed his opinions and forced him to resign have all left office. Therefore, there will be no major changes in Japan's foreign policy regarding its relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or in its policy towards China. It will largely follow the original policies of the Konoe Cabinet. The addition of representatives from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties to the new cabinet has completely dispelled rumors that the new cabinet would be organized entirely according to fascist principles as a single national party. Today, the attitude of Japan's new Prime Minister Hiranuma is very different from what it was a few years ago, and he will not endorse a purely fascist policy, because the Japanese Fascist Party founded by Hiranuma himself was dissolved a few years ago. Therefore, the Hiranuma Cabinet is merely a continuation of the previous cabinet, and will largely follow the policies of the previous cabinet. According to Chen, he used to be a correspondent for the Central News Agency stationed in

At present, in addition to mobilizing a large army to deploy defenses in the West River and the southern route, the Chinese side has also dispatched a large army to counterattack Guangzhou from the northeast and two rivers, so that the Japanese army dare not dream of westward invasion of Guangxi Province.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, abbreviated as the Fifth Plenary Session; according to a telegram from Chongqing, it has been confirmed that it will open in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, which is about ten days away. According to the Kuomintang's General Regulations, the Central Committee Plenary Session is an organization within the party that is second only to the National Congress. It is convened once every six months, and the meeting place must be located in the central government. The importance of its nature and authority is self-evident. It can be said that the affairs of the state and the governance of the party are not merely matters of one party. In the past twenty years, the major plans of the party and the nation have all originated here. Moreover, in extraordinary times, the war of resistance and national construction involve thousands of complexities, looking ahead and behind, carrying on the past and opening up the future. Matters either await exploration or await vigorous implementation, and every move is related to the future of the party and the nation. Therefore, this Fifth Plenary Session is certainly not comparable to the regular semi-annual meetings of the past.

The agenda and the motions of the Fifth Plenary Session are not known to outsiders. Even the most important topics to be decided are not revealed in advance by the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, as they have been in previous plenary sessions. Since the main agenda has not been disclosed so far, this reporter has no way to discuss the specific matters. However, there are several situations that we usually feel deeply uneasy about, and we would like to briefly state them here. A fool's thousand thoughts may yield a single gain!

Since the Kuomintang adopted the General Executive system following the decision of the Provisional National Congress last year, people inside and outside the party have praised it. It is believed that power has been concentrated, and the will has been unified, strengthening the organization and accelerating progress. However, as time has passed, there have not been many visible achievements. This is because, during wartime, military affairs are paramount, and there is no time to devote full effort to the party. Even if great achievements have been made, they have been obscured by the war and not fully known to the public. This is due to both subjective and objective reasons. Of course, the results have not been as expected. As the overall situation enters a more severe stage in the future, we should still recognize the urgency, importance, and severity, and should not demand perfection. However, the Central Committee members must not be too lenient with themselves. The status of the original Central Committee members within the party is not diminished by the General Executive system. Their service in the party, government, or society is not reduced to subordination because military affairs are paramount during wartime. Moreover, based on a sense of self-respect that is appropriate and a sense of responsibility that is shared by all people, they should have the spirit of the General Executive in their attitude towards the party, the nation, society, and even the duties they hold, and should be a thousand times more diligent and hardworking than ordinary party members and people. In this way, in addition to the General Executive being sincerely admired and regarded as the sole leader by the nation, the Central Committee members should also demonstrate their extraordinary qualities to ordinary party members and the people in various aspects of their spirit. It is important to know that the ability of any organization to maintain immortality depends on the formation of a good tradition by the core members, and cannot be permanently relied upon by any natural person. The Kuomintang has the General Executive, but there is still much to be done by the Central Committee members, who are its core members. We believe that the Kuomintang's future in politics depends on how the Central Committee members create a solid foundation for the party. If the core members are inferior, then the future will be inferior. What is worrying lies in oneself and not in others. The people have high expectations for the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang should have practical achievements to meet the people's high expectations. This is the first point. The Kuomintang has always established the party and the nation with a revolutionary spirit, but in the last decade, the revolutionary spirit has declined. Regardless of matters related to state affairs, just talking about the party, such as planning the party's organization, promoting and practicing the party's doctrines and policies, sanctioning all violations of party discipline, and selecting personnel for central and local positions at all levels, we often find that the revolutionary spirit is not thorough. Often, it is launched with great fanfare and with the force of a thunderbolt, but ends up buried in obscurity. Judging the circumstances, of course, there must be unavoidable difficulties, which are understood by the party. However, the feelings involved, the impact, and the inadequacy of the effectiveness of the results cannot be fully accepted by the people. The root causes vary and cannot be exemplified in detail. However, maintaining an open and impartial attitude, eliminating unnecessary entanglements and obstacles, and developing and expanding the original revolutionary spirit is the way to fundamentally cure the disease. This is the second point. This war of resistance, when explained in terms of the various aspects of the nation, both internally and externally, is full of the meaning of reforming and innovating. Even various social undertakings and the personal establishment and career of any individual will face serious tests and undergo drastic changes due to the war of resistance. This is due to the trend of events and is almost unavoidable. It can be seen that the excellent will be reasonably developed, and the corrupt will be reasonably eliminated. If artificial interference is added to it, although the final destination cannot fundamentally violate the trend, the transitional phenomena created will vary depending on whether the artificial interference is appropriate. Those who plan for the nation should clearly recognize this great trend and guide it in a favorable direction. In other words, we must work hard to make all reforms, successes, failures, rises, falls, profits, and losses extremely fair, extremely economical, and extremely clear. If the effort is appropriate, it can shorten the process of completing the great cause of national construction. Conversely, it will only increase obstacles. The impact is far-reaching and cannot be described in words. However, climbing high starts from the low, and traveling far starts from the near. Everything begins now. Therefore, planning for the party and the nation now must at least examine reality and eliminate any unfair, uneconomical, and unclear matters towards people and events. Only by eliminating them without mercy can reasonable measures be taken. This is the third point. Will the Fifth Plenary Session pay attention to these three points?

### Japanese Planes Bombing Near Chongqing, Dropping Leaflets to Propagandize to the People in Support of Wang Jingwei's Peace Movement, This Is the Beginning of Hiranuma's Attack on China

Chongqing: Yesterday, twenty-four Japanese planes bombed Yichang at around 12:00 noon, and then split into two groups to fly to Chongqing, bombing the suburbs and nearby areas of Chongqing, and dropping leaflets to propagandize to the people to support Wang Jingwei's peace movement.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Special Budget; Parliament Reopens on the 22nd; Arita to Clarify Diplomacy

Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, 7th: The cabinet decided to meet daily until the 11th, and after the 11th, meetings will be held as usual. Also, in the 7th cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Ishiwata first gave a detailed explanation of the special accounting budget for the 14th year of Showa (1939), and then the original plan was passed without objection.

Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, when the parliament reconvenes on the 21st, Foreign Minister Arita will elaborate on Japan's diplomatic policy, and will also touch upon the note sent by the U.S. government to Japan on December 31st of last year. The Japanese government believes that now is not the time to formally reply to the U.S. government's note, so the Foreign Minister must wait until the parliament reconvenes before mentioning the U.S. note incident. The Japanese government must thoroughly study the reactions in the United States after President Roosevelt's speech in Congress on the 3rd, and the reactions after Arita's speech in Congress in the future, before it can reply to the United States in the form of a memorandum.

### Japanese Economy Facing Imminent Crisis; Currency Devaluation Implemented; People's Livelihood Burden Increases

London, The well-known British weekly "The Observer" recently published an article entitled "Japan Can Endure Suffering." It states that as the undeclared war between China and Japan enters its second year, the domestic economic situation in Japan, and even the lifeblood of the empire, is clearly about to face serious worries. The deadline set by generally well-informed people has long passed. Anyone who knows the situation in Japan will not be surprised that its collapse may occur. The intensification of industrial production and the increase in the suffering of workers are affecting the people's energy and the quality of production. The decline in the standard of living in the years before the war has now fallen to the point where the Japanese masses, including farmers, can barely make a living. The decline of technical personnel has resulted in a large reduction in the import of war materials urgently needed by Japan. Ordinary industries have suffered great losses due to the lack of raw materials and the heavy pressure of government control. In the first half of 1938, Japan's cotton output fell by 20%, and the output of rayon only reached 30% of the previous year. Although the Japanese yen is nominally worth two shillings, it has actually been devalued and is only worth ten pence on the foreign market. The report concludes that, from this point of view, the approach of a financial and economic crisis in Japan is inevitable. (8th Quick News Agency Dispatch)

### Tianjin Concession Negotiations Remain Deadlocked

Hong Kong, Tianjin Dispatch, Negotiations between the Japanese army in Tianjin and the authorities of the British and French concessions remain deadlocked. The Japanese demands are extremely unreasonable, such as recognizing that the concession police are all anti-Japanese elements and must be reorganized, and insisting that anyone the Japanese designate to be arrested must be dealt with immediately. The concession authorities have not agreed to this, but have discussed it several times, so the future trend is highly noteworthy. (8th Dispatch)

### Germany Promotes Mulberry Planting and Sericulture; Objective Achievements in Four Years

Haitong Agency, Berlin Air Dispatch: The German weather is not suitable for mulberry planting and silkworm rearing, but in recent years, the German government has tried its best to enable the silk produced domestically to supply a portion of its needs. Since 1934, the achievements in silk production have progressed extremely rapidly. The output of cocoons has increased fivefold, and the number of mulberry trees has increased twenty-twofold compared to four years ago. Following this progress, the future is unlimited.

The German "Attack" newspaper claims that since Japan has blockaded British positions in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, Britain is now changing its approach and entering China through the back door via Rangoon. Britain's recent loan to China is for this purpose. According to the newspaper's Rangoon dispatch, British ships loaded with munitions have arrived there to supply China. The first batch of military supplies included twenty-two trucks. The mountains of Yunnan Province are precipitous, and although Japan has bombers, they cannot harm Yunnan Province. This progress is a revolution in the Far East, and also a new starting point in the Sino-Japanese War. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong, A large number of new weapons have arrived, strengthening the country's strength. Cars and all equipment purchased with credit loans from Britain are on the way, and if there are no obstacles in transportation, the first batch can arrive within a month, and more will continue to arrive. The waterways of Sichuan and Guangxi have begun to be dredged to facilitate the wartime military transport. (8th Dispatch)

### Xikang, Newly Established Province, Formerly Regarded as a Remote and Desolate Area; Now Undertakes Important Tasks in the Rear Area of the War of Resistance

The establishment of Xikang Province was realized on New Year's Day this year. It was formerly regarded as a remote and desolate area, but now it is actually a key point on the western border and bears important responsibilities in the rear of the War of Resistance. Now, a general report on the situation in Xikang Province is presented as follows:

Xikang is one of China's eight major plateaus, with many high mountains and deep valleys. It borders Sichuan to the east, Yunnan, British Burma, and India to the south, Gansu and Qinghai to the north, and Tibet to the west. The total area is 2,046,000 square miles, but the population is sparse. The total population of the province is only 3,800,500, of which 600,000 are Han Chinese, 1,300,000 are Tibetan, 1,700,000 are Kang, and the rest are Mongolian, etc., in very small numbers.

Xikang is surrounded by the high mountains and deep valleys of the Hengduan Mountains. The so-called Hengduan Mountains are composed of the Selongla Range and the Boshula Range branching out from the Gangga Li Mountains, the southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, the Tanian Ta Weng Mountains and the Yunling Mountains branching out from the Tanggula Mountains, and the Shaluli Range and the Daxue Mountains branching out from the Bayan Har Mountains. In addition to these six main lines of the Hengduan Mountains, there are also the Min Mountains in the southeast and the Wuding Mountains in the southwest. The main rivers include the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the Bo Tsangpo River, the En River, the Lancang River, the Jinsha River, the Yalong River, and the Dadu River. The Yarlung Tsangpo River originates in Tibet and flows into British India's Assam region. The Bo Tsangpo River originates in Jiali County in this province and flows into British Burma. The Nu River originates in the plateau north of Lhasa, flows through this province into Yunnan, and then flows into Burma. The Lancang River originates in the south of Qinghai, passes through this province into Yunnan, and then enters French Vietnam. The Jinsha River is the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, between Batang in this province and Xufu in Sichuan. The Yalong River is the Xiaojinsha River, originating from the southern foot of the Bayan Har Mountains and flowing south parallel to the Dajinsha River, joining the Dajinsha River west of Huili in Sichuan. The Dadu River originates from the southern foot of the Min River and meanders through Sichuan and Xikang provinces. Xikang is located in a semi-tropical zone and is slightly affected by the monsoon. Unfortunately, due to the high terrain, the climate is inevitably cold, but it also varies from place to place. For example, Kangding is very high above sea level, and the cold is particularly severe, while Ba'an is lower in altitude, and the temperature is moderate.

Xikang's resources are primarily mineral deposits. For example, the Mike gold mine in Zhanhua is famous for its high quality. The coal seam in Qamdo is as deep as 7,000 feet and as high as 600 feet. Ningjing produces abundant petroleum, and the British and Russians have investigated it. Tongpu, Dege, and its surrounding areas produce bronze and brass, while Kangding and Ba'an produce iron. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation and the superstition of the locals, although there was some mining in the late Qing Dynasty, the quantity was still very small. Agriculture is not very developed due to the high terrain and cold climate. Only the valleys and depressions can be slightly cultivated. The main crops are wheat, corn, and oats, followed by potatoes and beans. Rice is very scarce. Animal husbandry is quite suitable due to the vast grasslands, with yaks being the largest, followed by horses. Musk grows in the navel sacs of male musk deer, and the yield is extremely high. A large quantity is exported abroad every year. Forest products are also abundant, mainly pine and fir. Xikang is adjacent to Tibet and was originally the Kham region of Tibet, but Xikang has its own historical and inherited fixed area and cannot be mixed with Tibet. The name Xikang first appeared in the Later Han Dynasty. Zhuge Liang's expedition to the southern barbarians reached this place. Guiwang of the late Ming Dynasty was also exiled to Xikang. However, from the Tang Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, Ming Dynasty, to the Qing Dynasty, the method of governing Xikang was only to appoint its chieftains with a policy of appeasement, so that the locals only knew about Xikang and did not know about China. In the 30th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, after the British-Tibetan treaty was established, the Qing government realized that the boundary between Kang and Tibet could not but be urgently planned, and the method of governance could not be merely appeasement. In the 32nd year, the Minister of Frontier Affairs of Sichuan and Yunnan was established, with Zhao Erfeng appointed. Zhao managed Xikang for five or six years, striving to build, reclaim wasteland, establish schools, and reform the administration, in order to achieve long-term stability. The scale was roughly established, but the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. After the establishment of the Republic of China, 33 counties on the Sichuan border were designated as special regions. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, the Tibetan army attacked and captured nine counties including Dege and Ningjing. Only thirteen counties remained. In the 20th year, Ganzhi and Zhanhua were invaded and occupied by Tibetan bandits, half of Yanjing was lost, and Ba'an was also on the verge of danger several times. It was not until the 21st year of the Republic of China that the Sichuan-Kang army recovered Ganzhi, Zhanhua, Dege, Baiyu, Dengke, and other counties. In October of the same year, Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kang army, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet each sent commissioners for negotiations, and a ceasefire agreement was signed in Gangtuo, Dege. It stipulated that the area east of the Jinsha River would be managed by the Han side, and the area west would be managed by the Tibetan side. The dispute between Kang and Tibet has come to an end for now, but the lost areas have not been fully recovered. The proposal to establish Xikang Province has been circulating for a long time, and it has finally been established. The development plans for the future have already been detailed in the declaration of establishment issued by the Xikang Provincial Government.

### British Prime Minister's Visit to Italy Imminent; Wide Range of Talks; Germany and Italy Both Advocate for a Four-Power Conference to Discuss Mediterranean Issues

Berlin, As British Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to visit Italy, German political figures all hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will persuade the French authorities to agree to hold a four-power conference of Germany, France, Italy, and Britain to discuss various issues in the Mediterranean. It is said that in order to implement its demands, Italy may cause clashes in the border areas adjacent to French and Italian territories, and then mobilize its navy, which is not impossible. Prime Minister Chamberlain is deeply concerned that Germany may take action to assist Italy, and will naturally persuade France to participate in the four-power conference. In this way, Germany can also take the opportunity to raise colonial demands at the conference. German political figures hope so, but experienced observers say that if serious conflicts actually occur between France and Italy, Germany may not use force to assist Italy. Perhaps, if Germany believes that the dispute between France and Italy is enough to cause armed conflict, it may even refuse to fully support Italy's demands. In short, what Germany hopes for is that Britain will mediate between France and Italy. That is all. (7th Havas Dispatch)

Rome, When the British Prime Minister and others visit Rome, the Italian people will definitely give them a warm welcome. All streets will be hung with British flags. Although the official arrangements only include one meeting between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, according to the opinions of political observers, there will definitely be more than one meeting, and the scope of the talks will involve all international events. Italian newspapers also predicted the possibility of holding a four-power conference to discuss Italian demands, saying that the entire issue of the relationship between Germany and Italy and Britain and France will be considered based on the new balance of power created by the Munich Agreement. As for smaller issues related to Britain and Italy, such as the new commercial negotiations scheduled in the Anglo-Italian agreement, the final demarcation of the boundaries of African Anglo-Italian territories, and the future status of the Mediterranean, will also be discussed. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Rome, The news that British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will stay briefly in Paris on their way to Rome has aroused hopes among people here that Britain will mediate the dispute between Italy and France. The Roman People's Newspaper stated that this move is a slap in the face of France's claim not to accept mediation. According to international etiquette, the British Prime Minister and others would not accept France's request without first notifying the country that invited them to visit and obtaining its consent. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Cabinet to be Reorganized Next Month; Nature and Scope Depend on Diplomatic Situation

London, Political figures here recently declared that the British cabinet will be reorganized next month. The nature and scope will depend on the outcome of the talks between Prime Minister Chamberlain and the Italian authorities. In other words, if the Prime Minister can persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to earnestly support the appeasement policy and obtain various economic benefits in exchange, then radical figures such as former Foreign Secretary Eden will not join the cabinet. Conversely, if the Prime Minister's trip is unsuccessful, he will only adopt a tough policy towards Germany and Italy. In that case, Eden's return to the cabinet is undoubtedly certain. Moreover, if the cabinet is reorganized, the ministers in charge of departments related to national defense must be reshuffled. For example, Minister for the Coordination of Defence Inskip will likely be removed from his post. If the Prime Minister's appeasement policy fails, the government may change the national voluntary service system to a compulsory one. At that time, a special department will definitely be established, and Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, who advocates the most vehemently for compulsory service, will be transferred to be the minister of that department. In addition, it is well known that Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson has criticized the slow progress of the military expansion plan. Whether he will remain in office will also depend on how the diplomatic situation develops. The reassignment of Minister of Agriculture Morrison to another position is expected. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### Italian Foreign Minister Receives British and American Ambassadors

Rome, Official sources recently declared that when Foreign Minister Ciano received U.S. Ambassador Phillips today, he informed him that President Roosevelt's personal letter to Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the Jewish resettlement issue is being studied by the Italian government in a friendly spirit. There was no other indication. British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine also visited Foreign Minister Ciano today to discuss the arrangements for the reception of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax.

### French Premier Returns to Paris; Meets President Lebrun; Reports on Tour

Paris, Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived here at 9:18 this morning. When he got out of the car, he smiled and embraced Cabinet Secretary Xu Dan, Minister of the Navy, who welcomed him at the station. Then he delivered a broadcast speech on the platform, saying, "I am very pleased to have witnessed the loyalty and close unity of the natives of Algeria and Tunisia to the motherland." They also hope that French compatriots will become more united to carry out the great task at hand." When the Premier walked out of the station, a large crowd cheered and paid tribute to him. He then visited President Lebrun at 10:50 to report on his trip. (8th Havas Dispatch)

Paris, French Premier Daladier, on his way back to Paris, passed through Valence and gave a brief speech at the local town hall, defending his position in the Munich Agreement and earnestly explaining to all countries in the world that France has not been divided by it. His actions in Munich were aimed at protecting France and preventing the world from suffering from war. Daladier solemnly declared that if the French want peace, they must first unite, because if France is once disintegrated internally, it will inevitably be exploited by the enemy. He also refuted the rumors spread by foreign newspapers that civil war was about to break out in France, saying that the country spreading such rumors clearly has ambitions to covet France's territory in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Daladier continued, "As soon as I return to Paris, I will devote all my efforts to national affairs, and I will never allow the various rumors to become a reality. I believe that maintaining the security and order of France and its territories is the best policy to protect the French Republic and world democracy." (8th Haitong Dispatch)

### Situation on Hungarian-Czech Border Remains Tense; Czech Troops Continue to Attack Ancheng; Hungary Dispatches Reinforcements

Budapest, After the incident in Mongács in the north, it returned to calm yesterday afternoon. Another serious incident occurred in Nagygéjőc near Ungvár. A team of regular Czech troops, together with Ukrainian guerrillas, attacked the area at 9:00 last night. (Note: Ungvár, originally named Uzhhorod, is the capital of the Czechoslovak Carpathian Ruthenia province, which was decided to be assigned to Hungary by the Vienna Award). Upon hearing the news, the Hungarian authorities have dispatched reinforcements to defend the area. (8th Havas Dispatch)

Budapest, The situation near Mongács remains tense. According to news received from the Hungarian side, Czech troops continue to concentrate in the area. In addition, an incident also occurred today in the Hungarian border town of Kolda (not far from the border with the Czechoslovak province). A resident of the town named Lipenszky was arrested for insulting Hungarian Regent Horthy. More than 150 people immediately held a demonstration to protest. Hungarian gendarmes opened fire, killing three people. The situation was quite serious. (7th Havas Dispatch)

Budapest, According to news from the Hungarian official news agency, new movements of Czech troops were discovered yesterday near Krasztolmas in the vicinity of Munkácsy. The Czechs are also transporting beams and planks, apparently intending to build a bridge over the Latorica River in order to transport troops to Várkulcsa. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Budapest, Regarding the Mongács incident, after the conflict between Czech and Hungarian military forces yesterday, seven people were killed on the Hungarian side, including four officers, and nine people were injured. On the Czech side, one customs officer and three soldiers were killed. Their bodies were found in Hungarian territory, and soldiers and enemies were captured and detained in Mongács. (7th Havas Dispatch)

Budapest, The four Hungarians killed in the Mongács shooting incident will reportedly be given a state funeral. Among the nine injured, some were injured by stray bullets. Three citizens and two girls and one child are still in Mongács recovering. (8th Haitong Dispatch)

Prague, A communiqué was issued here yesterday stating that the Czech-Hungarian Mixed Commission is currently investigating the Mongács conflict. The first meeting was held yesterday afternoon. The Czech government has instructed that a detailed investigation be conducted into the causes and consequences of the incident. At the same time, it believes that the two governments should take this opportunity to study various trends in a spirit of friendly cooperation in order to appease the border and prevent the recurrence of such conflicts. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Prague, Regarding the Mongács incident, a semi-official communiqué stated that the area has returned to calm since 5:00 pm yesterday. The Autonomous Government of Carpathian Ruthenia has dispatched Lieutenant Lugaš, a liaison officer, to assist the joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian officers in conducting the investigation. In addition, the military authorities also issued a communiqué on the incident, stating that near the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the vicinity of the city of Mongács, Hungarian army units assisted by armed people opened fire on Czech army units on January 6. By the afternoon, after intervention by liaison officers from both sides, the firing stopped, and the respective troops returned to their original defenses along the border. The joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian officers investigated the situation yesterday afternoon in the hope of finding an appropriate solution. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### Czech-Hungarian Disputes Cause Unease in Germany; Italy Openly Favors Hungary

Berlin, Regarding the repeated disputes between the Czech and Hungarian borders, German political figures now feel uneasy about the tendency of the Czechs to allow the Slovaks to be self-governing. (Note: The German side no longer looks favorably on the Slovaks. Newspapers have recently reported that the Slovak Autonomous Government discriminates against Germans.) Newspapers originally stated that Hungary should bear the responsibility for the Mongács incident, but now they have changed their tune and attributed the responsibility to the Czech government. The Essener National Zeitung stated, "Communism is still active in Czech territory. This fact is not in line with the spirit of understanding between Germany and the Czech Republic." (8th Havas Dispatch)

Berlin, The German semi-official newspaper "Political and Foreign Correspondence" reported that the German government has issued warnings to both the Czech and Hungarian governments, and expressed Germany's attitude towards the Mongács incident. It is said that the authorities in any region must calm the people and maintain normality at the beginning of such incidents, and must take appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of the same incidents. The newspaper believes that the misfortune of this incident stems from the fact that people on all sides have different opinions on the recent revision of the border, and continue to promote demands to change the border. In fact, this kind of propaganda not only violates the solemn official guarantees, but also has the potential to create waves and cause international conflicts. This trend must not be allowed to grow. No matter how the rumors spread, the Vienna Awards have become ironclad cases. The new borders between Hungary and Czechia have been set, and no one should cross the border to make trouble. (8th Haitong Dispatch)

Rome, Foreign Minister Ciano received Hungarian Minister Vilany today to discuss the Mongács incident. (7th Havas Dispatch)

Rome, Italian newspapers' reports on the Mongács incident, judging from their headlines, clearly favored Hungary, and disclosed the Hungarian communiqué in more detail than the Czech communiqué, but did not make any criticisms. The same is true for officialdom. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Hungarian Government Urges Britain and France to Pay Attention

Budapest, The Hungarian government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain and France to draw the attention of the governments of their host countries to the Czech army's attack on Mongács. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### Polish Foreign Policy: Guaranteeing Border Security, Allowing Germany to Expand into Southeastern Europe; German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact Remains Firm

The Berlin Danzig Post, known for reflecting the views of the German authorities, recently commented on Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's talks with Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden, saying, "Although the political situation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe has changed significantly in the past year, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact signed in 1934 remains a useful tool for stabilizing relations between the two countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Beck's visit, and the German authorities are very satisfied with this." Regarding the talks between the German and Polish authorities, German newspapers have commented on this as their first decision. German political figures say that Polish foreign policy focuses on defending the country's border security with Germany, while allowing Germany to freely expand into Southeastern Europe, and it is gratifying that they still adhere to this policy. However, one thing is regrettable, namely, that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently advised Hungary to reconcile with Germany, but the Polish government did not support this. (Havas, 8th)

Warsaw: Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, after holding talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich, Germany, yesterday, returned here with his wife tonight. German Ambassador to Poland, Moltke, who participated in the talks in Munich, will return to his post tomorrow. Regarding the content of the talks, Polish officials remain tight-lipped and refuse to comment. (Havas, 7th)

### Hamburg Civil Affairs Director Delivers Speech on Foreign Policy Issues

Hamburg, Germany: Hamburg Civil Affairs Director Kauffmann recently delivered a speech on foreign policy issues, stating that 1938 was Germany's year of expansion in Europe. The policies promoted by Führer Hitler have been successful. The Munich Agreement was established with much effort from British Prime Minister Chamberlain, but Führer Hitler's contribution was the greatest. Although this agreement has produced an atmosphere of tranquility, anti-German forces within various democracies continue to grow. "Excluding the Soviet Union, the United States is the strongest of these forces." Finally, regarding the Jewish question, he said that this matter urgently needs to be resolved. Cooperation with relevant countries is needed to intensify resettlement efforts on a clear and legal basis. (Havas, 7th)

### Hungary Promotes a Lifestyle Movement, Implements Social Reforms to Promote National Unity

Budapest: Regarding the request of the German minority in Hungary for the right to promote National Socialism, their leader, Basch, will discuss it with Prime Minister Imrédy in the near future. (It is reported that there are over one million Germans in Hungary, about half of whom have assimilated to varying degrees with Hungarians.) To preemptively address this issue, Prime Minister Imrédy gave a speech on the 6th of this month, announcing the formation of the "Hungarian Lifestyle Movement," intended to unite government factions to resist Germanism. This movement will be chaired by Army Minister General Rátz, non-cabinet member de Losonczi, and former cabinet member Homann. Its main goal is to promote Hungarian national unity from a racial perspective. According to the Prime Minister's speech, this movement advocates for the implementation of "wise and prudent social reforms," stating that it "aims to overcome poverty, not to fight against assets." Furthermore, it advocates treating all minorities well, and has promised various preferential treatments to the German minority, such as: establishing German-language schools in German-populated areas; using German in administrative agencies and courts at all levels; and establishing a committee under the central government to handle minority affairs. As for the German minority's request to promote National Socialism, although their leader Basch will submit it for discussion with Prime Minister Imrédy in the future, according to Berlin's wishes, the Prime Minister has not yet agreed to it. In addition, the majority of the German minority is engaged in farming and is extremely indifferent to politics, often hindering Basch's efforts to promote a totalitarian system. Therefore, the German community itself shows little concern regarding promoting National Socialism. (Havas, 8th)

### Comparison of Air Force Strengths Among Major European and American Powers

London: The Sunday Times today published an article by an aviation correspondent stating that records circulating in Washington regarding comparisons of European air force strengths, said to represent the views of well-informed circles, are inaccurate and exaggerated by the authoritarian countries. At the time of the Munich Agreement, the rumored number of aircraft in each country was as follows: Germany 10,000, Italy 3,500, Britain 1,500, France 600, and the United States 1,700. However, according to information he obtained that has been verified from multiple sources, the actual number of aircraft in each country at the end of September was: Germany 3,200, Italy 1,750, France 1,150, and Britain 2,200. Moreover, the differences are now close to becoming significantly smaller. British authorities believe that the excellence of their regular and reserve air force pilots far surpasses that of any other country. The correspondent concluded by saying that he believes that the total number of deaths due to accidents among personnel in the British Royal Air Force and students in civilian flight schools is 219, which is only one-fourth of the death rate of the German Air Force and students.

### US President to Request Congressional Authorization to Retaliate Against Japan and Germany with Economic Measures; Naval Officials Believe the Philippines Need Protection, Advocate Adding Naval Bases in the Pacific

Washington: After President Roosevelt's message to Congress evoked a positive response in domestic and international opinion, the government felt encouraged and has prepared to submit a bill to Congress, requesting authorization for the government to take economic retaliatory measures against any country that imposes discriminatory treatment on American interests or discriminatory treatment on American citizens based on race or religion, with the primary intention of dealing with Japan and Germany. (Havas, 7th)

Washington: According to Congressman Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Rear Admiral Hepburn's report on expanding naval bases in the Pacific will be recommended by the committee to Congress, and the naval bases listed in the report will be established separately. Congress has also stated that it will formulate legislation based on the report. Rear Admiral Hepburn's report advocated that the United States should defend the Philippines by establishing air and submarine bases at key points in the central Pacific and greatly expanding the air and submarine base on Guam. According to naval officials, this plan was previously considered, but was temporarily suspended for fear of provoking a reaction from Japan. Rear Admiral Hepburn's report was drafted by a committee of naval experts chaired by Hepburn. The strengthening of Guam's defenses demonstrates their determination to defend the Philippines. The report advocated that the air base on Wake Island should have the capacity to accommodate a reconnaissance aircraft squadron and should be equipped with docks and shipyards. Similar facilities should also be built on Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Canton Island, and Rose Island. In Alaska, three second-class naval bases should be built, such as a submarine base on Kodiak Island and a naval activity base in Unalaska. Air and naval bases should also be added in the Atlantic and Caribbean. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Roosevelt Urges Democratic Party Unity; Celebrates Independence War Anniversary with Banquet

Washington: Former US President Jackson (a Democrat) served as a general during the War of Independence and defeated the British army in New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Today is the 124th anniversary, and over 10,000 Democrats across the country held banquets last night to celebrate. President Roosevelt, Attorney General Murphy, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, Acting Secretary of War Johnson, Governor Rivers of Georgia, and Governor Chandler of Kentucky all delivered speeches. President Roosevelt also called for Democratic Party unity, saying, "If we Democrats can help each other, then the American people will surely support our party in the 1940 election. The Republican Party had a minor victory in last year's congressional elections. The way to respond is to make those Republicans who are混跡 in our party and plotting against us return to their party, strengthen internal unity, and absorb members of other parties and non-partisans who believe in liberalism." In addition, President Roosevelt said that if former President Jackson were still alive, he would definitely use wireless telephone to tell him, "You are the first person since former President Theodore Roosevelt to be re-elected twice without interruption and to maintain a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Republicans had a small victory, so why fear?" The banquet fees paid by Democrats in various places ranged from $25 to $100 and were all used to supplement party expenses. (Havas, 8th)

### Democratic Senator Proposes Digging New Canal in Nicaragua; Militarily Important

Washington: Senator Bland, a Democrat from Virginia and chairman of the House Merchant Marine Committee, recently submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives, advocating the excavation of a canal in the Republic of Nicaragua in Central America or the widening of the Panama Canal. The discussion of opening a canal in Nicaragua was mentioned once several years ago. This is the first time that members of Congress have paid attention to this, which is worthy of importance. Regarding this plan, the New York Times published an article in early December of last year, stating that this river is 276 kilometers long and requires an expenditure of $725,000,000. American military authorities believe that the Panama Canal is easily damaged in wartime, and this new canal is of great military importance and needs to be opened. (Havas, 7th)

### Hull Advises Arms Dealers Not to Be Accomplices; Arms Control Committee Submits Report

Washington: The Arms Control Committee recently submitted a report to Congress, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, there have been numerous merchants who disregarded the neutrality law and tried to secretly transport arms to Spain, and they have all been stopped. However, forty "Grumman" aircraft were able to be transported to the Spanish Republican government via Canada and France using forged documents, and another ten were shipped via Mexico. In addition, twenty-two aircraft engines and twenty-four 37mm anti-aircraft guns could not be shipped because the State Department refused to issue export permits. Since January 8, 1937, the Spanish Nationalist Army has not received any arms supplies in the United States. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull, due to Japanese aircraft bombing civilians in China and Spanish Nationalist Army aircraft bombing civilians in Republican-held territory, pressured arms dealers and advised them not to sell aircraft and bombs to those countries. All but the largest arms factory have agreed to comply. (Havas Agency, 9th)

### Arab King's Cry of Injustice; Independence Dashed by Broken Promises of Major Powers; Blames US for Protecting Jews

Cairo: The protest letter from Arab King Ibn Saud to President Roosevelt, which was revealed yesterday, is as follows:

The people and government of the United States are influenced by extensive Jewish propaganda and have prejudices regarding the Palestinian issue, believing that Jewish oppression of Arabs is a righteous act worthy of support, not knowing that in fact, it is causing peaceful Arabs to suffer unfair treatment. Furthermore, he said that when the European War began, Arabs hoped to gain independence and freedom by joining the Allied Powers in the war. After the war ended, Arabs believed they could achieve independence based on the following reasons: Arabs participated in the Great War, sacrificing countless lives and property; the British government had an official document promising Arab independence; US President Wilson advised the Arabs to wage war in Mecca to obtain the right to national self-determination; when the Allied Powers occupied Arabia in November 1918, they declared in an official document that they were seeking Arab independence and freedom; and President Wilson publicly promised the right of national self-determination to the Arabs in his declaration on the Near East in 1919. However, after the war ended, the major powers went back on their promises and turned a blind eye. The territory of the Arabs was divided, and extremely unnatural boundaries were hastily drawn. Injustice in the world had reached this point. But there was worse to come. The major powers transferred the rights and interests of the Arabs to the Jews. If a race with a culture and way of life incompatible with the Arabs is allowed to occupy the homeland of the Arabs, and all the homeless people in the world are sent here, then how can there be hope for the restoration of peace in Palestine? Palestine has been sacrificed for the Jewish question. Now, please find a vast and boundless territory, open up and accommodate the Jews, instead of gratuitously granting what belongs to others, only singing high-sounding tunes. (Haitong Agency, 8th)

### Jerusalem: Terrorist Activities Show Signs of Resurgence; Over 4,000 Arrested

Jerusalem: Terrorist activities show signs of resurgence. Military and political authorities have intensified their suppression and have arrested many rebels in the northern and central regions, especially in the cities of Nazareth and Tulkarm. The total number of arrests is over 4,500, and they have all been detained in ten concentration camps. The Sarafand Camp alone detains 1,000 prisoners. The government authorities have issued an order stating that residents who have left the country without a passport or whose passports have expired and are still staying abroad will have their Palestinian citizenship revoked. As for Arab rebels, they attack Jews and Britons on the one hand, and also attack members of their own race who are designated as "enemies of the rebellion." For example, bandits are one such case. Many houses owned by the notorious bandit Fakhri Abdul Hadi and two shops in Nablus have been burned. Three Arab residents of Nazareth have been kidnapped. (Havas, 8th)

### Syria Demands Independence; Mass Demonstrations; Stores Closed

Syria: The treaty signed between France and Syria in September 1936, which stipulated that Syria would regain independence three years after the treaty went into effect, has been rejected by the French parliament. Mass demonstrations broke out in major cities in Syria today, demanding independence and opposing the abandonment of this treaty. Department stores in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Hama were all closed, and crowds gathered in the streets to participate in the demonstrations. Students from high schools and above in Damascus marched in teams, demanding independence. 600 students in Aleppo marched in teams, urging citizens to go to the mosques to listen to political speeches.

### Mexico Compensates British Oil Company for Losses

Mexico City: Mexican Foreign Minister Hay yesterday presented a check for £15,000 to the Danish Minister, representing the British Embassy, to compensate for the losses suffered by the British due to the confiscation of British oil properties during the Mexican Revolution. This is the amount determined by the Joint Committee of Arbitration to be paid annually. Thus, Mexico's debt for the confiscation of British oil companies has been cleared. The Mexican government also delivered checks to the French and Italian representatives to clear the debts due from the Mexican government this year. (Reuters, 8th)

### British and French Sympathizers with Spanish Republican Government; British Peace Group Leader Urges Italy to Abandon Interference; French Congressional Representative Willing to Find Ways to Supply Food

London: Four hundred representatives of the international peace movement, led by the Duchess of Atholl, marched to 10 Downing Street and presented Prime Minister Chamberlain with a resolution on the future Rome talks. The resolution requested that the government clearly announce to Mussolini that if Italy continues to interfere in the Spanish war, the British people's friendly relations with Italy will not be maintained. The resolution opposed granting belligerent rights to General Franco and advocated granting full international rights to the Spanish government. (Reuters, 8th)

Barcelona: A delegation from the French Parliament came to inspect the territory held by the Republican government and was received by members of the Spanish Parliament. Mr. Andé Dantin, Deputy of the French Radical Socialist Party, delivered a speech, saying, "After we return to our country, we will do everything in our power to assist your country in an effective way. For example, the food supply issue must be resolved immediately. There is a shortage of bread, milk, and potatoes in the territory held by your Republican government, while France has a surplus, which can be adjusted. In addition, we must also ask our government to end the despicable, hypocritical, and one-sided non-intervention policy. In other words, if a genuine non-intervention policy cannot be established, then we will give the most effective assistance to your Republican government, which is consistent with the ideals of us republicans and in line with the aspirations of us French to defend our homeland."

### San Francisco Bombing Case; Labor Leader Proclaims Injustice Rectified; 22 Years of Imprisonment; Released with Gray Hair

Sacramento, California: Labor leader Mooney, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the San Francisco bombing case on July 22, 1916, was acquitted and released today due to the inauguration of the new Governor Olson. It is said that 22 years ago, the US military pursued Pancho Villa and mistakenly entered Mexican territory, causing public outrage among Mexicans. As a result, a bomb was placed in a trunk at a street corner in San Francisco, which exploded, killing ten passersby and injuring forty. Mooney, as a labor activist, was falsely accused, sentenced to death, and then commuted to life imprisonment. During these 22 years, officials repeatedly tried to release him, but he refused. When Mooney left prison today, his black hair had turned white. Governor Olson first summoned Mooney to the state Capitol, announced to the legislature, "I firmly believe that Mooney is innocent and that his imprisonment was purely due to false accusations and perjury, so I advocate his release. If anyone opposes the release, please present new evidence immediately." After the governor finished speaking, the whole scene was silent, and no one raised any objections. The governor then declared, "I will now sign the release order for Mr. Mooney," and immediately signed the certificate and handed it to Mooney. His wife was also on the scene, extremely happy and weeping. Mooney also said to the governor, "You uphold justice, and I am extremely grateful." It is also heard that Governor Olson is planning to release Mr. Billings, who was sentenced at the same time as Mooney, but Billings has two convictions, so his release must first be approved by the Supreme Court. (Associated Press, 7th)

Sacramento: Labor leader Mooney, who was imprisoned in connection with the San Francisco bombing case in 1917, has spent twenty-two years in prison and was finally pardoned today. According to a broadcast speech given by Mooney tonight, he will fight against the Fascists to the end, and the most effective way to fight is to organize workers across the country to fight together. He said, "I deeply understand the significance of my release today. I have been fighting for twenty-two and a half years, hoping to redress my grievances... Even today, I can still recall the situation when I was sentenced in court, and the impression is extremely deep. My old mother cried out in pain, and my sister-in-law and colleagues were all in mourning. I deeply know that a certain force is not only fighting against us in California, but the whole world has suffered its adverse effects. There is no more effective way to fight against the fascist forces of today than with the economic organization of workers. It can be asserted that we should gather all our strength and strive to transform society with a common goal. We are responsible for rebuilding a good social order so that each member of society benefits each other and does not exploit each other." At the same time, Mooney thanked Governor Olsen and stated that he would try to get his fellow prisoner, Billings, released as well. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Amber Increasingly Used in Germany; Inlaid in Daily Necessities, Very Popular

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 8th (Airmail)

Amber ornaments, known in Germany as "German gold," have become increasingly popular in Germany in recent years, and are used creatively to decorate and embellish. Amber is abundant in the Baltic Sea coastal areas and has been used for ornaments for thousands of years. At a recent exhibition in Hanover, objects such as chains, bowls, cups, and sword hilts were inlaid with amber. Amber is also a commercial product similar to rosin. When ground into powder, it can be used to manufacture paints and other items. Amber bowls also have special uses in medicine because they can prevent blood from clotting when used to hold it.

### European Funds Flow Back to the United States

Washington: The Treasury Department recently announced that capital flowing from the United States to foreign countries totaled $374,547,000 in the first half of last year. From June to September in the second half of last year, however, $407,066,000美允 returned to the United States. The reason for this is likely due to the tense situation in Europe in September. As for the flow of capital between the United States and France, American capital flowing to France in the first half of last year totaled $44,287,000. By September, $71,287,000 had returned to the United States. (Havas, 7th)

### Transferring Gold to Maintain the Pound: Britain Implements New Financial Plan; Neither Inflationary Nor Exchange Control; Netherlands Likely to Cooperate with Britain

The British Treasury's decision to transfer gold from the Bank of England to strengthen the Exchange Equalisation Account and maintain the strength of the pound has been widely welcomed here. London sources say the Equalisation Account will have a huge sum of £450,000,000, enough to cope with any emergency. Foreign speculators should understand that this new plan is not comparable to inflation, as it does not affect the increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation. The exact amount of foreign exchange balance still available in London cannot be estimated, but there is no doubt that even if foreign funds continue to be withdrawn in large quantities, the authorities have the power to stop the adverse effects of such actions within two years. Moreover, a large portion of the foreign exchange balance is the cash held in the Treasury, so the transfer of gold will not affect the foreign exchange position. Responsible parties have also made it clear that the plan to protect the pound is not for exchange control. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

The gold issued by the Bank of England in London is worth £200,000,000 at the original price, but £350,000,000 at the current market price. After the decision on Friday to transfer this cash to the Exchange Equalisation Account, operators in the London foreign exchange and gold markets were very busy yesterday morning. Although pound trading was not very active at the opening, the price rose in dollar terms as the shorts rushed to cover, but the Exchange Equalisation Account sold dollars to curb the decline. At the close of the gold market, the authorities solicited gold prices at a premium of two pence, absorbing two-thirds of the amount sold. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Amsterdam. Although the Netherlands has not yet decided what attitude it will take towards Britain's actions to protect its currency, it is expected that the Netherlands will not refuse to cooperate with Britain to stop speculative acts that are detrimental to the pound. Dutch newspapers all say that Britain's move to maintain the pound is of great importance to the Netherlands. For the Dutch shipping company operating in the Dutch East Indies, the current British currency price is a factor in the success or failure of its business, because people in the East Indies calculate the value of their products in British pounds. According to the opinion of the financial community here, the falling price of the pound has had an adverse impact on Dutch commerce. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

### Spanish Rebels Launch Three-Pronged Offensive; Catalonia Front in Peril

Madrid. The Spanish government forces claim that the government forces on the Estremadura front have reached a point 90 miles from the Portuguese border, and have crossed the Zujo River into the province of Badajoz. Government forces have also occupied important heights near Mount Toroso. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

Saragossa. Spanish Nationalist forces crossed the Ebro River yesterday to attack the southern part of the province of Tarragona, and are now only 22 miles from the coast. Government forces in the Tortosa area are now in a precarious position. The defense of the Catalonia front seems to be gradually breaking down. The Nationalist forces are advancing rapidly on all fronts in fine weather. The Nationalist forces also said that the Northern Nationalist forces have reached Doncel, the Central Nationalist forces have advanced six miles along the Mengai Highway from the end of the Balaguer Bridge, and the Southern Nationalist forces advanced four miles yesterday morning and are now approaching Winbauddy. At the same time, the Nationalist forces on other fronts are also making rapid progress in the most dangerous mountains. (Reuters telegram, 8th)

### Situation After the Raids on Nanao: Refugees Urgently Need Relief; Japanese Troops Frequently Arrive to Inspect

Shantou Correspondence. After the second recovery of Nanao, on the 25th, the Shantou Red Cross Society sent several staff members again, carrying 2,000 yuan in legal tender, along with medicines, etc., and took a boat from Dongli, Chenghai, to Nanao to provide relief. According to those who provided relief back to Shantou, the first district of Longhan was burned down 80% due to many battles. Shenao, Qingao, and Yunao suffered less damage, and half of the houses were preserved. 70% of the refugees have returned. Those with a little property have returned to repair the tile roofs and build temporary shelters. Compared with the first inspection in mid-November, it has gradually become more vital. People are already cultivating in the fields, and some people are dragging fishing boats to the seaside to repair the burned boats in order to make a living at sea. More than 10,000 family members of fishermen who returned from Raoping and Chenghai are emaciated, haggard, and living under dilapidated walls, starting to sort out furniture. Nanao party affairs personnel Zhang Qianlong and others have returned to organize and train the people. The county office (originally in Longao) was destroyed, leaving only the walls, so it is temporarily located on Haishan Island and has not moved back to work. District chiefs and township chiefs have been re-elected in each district to listen to the county office and implement various policies, compile house numbers and household registrations. All daily necessities are transported by Chaoshan sailing ships. Although there is no market there, private goods are rampant. Salt can be bought for five or six catties per mill, and it has become a free commercial port. Smuggling ships also stop in the county to load and unload private goods. Japanese armed motorboats must go to Nanao every three to five days for reconnaissance, landing with arms and asking the residents if there are any Chinese troops stationed, and whether there is a plainclothes commando team organized. After asking, they leave. Japanese troops trade in Nanao, using Japanese military notes. Japanese warships are anchored between Nanao and Chenghai, about two or three ships. Sometimes they deliberately sink fishing boats, but they no longer pursue sailing ships. At this time, sea traffic is still convenient. There are no military police to maintain order in each district of Nanao, and there are no bandits looting. The people have nothing of value to plunder, so the public security feels good instead. Every time the Japanese army goes to Nanao for reconnaissance, they deliberately give small favors to win the hearts of the people. The Chinese government's relief to the refugees cannot be delayed any longer.

### Kunshan Puppet County Office Establishes Puppet Salt Bureau; Zhang Zhengyi Appointed Puppet Director

Kunshan Correspondence. Kunshan Salt Guild Hall has always been run by the government. After the Japanese army occupied Kunshan, they completely plundered a large batch of salt in the East Gate Salt Depot, worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As a result, salt prices soared, and the residents all complained bitterly. Last February, the puppet county office was established. The puppet magistrate Wang Youzhi is a master of collecting money. Recently, due to the exhaustion of the puppet office's funds, he came up with an odd idea to bring salt under the management of the puppet office in order to raise prices and hoard goods. The puppet salt bureau was established a few days ago, and Zhang Zhengyi was appointed as the puppet director. Zhang was the former district chief of the first district of Kunshan County. This time, he dared to do anything wrong and worked for the tiger. He also changed his previous attitude and spared no effort in searching and exploiting, so the people hated him to the bone.

### Japanese Troops in Suisuo Face Difficult Advance or Retreat; Key Areas Surrounding Japanese Troops Controlled by Chinese Troops; Chinese Troops Bravely Assaulted Suining and Even Rushed into the City

Huaiyin Correspondence. The Japanese troops entrenched in the Suisui area have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army has no strength to advance again. Although the Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou has transferred and pieced together mixed Japanese and puppet troops twice to reinforce them, they were also attacked by the Chinese army with a preemptive surprise attack, killing many enemies and destroying more than 90 tanks, a lot of ammunition and military supplies. Currently, there are about 1,000 Japanese troops in Sisuocheng and Sisuosanhushu, Gengche, Suiningyu, and Suilingzhen, which belong to Suining. They are ordinary troops and have no mechanized coordination. Because the key areas of the four countries where the Japanese troops are entrenched are controlled by the Chinese army, they are afraid to advance or retreat and dare not commit any crimes. The Chinese army is now planning to take the opportunity to annihilate the Japanese army in one fell swoop. It has been raining and snowing for days, so neither side has taken any active action for the time being, and the war has temporarily subsided. In addition, the Japanese troops in Suicheng have repeatedly requested reinforcements from the Japanese army headquarters in Suisuoqianshang. The Japanese army headquarters has now transferred more than 400 Japanese troops entrenched in the Suizhen area to Suicheng. Although the battle situation between the two sides has been calm in recent days, the newly arrived Japanese troops in Suicheng are building traffic roads at the North Gate of Suqian, as if they are going to do something. However, the Chinese army is prepared to launch another突击. In addition, the Japanese side in Suizhen is empty. Chinese troops, guerrillas, and people's self-defense forces are planning to take the opportunity to attack.

In addition, it is reported that there are only more than 100 Japanese troops trapped in Suining City, with 40 to 50 artillerymen and more than 10 artillery pieces. Artillery positions have been built in the Kuixing Building in the southeast of the city and at the South Gate. In addition, dozens of troops are stationed in Shuanggou, Lingchengtown, and Gengchetown. They are afraid of being attacked by the Chinese army at any time, and they dare not relax their vigilance. Japanese troops never dare to sneak into other towns and villages in the suburbs of the city lightly, because they have been repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army at Zhulou and Buziji, suffering heavy casualties. Therefore, after experiencing cruel lessons, they no longer dare to attack rashly. However, on the 24th of last month, more than 30 Japanese troops in Suining City left the city in two armored vehicles and moved southwest, attempting to sneak into Siyang. They were spotted by the Chinese army guerrillas as soon as they arrived near Guanshanji, and were met with a head-on attack with guns and cannons. After a fierce battle for a while, the Japanese army was unable to support it, and the road had been destroyed by the Chinese army, so they had to flee back to Suining in a panic. On the morning of the same day, dozens of Japanese troops in Suining also went to Suqian in an attempt to make contact with the Japanese troops in Suqian. As soon as they arrived near Shaji, they were discovered by Wang Baohua, a student of the Youth Corps. He immediately led more than 30 members of the people's self-defense team he had organized to intercept them. The fighting was fierce, and both sides suffered casualties. It was not until nearly noon that the Japanese army finally failed and returned to Suining.

Since the Japanese army occupied Suita, in addition to rushing to build fortifications to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking, they also implemented their policy of appeasement to anesthetize the people. At the same time, they instructed Zhao Guanyi to establish a puppet county office, with Zhao as the puppet magistrate. They sent Han traitor minions to go to the city and outside to summon the people to return to the city and ordered them to buy passes, one corner for each pass. All the people who returned to the city and stayed in the city without being able to hide must bring one for themselves. On the 16th of last month, the Chinese army secretly sent more than 30 plainclothes team members disguised as people to enter the city to buy them. They killed more than 30 Japanese troops and puppet officials who were monitoring the sale of passes, and then returned to their original defense. After this attack by the Japanese army, not only did the selling stop abruptly, but also strict defenses were deployed inside and outside the city, and pedestrians were not allowed to travel. Since Suqian fell, no less than a thousand innocent people have been killed. The people in the city are trapped at home and cannot go out. The Japanese army still takes the opportunity to inspect and loot at will, causing wealthy households to become poor, and poor households to freeze and starve to death. The situation is extremely tragic. As for the Japanese troops trapped in the city, there are currently a thousand infantry and cavalry troops and two or thirty tanks and armored vehicles. However, because the soldiers lack fighting spirit and the tanks lack gasoline, they cannot move. Gengche in Suishu was originally stationed with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers. The majority have been transferred because the strength of the Japanese army in Suicheng was empty. It is now confirmed that there are only more than 30 Japanese soldiers there. The Chinese army's Li department's guerrilla pig has led his department to suppress them. The Japanese army did not dare to resist and fled to Suqian in a panic. Li's department immediately occupied Gengche. However, because there was no need to hold it, Li's department secretly deployed in nearby villages, preparing to give the Japanese army a major blow at any time. The Japanese army's grain platform in Suqian is now located in the Cai Family Ancestral Hall. Two cannons are set up on Guokuang Mountain, one pointing east and one pointing north. The traffic line between Suqian Shunheji must pass through the ferry in the middle of the canal. Near the Sanbu Bridge, the Japanese army placed ships, seemingly for use as ferries. On the 19th, more than 100 Japanese troops marched from Gengche to Suyuncheng, but there was no other movement.

### New Fourth Route Army Political Work Stipulates Discipline for Soldiers and Holds Monthly Discussions

Continuation of the Special Correspondent Belden's Dispatch from the English American Evening News: Three regulations for soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army to obey: (1) Resist Japan to the end, do not surrender to the enemy, do not compromise; (2) Obey the orders of superiors; (3) Love the people. There are six more articles: (1) Cherish military equipment; (2) Cherish public property; (3) Be punctual; (4) Be alert and active; (5) Be neat and clean; (6) Be gentle and polite. Soldiers must also abide by ten points, all of which are followed by the former Red Army: (1) When borrowing accommodation from the people, return the door panel and straw used for bedding to their original place when leaving; (2) Wipe the floor clean; (3) Speak kindly; (4) Pay the original price for shopping; (5) Return the items borrowed from the people; (6) If you damage the borrowed items, compensate the original owner for the loss; (7) Go to the toilet in the outhouse; (8) Avoid being seen by women when bathing; (9) Carry out propaganda work at any time; (10) Do not kill prisoners indiscriminately. Political workers tell soldiers that they should automatically obey these rules. Even if there are violations, they will not be beaten or scolded. To take a violation of Article 7 as an example, the political worker will always summon the violator and tell him that he must not urinate and defecate anywhere, which is a disgrace to the army. If the soldier violates the regulations twice, the soldier's mistakes will be announced in a meeting. If he violates the regulations three times, he will be fined to clean up or detained in the prison cell for two hours. Killing a prisoner is considered an extremely serious incident. A general meeting is convened to thoroughly investigate the past behavior of the violating soldier. If it is found that his behavior is improper or his intentions are bad, he will be sentenced to death. If it is found that the soldier was moved by righteous indignation, he will be severely punished or detained in the prison cell. The soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army live in exceptionally clean places. I have seen them persuade people to clean up, talk to the people very kindly, and see how carefully they treat prisoners. All soldiers in the army, except for staff and other officers, take daily classes, in which college students, university professors, etc., give lectures on the meaning of the united front and war, the future of the anti-Japanese war, and international relations, etc., and report news at any time. Every morning when I get up, I see cooks, messengers, and orderlies sitting on the grass, listening quietly to the lectures. Officers do not attend classes, but hold monthly discussions. Each team in the army has its own education plan, and each has a "National Salvation Room," which is actually a club automatically organized by soldiers. Generally, the portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De are hung. Occasionally, the portraits of Lenin and Stalin are hung. Each room holds night meetings every night, organizes newspaper reading classes, etc., and posts wall newspapers, which are written at will by officers, soldiers, or messengers. The content is also indefinite. After dinner, each team engages in games. A crude tennis court has been opened outside the hospital. The most common one is the hide-and-seek game. The New Fourth Route Army publishes its own five-day newspaper called "Resist the Enemy", with a circulation of 1,000 copies per issue. The Second Division also publishes its own newspaper called "Fire Money", which publishes national military news and the battle reports of the Second Division, and publishes and distributes a newspaper called "National Salvation" to the people. Every Saturday and Sunday, soldiers perform songs, dances, and dramas at the rear headquarters, and at least once a month in Qianqian. Actors train themselves, and the printed scripts are also self-edited. The above-mentioned is the work of the Political Department in the army. The following will describe how the Political Department works among the people.

### Wuxi's Rice Industry in Irreversible Decline; Future Food Supply of the People Causes Serious Concern

Wuxi Correspondence. Wuxi has always been known as a silk and rice area. Every year, cocoons and silk have a huge output. Rice and grain are not produced locally, but it is a gathering and sales area. The shops in the Beihang area are lined up, the storage warehouses are dotted all over, the large grain boats in Ronghu are connected from beginning to end, the sails are like a forest, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, selling and buying, merchants gather, the rice and grain of northern Jiangsu and Jintan Yili are all concentrated in Wuxi, and the prosperity or decline of various industries also depends on the rice industry as the hub. During the anti-Japanese war, the Wuxi rice market disappeared without a trace. Last spring, a small number of rice merchants fled back and returned, each soliciting from friends and scraping together 30 to 50 yuan to 200 to 300 yuan. They built simple sheds, thatched houses, and bamboo huts in Beihang to barely shield themselves from the wind and rain and reluctantly did business. Because the equipment was simple and the expenses were saved, there was no distinction between shop owners and partners, and there was a company partnership. Profits and losses were shared, and benefits were shared equally. At that time, there were few businesses and many customers, and each had a surplus. When new wheat came on the market, those who returned to make profits came one after another, and merchants from all over came one after another. Although the market was lively, the profits were not as good as before. In August, new grain came on the market, and the new shops had slightly thicker capital, which was far from the simplicity of early spring, but there were not many merchants and the business was not very good. The huge expenses have made it difficult to support in recent months. Since the puppet business tax was levied, at the same time, freight rates increased, and the cost of merchants and vendors increased, making it unprofitable, so most of them changed their routes and went to other ports, resulting in a sharp reduction in business and a sudden decline. In less than a year, the rice industry fell sharply. The fatal reason is that in the past, customers could use rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains to mortgaged loans from banks for on-the-spot warehousing or shipping. Therefore, the grain stored in each warehouse often had as many as three or four million stones after the winter solstice. Now, the financial institutions have not yet resumed business, and there is no way to facilitate the use of funds. The current amount of rice in the warehouse is less than 100,000 stones, and the output in the four townships has decreased due to the impact of the invasion. Therefore, there are real worries about the future food supply of the people. Please try to buy them and transport them to your country in a steady stream. There is a danger of shortage of rice and grain in the spring when the new grain is not yet available. The Wuxi rice industry has declined irreversibly, and the date of its revival is unknown.

### Siming Elder, Xin Shaoru, Passes Away

Yinxian Correspondence. Xin Jiangming, also known as Xin Shaoru, also known as Zunian, a respected elder of Yinxian, started his career as a Jinshi and served as the magistrate of Qianshan, Bozhou, and Tongcheng, displaying remarkable political achievements. After the founding of the Republic of China, he returned to his hometown to take care of his parents and refused to be involved in worldly affairs. In his later years, he devoted himself to local literature, continuing the legacy of his maternal uncle, Dong Juexuan (Pei), a pioneer, and edited several volumes of Siming Qing Poetry, and also edited the Siming Series, all of which have been published to the world. His writing style was pure and profound, with a clear ambition to be indifferent. He authored "Crane Nest Elder's Literary Collection". He was harmonious but different in his daily life, and he adhered to integrity. After returning to his hometown, he repeatedly declined invitations to serve in the government, and his morality and articles became a respected figure in eastern Zhejiang. Unexpectedly, he suffered from a prolonged illness and eventually passed away in his home on the first day of the lunar calendar this year, at the age of sixty-seven. The passing of an experienced and respected figure is deeply mourned by all who hear of it.

### Shanghai's Financial Market (I): The Magnificent Stature of Shanghai's Financial Community Before the War

— Zhang Yifan

Shanghai has been a vital hub of the nation's economy and finance for nearly a century. It is not only the birthplace of all modern financial institutions but also the center of their concentration. Before the war, it possessed 32.5% of the nation's banks, with 128 branch offices densely distributed throughout the city. In total, there were as many as 181 banks (1). Among them, the 42 member banks held 45.0% of the total paid-up capital of the nation's banks (2), with total assets of 3,220 million yuan, accounting for over 44.5% of the national total (3), and cash reserves of slightly less than 652.2 million yuan, accounting for 55.0% of the national total (4), various deposits

(Note) (1) According to a survey by the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China, as of the end of June in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), there were 164 banks nationwide, with Shanghai accounting for 53. There were 1,627 branch offices nationwide, with Shanghai accounting for 128.

(2) Calculated based on the detailed operating statistics of the National Bank Yearbook for the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the total national capital was 402,695,909 yuan, with Shanghai member banks accounting for 178,561,000 yuan.

(3) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 7,275,859,0751 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 3,216,000,000 yuan.

(4) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 1,071,803,726 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 651,920,000 yuan.

(5) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 4,551,268,962 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 3,409,000,000 yuan.

totaling 3,409 million yuan, accounting for as much as 76.1% of the national total (5). Moreover, this is limited to the records of 41 member banks, excluding non-member banks such as the Central Bank.

The money exchange business was originally created in Shanghai over 200 years ago and has long been a leader among China's traditional financial institutions. Although it has been relegated to a secondary position since the rise of the banking industry, it still possesses considerable potential throughout the country. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), there were 1,189 money exchanges and silver shops nationwide, with a total capital of over 70 million yuan. Although the number of Shanghai's remittance exchanges had decreased to 55 at that time, their capital reached over 20 million yuan, accounting for nearly one-third of the national total (6).

Of the 25 Chinese-owned insurance companies nationwide, Shanghai alone accounted for 22, with capital accounting for nearly 90% (7).

Within the concession areas of Shanghai, covering over 800 square kilometers, there were 11 Chinese-owned trust companies. However,

(Note) (6) Calculated based on the National Bank Yearbook for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), excluding the Four Northeastern Provinces. (9) According to Zhang Yifan's "Dictionary of Finance" (published by World Book Company in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]).

in the nation's territory of over 11.17 million square kilometers, there were only 2 (8).

The warehouses and storage yards densely distributed along the major rivers, north and south, and along railway and highway lines were almost entirely backed by Shanghai's financial capital.

Silver companies, savings societies, real estate companies, and exchanges all had Shanghai as their sole base of operations. Even the ancient financial institutions most suited to feudal society, such as pawnshops, were most numerous in the capitalized society of Shanghai. Before the war, the major cities and towns across the country had a total of 4,632 pawnshops, with Shanghai alone possessing 660, holding capital of slightly less than 20 million yuan, while the national total was only over 140 million yuan (9).

Foreign investment in China was also mainly directed towards Shanghai. Of the total investment of 3,242.2 million US dollars in 1931, Shanghai accounted for 34.3%, totaling 1,112.2 million

With this capital strength, they built their thrones of control over China's economy. Financial capitals such as British-owned Mercantile Bank, HSBC, and Chartered Bank; French-owned Banque de l'Indochine; Dutch-owned Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij; German-owned Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; and Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi, had already come to Shanghai for activities before China even had banks. Mercantile Bank even transplanted its branch to the Bund less than ten years after Shanghai was opened as a port.

Because both Chinese and foreign capital took Shanghai as their center of operation, coupled with the vast fertile lands and abundant resources of the Yangtze River basin as their background, all of Shanghai's commercial and financial activities were able to spread their influence throughout the country and had the power to control everything. For example, the prices of various exchanges in Shanghai were the pivot points for market fluctuations across the country. The prosperity or decline of the securities market could even affect the fate of the national treasury. Even benchmark gold and cotton had the power to influence the entire Far Eastern market. Such a magnificent stature was already known to the world.

(II) "The Financial Era of an Isolated Island"—Today's Unique Characteristics of China

However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Shanghai has been the first to bear the brunt and is now reduced to an isolated island. This once prominent and invincible power has greatly diminished.

Although due to the cooperation of officials and merchants, and the proper handling of countermeasures, a collective security system has been completed; and benefiting from the special relationship of the concession areas; various financial institutions have generally been able to maintain a precarious existence, dragging on until today. Moreover, over 160 branch offices and agencies belonging to 29 institutions have moved to Shanghai from nearby war zones to resume operations. However, their so-called operations are only limited to sorting out accounts and handling the aftermath. There is no business to be done. The vast majority of the 3 million or so citizens, refugees, and quasi-refugees are hardly qualified as customers for their business. Moreover, the larger-scale Chinese financial institutions are all virtually empty shells, with no substance inside. Not only is their capital, which is like blood and essence, either swallowed up by fire or temporarily maintaining the current situation, so although they have a bright exterior, they are actually empty shells. Even if that were not the case, they only have paper claims, deceiving others and deceiving themselves. They cannot help but gaze remotely at the war-torn areas where smoke is rising everywhere, secretly shedding tears.

(Note) (11) According to the Shen Bao, November 29, 27th year of the Republic (1938).

As for foreign merchants, they now only have the qualification to prepare for claiming compensation for war losses, and no longer have the special privilege to continue their free entry and exit from China. For example, a large shipment of silver transported by the American Express Bank was intercepted by a certain party halfway and had to be hidden in Shanghai again: this is one example.

Before the war, everyone knew that Shanghai's financial market had three groups: foreign banks, Chinese banks, and money exchanges. At that time, they competed fiercely for dominance and were incompatible. Now, except for Japanese merchants, they are all in the same boat. For example, recently, foreign banks have agreed to accept the exchange clearingheads of Chinese merchants, no longer strictly distinguishing between the clearingheads of the Bund and others as in the past. Another example is that Chinese and foreign insurance merchants have now specially established a "Joint Sino-Foreign Special Affairs Committee" to jointly seek solutions to the current difficult situation. The exchange market has long been ordered to shut down, and although there is now a black market, its purpose is either to passively maintain its own wealth or to be used by others to dig its own grave. The activities of the securities black market can be said to be out of the former purpose. Illegal transactions of exorbitant foreign exchange rates have ultimately led to the depreciation of their assets valued in legal tender. The cotton prices in Tianjin and Jinan were originally controlled by the prices of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange. Other places such as Shijiazhuang had no status in the Chinese cotton market. However, today, the cotton markets in those places are not only no longer controlled by Shanghai but are also sometimes controlling Shanghai's market. Therefore, all activities on Shanghai's financial market today, at best, are only financial activities within over 800 square kilometers; they cannot be compared to the financial activities within over 11.1 million square kilometers before the war (12). Is this what is called the characteristic of today's isolated island financial market?

(Note) (12) According to the Shen Bao Yearbook: The total land area of the country is over 11.1 million square kilometers, and the Shanghai concession area is over 800 square kilometers. This number also includes the Eastern District, but in reality, the Eastern District is not a place where Shanghai's financial community can operate.

(III) The Isolated Island Finance, From Stagnation to Restlessness

Since August 13th, the activities of "isolated island finance" can be best described as speculative in early March of this year.

On the eve of the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Shanghai was in the midst of a rare speculative frenzy in recent years. The yarn and flower exchanges even prompted the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. Even Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned financiers and others to Mount Lu to inquire about everything, and used unified measures to resolve the disputes at that time. Soon after, the battles of Zhabei began, and the exchanges were ordered to close immediately. The silver and money industries were only allowed to resume operations after the Ministry of Finance announced measures to stabilize finance. The so-called measures to stabilize finance were nothing more than two: one was to restrict the withdrawal of deposits; the other was that unrestricted commercial deposits could use remittance instruments. This kind of remittance instrument could not be exchanged for legal tender and could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, but its value was exactly the same as legal tender. Its nature was different from the drafts with the nature of tokens before the war. At that time, external communication and trade were cut off by the Japanese army, and all industries and businesses were in a state of standstill. Later, due to the westward withdrawal of the National Army, it became even more frozen. (To be continued)

### Regular Guerrilla Forces Ordered to Fight, Counter-Offensive Begins on the Eastern Front: Traffic Between Jiaxing and Pinghu Cut Off, Japanese Troops in Shanghai Increase Reinforcements to Hangzhou Day by Day

The overall counter-offensive by the Chinese guerrilla forces on the Eastern Front has now begun. The Chinese guerrilla forces in western Zhejiang have launched an attack since the 5th of this month, targeting the important military strongholds of the Japanese army in Hangzhou and Jiaxing. In recent days, the Japanese army has been frequently transferring troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. At the same time, there are also battles along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The details are as follows:

Chinese Army in Western Zhejiang Ordered to Fight

The regular guerrilla forces of the Chinese Army, the 63rd Army, 63rd Division, and 61st Division, after recapturing the county seat of Haiyan and the eastern part of Haiyan County, from the northern bank of the Qiantang River in western Zhejiang to Zhapu and Kanpu south of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, have gained a base. In that area, all order has been brought back on track, and the governments of various counties have also been established to assist the army in handling political work. Recently, the Chinese army there, having received operational orders from the Third War Area Command, launched an attack and began advancing towards Jiaxing and Pinghu counties, near the railway, on the 5th of this month. On the 5th and 6th, contact with the Japanese army occurred in the Jiuli Bridge and Shili Pavilion areas between Jiaxing and Pinghu, and the more than ten-mile roadbed of the Jiaxing-Pinghu Highway in that area has been destroyed by the Chinese army, so traffic between Jiaxing and Pinghu is cut off.

Japanese Army in Pinghu Retreating

The important military strongholds of the Japanese army between Shanghai and Hangzhou are Jiaxing, because it has the Sujia Railway, which can connect with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, and on the one hand, it leads to the Pinglan Highway, which can reach Zhapu on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. In addition to the naval ships along the coast, the Japanese army in the rear of Hangzhou on the north bank of the Qiantang River regards Jiaxing as a key hub for supplies. Therefore, after the Jia-Ping Road was cut off by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in Pinghu has fallen into isolation, surrounded by the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese troops stationed in Pinghu are only 200, which is very easy for the Chinese army to annihilate. Therefore, the county seat of Pinghu may be recaptured. According to people from Pinghu who came to Shanghai, the Japanese army in Pinghu seems to be retreating on its own. The puppet organs in the city are all in a state of panic.

Japanese Army in Shanghai Opens to Hangzhou to Reinforce

The incident of the start of the battle near Hangzhou has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The Chinese army in Jiaxing, because it is to support the friendly forces there and to contain the Japanese army, has ordered the attack by the direct commander, which is actually the Chinese army's entire start to attack western Zhejiang. As for the Japanese army in Shanghai, it has sent a part of its garrison to rush to reinforce. The trains that have left Shanghai for Hangzhou in the past three days have been carrying Japanese troops, ranging from 300 to 500 people each time. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people have been dispatched, or even far more than this number.

Fierce Battles in Danyang and Changzhou

Also, along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, there are battles near Danyang and Changzhou. It is reported that Changzhou is very tense, and the Japanese army in the city has stepped up martial law. Rumors are also rife in Wuxi. The guerrilla forces north and south of the railway have already established contact, and everyone expects that a large-scale battle will break out there within days.

### Chinese Government Adjusts Wartime Finances: Rectifies Various Taxes, Promotes Direct Good Taxes, Cautiously Issues Legal Tender, Adopts Issuing Public Bonds

In order to adjust its finances during the war of resistance, the Chinese government is making every effort to rectify various taxes, promote direct good taxes, and adopt the best method of issuing public bonds. As for the issuance of legal tender, it will adhere to the cautious policy of the past. For more than a year of the war, less than 300 million yuan has been issued, and cash reserves have actually increased. The details are recorded as follows:

Rectify Taxes

(1) Stamp duty: The tax rates set in items 1 to 35 of the old stamp duty rate table shall be doubled. The original starting point for attaching stamps for goods or amounts of three yuan or more is now changed to one yuan or more. (2) Transit tax: A transit tax shall be levied on all local goods transported, loaded and unloaded, or passing through places with customs or branch cards, regardless of whether they are transported by railways, highways, ships, civilian ships, airplanes, post offices, or by transportation, in all places where there are customs. (3) Tobacco and alcohol tax: Various local wines will be subject to a surcharge of 50% of the old tax rate, and the tax on local tobacco leaves will remain the same, but the tax on local tobacco shreds will be 2 yuan and 7.5 cents per 100 pounds net weight. (4) The excessive profit tax for the extraordinary period has been levied since July 1st last year, and an inheritance tax is being prepared. (5) Unified tax: The provinces of Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, and Qinghai have been changed to areas where the unified tax is implemented. As for the goods subject to the unified tax that are transported from Shanghai, the first entry inspection agency shall verify and collect the tax.

Issue Public Bonds

(1) National Salvation Bonds: 500 million yuan, issued on September 1, 26th year of the Republic (1937), with an annual interest rate of 4%, repayable in 30 years. (2) National Defense Bonds: 500 million yuan, issued on May 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 6%, repayable in 30 years. (3) Gold Bonds: A. Customs gold notes for 100 million customs gold units. B. British gold notes for 10 million British pounds. C. US gold notes for 50 million US dollars. Issued on May 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 5%, repayable in 15 years. (4) Relief Bonds: 100 million yuan, issued on July 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 4%, repayable in 20 years. The above four types are all domestic debts issued after the War of Resistance. Among them, the purpose of the relief bonds is to relieve refugees in the war zone and has nothing to do with general fiscal expenditures. As for the foreign debts newly raised after the War of Resistance, the situation is unknown because the government has not announced it. Those that have appeared in the newspapers include Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, Sino-Czech, etc.

Carefully Issue Legal Tender

The issuance of legal tender in July of this year was 38,275,769.19 yuan by the Central Bank, 51,772,265.59 yuan by the Bank of China, 33,599,944 yuan by the Bank of Communications, and 20,843,201 yuan by the Farmers Bank of China, totaling 144,491,577.19 yuan. In June of last year, the Central Bank had 48,966,678.85 yuan, the Bank of China had 65,325,172 yuan, the Bank of Communications had 32,185,449.95 yuan, and the Farmers Bank of China had 26,221,983.35 yuan, totaling 172,699,783.35 yuan, an increase of 28,208,216 yuan.

Wartime Finance

From the above three wartime financial measures, it can be seen that the Chinese anti-war financial resources take the least from increasing taxes and take the least from issuing paper money. The biggest financial source is issuing public bonds. Moreover, historical evidence proves that issuing public bonds is the best method for raising wartime finance. Facts prove that our financial authorities do not use currency inflation as a method of raising wartime funds. Because after years of war, only more than 200 million yuan of legal tender has been issued. Moreover, the issuance of legal tender with the increase of more than 200 million yuan has accurate preparation. Because of the rise of the anti-war army, the country is unified, the circulation of legal tender is gradually promoted, and the demand for legal tender naturally increases. People in the occupied areas have risen to collect legal tender. At the same time, the government is particularly cautious about the issuance of legal tender. The issuance of cash reserves has actually increased compared to before the war.

### Family Members of Soldiers Should Be Respected: Difficulties in Household Affairs Should Be Resolved on Their Behalf

After the Military Affairs Commission issued measures to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers fighting against the enemy, with regard to the soldiers serving the country, members of society should unanimously respect their families. Local government officials should treat them with courtesy and provide diligent assistance. At this time of cold weather at the end of the year, the county magistrates, township chiefs, and baojia chiefs should personally visit or send personnel to visit each household to express condolences. For those with difficulties in household affairs, they should seek solutions on their behalf within the possible range. As for the family members of all soldiers, if they have requests for assistance, whether public or private, they can frankly state their case to the township, town, or county government. All officials and public officials should sincerely help to make arrangements, and those with larger cases can directly apply to the district office for assistance. In short, the strength may not be sufficient, but the heart must be fully devoted.

### Military Affairs Commission Circular: Public Officials Should Be Diligent and Prudent, Taking Simple Plainness as a Matter of Course: Those Who Disobey Should Be Abandoned by the People

The National Government Military Affairs Commission, at this time of serious national crisis and deep foreign invasion, in order to implement the purpose of resistance and nation-building, depends on the whole country, from top to bottom, sharing worries and encouraging each other, breaking through the difficult road ahead, and completing the achievements of nation-building. All public officials should feel ashamed and reflect on themselves, set an example, and establish a model for the people, in order to be worthy of their duties. However, recently, there are still some public officials who continue their past bad habits, extravagance and waste, and undisciplined behavior. Whether in actions or daily life, they still only seek comfort, without any awareness of self-encouragement. Not only does it give the local military and civilians a bad impression, but at this moment, the moment of life and death is at stake. Thinking of the frontline soldiers who have experienced cold and heat, fighting bloody battles in the trenches, and the suffering compatriots whose houses have been destroyed and who are displaced in ditches, one should not be able to eat or sleep in peace. How can they still have the heart to seek comfort? If they forget their responsibilities and disregard difficulties, they will have lost all shame. How can they hold public office? How can they lead the people to complete the revolution? Now, in order to rectify discipline, it is hoped that all public officials will arouse their conscience, deeply reflect on themselves, and take enduring hardship and simple plainness as a matter of course. All aspects of life must follow the principle of simplicity and plainness. If there are still those who do not practice what they preach or who disobey, once discovered, in addition to being dealt with according to the circumstances, the facts shall be made public to be abandoned by the people, and to serve as a warning to those who disregard danger and have no spirit.

### Economic Aggression is Vicious: Factories in War Zones are Occupied: Silk Factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang are All Operated by Japanese Merchants: Large-Scale Dumping of Daily Necessities in War Zones

After the "August 13th" war broke out, China's industrial factories were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, causing the most severe damage. Up to now, most have not been able to resume operations. The Japanese side previously used economic cooperation as an excuse to attempt to take over Chinese silk factories and control them, which was unanimously rejected by all factories. However, the Japanese side's attempts did not stop because of this. Recently, the Japanese side has seized all large and small factory foundations, properties, and production machinery in the war zones of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, taking them for their own use. For example, in Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang and other places,

Silk Factories Are All Operated by Japanese Merchants

Recruiting male and female workers and starting work as usual. Under the trampling of iron hooves, the treatment is extremely harsh. All the goods produced are dumped in large quantities in various regions of central China. In addition, there are more small factories for daily handicrafts that have been forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, such as towels, soap, candles, matches, and tobacco. The output in the war zone is very large. Among them, those who still use the original factory name to produce their products are euphemistically called Sino-Japanese joint ventures. In reality, the power is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. It can be seen that Japan's policy of

Economic Aggression is Vicious

In one instance, according to investigators who have been to the war zone, there are a total of six silk factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang that have been forcibly occupied and started by the Japanese, with more than 10,000 workers. The seized foundations and properties are worth 30 million yuan in national currency. In Suzhou alone, there are no less than 30 small factories that have been robbed and newly established by the Japanese, specializing in the production of daily necessities, which are dumped everywhere. This method of sucking blood and marrow by the Japanese side not only exposes the true face of its aggressors, but also proves that its domestic economy is at the end of its rope and it has to adopt this conspiracy to prolong its last fate.

### Jewish Refugees Temporarily Residing in Shanghai: Everyone is Now Working Hard to Learn English to Gain a Foothold in the Far East

The Shanghai Times reports that over the past few months, the number of Jewish refugees arriving in Shanghai has reached 1,500. They are all taken care of by three organizations, providing food, lodging, and pocket money, and inviting medical care and teachers to teach English. One of the three organizations is the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Assistance Committee, which is responsible for most economic matters, while the actual relief work is handled by the German-Austrian Jewish Relief Association or the International Committee for the Relief of European Refugees. The former only

Relieves Jews, but the scope is very broad. The latter provides relief to any refugees who have fled from European dictatorships. However, the relief work for Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai is mostly handled by the German-Austrian Jewish Relief Association. The association also communicates daily with European relief organizations via telegram. For example, a certain relief organization in Singapore is entrusted by the association to take care of any refugees passing by on ships and telegraph the number of refugees coming to Shanghai to the association for preparation. When the refugees arrive in Shanghai, the association

Rents Private Houses to Settle Some Refugees, and Provides Food Expenses. However, this method is too wasteful, so the association would rather adopt a system of communal living and eating. For example, when Jewish refugees currently living in the Anpengkemen Building (transliteration) have meals, they all go to the Sichuan Road YMCA to dine. However, the association hopes to provide meals on its own, which is more economical. Most of the Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai are middle-class, and very few can speak English, which is a major setback. Therefore, the Shanghai Jewish Youth Federation has now been organized to teach English. The federation also has a very important

Job Placement Department, which compiles detailed statistics on the talents of immigrants. However, so far, only about 100 Jewish refugees have been introduced to jobs. The association expresses great sympathy for the Municipal Council's efforts to limit the number of immigrants, because Shanghai cannot accommodate many refugees at present. However, if refugees have already started to come to Shanghai, they will do their best to provide relief. According to the opinion of the association's personnel, after the war stops, immigrants should be given a foothold in the Far East, and Shanghai is only a temporary resting place for them.

### Overseas Branches of the Bank of Communications Established One After Another

In order to invigorate the finance of the southwestern provinces, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have added more than 40 branches in the major ports of the southwest, actively handling industrial, commercial and rural loans, which has been quite successful. In order to adapt to the development of foreign trade, the branches established by the Bank of China in Rangoon, British Burma, and Batavia, Dutch East Indies, have started operations. At the same time, the Bank of Communications has also decided to establish a branch in Manila, Philippines. Li Daonan, the president of the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong, has gone to prepare for it and is ready. According to news from the banking community in this city, the two branches of the Bank of China can be established within the month. The Philippine branch of the Bank of Communications is waiting for Qian Xinzhi, the chairman of the bank, to return to Hong Kong from Chongqing to approve the plan, which can be realized before the spring of this year. The business of each branch focuses on remittances from overseas Chinese and the development of foreign trade of domestic products, and the future is very promising.

### Extension of Voucher Contract Approved by Banks

The Yinqian Liangye Gonghui (Silver and Money Trade Association) received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the voucher contracts for various banks and firms to receive legal tender from the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank are tentatively extended for another year based on the original amount. However, if the situation stabilizes and the bond market becomes stable during this one-year period, the issuing bank may notify the voucher-receiving bank to terminate the contract two months in advance. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the Yinqian industry yesterday and learned that the two industry associations have recorded the Ministry's original telegram regarding the approval of the one-year extension of the voucher contract and ordered member banks and firms to comply. It is reported that various banks and firms expressed gratitude to the government for understanding the difficulties of businesses and approving the one-year extension.

### Government Promotes Rural Handicraft Industry Establishes Five Major Guidelines Mobilizes Vast Rural Population to Strengthen Economic Foundation for Resistance

The National Government is making every effort to operate general industrial construction during the war of resistance. In addition to important industries such as sericulture, chemicals, water and electricity, and textiles, China's rural handicraft industry has unique characteristics. If guidance and improvement can be provided, production can be increased to supplement the shortcomings of the machine industry. Currently, the government has decided to actively proceed with the following guidelines to promote the rural handicraft industry: First, actively improve technology to increase production and meet the needs of rural areas during the war of resistance. Second, establish small-scale iron and woodworking factories in various county towns to supply various production tools. Third, the Farmer's Bank should provide as many loans as possible for the rural handicraft industry to facilitate development. Fourth, support and organize rural handicraft cooperatives to adjust production and sales. Fifth, rural handicraft production is simple, and the government has decided to mobilize the vast rural population to participate in production to strengthen the economic foundation for resistance and national construction.

### Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai Municipal Council Not Restricting Newspaper Reports Completely Groundless Only Quite Anxious About This Matter

The Continental Press reported that news from Japan stated that the

Shanghai Municipal Council of the International

Settlement had requested the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai to

take certain measures to prevent Jewish

immigrants from flocking into the International Settlement. Yesterday (7th),

a spokesman for the Municipal Council denied this. According to

this news, it was published in the

English-language Japan Times published in Tokyo on January 1st. The newspaper

also commented that Japan is now at war with China

and of course does not want to see

political refugees

flocking into Japan,

"Manchukuo,"

or North China and Central China. Japan does not want to be

used by Britain in the Far East as a tool

for anti-Semitic activities, etc. According to reports yesterday, this news

is absolutely groundless. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council

attaches great importance to the current influx of German immigrants

into the International Settlement, but the Council

has only notified the consular corps of the possibility of restrictions. This article in the Japan Times

shows that the Municipal Council's news about preventing immigrants from continuing to come to Shanghai

is not new, but the previous news

was also groundless.

The Municipal Council

is naturally anxious about the excessive exaggeration of the

foreign immigrant problem in Shanghai, which makes it impossible to deal with, but there is

nothing that can be done at the moment.

The number of German exiles coming to Shanghai

has reached about 1,500. It is expected that the Victoria,

a ship sailing from Italy to Shanghai, will

arrive on the 15th of this month, and will also bring

Jewish refugees. According to a spokesman for the Foreign Refugee Relief

Association, when talking to reporters about the issue

of these immigrants, he said that raising 90,000 yuan

for living expenses is indeed

not a problem for Shanghai alone, and providing this money

is the actual responsibility of foreign

governments. The spokesman also said that the association

is already working on getting this funding.

At the same time, it was learned that Shanghai is

really powerless to prevent the continued influx of

immigrant groups. Because all parties in Shanghai have no right to order immigrants to leave Shanghai.

Jews fleeing the anti-Jewish wave in Germany, if any

control is to be exercised over the actions of these people,

then it should be done by the country

where these immigrants boarded the ship.

Most of the places where immigrants boarded the ship

are in Italy. If the Italian government wants to

cooperate in handling this matter, then the domestic offices

of Italian shipping companies can refuse

to sell tickets to immigrants who designate

Shanghai as their destination. If other countries also cooperate,

the same control can be implemented. However, we have

attempted to obtain such cooperation and control, but

Shanghai has not yet been informed.

### Japanese Buses Operating Municipal Council Protests Conflict with Concession Rights

Trams, buses, etc. operating in Hongkou and Yangshupu have always been granted concessions by the Municipal Council

to the China General Omnibus Company and the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company.

Vehicles of the two companies stopped running on the roads north of the Suzhou River

after the war, and have not resumed operations to this day. However, buses transported by the Japanese army have already been put into operation in Hongkou.

The Municipal Council believes that this move clearly conflicts with the concession granted to the China General Omnibus Company,

and has therefore protested to the Japanese side.

### Discussion on Establishing Shelters to Accommodate Street Refugees There Are Over 10,000 Street Refugees Establishing Shelters to Accommodate Them Cannot Be Delayed Any Further

Liu Zhongying, Cao Zhigong, and Li Futian, members of the Citizens' Group Vegetable Procurement Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, jointly proposed to the association yesterday, stating: We hereby inform you that since the organization of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association by various public organizations, charities, and Chinese and foreign people, all measures have become increasingly perfect. At the same time, fundraising has also been gradually grasped due to the widespread promotion by various industries and sectors. This is truly a blessing for the 100,000 refugees in the resettlement camps. However, at this time of severe winter, street refugees are unable to eat when hungry and unable to clothe themselves when cold. Their situation is even more miserable than that of the refugees in the resettlement camps. According to the survey and statistics published by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement on methods of soliciting donations for refugees, the owners of various dance halls have unanimously expressed their support for the association's good intentions and are willing to assist in promoting them. The method is roughly to add 10% to all catering bills as refugee donations. In addition, the dance girls have also organized a fundraising team to carry out fundraising. It is reported that the above method will be discussed and decided at the second meeting on the 10th of this month, and fundraising committee members and heads of various groups will be appointed to start work immediately.

### Fundraising Achievements of Amateur Opera Group

The Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Opera Group

of the Shanghai Refugee Relief

Association, since hiring

Jin Tingsun and Yuan Ludeng as chairman and vice-chairman respectively,

and hiring members of various groups and heads of solicitation teams,

has been making every effort to promote fundraising work in recent days.

The relief donations raised have reached more than 9,000 yuan. Also, on the 9th of this month,

it will be the 60th anniversary of the death of Mr. Jiang Fuxiang's late mother in Shanghai. The group specially initiated a toast, and

all the congratulatory gifts will be donated in full. Members of the group will also participate in performing at a hall show.

### Kun Opera Fundraising Efforts Continue

Comrades from the

Shanghai Gengchun She

Kun Opera Troupe,

Yin Zhenxian, Xu

Lingyun, Hua Xiaowei,

Guan Ji'an, etc., performed

an obligatory Kun Opera performance at the Carlton Grand Theater

on the 6th, and after deducting miscellaneous expenses,

there was a surplus of more than 600 yuan in national currency, which was sent to

the Refugee Relief Association for the purpose of providing relief to refugees.

The members of the troupe decided to stage another Kun Opera performance in the near future, but the performance date

has not been determined. The plays performed are all the members' signature plays.

There were a total of 7,790 refugees living in the alleyways and some vacant houses in the International Settlement

in November of last year. Counting the legal concessions,

there should be more than 10,000 people. The suffering of these more than 10,000 refugees wandering the streets is something

we should try to help with from a humanitarian and municipal perspective.

In our opinion, the best way to treat the symptoms is to set up several shelters

in the two concessions to accommodate these street refugees.

If this matter can be resolved and carried out, the concession authorities will also be happy to support it. As this matter concerns

relief and public safety, we have specially prepared this letter as a suggestion.

We dare to ask for a public decision to be implemented, and we are extremely eager.

### Principles for Levy Donations from Dance Halls Agreed Upon

The Modern News Agency reports that since the outbreak of

the war, refugees

from the war zones have been fleeing

to Shanghai. Although various charities have tried to send them back,

the number of refugees stranded in the concession areas and the Nanshi refugee area

still amounts to 100,000 to this day. The monthly cost of living is more than 300,000 yuan.

Leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, in order to care for the refugees and coordinate relief efforts,

organized the Refugee Relief Association. Since its establishment, various industries have responded enthusiastically,

and they have all actively paid the disaster relief donations. The hotel and restaurant industry and various entertainment venues

have all added refugee donations, and customers are also happy to pay.

Now, the association believes that the dance hall industry alone is lacking, and various parties

believe that it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, on the 6th of this month, all dance hall managers in the city were convened

to discuss adding

### Part of Punan Ferry Open

Due to the outbreak of guerrilla warfare there, all ferries in Punan

were closed and ships were suspended.

Recently, the situation has eased slightly, and some of the ferries

have been opened. Ferries have resumed operation at Wangjiadu,

Zhagang, and Dujiaxing, etc. However, inspections at the ferry are very strict, and there are few passengers.

Ferries at Deshenggang, Yangsiqiao, and Lutanmiao, etc. are still closed, and ships have not resumed operation.

### Gaoqiao Town Office Urges Burial of Exposed Corpses and Coffins

Since the start of the war in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, the local area has been peaceful due to the lack of military relations.

Many residents from nearby cities and villages have moved there to avoid the war.

The number of deaths has also been quite high. The corpses and coffins of refugees from other provinces are piled up behind the Hongmiao Temple in the west of the town and in various tomb sites in the east of the town.

Unscrupulous people even steal coffin boards to sell as fuel, resulting in exposed corpses

being dragged and devoured by wild dogs, and their remains scattered in the fields, which is a tragic sight that cannot be tolerated.

The town office, due to concerns about sanitation, issued a notice yesterday urging relocation and burial, with a deadline of one week.

After the deadline, workers will be hired to bury them all in order to tidy up the city and emphasize morality.

### Foreigner from Chongqing Talks About Wang Jingwei's Quiet Departure from the Country Took a Commercial Plane from Chongqing Passengers on the Same Plane Were Unaware Chen Gongbo Sent a Letter to Zhang Qun Saying He Was Going to Yunnan to Give a Speech

Yesterday, a foreigner who had just arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing said that the details of Wang Jingwei's departure from Chongqing

were mostly not detailed in telegrams. According to him, when he left Sichuan for Yunnan, he took a commercial plane.

Among the passengers on the same plane were Gong Zhimu, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education, and Fu Sinian and other six people from the education sector.

Gong and others did not initially know that Wang was preparing to leave the country due to illness. Wang only stayed briefly in Hanoi

and then flew to Hanoi. Zhou Fohai, former Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Senator Tao Xisheng also went to Hanoi to meet him.

It is now reported that Zhou and Tao are still living with Wang. Before Chen Gongbo, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, left Chongqing, he only sent letters to Zhang Qun and Ye Chucang, saying that

he planned to go to Yunnan to give a speech and would return to Chongqing after staying for a week. It is now known that Chen Gongbo has transferred from Hanoi to

Hong Kong.

### Economic Establishment of Large-Scale Iron Smelting Plant Purchase of High-Temperature Equipment for Active Smelting Ten Tons of Refined Iron Per Day Iron Prices Will Not Rise Again

Iron is the main raw material for light and heavy industry.

Although China produces abundant iron, the output of refined iron

has not been widely supplied

because there is still no high-temperature iron smelting furnace.

Before the fall of Hankou, the demand for pig iron in various places

was mostly supplied by the Liuhegou Pig Iron Company in Hankou.

Since the abandonment of Wuhan, the source of pig iron

has suddenly become scarce, so iron

prices have soared, rising from more than 300

yuan per ton to more than 700 yuan per ton. It is learned that the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

has now established an iron smelting plant in Sichuan and purchased

a high-temperature smelting furnace capable of smelting ten tons per day.

Before the abandonment of Wuhan, it had tried

to transport out more than 1,000 tons of pig iron. At the same time,

it is actively planning to develop iron mines. Therefore,

there is no need to worry about the shortage of refined iron required by the people in the future,

and iron prices may not rise again.

### Eastern Zhejiang Officially Opens to Navigation Not Far Away Navigation Measures Will Be Promulgated Soon Passenger Transport Can Be Expected to Be Implemented

It is now reported that the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group,

in order to effectively rectify shipping and transportation in eastern Zhejiang,

convened relevant groups to hold a shipping affairs

conference. After the opening, the authorities have implemented the decisions of the conference

one after another. According to news from the shipping industry, the formal navigation measures for eastern Zhejiang,

in addition to adopting the opinions of various parties and the suggestions

of Zhang Guiling, Deputy Commander of the Yongfang Defense, were discussed in detail

and will be promulgated and implemented soon. After the suspension of direct shipping and combined bay shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, goods

between Shanghai and Ningbo have been transported by the shipping industry through combined transport of goods

to adjust the situation. Combined passenger transport has not been implemented due to the failure of

flights between Shanghai, Taiwan, and Ningbo to connect with each other. The shipping industry is now actively adjusting

flights, so combined passenger transport can be expected to be realized in the shortest time.

### Passport Issuance Requires Certification from Institutions

After the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai took over the issuance of passports, the procedures for overseas Chinese to obtain passports for going abroad are extremely simple.

As long as the form is filled out in detail and there is no time-consuming investigation,

the passport can be processed within four to seven days. If

the date of departure by car or boat is filled out, it can be processed as soon as possible. However, the important condition is the guarantee. According to the regulations of the ministry, the qualification for the guarantee,

if they are government agency personnel, must have an official letter from the agency. If they are people from the four villages, they must have an official letter from the district village office. If they are Hong Kong people,

they must have a guarantee from a chamber of commerce, local chamber of commerce, bank, limited company, lawyer, or a person of good reputation.

Then it can be quickly issued. Most of the delays are due to the issue of guarantee qualifications,

not due to delays in the procedures of the person handling the matter. Most of the passports issued by the office

are taken to Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces via Guangzhou Bay.

As for the French consulate, in order to facilitate travelers, travelers going to or through Vietnam can apply to the consulate for a passport.

However, recently, the Chinese government has set up a passport issuance office in Hong Kong, so there is no need to do this. Therefore, the consulate has also recently announced

the suspension of issuance. Anyone who wants to go to or through Vietnam to the mainland of China must have a Chinese passport

before they can request a visa from the consulate.

### After the Promulgation of the Public Treasury Law Trial Implementation from July Implementation in January Next Year

After the National Government promulgated the Public Treasury Law on June 9 last year, it stipulated that the public treasuries of all levels of government in the Republic of China and the handling of their affairs shall be

handled in accordance with this law. The organs that manage cash, bills, securities, and other property for the government are called

public treasuries. The public treasury of the central government is called the national treasury,

with the Ministry of Finance as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). The public treasury of the provincial government is called the provincial treasury,

with the Department of Finance as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). The public treasury of the municipal government is called the municipal treasury,

and the public treasury of the county government is called the county treasury, each with its

Finance Bureau as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). If there is no Finance

Bureau, the municipal or county government is the主管機關(chief administrative organ). As for the date and

region of implementation of the law, it will be determined by order. It is reported that in order to implement the

unified collection and payment of the whole country and reorganize finances, it has been decided to trial implement the Public Treasury Law from July 1 to the end of December

this year, and formally implement it from New Year's Day next year.

### Japanese Military Police Transferred Gambling Dens Suffer Immensely Pudong Yongli Club Closed After Opening for Only One Day

The Xiaochu unit of the Japanese military police in Yangjiazai, Pudong,

was completely transferred to another location the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another batch of new military police was transferred in,

but the number was smaller than before, only more than 20 people, taking over the duties of the former Xiaochu

unit. However, the Pudong gambling den, the Fali Club, which had just opened for the first day

the day before yesterday, suffered a major blow. On the first day of business, it made a profit of 60 yuan,

paid 40 yuan to someone, and the remaining 20 yuan was not enough to cover the day's expenses, resulting in a heavy loss.

It was forced to close yesterday. It is said that although the gambling den obtained permission from the old military police of the Japanese side,

the new military police cannot recognize it. Therefore, some ronin bosses felt extremely embarrassed.

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a report from the Kunming Post Office that due to the blockage of postal routes and inconvenience of transportation in the area,

parcels sent to various places are piled up like mountains. All large parcels sent to the area will be temporarily suspended for acceptance from today.

The Shanghai Postal Administration's large parcel dispatch office issued a notice stating, "From today, parcels sent to Kunming in this area,

except for personal and medicine parcels, will be temporarily suspended for acceptance. It is also learned that large medicine parcels transferred from Beihai to Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and the two Guang provinces have not resumed acceptance.

### US Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai Anchored for Ten Days to Return Home

The Continental Press reported that the US Navy transport ship Henderson arrived in Shanghai yesterday (6th) morning after being anchored in Qinhuangdao for several days and unloading supplies for the US Marine Corps stationed in China.

It plans to be anchored for ten days and is scheduled to sail to San Francisco on the 16th of this month. It is reported that 50 sailors from the US Pacific Fleet and

the Asian Fleet will board the ship to return home. The ship brought 90 replacement soldiers when it sailed to the Far East, and in addition to the US sailors, 100

US Marines will also board the ship to return home. According to the Henderson, it was delayed

by 24 hours due to bad weather and only arrived in Shanghai on December 31. After the soldiers who came to serve in the Fourth Marine Corps disembarked, the

ship set sail north to Qinhuangdao and returned south to Shanghai on January 3.

### Foreign Mail to China Rerouted Through Fujian Province To Avoid Illegal Inspection by the Shanghai Bureau Southwest Mail Rerouted Through Vietnam

Mail from various foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui,

Jiangxi, and other provinces used to be transshipped through the Shanghai Postal

Administration. According to a quick report from the Quick News Agency, the Postal

Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in order to prevent foreign mail

to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other three provinces from being inspected

by the so-called "inspectors" dispatched by Japan through Shanghai transshipment,

notified the postal authorities of various countries

that foreign mail to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi,

and other provinces would no longer be transshipped through Shanghai, but would be transshipped through Fujian Province to avoid inspection.

This measure has been implemented recently.

As for mail from foreign countries to the southwestern provinces, it has also been rerouted through Annan and Burma due to the fall of Guangzhou.

### Price Increase in the Crate Industry

The raw materials used by the crate industry in this city for making crates have always been

construction boards (produced in Fujian) and Wenzhou Tanhu boards. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, transportation has been disrupted.

The original price of construction boards was 4 yuan and 2 jiao per zhang, and the price of Wenzhou Tanhu boards was 2 yuan and 8 jiao. By the end of last year, the price had actually risen

to 8 yuan per zhang for construction boards and 5 yuan and several jiao per zhang for Tanhu boards. Therefore, the industry has been greatly affected.

It has already convened the industry to hold a meeting and decided to implement a price increase on the 15th of this month

to maintain capital. It has also agreed to unify prices and notify the industry to comply.

### Tongren Hospital Social Services Department: Seeking Parents to Claim Child Left at Hospital; Warning to the Child's Parents to Quickly Reclaim Their Child

The Pediatrics Department of Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road in this city treated a sick child named Chen Quanfu, only one year old, on November 19th of last year. At that time, the parents left the sick child at the hospital for treatment, claiming to reside in a bungalow at Kangjia Bridge, Caojiadu. They said they would reclaim the child upon recovery. However, since being admitted, it has been over a month and a half. Although the child has long recovered, the parents have not come to visit and have since disappeared. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital sent personnel to Kangjia Bridge, Caojiadu, for investigation, but the address turned out to be fictitious, and the investigation yielded no results. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital hereby publishes this notice, warning the parents of Chen Quanfu to quickly reclaim their child. Medical expenses will not be an issue. If the parents ignore this notice and fail to reclaim their child within one week from the date of publication, their intention to abandon the child will be apparent. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital will have no choice but to arrange for the child's care in the best possible way. It is hoped that the parents will consider this carefully and not regret it in the future.

The Golden Gate International Exposition in the United States is scheduled to open on February 18th. Due to the ongoing war of resistance, the Chinese government has not officially sent personnel to participate. However, overseas Chinese in the Americas, in conjunction with well-known manufacturers from Hong Kong and Shanghai, are participating under the name of Chinese merchants. They are preparing the "Chinese Merchants Exhibition Hall" at the exposition and have specially appointed Director Kuang Guangyin to return to China to collect items for participation. It is learned that Mr. Kuang has largely completed the collection of items for the exposition. In South China, the items include Guangdong embroidery, antiques, calligraphy, and other valuable handicrafts. There will also be golden dragons, silver dragons, lion dances, Cantonese opera, and other celebratory performances. In Shanghai, Mr. Lu [blank] is responsible for the collection, and the items will soon be ready for shipment to Hong Kong and then to the United States. The first batch of items from South China departed on December 30th of last year, and the second batch was shipped on the 4th of this month. The third batch of collected items will be shipped on the 13th. In the near future, the collection will be further expanded and scoured. Overseas Chinese in the Americas have also appointed Dr. Feng Jintang (transliteration) to return to China to select beautiful women to participate in managing the items. Mr. Chen Yingsun (transliteration), a well-known porcelain merchant from Shanghai, will also travel to San Francisco at the end of the month to participate.

### Shanghai Municipal Council: 1938 Administrative Review (Continued): Bund Wharf

The Board of Directors and the Works Committee of this Council discussed the fees for using the Bund pontoon wharf, and a charging scheme was approved for trial implementation until the end of June. As the original scheme was found to be unsuitable, it was resolved to revise and amend it, with the amended scheme coming into effect on July 1st. A charging office was set up on the Bund.

### Factory Management

In the second half of last year, various industries in this city gradually showed signs of recovery. Many new factories were established in the western district. The Industrial Section of this Council took this opportunity to firmly instruct factory owners to comply with the principles set by this Council and, where possible, to provide dormitories for workers. The construction and installation of boilers were carefully monitored by this Council. Several sessions of the boiler operator training course were held with good results. Ms. Xing De, Director of the Industrial Section, participated in the International Labour Conference in Geneva during her leave last year and visited the representatives attending the conference and the staff of the International Labour Office, reporting on this Council's efforts to improve factory conditions in the past five years.

### Mui Tsai Problem

In August last year, this Council received a report from the League of Nations Committee of Experts on Slavery, forwarded by the Senior Consul. The Committee expressed its appreciation for this Council's work on the mui tsai problem. Ms. Xing De, Director of the Industrial Section of this Council, visited Geneva, London, and Ottawa to discuss the mui tsai issue with experts studying social problems. A detailed account of this matter is included in the Industrial Section's report.

### War Service Medal

The awarding rules were drafted by a special committee during the year before last. The recipients are limited to those who were in uniform and served during the war.

### Library

As the Nanjing Road Public Library building was small and had various shortcomings, this Council decided to move the library to a new location on Beijing Road. The new premises are more spacious, and the lighting and ventilation are better than the old location. The Library Committee appointed members to inspect the interior of the library and report their opinions from time to time.

### Refugee Lottery

At the end of May last year, French nationals who were issuing refugee charity lottery tickets requested permission from this Council to sell the tickets within the International Settlement. This Council has a policy of prohibiting the issuance of lottery tickets, but due to the special circumstances of the issuance of these charity lottery tickets, permission was granted to sell them within the International Settlement, provided that the sales method was satisfactory to this Council.

### Jing'an Temple Fair

The temple fair held near Jing'an Temple every year was not allowed to be held last year due to the tense situation. Later, out of consideration for the difficulties faced by merchants, designated private gardens were allowed to set up stalls and conduct business.

### British Military Cemetery

There is a British military cemetery on Minguo Road in the southern city, where British soldiers who died in the Taiping Rebellion are buried. The cemetery has been in disrepair for many years, and the cemetery caretaker was forced to leave during the war in the southern city in the year before last. Therefore, this Council, the British Consul in Shanghai, and the British military authorities agreed to relocate the remains in the cemetery to the Hongqiao Cemetery.

### Band

### Rongchang Gambling Den Bombing: Three Gamblers Injured

At 4:35 PM yesterday, a bomb was planted in the Rongchang Club gambling den at No. 8 Yifeng Lane, the end of Jessfield Road in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area. The bomb exploded, sending shrapnel flying, injuring three gamblers who were in the immediate vicinity. They were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. An investigation revealed that the three injured were Zhu Jiazhen, 38, from Pudong, residing at No. 50 Hongshou Lane, Wenzhou Road, injured in the left foot; Feng Fu, 33, from Guangdong, residing at No. 23 Tongxing Lane, Sima Road, injured in the leg; and Wang Shengkang, 37, from Ningbo, residing at No. 13 Hexing Lane, Avenue Edward VII, injured in the leg.

### Two Robbery Cases

At around 9:30 PM last night, several men suddenly broke into Room 403 on the fourth floor of the New Asia Hotel on Guizhou Road. They questioned the guest in a peculiar manner, asking if his exit permit was signed there. The guest, finding the situation strange and completely fabricated, was about to demand an explanation when the men pulled out handguns, threatening him to remain silent. They then began to search the room, and it was only then that the guest realized he was being robbed. Helpless, he allowed the robbers to do as they pleased. As a result, 157 yuan in cash was stolen. By the time he regained his freedom and attempted to pursue the robbers, it was too late. He immediately reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and gave chase separately. At No. 632 Avenue Edward VII, three robbers suddenly arrived to commit robbery at around 6:30 PM yesterday evening. Two robbers, armed with guns, were responsible for keeping watch and acting as lookouts, while the unarmed robber entered the house and looted valuables, including jewelry and cash, worth over 280 yuan, before fleeing in different directions. The victim was unable to pursue them and immediately reported the loss to the police station in charge, requesting them to investigate.

### Puppet Organizations Set Up Checkpoints: Self-Collected and Self-Used; So-Called Administrative Sovereignty Still Belongs to the Pacification Team

Although the puppet organizations in the occupied areas of this city have a so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality," their administration is still largely characterized by abnormal fragmentation, especially in the southern city and the western district. Although the police authority once changed the "mobile police" run by the former "Autonomous Association" into "Great Road Police," a special detective team was still established under the auspices of the Pacification Team to usurp the authority of the puppet police bureau. Regarding taxes, the puppet "Administrative Office," a substitute for the southern city "Autonomous Association," has set up checkpoints at Minguo Road, Xinkai River, South Wharf, Bund, Xietu Road, and Pingyin Bridge, and has also dispatched more than 20 mobile tax collectors. In the western district, the "Maintenance Association" has set up checkpoints at Caohejing, Hongqiao Road, Beixinjing, Fahua, and Yujidun. All the revenue collected is used by themselves and not reported. Special agents are stationed in the northern city, while puppet "Self-Defense Corps" are stationed in the western district, all with guns and ranks. Fu Xiaoan issued an order some time ago to unify the authority and merge the operations in order to weaken the abuse of power by all parties, placing the puppet "Administrative Director" and others in a position of idleness similar to that of a former district chief. However, the southern city and the western district, relying on external support, have ignored the order. It is unknown how this will be resolved.

### Liuhe Yanglinkou: Pirates Attempt to Rob Merchant Ships; Li Bei and Heng Xi Escape Alertly; Pirate Ship Opens Fire, Killing One Passenger and Injuring Two

At around 4:30 PM yesterday, as the foreign merchant ship Li Bei was entering the river mouth at Yanglinkou outside Liuhe, it was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship, which ordered it to stop. The captain of the ship, realizing that they had encountered pirates, was exceptionally alert and immediately accelerated, pushing the ship forward to escape. The pirate ship chased after it but was unable to catch up and fired a volley of shots as a warning. As bullets flew everywhere, one bullet struck Zhao Xian'gen (29 years old, from Jiangbei), a passenger on the ship, in the chest. Blood gushed out, and he was barely breathing. Shortly thereafter, the Heng Xi also passed through the area and was also fired upon by the pirate ship. Passengers Xu Haicai (15 years old) was hit in the left foot by a stray bullet, and Lou Renhua (25 years old) was shot through the right leg, fortunately not in a vital area. Both ships eventually escaped and arrived safely in Shanghai, both at around 12:00 AM. The injured were taken to Renji Hospital. However, Zhao Xian'gen's injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The remaining injured were hospitalized for treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Central Police Department for investigation.

### Southern City Puppet "Court" Has No Development; Tu Fu Requests Abolition of the Puppet "Judicial Office" Due to Internal Strife Over Personnel Matters

Since the puppet "Local Court" in the southern city was established with Tu Fu as the puppet president and Kang Handong as the puppet "Chief Prosecutor," it was expected that the income from litigation fees would be used to cover expenses. However, since the opening, not even a single petition form (50 cents each) has been sold, so there has been no case at all. This is because the puppet "Judicial Office" of the puppet "Municipal Government" in Pudong still exists. The southern city "Court" is not connected to the puppet "Municipal Government," resulting in no development at all. Tu Fu and others are extremely anxious and have petitioned the puppet "Ministry of Justice" to handle the matter. It is said that after the puppet "Ministry of Justice" contacted the puppet "Executive Yuan," a "directive" was issued to the puppet "Municipal Government" to abolish the puppet "Judicial Office" by the end of this month. However, the puppet "Court" does not need the personnel of the puppet "Judicial Office," resulting in major internal strife.

The puppet "Reformed Government's" Ministry of Justice has been promoting the restoration of the Shanghai "Local Court" for a long time, but it has not yet materialized. It has now been found that the buildings of the Shanghai Local Court on Chezhan Road in the western district, except for most of the buildings that were destroyed by fire, the detention center, gate, and buildings in the back are still relatively intact. Yesterday, someone passing through Chezhan Road noticed a new wooden sign hanging next to the iron gate of the detention center, about four to five feet high and seven to eight feet wide, with the white characters "Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court Detention Center" written on a black background. It seemed newly written. The iron gate was half-open, and five or six Chinese people wearing long robes and felt hats were sitting on the porch, looking very bored.

### Puppet "Municipal Government" Advisory Group Established to Control Various Puppets

After the former Japanese Nishimura Guidance Group of the puppet "Municipal Government" was disbanded due to dishonorable incidents, the Japanese are now using an "advisory" system for all guidance matters, which is essentially the same thing under a different name. They are still manipulating the puppet "Municipal Government" behind the scenes. It is learned that the new advisory group has been established. In terms of personnel, in addition to adding some new members, some old members have also been reappointed. For example, Nishida Katsunori, an advisor to the puppet "Municipal Government," was originally a guidance officer in the compilation office of the puppet "Municipal Government" under the Nishimura Guidance Group and has a close relationship with Su Xiwu, the puppet "Secretary-General," making him a headache for Fu Xiaoan. Kita Shoichi, advisor to the puppet "Finance Bureau," was originally a guidance officer in the former "Finance Bureau" and is also Su Xiwu's old superior. Miyanari Hoshi, advisor to the puppet "Education Bureau," was a guidance officer in the education section of the former puppet "Governor's Office." Miyazaki Sadayuki, advisor to the puppet "Social Affairs Bureau," originally belonged to the former puppet "Nanshi District Office" as a guidance officer. Kusano Hideyuki, advisor to the puppet "Youth Corps," originally belonged to the former Kawakawa puppet "District Office" as a guidance officer. These people are experienced and know the ropes well, making it easy for them to control the various puppets. Therefore, it is just a dream for Fu Xiaoan and others to try to seize the opportunity to gain some freedom of action.

### Dongshi of the Houren Shantang in the Yinxiang District Sues for Century-Old Accounts, Alleging Embezzlement by Former Dongshi; The Defendant Is Ordered to Respond in Detail Before Further Investigation

Shen Jingfu, Chairman of the Houren Shantang in the Yinxiang District of Shanghai, recently hired attorney Xu Jiashi to criminally sue former Chairman Wang Zengyou, Zhou Wenzhi, and Dongshi Wang Juchuan and Lu Jingtang for allegedly embezzling more than nine mu of land, valued at tens of thousands of gold, donated by various philanthropists to the Shantang in the past. Huang Risheng of the Third Criminal Court continued the hearing this morning. The plaintiff's attorney, Xu Jiashi, submitted the inspection forms copied by both parties during the adjournment, stating that according to the plaintiff Shen Jingfu's form, there were two plots of land, each five mu, donated by philanthropists between the 28th year of Daoguang and the 5th year of Xianfeng, which were not listed in the defendants' inspection form. Furthermore, the 60 dan of white rice purchased by the Shantang through Yuda Medical Garden in 1933 was also not included in the accounts. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the Shantang had been established for a century, and all the properties during the late Qing Dynasty were managed by the late General Dong Wang Jiebo.

### Sanitation Company Inspector Injures Father and Son Laborers over Competition for Business; The Court Orders Dai Yongshou to be Re-Examined After Recovery

Dai Shoushou, a 67-year-old Jiangbei man, and his son, Dai Wenguang, who lives in a straw shed on Makien Road and works as a night soil cart driver, were lured into an alley by several people at 5:00 AM on January 27th of last year while heading to the Sanyi Silk Factory on Macau Road to empty buckets. The assailants used axes to injure both the father and son, causing them to fall to the ground. The assailants then fled in different directions. The Chinese and foreign detectives from the Qitu Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm and transported the two victims to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Dai Yongshou's injuries were quite severe and he was barely breathing. After investigation, the police learned that the case was committed by Chen Fengyi, Chen Buchuan, Sha Yaozhang, and others, sanitation company inspectors who live on Jilong Road, over competition for business. The police secretly arrested Chen and the other two and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The case was continued in the Third Criminal Court yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that although Dai Yongshou's head and leg injuries had been treated by a doctor and were not life-threatening, he was unable to stand. He requested that the hospital lift him to the dock for identification. Lying on a listening chair, he was questioned by Judge Huang Risheng, who immediately left his seat and approached Dai. According to Dai, he and his son Wenguang and daughter-in-law were working at the Sanyi Silk Factory at the time. He saw the defendant Chen Buchuan calling his son Wenguang into an alley to talk.

Since the Wan Zhu Elementary School on Luxiangyuan Road in the Jiudian area of Shanghai City was occupied by the Japanese army as a garrison, a passage has been left at the Fangbang Road entrance on the south side, where Japanese soldiers and puppet police are stationed. Residents entering and leaving, regardless of gender, must take off their hats, bow to the Japanese soldiers, and present their resident's permit. The troops stationed there have not been transferred back since they were transferred to the Qianxian front for reinforcements. More than 100 newly arrived soldiers recently transferred from Japan are stationed there. These new soldiers are all under 20 years old, have violent tempers, and often beat citizens. Residents fear them like tigers. Recently, the commander of the Japanese troops, feeling that the defense was tight and that the road was too narrow to develop, hired workers to demolish more than a dozen houses on the opposite side, including a certain family's nunnery (all female nuns) and the Fuxing Timber Yard, in order to widen the road. They also built two circular forts, about five or six feet high and more than ten feet in circumference, at the north and south ends, using bricks and cement.

### The Construction of China's Wartime Economy - A Summary at the End of the 27th Year (1938) -

— Sheng Mujie

(1) Three Principles and Eight Guidelines

The greatest goal of wartime economic construction is to achieve victory. However, economic phenomena are complex and multifaceted. Without principles as a guide, there is no way to proceed. Therefore, the Manifesto of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang expounded on the relationship between the War of Resistance and national reconstruction based on the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, complementing and assisting each other. In the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was strongly argued that the greatest purpose of Japan's aggression was to carry out economic plunder by relying on military force. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, China should first maintain the rural economy to develop productivity. The economic strength that is directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance with the emerging industries is profound and enticing, and the strength of the entire government and the entire people must be used to seek revival. From this, three principles were put forward: First, to engage in the accumulation of productive capital and the revitalization of industry with extreme frugality and hard work; Second, all plans for industrial revival should be focused on seeking victory in the War of Resistance, eliminating the differences in interests and feelings due to their status or occupation on weekdays, and moving towards a common goal; Third, in economic construction, the government must implement planned economy based on the creed of the Principle of People's Livelihood: For enterprises suitable for state operation, the state should raise capital and engage in operation, so as to make them tend towards rationalization of production; for enterprises suitable for private operation, private individuals should invest and operate them, and under the national reorganization plan, they should be guided and encouraged by the government.

In order to ensure that the War of Resistance will be won and the nation will be built, seven categories of guidelines for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction were formulated, of which the economic ones were further divided into eight types: First, economic construction should be centered on military affairs, while at the same time paying attention to improving the people's livelihood. With this goal, a planned economy should be implemented, and investment by people at home and abroad should be encouraged to expand wartime production; Second, make every effort to develop the rural economy, encourage cooperation, regulate food supply, and reclaim wasteland and dredge waterways; Third, develop mineral resources, establish the foundation of heavy industry, encourage the operation of light industry, and develop handicrafts in various places; Fourth, implement a wartime tax system and thoroughly reform financial administration; Fifth, control banking business and adjust industrial and commercial activities accordingly; Sixth, consolidate the legal currency, control foreign exchange, and manage import and export goods to stabilize finance; Seventh, reorganize the transportation system, organize water, land and air combined transportation, and build more railways and highways, and open up more air routes; Eighth, strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing, hoarding, speculating and manipulating prices, and implement a commodity price control system.

In the past year, the motivation for China's economic construction has been in line with these three principles, and the matters of economic construction have also followed these eight guidelines. Now, the important items will be discussed separately for the reference and study of those who are concerned about China's wartime economy.

(2) Financial Construction

In recent years, China's financial construction has made significant progress. The income tax created in October of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) has added an important source of wartime finance. Since the official outbreak of the August 13th Incident (1937), the National Government, in order to encourage donations for national salvation, issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds, which were fully issued and have now been sold out. At the same time, it successively promulgated nine articles of the "Temporary Measures for the Collection of Stamp Tax in Extraordinary Times," five articles of the "Measures for Additional Levy on Native Wine and the Implementation of Native Tobacco Silk Tax," and seven articles of the "Temporary Regulations for Export and Transit Tax." However, as the war zone expands day by day, the three taxes of customs, salt and unified tax, which used to be the main source of tax revenue, can hardly be collected. For example, according to the Social and Economic Monthly Report, the tax revenue of the ports preserved in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) is estimated to be 80 million yuan. The government must find other sources of revenue to subsidize it. The methods of raising funds are nothing more than increasing taxes or establishing new taxes, raising domestic and foreign debts, and issuing more paper money. As for increasing taxes, most of the places where taxes used to be collected have become war zones, and taxes cannot be collected at all, let alone increased. As for increasing the issuance of paper money, it is enough to create the evil of inflation and disrupt wartime finance, and there is nothing worse than this. Therefore, to cope with this huge wartime expenditure, the only things that can be used for subsidy and avoid the burden of inequality are the establishment of new taxes and the raising of national debt.

(A) Regarding the Establishment of New Taxes

On October 28th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the National Government promulgated "Seventeen Articles of the Regulations on Excess Profits Tax in Extraordinary Times," which stipulated that: Any profit-making enterprise with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, including companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals; profit-making enterprises jointly run by officials and merchants; and temporary profit-making enterprises, whose profits exceed 15% of the capital amount; and the profits from property leases that exceed 12% of the property price, will be subject to tax rates ranging from 10% to 50%. July 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) was set as the starting date for tax collection, and one collection was made every half year, but according to the nature of each industry, it was collected monthly or in one lump sum. On October 6th, the National Government promulgated "Twenty-four Articles of the Temporary Regulations on Inheritance Tax," which stipulated that if a person dies and leaves property within the territory of the Republic of China, and if a citizen of the Republic of China has a residence within the territory of the country and leaves property abroad, taxes shall be levied. The so-called inheritance refers to the movable property, immovable property and all other rights with property value of the deceased. The tax will be levied starting from a total inheritance amount of 5,000 yuan or more, with tax rates ranging from 1% to 50%, and will be implemented from January 1st of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).

(B) Issuance of Public Bonds

The establishment of new taxes is indeed a fundamental plan for wartime finance, but the effectiveness of new taxes is difficult to expect. Therefore, there is a sense of urgency for wartime finance. Moreover, when there is a great need for funds both internally and externally, and the construction of the wartime economy also requires funds. Therefore, in addition to hosting new taxes, we have to borrow public bonds to subsidize them. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national debt borrowed has amounted to 104.7 million yuan in national currency, 10 million yuan in customs gold, 150 million francs in foreign currency, 10.144 million pounds in British gold, and 50 million US dollars. Please see the table below:

In addition to issuing public bonds, local finance has made every effort to consolidate tax revenue, increase tax rates and open up new sources of tax revenue, and reduce government expenditure. Now, let's look at the financial facilities in Guangxi Province, and it is not difficult to draw inferences about the financial situation in other provinces.

Regarding provincial finance, adjust tax revenue according to the nature of national and provincial taxes, and temporarily handle it as before before the adjustment; expand provincial and county public enterprises so that operating income becomes an important source of government revenue; reorganize land and prepare land tax; hold urban land price tax; continue to promote housing tax, provincial and county various taxes and levies, all based on direct collection as a principle, and gradually abolish the system of collection on behalf and contractors; administrative organs should not concurrently collect tax money as a principle, and gradually transfer provincial and county taxes and levies to the tax collection bureau for handling; appropriate a certain amount of tobacco and alcohol tax surcharges and business tax to supplement county local expenses, and determine its distribution standard; restrict the additional surcharges of various taxes and levies, or re-levy taxes and proportional levies in other names; formulate regulations on banks acting as county treasuries, and gradually let banks act as county treasuries. Regarding county finance: order each county to urge districts, townships (towns) and villages (streets) to earnestly assist tax collection agencies in performing their duties; urge each county to continue to investigate land that has not paid taxes and levies, and collect donations according to its land price; urge each county to improve county financial supervision and unify the income, expenditure and custody of grassroots organizations. Regarding accounting and auditing: strictly implement the accounting system; implement township budget and accounting; strictly implement pre- and post-audits; promote on-site audits; actively promote inspection affairs; and pay attention to the general survey of the property of various agencies.

(3) Monetary and Financial Construction

After China implemented the legal currency in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the currency system was unified and finance was stabilized. However, due to political relations in Guangdong and Guangxi, and geographical relations in Yunnan Province, the legal currency could not be promoted. Later, the Guangdong currency system was reformed twice on August 21st of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) and June 20th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) to abolish the mill notes, but the currency system of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces still could not be unified and the legal currency could not be promoted. However, since the outbreak of the war, the central political and economic power has moved into the southwestern provinces, and the currency systems of Yunnan and Guizhou have also been unified. Therefore, China's entire currency system has become more unified due to the war.

In terms of financial construction, at the beginning of the war, there were the promulgation of measures to stabilize finance and the approval of measures to supplement the gold reserve for stabilization, as well as the organization of the joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China and the establishment of the four-bank discount committee. From March to June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), there were successively the implementation of the outline of measures for the control of foreign exchange for import and export and the improvement of local financial institutions, as well as various measures decided by the Hankou Financial Conference.

(A) Guangxi Promotes Legal Currency

When the legal currency was implemented, the use of current mill notes was prohibited. The Guangxi Bank took the opportunity to collect and redeem them. In addition, the provincial government's revenue was insufficient, and it overdrawn a large amount from the bank, and the amount of issuance reached more than 20 million yuan, which was still in short supply. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), military expenses were vast, and more than 30 million yuan was issued. The value of the Guangxi currency continued to fall. Fortunately, it was completed soon, and the provincial government repeatedly asked the central government for relief, but no result was achieved due to disputes over the exchange rate between the Guangxi currency and the legal currency. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was stipulated that two yuan of Guangxi notes were equal to one yuan of legal currency. At the same time, in order to consolidate Guangxi's finance and enrich the preparation of Guangxi notes, the central government issued a consolidation bond of 17 million yuan in December.

(B) Yunnan Promotes Legal Currency

Yunnan Province did not start to promote the legal currency until May of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). All public and private payments and receipts within Yunnan Province were based on the legal currency, and cash was not allowed to be used; the use of legal currency was limited to small notes of one yuan or less in the currency units of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and the old and new notes of the Fu Dian Bank were allowed to be used; those who hold silver coins must exchange them for legal currency at the Fu Dian New Bank and branch offices and legal currency exchange offices within three months from May 15th. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance properly finalized the method for collecting and destroying the US-printed banknotes issued by the former Fu Dian Bank, limiting it to one collection and settlement from September 1st to the end of November. However, due to inconvenient transportation, the deadline was extended by three months to the end of February of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), and the Fu Dian New Bank was responsible for the settlement, and it would be invalid after the deadline.

(C) Measures for Controlling Foreign Exchange

Since the promulgation of the measures to stabilize finance, the funds needed by agriculture, commerce, industry and mining should still be maintained. However, in order to cope with the demands, the financial industry originally prepared and tightened loans. Although the Central Reserve Bank of China has not been established, the four government banks have been responsible for rescuing the financial panic in the past. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks to handle discounts. At the same time, although the supplementary measures to stabilize finance temporarily prevented the outflow of funds, the incomplete structure failed to achieve universal results, and it was necessary to manage trade and control foreign exchange. In March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the so-called "United Reserve Bank" in Peiping was established, and after issuing unsecured and non-convertible banknotes, China, in order to protect its foreign exchange reserves, issued public bonds on March 14 of the same year as the main means, but this is not enough to be a flaw in China's wartime finance. Judging from the financial measures of various countries during the European War, it is enough to be called.

(C) Regarding Local Finance

As for local finance, it was already very tight in peacetime, and it was even worse in wartime. The method of financial compensation, in addition to some overdrafts from provincial banks, had to resort to public bond policies. We know that about 60 million yuan has been issued. A table is shown as follows. . . Promulgated three articles of the Measures for Application for Foreign Exchange Approval and six articles of the Rules for Application for Purchase of Foreign Exchange, which were subsequently increased. On April 12, the Shanghai Liaison Office was ordered to be established, on April 14, cash was ordered to be provided, on May 7, banks applying for foreign exchange should indicate the name and amount of the importer, and the applying bank was only allowed to take three-sixteenths of a penny handling fee. On June 10, the foreign exchange application form needed to record the name, quantity, amount and origin of the goods in detail. From August 8, it was further advanced to the order approval system. The central bank only sells foreign exchange but does not buy it, which is not a good policy. Moreover, allowing export foreign exchange to operate in the market has a great impact on the future of exchange rates. It should be concentrated in the central bank, which can not only generate foreign exchange positions, but also stabilize the exchange rate of legal currency. Therefore, the implementation of various measures to control export foreign exchange was introduced on April 25. The main measures are four regulations: Measures for Merchants to Transport Goods for Export and Settle Foreign Exchange, Types of Export Goods that Should Be Settled in Foreign Exchange and Their Methods, Matters to be Noted by Relevant Agencies in Investigating Foreign Exchange from Exported Goods, and Matters to be Noted in Implementing "Types of Export Goods that Should Be Settled in Foreign Exchange and Their Methods." It is stipulated that export goods should sell the foreign currency obtained to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications - in fact, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications resell it to the Central Bank. The export goods that should be settled in foreign exchange were gradually expanded to 24 types, and then changed to 23 categories, and later there were deletions. From the New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), it was further reduced to 13 major categories such as tung oil, hog bristles, cowhide, tea, mineral sand, gallnuts, fur, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, casings, and duck feathers.

(D) Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance

The joint discount of the four banks is enough to enhance the strength of the central and chartered banks in leading financial regulation and adjusting industry and commerce. However, the structure of local financial institutions urgently needs to be improved, and the capital needs to be fully purchased. Therefore, at the end of April, the Ministry of Finance announced ten articles of the Outline of Measures to Improve Local Financial Institutions, and specially approved local financial institutions to receive one-yuan notes and auxiliary coin notes from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, but only on the condition of handling the following businesses related to agriculture, industry, and mining: Operation of agricultural product warehouses, storage of agricultural products, loans for seeds, fertilizers, farming cattle and agricultural tools, loans for farmland water conservancy projects, acceptance or discount of agricultural bills, mortgage of land and real estate that have completed legal procedures and have continued income, mortgage of factory assets, mortgage of industrial raw materials and finished products, acceptance or discount of commercial bills, management, issuance or mortgage of corporate bonds, mortgage of company stocks that pay interest according to regulations, and mortgage of agricultural, forestry, fishery, mining products and daily domestic goods. The intention of this note-receiving method is purely to encourage financial institutions to move towards agriculture, industry, and mining, so as to correct the past imbalance of focusing on commerce, and to make all funds flow into rural areas and be used for production. Those related to agriculture account for as many as five items. The wartime financial stabilization measures are passive restrictions, and the outline of local financial reform is active construction.

(E) Progress of Gold Policy

In addition to the aforementioned, the progress of gold policy, the establishment of British and American loans, and the extension of Sino-US currency are also important for the construction of China's wartime currency.

Since China nationalized silver in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it has still allowed free gold trading, and only used the customs gold settlement price to control the gold price. However, gold has the qualification of an international monetary material. The more gold reserves, the more relatively it shows the country's strong external purchasing power. Since the War of Resistance, the collection of gold in China has also been one of the important policies of the wartime economy. When the national salvation bond was raised, it was stipulated that it could be used to purchase bonds with gold or gold. On October 10th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Measures for Converting Gold into Legal Currency and Implementation Details were promulgated, stipulating that those who exchange raw gold, gold utensils, etc. for legal currency will be given a handling fee of 3-5%, 6% will be added for national salvation bonds, and 2% per week will be added for those with legal currency. On May 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), gold bonds were issued, stipulating that those who purchase with raw gold and its manufactured products or gold coins, etc. will be issued customs gold bonds according to the amount of pure gold contained, with each customs gold unit converted into 60.1866 milligrams of pure gold. On November 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Measures for Supervising Silver Buildings to Collect Gold were promulgated, stipulating that silver buildings should only collect and sell gold and nine-carat gold in the shape of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, blocks, leaves, placer gold, and mine gold are not allowed to be collected and sold at all. Shops that specialize in buying placer gold and mine gold and do not also operate silver buildings should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract to accept the entrustment to collect gold and sell it all to the Central Bank and shall not sell it privately. In mid-November of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance restricted the private smuggling of gold for export and transport to the occupied areas, stipulating that gold and gold ornaments of any shape are prohibited from being transported or transported to the occupied areas unless specially approved by the Ministry of Finance. Looking at the progress of wartime gold policy as a whole, the greatest purpose is to collect folk gold to increase foreign exchange funds. China has to try its best to collect folk gold in order to strengthen the consolidation of legal currency against foreign exchange.

(F) Extension of the Sino-US Currency Agreement and Credit Loans

Raising foreign debt is also an important policy to consolidate the currency value and stabilize finance during wartime. In September of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), China dispatched economic envoys Chen Guangfu and Xi Demao to the United States. After three months, as a result of discussions with the US Treasury Department and private groups, the currency agreement was extended and a credit loan of US$25 million was established. According to a Havasi telegram on December 19, the US Treasury Secretary said that the Sino-US currency agreement signed between China and the United States on July 9, 1937, allows China to use the gold deposited in the United States as collateral to obtain credit loans from the United States. The Central Bank of China has obtained this credit loan under certain conditions to protect the interests of China and the United States in order to facilitate the stability of exchange rates. This agreement will continue to be effective after it expires at the end of 1938. According to a joint statement by the Chinese and US finance ministers on the Sino-US gold and silver exchange agreement on July 9, 1937: Continuing the silver currency agreement signed in May 1936, China will purchase a large amount of gold from the United States under mutually acceptable conditions, and the United States will continue to purchase silver from China in order to help China increase its gold reserves; and both parties will negotiate a method - that is, the Central Bank of China can obtain US exchange under conditions that protect the mutual interests of both parties to stabilize the currency. Therefore, the currency agreement and credit loan are probably the result of the expanded negotiation method. As a result, the stability of the legal currency has been further strengthened. Silver prices fluctuate constantly and do not have the qualification of a world currency. Although various currencies have stopped the gold standard, gold still maintains the function of value storage in international financial relations. The extension of the Sino-US currency agreement can give China various benefits for easily converting silver into gold to enhance the value of the legal currency foreign exchange fund. Secondly, credit loans, whether in the form of currency or goods, can directly and indirectly increase foreign exchange funds and stabilize the value of legal currency.

In addition to the US$25 million credit loan from the United States, the United Kingdom has also approved in principle a credit loan of 10 million pounds to China, the first payment of which is 500,000 pounds, specifically for the purchase of heavy trucks and transportation materials.

(4) Other Economic Constructions (A) Transportation Construction

Today, the western, southern, and northern provinces have become China's base for "Victory in the War of Resistance and Success in National Construction." As a result, China's wartime economic construction is also concentrated in the western, southern, and northern provinces. However, the most important thing in economic construction is the construction of finance, currency, and finance, which is used to promote other economic constructions, and it is determined to be the construction of transportation economy. After the opening of transportation routes, the materials needed for "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction, and economic construction" can be enriched, and there is no need to worry about the lack of supply.

The construction of transportation can be divided into two aspects: highways and railways. Regarding highways: there is the Southwest Highway Network, which connects Hunan Province to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong and other provinces and Myanmar; there is the Northwest Highway Network, which connects Hubei Province to Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces; there is the West-North-South Communication Highway Network, which connects Sichuan Province to Shaanxi and Gansu. Regarding railways: the Qian-Dian (Guiyang to Kunming), Yu-Dian (Xufu to Kunming), and Dian-Myanmar (Kunming to Manyun Town on the Sino-Myanmar border and Bhamo in Myanmar) railways are being built in the southwest. The construction of the Dian-Myanmar Railway has great significance for opening up European international transportation, and can save the travel distance and time between the southwestern provinces and foreign countries.

(B) Construction of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the development of the domestic economy was adjusted, and attention was paid to those related to national defense. On December 22nd of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the National Government promulgated the Wartime Agricultural, Mining, Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations, and the Military Commission managed them in accordance with these regulations. A Trade Adjustment Committee was established under the Military Commission with a fund of 20 million yuan; an Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee with a fund of 30 million yuan; and an Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee with a fund of 10 million yuan, all of which were specially allocated by the Ministry of Finance. In the past year and a half, great achievements have been made.

The Trade Association is now under the Ministry of Finance and has been renamed the Trade Commission. It mainly promotes the export of domestic goods and complements the control of foreign exchange for exports. For example, tea from Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, silk from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, hog bristles and fur from Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangsu, and tung oil from Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In mid-June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance further formulated measures to promote export trade, divided into: (A) reducing export costs to promote export sales; (B) adjusting domestic commodity prices to maintain domestic production. The first part is a remedial measure because the international market is depressed and the prices of goods are falling, resulting in occasional sales losses for export merchants, which in turn affects the production industry; the second part is a remedial measure because there are differences between the official exchange rate and the black market, and merchants require the sale of foreign exchange at market prices or cash compensation from the government.

The Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee is now under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and is complemented by the Agricultural Bank and the Agricultural Experiment Institute. The Agricultural Bank specializes in handling the lending of funds, and the Agricultural Experiment Institute specializes in improving agricultural production technology. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated measures to subsidize agricultural improvement funds in various provinces. In addition to cooperative undertakings, agricultural improvement agencies can request subsidies for improvement funds in accordance with this law. The Ministries of Finance and Economics have formulated six articles of the Measures to Expand the Scope of Rural Loans, stipulating that financial institutions that receive one-yuan notes and auxiliary coin notes in accordance with the Outline of Measures to Improve Local Financial Institutions, and cooperative treasuries established in accordance with the law, should make full use of various cooperatives to increase various agricultural loans. However, during the War of Resistance, farmers' organizations recognized by lending agencies may also be the object of loans.

The Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee is now also under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and cooperates with the Resources Committee to consolidate the foundation of public and private enterprises. The former assists local private factories in moving from war zones to safe areas to continue operations. It is estimated that more than 300 companies have been assisted by the government to move to inland provinces, of which more than 100 are in Sichuan Province. The latter specializes in state-owned heavy industries in inland provinces - steel, chemical, electricity, machinery, and mining and metallurgy. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs assists a certain agency in building a larger steel plant, which, after completion this summer, can produce considerable steel every day, and also assists a certain private steel manufacturing plant, which will soon be able to produce steel. The Yongli Company, which has experience in handling this industry, is asked to handle the chemical industries such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and Abyssinia. In addition, the National Government promulgated the Industrial Incentive Law and the Special Industrial Interest Guarantee and Subsidy Regulations on June 7th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), which were reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The former stipulates that those who have international competition in domestic and foreign markets, adopt the latest foreign methods for manufacturing, and manufacturers with patent rights may request a reduction or exemption of export tax, raw material tax, transportation fees of state-owned transportation enterprises, and give awards and exclusive manufacturing rights in a certain area for five years. The latter stipulates that special industries manufacturing prime movers, motors, machine tools, metal materials, liquid fuels, and transportation equipment may request an interest guarantee - 5% for paid-in capital and 6% for bonds, limited to seven years, or subsidies - giving cash based on the annual production cost and market price of each product category.

In short, the construction of wartime agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce is presided over by the Ministries of Economics and Finance, promoted by the three committees, and assisted by the affiliated agencies. However, because this construction was launched in "Victory in the War of Resistance and Success in National Construction," the information is confidential and lacking, so it cannot be elaborated in detail, which is regrettable.

### Large Quantities of Pigs and Cattle Arrive in Shanghai

Fresh pigs and butchered cattle are in great demand in this city. Since the National Army moved west, transportation has been frequently disrupted, making it extremely difficult. As a result, prices have increased. Recently, pig merchants pooled their resources to purchase large quantities of pigs from various places in northern Jiangsu, which are being continuously shipped to Shanghai in batches.

### Foreign Exchange Arbitrage and Capital Flight

— Ying Yongsheng

I. What is Foreign Exchange Arbitrage?

The Shanghai foreign exchange market has both spot and forward rates. Due to market conditions, there are differences between spot and forward rates. Sometimes the spot rate is higher than the forward rate, and sometimes the spot rate is lower than the forward rate. Recently, the market has mostly seen spot rates cheaper than forward rates, that is, the price for this month is lower than the price for the next month. If you buy futures for this month and sell futures for the next month at the same time, there will be a difference. This difference is interest; the level of interest depends on the size of the difference. The method is similar to the previous arbitrage of public bonds.

II. Calculation Method of Arbitrage Interest Rate

Regarding the method of calculating arbitrage interest rates, there are two types of calculations: ordinary calculations and simplified calculations. They are described separately below:

Method for calculating the interest rate of English gold arbitrage:

(1) Ordinary calculation: For example, on the morning of December 24, the opening price of the black market for foreign exchange was 8 pence 59375 for English gold in December, and 8 pence 5625 for January of the 28th year. If you want to invest 10,000 pounds, what is the monthly interest rate?

National currency to be paid in December

That is, a monthly interest rate of 3...

The ordinary calculation and the simplified calculation are originally the same. The interest rate obtained is the same for large numbers. The trailing numbers are slightly different due to the rounding of English gold into national currency.

Method for calculating the interest rate of US dollar arbitrage:

For example, on June 23, 27th year, the black market price for foreign exchange in June was 18 yuan,

The price in July was 17 and a half yuan. What is the monthly interest rate?

(Based on 100,000 US dollars)

(1) Ordinary calculation:

National currency to be paid in June

The difference is 15,873.02, which is the interest for one month for 555,555.55. To find out what the monthly interest rate is,

15,873.02×1,000 (monthly interest rate) + 555,555.55=28.5714362

That is, a monthly interest rate of 2% and 8 mills

(2) Simplified calculation:

The difference between the market prices in June and July is .50, and the market price in July is 17.5. The calculation formula is as follows:

.50+17.5×1,00=28.57142857

That is, a monthly interest rate of 2% and 8 mills

The interest rates obtained by the above two methods are the same for large numbers. The trailing numbers are slightly different due to the rounding of US dollars into national currency.

Note: The interest rates obtained above do not deduct the broker's commission. According to bank practice, 1/32% of the national currency income of the foreign exchange sold needs to be paid, and no commission is paid for the foreign exchange purchased.

III. Comparison of the Highs and Lows of US Dollar Arbitrage Interest Rates in the Last Half Year

In order to compare the highs and lows of Shanghai's arbitrage interest rates in the past six months, a comparison of the daily interest rates in the most recent six months (because the arbitrage interest rate varies from day to day in each month due to the size of the difference) is listed below to observe the general trend.

IV. The Relationship between High and Low Interest Rates and Capital Flight

Capital flight mostly involves Chinese people depositing funds into foreign banks or buying foreign exchange, but the level of arbitrage interest rates also has a significant impact on capital flight. Because thick arbitrage profits attract Chinese people to engage in foreign exchange arbitrage transactions. Moreover, ordinary people who do not understand what arbitrage is are also joining in one after another, influenced by newspaper advertisements touting the favorable arbitrage interest rates. For example, in October, because the arbitrage interest rate could reach about 2% per month, those who engaged in arbitrage transactions were particularly active. According to reports from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, more than 10 million yuan flowed directly and indirectly into foreign banks in one month of October. However, in the past two months, because the interest rate offered by arbitrage has been declining day by day, Chinese people are unwilling to continue this type of transaction and are withdrawing funds to deposit in Chinese banks to earn interest, amounting to a considerable amount, estimated at several million yuan. It can be said that a portion of the escaped capital has been recovered. It is found that the initiators of foreign exchange arbitrage are mostly foreign banks. They determine the size of the difference based on their position and mostly state on the order that the foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank without interest. Therefore, foreign exchange arbitrage can be said to be a credit loan that foreign banks absorb from Chinese people. According to the current market situation, if the interest rate offered by arbitrage is high, there will inevitably be more capital flight; if the interest rate is low, the capital that has already escaped will naturally be recovered. Regarding capital flight, it has a significant impact on the market, and the rise and fall of the black market interest rates for discounts are also related. In short, foreign exchange arbitrage and capital flight are very closely related.

Commercial News

### Finance: English Banks Refuse to Accept Gold Mortgages; English Gold Price Falls More Sharply; Spot Gold Trading in This City Was Non-Existent Yesterday

Yesterday's spot gold market at the start of trading was because it was a regular Sunday holiday, although there were still some members gathered, but there was no trading. The number of customers entering and exiting the cash exchange industry was also very few. The selling price was still around 1,990 yuan. Also, the price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops has not changed. Datong Bank still hangs the original price of 202 yuan, Xin Bank hangs 200 yuan, and buys in at 194 yuan. Also, a London telegram on the 7th reported that due to sudden rumors in the market that banks would refuse to accept gold mortgages in the future, and the pound sterling has been lengthening daily after being protected by the Ministry of Finance, this has caused panic among those who hold physical goods, and they have successively come out in large numbers, causing the decline to increase tenfold. The price has shrunk sharply by eight and a half pence per ounce, retreating to seven pounds, eight shillings, and nine and a half pence.

### English and Indian Silver Prices Both Shrink

A London telegram on the 7th reported that speculators were selling, there was a lack of support, and the market situation was calm. Both near-term and far-term large bars of silver shrunk by one-eighth seven-five. A New York silver telegram reported that the price of American silver was still quoted but untraded. Also, a Bombay silver telegram reported that Indian silver was still loose and tired. The spot price and near-term and far-term prices continued to shrink by two annas.

### Grain: Both Thick and Thin Indica Rice Had No Ups or Downs

Yesterday's source of national rice, the downriver area, arrived on the 7th, and more than 10,000 bags were transported from Suzhou, so people's hearts were more discouraged. Both the market on this street and the storage households felt that the sales were inferior, and the sales of steamed buns were also not as smooth as before, making it difficult for the market to see any more strength. The price of both thick and thin indica rice remained at the original price and had no ups or downs. Du Yangbu tip was also similar. The shortage of biànyuán goods was still in good shape, but because the price level was already high, it was difficult to increase it, and it was the same as the current flat situation.

### Sugar Market: Quanzhou Telegram, Authentic Goods; Quanzhou Sugar Entering Shanghai Prevented

Yesterday's sugar market, such as crude white, car white, lotus red, and domestic Chao sugar, etc., did not have many transactions and the opening was also scarce, with no significant ups and downs. There was a shipment of 599 bags of Quanzhou sugar transported by the Shenguang Wheel. According to the Fangxi news from the Jianbang firm, a telegram from Quanzhou reported that goods were being stopped because Huian, which is adjacent to that place, was shelled by enemy ships, so there was a fear of accidents. If the other party really has intentions, then the source of sugar will have problems, it is said.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Creates a New High Price

Southern Tang gorgon fruit: Because this season had a poor harvest, the inventory in the production area was already scarce. The unified goods price had previously risen from more than 100 yuan to 145 yuan. Now, because the Shanghai market felt thin day by day, the trend was tight, and the price increased by another 15 yuan. Yesterday's market sold for 160 yuan. According to people in the industry, there is a risk of a shortage of goods soon. It has been found that the top sieve surface has already been sold out, and even ordinary pond gorgon fruit is priced at 60 yuan. However, medicinal gorgon fruit, that is, cut gorgon fruit, is cheaper, selling for 27-28 yuan. The market is expected to continue to rise.

### Torreya Seed Supply is Not Continued

Torreya seeds are produced in the inland areas of Zhejiang. There were previously stocks held by traders here, selling for 20 to 22 yuan per picul. Most of the purchases were made by Nanjing and Zhenjiang firms. As of now, they have been sold out, and the supply has suddenly been interrupted. However, the demand is still high. If there are arrivals, it is generally speculated that the price will have to rise to 40 to 50 yuan, which shows the eagerness.

### Silk and Tea: Last Month's New York Raw Silk Consumption Decreased and Inventory Increased

New York's raw silk statistics for December of last year:

It has now been disclosed by the New York Raw Silk Association. Viewing the various statistical figures as a whole seems to imply that the recent rise in raw silk may turn sluggish. The total import volume of New York raw silk last month was 42,264 piculs, a decrease of 1,742 piculs compared to the previous month. The total consumption was 25,204 piculs, a decrease of 6,395 piculs compared to the previous month. The total inventory was 53,278 piculs, an increase of 7,060 piculs compared to the previous month. The details are listed below (unit: piculs):

### TALK - WRITTEN FOR SHANGHAI WOMEN

— Qin

Respected Shanghai Women Compatriots,

You live in Shanghai, and although your actions are not entirely free, you have already achieved considerable success in social service.

In the past eighteen months, you have educated refugees in refugee shelters; you have held relief fairs to raise funds for refugees; you have collected donations for refugees on the streets; you have donated your own clothes to refugees. Recently, you have enthusiastically supported the promotion of frugal relief. Indeed, you have fulfilled your responsibility as a citizen.

Now, what I want to say to you is not to praise your past achievements, but to hope that you will go further in seeking happiness for the people. I believe you can fully achieve the following points:

1.  Practice Frugality in Clothing and Food: Recently, a Ms. Wang Guoxiu returned from the United States. According to her, women in several major cities in the United States have switched to wearing cotton socks. Women in several other cities have participated in the "One Bowl of Rice" movement, which has been very successful. Originally, American women wore silk stockings, and American society is very affluent. Why do they wear cotton socks? Why do they only eat one bowl of rice, going hungry? They are truly sympathetic to the suffering people of the world. In particular, the virtue of frugality in clothing and food is even more worthy of our emulation and practice. I hope that the women compatriots of Shanghai can achieve this.

2.  Organize Reading Groups: It is a very meaningful activity to organize a reading group with several neighbors, classmates, or relatives. Each person buys several newly published books, newspapers, and magazines, puts them together, and borrows them in turn. During meetings, they can present reports to each other and discuss various issues related to reading, such as education, social issues, and current events. I believe that modern women should have this interest in reading. Reading groups are the most honorable group activity for women. I hope you will quickly organize them.

3.  Organize Hiking Clubs: Shanghai women compatriots often do not pay attention to their physical health, and they rarely organize hiking clubs. Women's hiking clubs have been popular in Europe and America for a long time, so their bodies are much stronger than yours. This kind of organization is very simple. You only need to decide on a few people and stipulate the method of each hike, such as running or cycling, and then you can hold it. The route of the hike may be temporarily limited to quiet roads. This is an easy and feasible fitness activity. I hope that in the near future, there will be such groups in the Shanghai women's community.

4.  Do Not Engage in Meaningless Pastimes: I have heard that a very small number of women in Shanghai like to play cards. Why do they like to play cards? I can't figure out the reason. This kind of meaningless pastime wastes time and energy, and it neglects family affairs, so it really needs to be improved. Think about it, if you sit at the card table all day long, leaving household affairs to the servants and letting the children play in the alleys, this kind of life without family responsibility, if it continues for a long time, will inevitably lead to family breakdown. The family is the basic unit of the country. If the family breaks down, how can a healthy country be produced! I hope you will pay special attention to banning and prohibiting it!

In addition, such as happily using domestic products, implementing family savings, etc., I think you have already done it, so I won't say more.

Shouting and wagering are still not enough, so they go to the red-light district to seek pleasure. Everywhere, clear songs gently turn, and graceful dance shadows gracefully sway. How much pursuit of pleasure and joy do they know? Can they think of the suffering and displaced refugees! They are: shivering frequently due to lack of warm clothes, and also: suffering from hunger with little soup or broth to swallow. It is truly pitiful to be without clothes or food, longing for their hometowns while secretly shedding tears. Everyone has a home but cannot return, hating the brutal soldiers with unbearable anger! Most pitiful are: the fragile bodies of refugee children, how can they endure the cruel suffering, as if: tender buds are being battered by wind and rain. The same compatriots share different joys and sorrows, other countries still express their sympathy. Everyone should have a compassionate heart, and only when one is satiated and not drowning can one be called benevolent. I urge you to quickly untie the bag of benevolence, and enthusiastically donate without tiring. Let us come together to help those in need without hesitation.

### REFUGEES AND THE PUBLIC

— Refugee Reporter

In this era of suffering, everyone is a refugee:

Some are refugees with clothes and food, some are refugees without clothes and food. We hope: that the refugees with clothes and food will save some and help the refugees without clothes and food! We also hope: that the refugees without clothes and food will work hard and unite to become refugees with food!

Those who manage refugee shelters should strive to ensure that there are no refugees to manage.

Those who work in refugee relief should strive to ensure that there are no refugees in need of relief. Our goal is to train and nurture the refugees without clothes and food, making them useful and capable members of the public!

That's why our weekly is called "The Public Weekly."

### PILGRIMAGE TO SELF-SUFFICIENCY REFUGEE CAMPS (Part 2)

— Yixin

(III) The Third Self-Sufficiency Camp, located at the intersection of Avenue Road and Gordon Road, has now been disbanded.

(IV) The Fourth Self-Sufficiency Camp: Originally known as the Jiaozhou Refugee Camp, it is located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road. The organization of this camp is divided into three sections: General Affairs, Guidance, and Management. The General Affairs section is divided into: 1. Documentation, 2. Provisions, 3. Storage, 4. Accounting. The Guidance section is divided into: 1. Registration, 2. Hygiene, 3. Security. The Management section is divided into: 1. Class Instruction, 2. Statistics. There are a total of 244 self-sufficient refugees in this camp, with employed and unemployed each accounting for half. In addition to the staff and educated children who are provided with meals by the camp, the remaining refugees purchase meals from the camp at 100 cash per liter, with no limit on the amount purchased. Adults pay five cents per month for water and electricity, and the remaining expenses are borne by the Charity Federation. The refugees' production work is all done outside the camp.

(V) The Fifth Self-Sufficiency Camp is located inside the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road and Zhanlang Road. The camp's affairs are handled by the director, deputy director, accountant, education officer, and instructors, etc., who handle daily affairs. The managers manage registration, production, writing, general affairs, provisions, storage, hygiene, and medical services. The refugees are all those who were previously able to be self-sufficient in the Cisheng Refugee Camp. A total of 447 elderly and young refugees, as well as staff members of the camp, are provided with meals by the camp. 184 people buy their own meals, costing 200 cash per day. Some production work is done inside the camp, and some is done outside the camp. Some clothing is provided by the refugees themselves, and some is provided by the camp. Education is divided into children's classes, women's classes, and men's classes. The children's class is divided into six levels, with more than 100 students, who receive full-day instruction. The Dunxin Road Refugee Camp began construction in October last year and has been completed, covering an area of more than 40 acres, with beds, classrooms, and medical facilities (photographed by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association). The women's class has more than 30 students, and the adult class has about 60 students, who attend classes for one hour each day.

(VI) The 18th Christian Self-Sufficiency Camp: The organization is divided into six groups: Religion, General Affairs, Medical Services, Education, Catering, and Registration. Most of the refugees are reorganized from the previous 18 camps, and some have moved in from other places, but they must be guaranteed by a pastor. The total number of people is 300 to 400. The monthly meal fee is four yuan, half price for ages five to twelve, and free for ages under five. The rent for a south-facing room is four and a half yuan, and the rent for a north-facing room is four yuan, with a maximum of eight people allowed to live in each room. Each electric light costs eight yuan. Children's education includes six levels of primary school, divided into four classes, with a kindergarten attached, and independent classrooms. There is no adult education class yet. Refugees can enter and leave freely except during class time. There is also a portion of elderly and frail people who are unable to produce and are still provided with supplies by the camp.

In addition, there is also a former 36th branch of the Charity Federation, which has now been converted into a work dormitory. It is newly established, and the internal organization is simple. There are more than ten refugees. Each refugee pays four and a half yuan for meal money each month. The camp cooks and distributes the meals, twice a day, at 11 am and 5 pm. There are no other restrictions. Some work outside the camp, and some work inside the camp. Refugees have absolute freedom of entry and exit, and it is entirely a dormitory. The camp only accepts female workers, so it is also called the Female Workers' Dormitory.

Since the establishment of the self-sufficiency camps, it has reduced a part of the public consumption and increased production. On the part of the refugees themselves, they can produce and at the same time exercise their bodies. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

Looking at the self-sufficiency situation of the various camps, the impression is very good. This is also a great achievement in refugee relief. Living a life of dependency is gradually advancing to a life of self-reliance. In the near future, the number of refugees who can be self-sufficient will definitely increase gradually, which is worth waiting for.

### NATIONAL HERO - STONE BOY

— Jin Yixi

During the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were often bullied by others. That year, just like now, there were invading troops, who burned, looted, raped, and killed, doing everything without restraint. Fortunately, with the efforts of local government troops and militia, the situation was stabilized. A small city in the northwest of Shanghai (north of Nanxiang, west of Luodian), called Jiading, was also spared this harassment.

It was a quiet evening, the night enveloped the earth, dark clouds obscured the moon, a cool breeze passed through the sparse forest, blowing gently, startled birds roosting, chirping like the sound of ghosts crying. Ancient trees stretched out their withered branches across the road, like iron hands reaching out to grab people, a kind of secluded and dark atmosphere, making people's hair stand on end. The patrolling soldiers in the shadows were on guard, and the fierce enemy soldiers were finally unable to succeed and were frustrated.

However, people's energy is ultimately limited. After each soldier and militiaman had defended for several days and nights, they were all exhausted, and the sleep demon grabbed everyone's eyelids, and they all fell into a deep sleep.

At this time, the enemy soldiers, who had been anxiously besieging the city without success, caught a glimpse of the sparse black shadows on the city wall and thought that the time to attack the city had come. Ladders and ropes were brought, and they carried their weapons, braving the black sky, and tiptoed towards the breaches in the city wall.

In this extremely critical moment, a boy heard a strange "rustling" sound and looked in that direction.

"Ah!" If he hadn't looked, it would have been better, but the sight stirred his heart with surging hot blood. Looking back at his companions, they were all snoring loudly. He gritted his teeth, silently grasped his broadsword tightly, and lay伏 in ambush by the breach, waiting for the arrival of the enemy soldiers, to give them a heavy lesson.

The enemy soldiers, one by one, ascended as fast as lightning. Just as they were about to look around to see what was happening, unexpectedly, a bright broadsword stretched out from the side, with a "crash," their heads and bodies parted ways. One, two, three... With the sound of "crash," they parted ways one by one and rolled down. It was as satisfying as cutting vegetables.

"Hua!" A chorus of voices woke up, woke up the sleepy-eyed officers and soldiers and militia, in a group of noisy sounds.

"Kill! The enemy is coming!" The boy shouted at the top of his lungs in the tense air.

"Kill! The enemy is coming! Compatriots, get up quickly!" The officers, soldiers, and militia all responded.

In a flurry of flashing swords, countless heads were cut off. Suddenly, with a "bang," a cannonball came from a distance, and the boy fell in response. It was a pity that he sacrificed himself with a smile on his face for the sake of the country and the locality.

However, although the child was killed, the enemy was finally defeated in the collaborative counterattack and retreated far away. Thus, the lives and property of the entire city of Jiading were protected.

This short story is full of hot blood, it is tragic! Now, at the two city gates in the northeast of Jiading, there are stone statues of the boy, which commemorate his great deeds and allow people to admire this tragic situation forever.

### LIFE SKETCHES - TEACHING MY MOTHER TO READ - SECOND NEWSBOY SCHOOL

— Li Xiyi

December 8th

Today, I got up, washed my face, and brushed my teeth, then went to the newspaper office to unpack some newspapers. My mother went to the market to sell fish. After I finished delivering the newspapers, I went to the market to help my mother sell fish. After my mother and I finished selling the fish, we went home to cook. After lunch, I taught my mother to read. After teaching her for more than half a month, my mother could recognize some of the words on the banknotes. While I was teaching my mother, I was also reading and writing myself. At four o'clock, I took the money and went to the news agency to unpack some evening newspapers. After selling them, I went to school to study.

### WAR REPORT - WEEKLY UPDATE

Guangdong

On the Guangdong front, since the Chinese army launched a fierce counteroffensive, the Japanese army has shortened the battle lines, reorganized, and waited for reinforcements. They have also actively built fortifications in the areas surrounding Guangzhou, such as Zengcheng, Huangpu, Shunde, Jiujiang, Foshan, and Sanshui, as a plan for retreating and attacking. Recently, the Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shangxia Luogang have been attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing panic and firing cannons at night, consuming a lot of ammunition. The Japanese troops in Shilong were attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army on the night of the 28th, and fought with the Japanese army in the streets for several hours, causing considerable losses to the Japanese army. At dawn, the Chinese army safely retreated to its original position. A unit of the Japanese army in Foshan of a thousand men was transferred to Guanyao, and a regiment transferred back from Jiujiang filled the gap, seemingly in a rotation adjustment. The Japanese First Division in Sanshui is also actively preparing, and it is said that there are still subsequent troops being transported, indicating that they have active intentions toward the West River. The Japanese warships on the Beihai and Qiongya sea areas have not been seen to have any activity.

Yuehan

The war on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite quiet recently. The two armies are still facing each other on the line of the Xinqiang River and Jiuling Street. A certain unit of the Chinese army recently attacked Taolin, Linxiang, at night. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated northward.

Nanxun

On the Nanxun front, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing each other on both sides of the Xiu River. Except for occasional small contacts between guerrillas and the Japanese army, there has been no fierce war on the front. At dawn on New Year's Day, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops at various key points between Yongxiu and Dean. It has been quite effective, and the Chinese army is currently in pursuit.

Eyu

On the northern Hubei front, after the Japanese troops in Yingshan, Taolin, Heguan, and Hepu were attacked by the Chinese army, most of them retreated to Xihe. The Japanese troops in Guandimiao also retreated to Yingshan. After the Japanese troops in Anlu were attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army and captured Qinglongtan, the Japanese army retreated backward. The Japanese troops in Zaoshi are heavily guarded, seemingly without the will to attack. There has been no war recently on the southern Henan front. However, the Japanese troops in eastern Henan are very active. The Japanese troops in Shangqiu and Kaifeng have recently increased to five or six thousand, and a portion of them has invaded Qixian and is currently engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese troops defending the city. Although Tongxu has been occupied by the Japanese army, due to the restraining effect of the Chinese guerrillas, they have not dared to invade westward for the time being. On the northern Henan front, the Japanese headquarters in Xinxiang was attacked by Chinese plainclothes soldiers, causing a fire that burned for a whole day. The station north of Xinxiang was also occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army is now retreating northward.

JinSui

The Japanese army in Shanxi is attempting to actively encircle and attack the Chinese army in western Shanxi, as a preparation for invading west of the Yellow River. They once began to invade a few days ago. The Japanese troops invading northward from Hejin were severely attacked by the Chinese army near Yumenshan and have retreated towards the Hechu area. Another group of Japanese troops invading westward from Linfen, together with the Japanese troops moving south from Fenyang, retreated to Daning on the 29th and sent a portion of their troops to harass Jixian and Xiangning. The Chinese army is currently engaging them. In addition, there are Japanese troops invading south from Fenyang across Jiuyu, who have also encountered a counterattack by the Chinese army, so it is unlikely that they will succeed. The Japanese troops invading westward from Lishi are currently maneuvering with the Chinese army near Liulin. The Chinese army is currently driving them away in separate routes. In short, Jixian and Xiangning are the pre-determined battlefields of the Chinese army, and there have been thorough arrangements. It is expected that the Japanese troops in that area will suffer a major blow soon. The Japanese troops in the vicinity of Suiyuan and Baotou have continued to increase, seemingly with the intention of invading westward. Fearing attacks by Chinese guerrillas, they have recently demolished all the civilian houses within thirty li of Baotou, and the refugees who have no home to return to have joined the guerrillas in droves. In this way, the Japanese army will be greatly threatened. At the same time, the puppet troops in the area are fighting among themselves, and the more powerful units are rumored to be brewing defection.

Hebei

There are many Japanese troops stationed at various key points on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. There are more than 10,000 Japanese troops in the vicinity of Shijiazhuang, and more than 7,000 of them have gradually moved westward, seemingly with the intention of reinforcing Shanxi.

In short, summarizing this week's war situation, there have been no particularly large battles on any front. On the southern China front, the Japanese army in Guangdong seems to be holding firmly to the key points near Guangdong, as well as the strongholds of Humen, Dongguan, etc., with the main force invading Zhaoqing from Sanshui. However, after the Chinese army launched simultaneous attacks on various fronts, the Japanese army has already shown a situation where it cannot attend to both ends. It has suffered heavy losses in recent days and can only retreat and become困 in its original position. On the central China fronts, there have been small contacts愿 between the two sides. The Japanese army seems to be concentrating in Wuhan to reorganize, while the Chinese army is also waiting for an opportunity to encircle and attack. On the northern China front, the Japanese troops in Shanxi and Chahar are eager to make trouble. They have invaded various places in western Shanxi in separate routes, but after being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they have suffered heavy losses and are still in confrontation in the areas of Hejin, Jixian, and Lishi. The Chinese army has strict defenses and strong troops, and it is not easy for the Japanese army to break through and invade west of the river. At the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, it is actually beneficial for the Chinese army that the Japanese army is flowing into the mountains. In all aspects of strategy and tactics, the Japanese army has already shown exhaustion and resourcefulness, and is stretched thin. If the Chinese army currently utilizes new strategies and tactics to implement a full-scale war, the Japanese army will be even more exhausted. The victory of the future is in expectation.

### MINISTRY OF EDUCATION EMPHASIZES FILM EDUCATION - Stipulations for Subsidizing Radio and Dry Battery Methods in Various Provinces and Cities

(Chongqing News) In view of the importance of film education, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated the methods for subsidizing the price of radios and dry batteries in various provinces in the second half of the 27th year, which are announced and implemented as follows:

(1) At present, transportation is inconvenient. The Ministry will subsidize radios and dry batteries in various provinces in the second half of this year. Except for the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang, which will be allocated radios according to regulations, the remaining provinces will uniformly verify and issue cash according to the price, which will be selected, purchased, distributed, and transported by the Education Department of each province. The Ministry will also verify and provide transportation costs according to regulations.

(2) The Ministry's subsidy for the price of dry batteries in various provinces is limited to one set per radio installed by the Ministry. If educational institutions that install their own radios are unable to afford dry battery consumers due to special circumstances, they may also submit a request to the Education Department for verification and transfer to the Ministry for appropriate subsidies.

(3) The Education Department of each province should submit a request for the price of radios and dry batteries in accordance with the quantity stipulated by the Ministry in the second half of this year, limited to one request. If the request is not made by the end of January of the 28th year, the price will be distributed separately and will not be reissued.

(4) The Education Department of each province should plan in advance, list them separately, and submit them to the Ministry for the price of radios and dry batteries. The Ministry will quickly review and reply (the radio form should list the name of the institution, location, type of machine installed, machine price, transportation, and tax fees, etc. The dry battery form should list the name of the institution, location, type and quantity of dry batteries, price, transportation, and tax fees, etc.).

(5) After receiving the notice of approval from the Ministry, the Education Department of each province should immediately order goods from manufacturers, distribute them, and obtain a copy of the invoice and transportation fee receipt, together with the printed receipt from the department, to submit to the Ministry for verification and issuance of the price.

(6) In areas closer to the central radio stations directly under the central government or the provincial radio stations in each province, radios with fewer vacuum tubes should be issued as appropriate (two or three lamps are sufficient). In towns with AC power sources, DC radios should not be issued, so as to save material resources.

(7) When purchasing and distributing radios and dry batteries, domestic products should be purchased as much as possible, and priority should be given to purchasing from the Changsha Central Wireless Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Plant.

Rendaye Xuerzi Kairole Qu Fu En Leikofski

Seesaw Battle Ends in a 3-3 Tie

Tung Wah attacked first with great momentum, and St. Francis de Sales had little resistance. Wu Binghao and Jia Youliang made two crosses each, but Wan Xianghua missed the opportunities, which was a pity. After seven minutes, Xianghua picked the ball, and A Dai made a feint. Shen Shiyan headed the ball from five yards out, bouncing it off Capeboute's shoulder and into the net. Tung Wah took the lead. Several consecutive attacks put St. Francis de Sales in danger. After fifteen minutes, St. Francis de Sales' Leikofski went deep, and Zhang Zhaopeng missed a foot. Kairole Qu shot from 25 yards out. Zhou Dayun rushed out of the goal but failed to catch the ball, which slipped into the net, tying the score at 1-1. After that, Tung Wah's attack was effective. Five minutes later, Tung Wah's good fortune came. Wu Binghao cut in from the side, and Dai Linjing and Shen Shiyan rushed up together. Shen Shiyan forcefully collided with Capeboute, and both the player and the ball went into the net. Tung Wah took the lead again at 2-1. Five minutes later, Rendaye shot, and Dayun was out of position. Zhaoxiang retreated and kicked the ball out. Xu Chengxun accidentally fouled and was awarded a penalty kick. Fu En scored, tying the score at 2-2. After thirty-four minutes, Dai Linjing's shot was blocked. Wu Binghao's low shot was caught by Capeboute but lost again, flowing into the net. Tung Wah took the lead for the third time at 3-2. But Xuerzi's close shot bounced off the wood and into the net, ending the first half with a 3-3 tie.

Two Goals in a Sudden Comeback

After switching sides, both Tung Wah and St. Francis de Sales had chances. Zhang Zhaopeng was injured and left the field but returned shortly after. After fifteen minutes, Pantuo Xun was awarded a free kick because Jiang Zhaoxiang fouled. Kairole Qu headed the ball into the right corner. Dayun was unable to save it. St. Francis de Sales took the lead for the first time at 4-3. But just one minute later, Tung Wah launched an attack from the center line, and A Dai made a low shot near the goal, immediately tying the score at 4-4. After an hour of mutual attacks, Fu En crossed, and Zhaoxiang intercepted. Endaye intercepted, just a short distance away, and flicked it into the bottom corner, taking the lead again. Tung Wah, seeing the seriousness of the situation, launched an all-out attack. St. Francis de Sales tried their best to defend. As the last three minutes approached, Tung Wah had still not made any progress. The audience stood up. Unexpectedly, Xu Chengxun suddenly displayed his skills, scoring a goal out of nowhere, tying the score at 5-5. With an unexpected goal, the attack became even stronger. In the last minute, A Dai hooked the ball, Jia shoveled and passed to A Wan, and Wan Xianghua made a low shot, immediately touching the net, making it 6-5. Tung Wah immediately turned defeat into victory. Although Xianghua left the field due to injury, it was no longer critical. The whistle blew loudly. Tung Wah defeated St. Francis de Sales 6-5. The fans congratulated each other, saying, "What a swift path!"

Free Talk

### "Face" and Changing Faces

— Du Qin

Upper-class Chinese people like to talk about "face". Because they like to talk about "face", they often have to change their faces. — This sounds strange, but it is indeed the case.

We Chinese naturally know what "face" is. However, some foreigners who study China say that "face" is like the "rites" of ancient China, and it is difficult to find an equivalent word to translate it. It is indeed very difficult to explain the term "face" clearly. However, in general, "saving face" is nothing more than not exposing something embarrassing that has been done. — This is certainly not the essence of "face", but I really can't think of a clearer way to say it for a moment, so I'll just count it for now. In fact, the aspects that face-ism plays out are extremely broad.

There is a story passed down from the late Qing Dynasty. A minor official harbored a grudge against a senior official. He deliberately ran up to him when the senior official was seeing off guests and whispered, as if reporting a confidential matter: "Would it be okay to give your mother to this humble official as a wife?" The people nearby could not hear what was said, so the senior official replied loudly; "Yes, yes. Do it tomorrow, do it tomorrow." This was because it did not hurt his "face", that is, it was not exposed, so he dealt with it in this way. However, the officials of the late Qing Dynasty also had a way: when he was talking to a subordinate, if that person accidentally exposed some of his secrets, that is, hurt his "face" a little, he would give you a cold shoulder, suddenly sinking his face, as if he didn't recognize you at all, saying: "I forgot your esteemed name ——" The meaning is to give the other party a "face" slap as well. This is a concrete manifestation of changing faces for the sake of face.

But no matter what, the so-called "face" is really like the "rites" of the past, just a trick of the upper classes. In fact, the lower classes do not have this kind of thinking. If you don't believe it, try to inquire from the mouths of the lower classes, they never say the word "face". Of course, they often scold people for being "shameless", but that meaning is much simpler. It is quite different from "saving face".

Because of this, the lower classes are not as likely to change their faces as the upper classes. Yesterday you said he was my partner, today you say he is my enemy, and tomorrow you slap yourself in the face, saying that I was originally his godson. Yesterday I said I was an iron man, today I say I am "serving the public despite illness", but tomorrow I frown and say that I have an "illness" and cannot "serve the public"... How can the lower classes play these tricks?

Although we sometimes see in the literature that the lower classes seem to be changing their faces, in reality, they are mostly "masks" painted for them by the upper classes. For example, the Boxers, if we were to recognize their faces in the "Donghua Sequel", they would first be "Boxer bandits", but later they would become "righteous people", and finally they would become "Boxer bandits" again. However, as long as those who truly understand history know that the real face-changer was the current dynasty that was saving its own face, while the Boxers were always just the Boxers. Zai Fu, one of the protagonists at the time, was a bandit by birth. After his face was painted with a "mask", he was very surprised and even wrote a letter to Ronglu to ask him what was going on. To criticize him in Shanghai dialect, it would be called "not knowing his place".

The sages of China are clever. They called the upper classes "gentlemen" and the lower classes "petty people". In this way, the upper classes are always good people, and the lower classes are always bad guys. "The virtue of the gentleman is wind, the virtue of the petty man is grass." The upper classes are elusive, making it difficult for people to figure them out, but you only see the lower classes falling east and west.

Because the lower classes don't "save face" and don't have knowledge, they allow the upper classes to sometimes elevate them to patriots and sometimes demote them to "bandits". As for the upper classes, of course, they are always "gentlemen" until death. Here is another irrelevant example.

It is said that when Shanghai had just fallen, some Jiangbei people guarded the traffic entrances of the concessions and the southern city, and pointed to the badges on their chests and said frankly: "We are traitors, understand?" This is certainly the truth. But only the traitors of the lower classes would be so honest. If the traitors of the upper classes would not be so stupid. Not only would they never admit that they were traitors, but they would also scold the traitors in front of you.

### Old Liu

— He Longsheng

Rain like cow's hair, wind with a chilling sound. The sky was somewhat displeasingly gray, and the shadow of brightness seemed hidden in one place.

Such weather truly spoils the scenery, dampening people's desire to travel. "How annoying..." Old Wang, wearing a sharp suit and holding a pipe, walked to the window, complaining to the sky.

"There are many annoying things, young masters only know how to play." Old Chen, wearing thick glasses of eight hundred degrees, was staring intently at the Outline of Chinese Literature History when he was provoked by Old Wang's words, and said impatiently.

"...What does a fool know?... Eat, drink, and be merry... If you were like this, you wouldn't have any worries in your life!... Life is like a mayfly, never secure, do you remember Old Liu's hand?... "

"People without thoughts are simply equivalent to pigs!"

Old Wang and Old Chen argued as if they were about to fight.

Mentioning Old Liu, excitement and sadness surged into my heart!

...On the rugged road, our ambulance drove forward... We spotted enemy planes tracking us, we immediately stopped the car... and hid in the fields... bullets fell like hail... the world is so big, where can we be safe... we are all going to die!... "Haha!" Old Liu told us triumphantly when he returned.

"Bullets have no eyes, be careful!" But he never took it to heart. Day followed dusk, and dusk followed day, and it had been a long time since we had seen him return. We were suspicious and fearful. Later, the truth told us: he was injured--when his car set off and was halfway, suddenly, red and green signals appeared in the sky. Although he knew things were bad, the quick-witted him didn't have time to escape. Mother-son bombs shot straight over as if they had eyes, and fresh blood stained his snow-white clothes. Ah! They, they, three people were harmed--he lost his left arm, one lost a leg, and another was fatally wounded and died on the way.

Lying on the snow-white sickbed was he, missing an arm, without a trace of worry, calm and dignified, as if praying for something.

"...What does it matter--you don't have to worry, I can be discharged in a few days..." He said, "It's also interesting to say, I was originally a rescuer, and now people are rescuing me."

"Humans are inherently interdependent and coexist... loving others is loving oneself, harming others is harming oneself..." I interjected.

A smile appeared on his face, as if he had gained a little comfort and became excited.

"Jackals will eat people, and as a result, die at the hands of hunters!..."

"...What does it matter to lose an arm for others! People have already lost their lives for me! Losing an arm makes me useless? No! If the left arm is broken, there is still the right arm. Old Wen lost a leg, but he still has one leg. Old Sheng's body died, but his spirit will never die!... Our blood will never run out, and the soul of the nation will never be extinguished!... Look! See how long they live! The day of 'justice' is the time when 'might' dies. We must identify our goals and move forward through thorns!... Survival obtained with blood is true survival; history written with blood is glorious history... Forward! Forward!"

He forgot all the pain, raised! He raised his only arm, clenched his fist and shouted, as if hot blood was boiling, like a volcano erupting, breaking through the deathly silent ward, touching the heartstrings of every patient!

Hey! Old Liu's words and his figure, when I think of them now, are still vivid as a picture. But now, I don't know where he has gone. Perhaps, in order to fulfill his mission, he is continuing to move towards the path of light!

Faintly, I heard the old ox humming from afar:

"Bleeding for the country, the country will not perish, resist! Resist!—"

Black clouds gradually disappeared, and the east revealed a faint light.

### In Wu Jia Xiang

— Ren Yong

Three years ago, I left Wu Jia Xiang. But I don't miss her too much, because Jiangwan is not without its beauty, and I can find the true meaning in the realistic environment, so why should I pointlessly miss the past.

However, now I intensely miss the past, and in picture after picture of memories, beautiful Wu Jia Xiang rushes to float up first. I deeply remember her, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes in the middle of the night.

Wu Jia Xiang has a living beauty! There, there are five hundred acres of land, there, there are countless young men and women. Among us, there are men as strong as iron bulls, there are maidens as brave as Mulan, our younger siblings are still infants whose milky smell has not yet dried. The older ones are wearing old student uniforms and blue cheongsams, and the younger ones are all mighty boy scouts, with thick bare legs, showing rosy faces, what is this? Isn't this a living beauty?

Early morning is the most lovely time. In the clear breeze of the morning, at the sound of a bugle, groups of young people swarm out of the surrounding dormitories, habitually lining up. The physical education teacher shouts on the high platform in front of the flagpole, the bugler sounds a blast, the beautiful national flag solemnly climbs to the top of the ten-zhang pole, a thousand people stand on the field, but there is not a single sound, each person is like an iron pillar, saluting the national flag with the greatest respect! Neat, solemn, isn't this a living beauty?

The national flag is fluttering at the top of the pole, and the magnificent morning meeting song roars loudly along with the loudspeaker: "...Caressing the wounds of the Songhu battle, quelling the injustice, a surge of hot blood rushes to the heart for thousands of zhang, when will the national prestige be promoted, the sovereignty asserted, talents emerge...bravely advance! Forward, young people of Shangzhong!..." Ah, what a thoroughly energetic morning.

During the day, we are all busy with our studies, Longmen Building and Xianmian Hall are the places where we exercise our brains. After four o'clock, these two Western-style buildings become quiet, and groups of us, taking off our student uniforms, rush madly to the sports field and gymnasium, where we forge our muscles and bones. Literature and martial arts, how can either be spared?

The setting sun is quickly slipping towards the west, the national flag, its face flushed, crawls down the ten-zhang pole, the heroic bugle sound orders every young man to stand still, still like an iron pillar, protecting our national flag, slowly crawling down.

In the evening, the five hundred acres of land are all quiet, the window holes of the dormitory emit light, and our partners are struggling desperately with knowledge again. Literature and martial arts, how can either be spared?

However, I have been separated from this kind of life for three years. That kind of living beauty constantly returns to the edge of my eyes, I squint at it, I silently recall it.

Recall, reverie, recall, reverie; I am shocked without realizing it! Now, I wonder what kind of flag is fluttering on the ten-zhang pole? In the three-dimensional dormitory, what has become of our desks and iron beds?

However, every morning, the bugle sounds seem to still roar in my ears, and the national flag seems to still flutter between my eyebrows. I can't help but sing the "Morning Meeting Song" from Wu Jia Xiang, and on the drying platform, I stand alone like an iron pillar, vigorously doing calisthenics alone. Just one drying platform is equivalent to a vast square of five hundred acres. Memories are useless, we need to work, we need to work eternally!

### Ode to Life and Death

— Shaoguang

Fireworks fill the sky,

Illuminating our bright future,

The stirring bugle,

Awakens the dreams of the Chinese nation.

Who is not a dignified seven-foot body?

How can we willingly be slaughtered and trampled!

We want to live--but we are not afraid of death,

(Death, must be a death of value!)

To have the courage to risk life in the face of danger,

Only then are we worthy of being human in the current century!

To have the determination to sacrifice oneself for righteousness,

Only then can we strive for the eternal life of the country!

We want to live, but not to steal life,

(Life, must be a life of meaning!)

Now, every corner,

Is filled with the cries of killing the enemy,

Hot blood, hot strength,

Four hundred million hearts,

Formed into an iron-like

New great Great Wall!

Enduring all suffering,

Forging a tenacious and extraordinary spirit;

Recognizing the times, recognizing friends and enemies,

And even more recognizing our mission;

The evil iron hooves will not be driven away for a day,

The sacred War of Resistance will not stop for a moment!

Remember, then--

The people of all China,

Live--live for the nation!

Die--die for the country!

### Watching Popularity and Missing Fallen Friends on the Battlefield

— Xiangdong

He throws himself into the infinite space,

—Never looking back or hesitating,

Only tragically, shedding the last string of brilliance,

Then ends this life of hundreds of millions of years!

### "Prosperity Policy"

— Sangzi

According to various reports: The culture that "Bushido" brought us early on was: burning, looting, raping, and killing; its purpose was to seek the establishment of a "new order", so they used this spirit of Yamato to destroy everything "old" of ours as much as possible. However, as a result, they were greatly disappointed. The "new order" of "scars all over, stench everywhere" was indeed created for them, but at the same time, they lost a large number of objects that could be exploited and sucked. This is a phenomenon that violates what they originally wanted, and of course they are not willing to have this phenomenon exist, so there is the implementation of a periodical "both hard and soft" policy.

The so-called "hard" policy is still the old set: burn, loot, rape, kill; but in order to take care of the "soft" aspect, the means used seem to be slightly more "civilized" than before. As for the so-called "soft" policy, it is simply playing tricks there, deceiving themselves and others; but the general "nouveau riche" under their wings are using it as the basis for promoting the "royal road paradise". Of course, as a result of combining hard and soft tactics, they have achieved considerable success, but before long, they have obviously failed again. Not only did the so-called "undesirable people" not bite, but even a group of so-called "good people" gradually understood their role. They also know that the content of the appeasement policy they implemented is not substantial enough, so they cannot win "popular support" and reap real benefits, so they innovate again and use the "prosperity policy" to assist the promotion of the appeasement policy.

The policy of prosperity is to widely establish "opium dens", "clubs" and "brothels". They incite their pawns to engage in promotion with the reason of prospering the market and increasing tax revenue. Those "nouveau riche" who have "benefits" to reap, of course, work desperately. Therefore, this policy has achieved satisfactory "results", and they are very happy because of this, believing that this can not only obtain huge amounts of wealth and save them from poverty, but also create a "prosperous" "new order" to boast to the world.

The isolated island is flourishing and the source of wealth is prosperous, and they are very envious of it. However, because the situation is special, it is not convenient to intervene, so they can only implement their prosperity policy in a corner of the West Shanghai, luring the general islanders to pay them "prosperity" fees every day, and recently it has spread to Hongkou and Pudong.

The isolated island is now surrounded by this prosperity policy that is destroying our nation's physical strength, demoralizing our nation's will, and destroying our nation's morality. The general islanders should recognize the environment and restrain their vital energy. If they die under the prosperity policy, they will not only fail their ancestors, but also fail themselves.

### Shanghai Road Names That Have Become History

— Run Gui

In Shanghai decades ago, the road names were very different from what they are now. At that time, most of the road names were taken from the local place names, but these have after all been eliminated into historical names, only occasionally found in the mouths of some people. Here, you can get a complete picture of it.

The most familiar to the general old Shanghainese is Yangjingbang, but this is also an old name. Now, making fun of the Chinese-style English is called Yangjingbang, because Yangjingbang was the earliest place to come into contact with foreigners; in addition, the Public Concession Land Regulations Law is also named Yangjingbang Regulations Law. In fact, Yangjingbang is a river parallel to Suzhou Creek, Caohejing, and Beixin Creek at the intersection of the British and French concessions; now it has been filled in and has become the famous Edward Road.

The general Shanghainese also know very well about the event of Edward Road replacing Yangjingbang. A few foreigners gave special names to the roads that intersect with Edward Road; the intersection of the Bund and Edward Road is called "Outer Yangjing Bridge"; there was also a bridge at the corner of Sichuan Road intersecting with Edward Road, but later, because the river was filled in, the bridge was also gone, which is the "Second Yangjing Bridge"; at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Edward Road is the Third Yangjing Bridge. As for the intersection of Henan Road and Edward Road, it is certainly not the "Fourth Yangjing Bridge", its name at the time of its destruction was "Sanmaoge Bridge", because there was a temple at that time, and the name was "Sanmaoge". The names of these "Second Yangjing Bridge", "Third Yangjing Bridge!" and "Sanmaoge Bridge" have been publicly recognized by the bus company, and these Chinese local names are also used in the markings on the corner of the road or on the fare list.

At one time, two bridges were built on the surface of the Yangjingbang River, one on Hubei Road and the other on Jiangxi Road. At that time, the names were "East New Bridge" and "West New Bridge". Although the bridges have been demolished, the names are still kept. In addition, there is a unique bridge that crosses Yangjingbang on Shandong Road, which is "Daijun Bridge".

Most Chinese people are unwilling to say Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, and Guangdong Road when referring to the famous five roads in Shanghai, but prefer to say "Da Malu" (Great Road), "Er Malu" (Second Road), ... for convenience. Do you know "Liu Malu" (Sixth Road)? This is Beihai Road, which is a very short east-west road between Guangdong Road and Edward Road, and connects to Yu Qiaqing Road—formerly called Xizang Road (Tibet Road).

Chinese people also like to divide a whole road into several sections and add a special name to each section. For example, Henan Road in Nanjing Road is famous for "Paqiu Chang" (Ball-throwing Field); the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is named "Risheng Lou" (Rising Sun Building). The origin of these names is because there will be an entertainment place or a teahouse at the corner of the road. At the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road, there is also "Qipan Jie" (Chessboard Street), which is where bookstores are concentrated; however, no one knows why it is called this name. Some say that there are often many professional chess stalls set up along the road, enticing people to bet money; others say that the name comes from the fact that Henan Road, Fuzhou Road, Jiaotong Road, and Shandong Road look very much like the four squares of a chessboard. Now Fuzhou Road is famous as "Cultural Street", which is because there are many bookstores.

There is a "Baoshan Street" (Precious Good Street) on Guangdong Road, near the corner of Hubei Road. Although the road has been hidden, the road name is still remembered. Similarly, between Hankou Road and Hubei Road, there is a "Daxin Street" (Great New Street).

There are also two "Slanting Bridges" in Shanghai, but neither bridge can be found; one of them is on Jing'an Temple Road, and the other is the Slanting Bridge of Lime Harbor. Near the West Gate, there was also a bridge that surrounded the city; speaking of the city moat, now it is impossible to find its traces, and the road name is "Xinkai He" (New Opened River).

### Reader's Voice Two Types of "National Disaster Money" Makers

— Qiuwen

Last month, Dr. Ma Yinchu submitted a request to the central government to severely punish those who make "national disaster money." Since the "August 13th" incident, after carefully observing in the isolated island, it is really unknown how many unscrupulous merchants are engaged in making "national disaster money." Although these unscrupulous merchants adhere to secrecy, they cannot escape the attention of the masses. As far as I know, the following two types are the most harmful ways of making "national disaster money." Of course, these are just a few of the dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of types of businesses. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a few silver shops and money houses on the isolated island (the area around a certain road being the most) began to act wildly. There are countless bosses who have made a fortune. They are all greedy for huge profits and secretly sell large amounts of red-white gold and silver coins to a certain side. They have a kind of secret deal for regular customers (such as silver shops in various counties in the interior) if they sell gold and silver to them. This kind of pupil plate exceeds the market price greatly. For example, recently, the price of each tael of sterling silver is two yuan, but they can offer two yuan and three jiao. The Central Bank exchanges hard currency for legal currency, and each yuan can increase by one jiao and five fen, but they can exchange each yuan of hard currency for one yuan and three jiao of legal currency. A few customers who are overwhelmed by profit naturally sell to them regardless of the pros and cons. However, if someone occasionally questions their outlet, they either say they directly remit to the central government, or they say they transport it to Hong Kong; or they are entrusted by a certain giant merchant to buy it on their behalf. In fact, the latter two actions are illegal. And cannot escape the crime of making "national disaster money"! As for the location where they contact customers, it is usually in a closed room in a hotel. Even the staff in the store have no way of detecting it.

The small rice merchants in the Zhabei, Hongkou, and Nanshi areas are inevitably affected by the war and suffer losses. Since they do not have huge capital to rebuild their old business in the concession, they perversely go astray. Since the autumn harvest in the rural areas of the interior last year, the general rice merchants have been active. First, they went to a certain side to obtain a transportation pass. Then, they agreed with a certain department of a certain side that after purchasing new rice in the interior, they would directly sell it to them as military rations. He takes a commission from it. If the quantity exceeds a certain amount, he can also ask a certain side to send someone to protect him along the way. It is said that there is indeed a considerable number of people engaged in this business on the isolated island, and there are also not a few who have become wealthy men!

The names "Lao Wen", "Xin Zha", and "Zhabei" can also often be heard. The meaning of "Lao Zha" is a construction of the waterline of the Blee River. Fujian Road is paved with northern materials, so it is still called "Shi Lu" (Stone Road), and Fujian Road Bridge is also named "Shi Qiao" (Stone Bridge). Speaking of bridges, Jiangxi Road Bridge is also named "Zilai Shui Qiao" (Tap Water Bridge), which is named because of the tap water stack tower next to the bridge.

Before it became famous, Henan Road was called "Tie Ma Lu" (Iron Horse Road). This is because the Songhu Railway passed through the north of it. A more peculiar word is "Tou Ji Qiao" (Chicken-stealing Bridge), which is at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, which means that there is a small stone bridge there, but there are no traces of it now; as for the reason for calling it "Chicken-stealing", no one knows.

The next road on Sichuan Road where the Chinese Youth Association is located is "Lao Jie" (Old Street)--very narrow. Before the latest construction, this was a narrow old city street filled with butcher shops, taverns, and restaurants. When the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to have the road names baptized, there were indeed many local names that were selected and adopted, such as "Wufu Long" (Five Blessings Lane), "Jin Yang Jie" (Golden Ocean Street), "Tang Jia Long" (Tang Family Lane), "Shou Jia Qiao" (Shou Family Bridge), etc. Similarly, in the central area, the north-south roads are named after Chinese provinces, such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Guizhou Road, Yunnan Road, etc.; and the east-west roads are named after major Chinese cities, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Beijing Road, Guangdong Road, Suzhou Road, etc. (Translated from the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post)

### New Wedding Night “His Exciting Night” Produced by Universal Pictures Shown at Cathay Theater

— Yanhua

Quel Rogges is a comedian's clown, he doesn't give me a deep impression, but I remember one thing, that he and Roland Young (who has starred in "Windy Romance") are comedians' clowns of light humor.

But for Quel Rogges to independently star in this "New Wedding Night", it seems that he is not qualified enough in terms of reputation and business assurance.

Regarding the whole play, I would like to talk about it from several aspects:

First, in terms of the script creation, I think that the writing technique in the local part is still quite lovely, especially after the company employee Adam was rumored to have fallen off a cliff and died, the family suspected that he was "a ghost returning to life", in the atmosphere of comedy, it has achieved very good results.

But at the same time, we have to point out that the abrupt and unnatural development of the story of the whole script damages the unity of the entire film. The most obvious example is: the car driver with mental problems, his appearance, his desire to commit suicide because he can't sing, etc., this can indeed be regarded as strengthening the effect of comedy, but using overly far-fetched characters or overly rigid techniques to reluctantly help this drama, then its failure is expected. The key is about the personality of the characters. In my personal opinion, writing Quel Rogges (Adam) as a cowardly and timid character should have achieved good results in this comedy, but Adam's previous cowardice and his sudden excessive bravery and rudeness after drinking, if the playwright could strengthen the opposition, then the ending of the whole play would be much better than it is now. Because in this script, at the end, Adam's brave mood after anger is too weak after all.

Second, what should be mentioned is naturally the director's technique. I said earlier that this play reveals this weakness in terms of atmosphere because the center of gravity written in the script before and after is uneven. That is, after Adam gets angry at the end, when he orders the company manager to admit all the insults and mistakes, the power of the drama is greatly weakened in the contrast of the drama before and after.

The director did not use better techniques to supplement and strengthen it for this ending, so the play loosened up uncontrollably at the end.

However, in the atmosphere of the whole family treating Adam as a ghost, in terms of directing techniques, it is indeed not bad, the bride's aunt faints when she sees Adam, the black servant is frightened and at a loss when he sees Adam (we always feel infinitely disgusted with the American film's portrayal of blacks as so stupid), Annie faints when she sees Adam..., these things, in the comedic atmosphere of treating people as ghosts, it does pull the audience's emotions tightly together.

The entire cast, except for Quel Rogges, who has a lot of screen time, the rest of the cast does not have a lot of screen time, especially the female roles seem to have too little screen time.

### Rain Clears Up, First Installment: One-Armed Old Man Organizes Free Village; Twin Daughters Pay Respect at Martyrs' Tomb

— Bao Tianxiao

Old Master Zhu's granddaughter was sent to Doctor Zhang's hospital, where Doctor Zhang took great care of her. She gave her a name, Zhu Airen, the name Airen meaning "spreading love." She taught her to read and write. Fortunately, there were many people in the hospital, including the nursing ladies. The church also ran a primary school, and Doctor Zhang treated this country girl like her own daughter. Zhu Airen was very lively, jumping in and out, and had many sisters. All her clothes were made for her by Doctor Zhang. Time passed quickly, and Zhu Airen was seventeen years old and had graduated from high school. At that time, Doctor Zhang had an American girlfriend, also a female doctor, who was about to return to her country. Doctor Zhang entrusted her to take her goddaughter, Zhu Airen, to America. Fortunately, she had a good foundation in English from her school in her own country. After studying at an American medical school for four or five years, her knowledge naturally greatly improved. Zhu Airen was no longer the country girl she once was. In fact, Doctor Zhang had a deep intention in sending her to study in America. Since Doctor Zhang established this women and children's hospital, it had gradually expanded, and its scale had become even larger. In addition to the main hospital, which was still in the large city, there were several branches, and besides the hospitals, there were also several nurseries. Even the scale of the main hospital was different from before. It covered nearly a hundred acres, and the buildings were all newly built five-story and six-story buildings. All facilities were available. Although it was a women and children's hospital, it was the most complete modern women and children's hospital. There was also a large and beautiful garden surrounding it, with clear water and lush trees, and quiet flowers and birds. Because in recent years, women have been going to the hospital for childbirth, the hospital has become increasingly busy. Although each branch hospital had a director, and each nursery also had a director, the person in charge of the overall management was still Doctor Zhang Wenqi alone. Therefore, she wanted to cultivate her goddaughter, Zhu Airen, to inherit her career in the future, so that she could entrust someone with it. After Zhu Airen returned to her country, she naturally served in her own hospital, helping her godmother, Doctor Zhang, a great deal. Although Doctor Zhang had also studied abroad, the world of medicine was changing rapidly, with countless new inventions and theories every year. The new was coming out, and the old was gradually being eliminated. What she had learned was the latest, so she naturally benefited a great deal in medicine and technology. Moreover, Doctor Zhang was busy with medical administration and didn't have time for academic research every day. (8)

### Appreciating Dance: 1. What is Dance?

— Jiasheng

What is dance? This is a question that should be explained first.

In China, the art of dance has not yet been noticed, so the general public's concept of it is that dance is the kind of dancing that takes place in hotels or dance halls to the rhythm of jazz music, as well as the dancing of those low-taste song and dance troupes. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Of course, that kind of dance is also a kind of dance, but in terms of the origin and development of dance, as well as cultural principles, it cannot be considered a legitimate form of dance. At most, it can only be said to be a decorative social item of the leisured class since the era of commercial capitalism, and it even harms the progress of legitimate dance.

So, what exactly is legitimate dance?

Dance originally originated from human actions. With humans, there were the basic postures of dance. When writing and painting had not yet emerged, primitive people's will and emotions were almost entirely reflected in dance and music. Later, the development of dance could not escape this task, so it can be said that dance is the organized expression of the form of human consciousness and emotion. Its content is based on the same principles as literature or other arts. The only difference is the tools of expression. In other words, dance does not use words or language, but uses the beautiful shapes and postures of human movements, whether fine lines or coarse lines, to describe human actions and emotions. Moreover, its content and postures also change with the times. For example, "prayer dances" can only be produced in a society dominated by religion.

2. Qualitative Analysis of Dance

To appreciate dance, one must first understand the essence of various dances, such as folk dance, lyrical dance, narrative dance, athletic dance, and social dance.

Athletic dance is only a kind of beautiful movement for cultivating physical health, and social dance fundamentally lacks artistry, so we will not discuss it. What we want to talk about here are the various meaningful dances that are staged for performance.

"Folk dance" is a kind of folk dance, just like folk songs in Western music, but it uses the postures of body movements to express the folk way of life. Therefore, from this kind of dance, one can recognize the characteristics of the nation and the unique postures of labor. For example, after watching the "Spanish Sowing Dance," one knows that the labor postures of Spanish farmers are clearly different from those of other nations. At the same time, when we appreciate the crude and straightforward linear postures of "folk dance," we must not despise them, but react and see that this is its characteristic. The so-called straightforward and simple beauty of farmers' movements.

"Lyrical dance" is a kind of dance that is extremely rich in poetry. In France, some people have called it "dance poetry." This kind of dance uses extremely delicate postures and aesthetic movements to describe soft subjects. Moreover, these subjects are often taken from beautiful myths or love stories. Appreciating this kind of dance can be regarded as the same as "nocturnes" or "tone poems" in music.

"Narrative dance" is like narrative poetry, using sequential postures to describe an entire historical event. Ancient narrative dances mostly described the great deeds of heroes and the comedies and tragedies of the love of knights and beauties. Medieval narrative dances naturally described God. The "Genesis Dance" was produced in this era. Modern and contemporary narrative dances mostly describe the collective actions of people. Narrative dance is the prototype of mime, but it is different from mime, because the movements of "narrative dance" are purely dance postures, without the elements of drama movements.

"Lyrical dance" and "narrative dance" were staged very early. "Folk dance" has also been brought to the stage in modern times. Therefore, these types of dances are called stage dances, and their effects are even more profound on the stage.

Since these types of dances are staged, they need to be coordinated with the conditions on the stage, such as lighting, costumes, scenery, and especially the creation of dance music and the application of dance music. When appreciating stage dances, one must not neglect the value of these objective conditions in coordinating. (To be continued)

### A Colorful Record of Theatrical Events in Beijing and Tianjin

— Yu Gong

Mr. Shen Mugong, the owner of Xiaozhilian Hall, sent a letter from the ancient capital yesterday, reporting in great detail the theatrical events in Beijing and Tianjin. His comments were insightful and penetrating. I have extracted and recorded them here to inform the readers. The ancient city has fallen, but the chrysanthemum (theater) industry has developed in a distorted way. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about. Meng Xiaodong performed the complete "Hong Yang Dong and Related Bone Stealing" in Beijing. Her teacher, Yu Shuyan, personally supervised the performance. Several "friendly nation" people, including the president of the ×× bank, watched the play. They purchased tickets from Meng's manager in advance, but only got seats in the seventh or eighth row. It was said that the front rows had already been sold in advance. However, a few hours before the performance, a large number of tickets for the second and third rows were found to be available. The bank president then bought them all at a high price and told Meng's manager that when Xiaodong took the stage, he would "draw lots" as revenge, causing her extreme embarrassment. Meng was very embarrassed and almost shed tears. She then asked someone to mediate with the bank president, and the matter was settled. Meng suffered this stimulus, and her voice suddenly lost its moisture on the stage. The bank president used his money and evil power to make fun of a singing actress, which is truly abominable. This matter caused a sensation in the theater circles of the old capital, but all the major and minor newspapers did not mention a word about it.

The two theaters in Beiping, Xinxin and Chang'an, will perform so-called winter relief charity performances. Xinxin has Cheng Yanqiu and Ma Lianliang's "Ganlu Temple," Hao Shouchen and Li Shaochun's "Lianhuan Tao." Xiaocuihua and Xiao Changhua's repertoire is yet to be determined. The Chang'an Theater has Shang Xiaoyun and Gou Huisheng's "Fan Jiang Guan," and Jin Shaoshan and Ben Wanchun's "Lianhuan Tao." Shaochun is the son of Li Guichun, and Wanchun is Li's son-in-law. They are performing the same play at the same time, which shows the depth of the animosity between the brothers-in-law.

The Tianjin China Grand Theater performed "The International Lions Club Charity Performance" for two days. The lineup of famous actors was complete, and the repertoire was also quite exciting. Ticket prices were divided into four types: five yuan, four yuan, three yuan, and two yuan. A total of more than 17,000 yuan was sold in two days. A commemorative booklet was distributed on the spot. The booklet was beautifully decorated and explained each play performed in both Chinese and English, as well as photos of the famous actors in their costumes and casual clothes. There were no flattering words of praise in it, which is very different from the special publications that are popular in Shanghai, which are full of embellishments.

Cheng Yanqiu was originally scheduled to perform after the charity performance. The repertoire had been announced, and more than half of the tickets had been sold in advance. However, on the day of the performance, he suddenly published a statement in the newspaper, saying that he could not come to Tianjin due to a cold. The tickets sold were refunded. In fact, it was because the charity performance had been sold out every day for several days (there were also five days of performances by the Five Elders Association before the International Lions Club charity performance, and the attendance was also very good), and he was afraid that the good times would not last and that his business would suffer a setback. For the sake of his personal reputation, he was unwilling to continue the performance. The so-called cold was just a pretext.

### "The King of Chu" Undergoes a Marital Change; Yi Hua Abandons Jin Suqin; Thousands of Feet of Film are Sacrificed and Re-shot; Yu Ji is Replaced by Diao Ban Hua

— Xin Shi

Yi Hua Company's costume film "The King of Chu," directed by Wang Cilong, was solemnly prepared for a long time. It was not until last week that the shooting began. The male lead, the King of Chu, is played by Wang Yuanlong, formerly known as the "King of the Silver Screen." Regarding the role of Yu Ji, Yi Hua initially posted a recruitment advertisement, but did not find a good candidate. After searching in many ways, they hired a famous female actor, Jin Suqin. Jin is the number one female actor in the South, with both beauty and talent, surpassing her peers for a time, and is sufficient to add color to the film. Yi Hua hired her at a high price and promised to list her as the leading actress, treating her with utmost courtesy. Unexpectedly, not long after the filming of the film, a sudden change occurred; Yi Hua suddenly and decisively abandoned Jin and decided to replace her with another actor. It is said that this incident occurred because: Jin's delicate body is very weak. She is currently singing at the Golden Theater every night and has fainted twice due to physical exhaustion. Therefore, it is inevitable that she often has difficulty arriving on time for the filming work at Yi Hua. The art of the screen is originally different from stage performance; Jin is often happy to be independent due to excessive self-confidence and fails to follow the director's instructions. At the same time, Yi Hua attaches great importance to this film; and it has been decided that it will be released in the New Light Theater starting from the New Year's Day. For this reason, they feel that the date is approaching and the relationship is not trivial, and it is difficult to delay. They then obtained Jin's consent and immediately stopped the filming. All the thousands of feet of film that had been shot were sacrificed; Diao Ban Hua was assigned to take over the role of Yu Ji and re-shot from scratch. Yi Hua's decision to change plans suddenly was not without reason. Fortunately, not much film had been completed, so the loss was not too great.

### Theatrical News: Renewal Stage Appoints Senior Staff

The shareholders of Renewal Stage will hold a meeting tomorrow (the 10th) to discuss the overall situation in the future. It is said that the senior staff of the front and back stages have been appointed as follows: Ji Xiaofeng as general manager, Qi Jian as manager, Zhou Xiaoqing as chief inspector, Chang Yunheng as back stage manager, and Li Gang and Zhao Ruizhang as deputy managers.

Lin Shusen Joins Charity Performance of "Intercepting the River." Famous actor Lin Shusen will participate in the Lingjie United Association's charity performance for Pushan Villa. The repertoire is scheduled to be "Zhao Zilong Intercepting A Dou" with Zhang Wenqin. Lin has sought Zhang Wenqin's consent. It is reported that the charity performance is scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th.

The Grand Theater Plans to Invite Female Actor Zhu Cuimei. The Grand Theater's female actor, Han Suqiu, is taking a leave of absence due to physical weakness. The theater is actively looking for other actors to fill the gap. It has been introduced that female actor Zhu Cuimei, who has taken refuge in Linchuan from Hunan, is being contacted. If it works out, she will leave for Shanghai soon.

Jin Xiqin Terminates Contract with Golden Theater

Female actor Jin Suqin, since joining the Golden Theater, was originally scheduled to perform until the end of the year. Now, Suqin feels physically weak and has requested the Golden Theater to end her performance early. It is now scheduled to end on the 19th of the lunar month, and she will leave on the 20th.

### "Realizing a Dream" and Other Performances: "Guanghua Fellowship's Art and Entertainment Evening" at the YMCA

— Jun Yang

The "Guanghua Christian Fellowship" held a "Guanghua Fellowship's Art and Entertainment Evening" at the YMCA in Baxianqiao on the 7th and 8th to help refugees. All proceeds from ticket sales were used for refugee relief.

The programs for the two days were slightly different. I went on the first day. The first program was the YMCA Orchestra's performance of "Overture," the second was a "Solo," the third was Wu Xiaobang's "Dance," and the fourth was the play "Realizing a Dream." "Realizing a Dream" was directed by Mr. Wu Renqi, the director of "The Beginning of Man." Audiences who have seen "The Beginning of Man" will probably not forget Mr. Wu Renqi's delicate techniques. In "Realizing a Dream," we still felt Mr. Wu Renqi's intimate touch.

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and Theater in the Old Capital (69): The Landlord of Luoma Lake is Named Ma

— Xu Muyun

In martial arts plays, there is a type of short play that focuses on reciting, dialogue, acting style, and posture. It is neither very noisy nor chaotic, and it can also make the audience feel excited. This type of play can be called a small martial arts play. Plays like "Evil Tiger Village," "Luoma Lake," and "Stealing the Imperial Horse" are all tightly structured and combine martial arts and literary singing. Compared to those monotonous "Overlord Village" and "　Wax Temple," they are a hundred times better. Speaking of this, it reminds people of the late martial arts master Yang Xiaolou. That kind of crisp voice and delicate acting style, will there ever be a second person who can match him? According to some old music lovers, Xiaolou's plays have all become Guangling San (a lost melody).

Luoma Lake is located in the territory of Pisu counties in northern Jiangsu. Although it is not as large as Suzhou's Taihu Lake, it is known to almost everyone due to the promotion of dramas. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi in the early Qing Dynasty, there was a martial arts official who guarded the gate of the harem. His surname was Ma, and I don't remember his name very clearly. This man was originally from Xuzhou. He was very cautious and law-abiding. He did not dare to do anything out of line, and he did not engage in favoritism or corruption. Therefore, he gained the trust of the Grand Chief Manager of the Eighteen Routes (Li Lianying at the end of the Qing Dynasty had this title, managing all affairs in the palace. It remains to be investigated whether this title existed in the early Qing Dynasty.) and was assigned the important task of patrolling the palace at night and guarding the gate of the harem.

Yinzhen (Kangxi's fourth son, later known as Yongzheng) had liked to go out of the palace for leisure since he was a child. He often changed into plain clothes and a small hat to mingle in various social levels among the people. Tea houses, restaurants, and major temples inside and outside the capital were all places he frequented. According to reports, he was fond of martial arts and knew many chivalrous people. He secretly organized a killing group called the Blood Drops to prepare for assassination if the plot to usurp the throne failed. Therefore, he often left early and returned late, rushing back to the palace before the gates closed. Because Kangxi had too many sons, he could not pay attention to his actions, so he became more and more daring later. Once, it happened to snow heavily, and the ground was covered with snow. It was very slippery underfoot, and he was also facing a headwind. He stumbled with every step and walked very slowly. By the time he finally reached the gate of the harem, he saw that the palace gate had already been closed.

"Realizing a Dream" depicts the fantasies of girls. They dream of having a young lover who writes them sweet love letters, sends them roses, and even gives them an engagement ring, but this is just a dream, an "unfulfilled dream."

### Wang Wanyu Writes Seven-Act Play "Return"

— Gu Wei

The young writer Wang Wanying writes in a light and fluent style. His works are often published in this magazine and various newspaper drama sections and are well-loved by readers.

Mr. Wang has a considerable understanding of drama. In the past, in Shanghai and Guangdong, he organized a drama club to specially write and direct various patriotic dramas, which were performed in schools and public institutions, with excellent results. Recently, Mr. Wang, in addition to writing, is also writing a play, which is tentatively named "Return," in seven acts. The content is about a young man who returns from the battlefield: the intention is pure, and it contains a profound educational effect. The plot is bizarre and contains much criticism of society. He has now completed five acts and will finish it within this week. It has not yet been decided whether it will be performed in a theater or published as a separate book. (Pay the bill)

But it is said that girls hope to "realize" this kind of "fantasy," so "Unfulfilled Dream" has also been changed to "Realizing a Dream."

Xiao Feng's Annie is quite capable of revealing the passion that is hidden deep in the hearts of ordinary girls. She refused Han Luo, and after her final request, she still sat on the sofa by the fireplace and wrote an ideal love letter. She is trying to reveal an unstoppable girlish infatuation. Wu Wuliang, who plays Han Luo, may be lacking in stage experience, and he acted a bit too much. I think he should be at least a little gentler. Yuan Rongxiang, who plays Luo Shi, may also be "stage fright." Her voice was too low. But overall, the performance cannot be said to be bad.

Finally, there was Gu Chuanjie's "Selling Horses," but because I have no interest in Kun opera, I had to sacrifice the good show.
