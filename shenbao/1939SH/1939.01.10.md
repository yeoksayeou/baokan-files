### Wang Jingwei Arbitrarily Spreads Rumors, Falsely Accusing Chairman Chiang of Accepting Japanese Conditions, Zhang Fakui and Others Demand Arrest and Execution

(Chongqing) Official circles here have not yet received the full text of the letter published by Wang Jingwei in Hong Kong last night, so there is no comment for the time being. The government has already clarified its views in the declaration issued on New Year's Day, vehemently condemning Wang's "peace movement" as a complete violation of party discipline, so whether there will be any criticism of this letter is also unknown. However, according to reliable sources obtained by Reuters, Wang's claim that Chairman Chiang had accepted the Japanese conditions submitted by the German ambassador as a basis for negotiation before the fall of Nanjing is completely untrue. At that time, the Chinese authorities requested a detailed explanation because the Japanese conditions were quite unclear. This step cannot be considered an action to accept the conditions as a basis for negotiation. Later, because Japan changed its conditions, Chairman Chiang never mentioned the matter again. As for Wang's statement that the assistance of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France cannot affect the outcome of the war, it only shows that Wang is indeed a "defeatist." Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Wang has always held a pessimistic attitude towards the future of China's resistance. This attitude has aroused extremely deep-seated aversion among the generals at the front. It is reported that several people are now requesting the arrest of Wang and his execution, but the highest authorities still believe that Wang will eventually retract his advocacy of peace talks, so the most激烈電文 issued by some generals has been prohibited from being published. People here believe that Wang will not attempt to negotiate with Japan or join the "puppet regime" established by the Japanese. (9th Reuters Telegram)

(Hong Kong) Guangzhou external news, Wang's peace movement seems to have been temporarily shelved after its failure. It is reported that Zeng Zhongming held formal talks with certain personnel in Hanoi on the 9th. Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Mei Siping and others had a meeting in Hong Kong yesterday. (9th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Kuomintang does not attach importance to Wang's letter to Chiang, because all of Wang's current actions are private actions and have no connection with China. Chairman Chiang's headquarters has not yet received the letter. A Chinese spokesman said that this decision is the same as the report published by the Tongmeng Society and the previous report that he will participate in the puppet government, and it is considered that there is no connection. None of Wang's former confidants have been arrested, and all the rumors are rumors. (9th Associated Press Telegram)

(Hong Kong) Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi telegraphed compatriots at home and abroad on the 5th, saying that Wang Zhaoming has betrayed the party and the country, and has spoken for the enemy. The Central Standing Committee has given him the punishment of permanent expulsion from the party, and the National Government has removed him from all positions held concurrently. Now the people of the country are unanimously denouncing him, vowing not to coexist with this traitor to the nation. This army has also appealed to the Central Government to issue an arrest warrant to maintain national law and benefit the war of resistance. This is hereby telegraphed, respectfully hoping for your attention. (8th Telegram)

Lian County: Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou led all the officers and soldiers of the first battle zone and telegraphed the Central National Government on the 5th from the front line, saying that they had just read the resolution of the Provisional Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee regarding Wang Zhaoming's violation of discipline, endangering the party and the country, permanent expulsion from the party, and removal from all positions. Punishing traitors, Fakui and Hanmou humbly lead all the officers and soldiers of the first battle zone to pledge their utmost sincerity and absolute support for the resolution. Zhaoming shamelessly telegraphed and stated his fallacious views on the proposals to the Central Government, being drunk and speaking for the enemy. All officers and soldiers are filled with righteous indignation and believe that, as Wang Zhaoming said, not only is he willing to give up lost territory, break up unity, and ruin the economy, but he is also making wild statements in his telegram, obstructing the war of resistance and blurring the lines between right and wrong. Judging from his actions, he is simply using the pretext of peace to achieve his private desire for open surrender. At this time when the whole country is unanimously determined to fight to the death, the enemy's momentum is declining, and victory is within reach, Wang Zhaoming is losing his mind and recognizing the enemy as a friend, disregarding the loss of hundreds of thousands of miles of land, the injuries and deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the sacrifices of millions of people, and the loss of tens of millions of properties, which are not enough to change his personal dream of wealth and glory. Summarizing his vile behavior of stealing fame and losing integrity, his crimes of betraying the country and the party, even adding 寸磔, would not be enough to cover up his guilt. All the officers and soldiers here humbly believe that the central government's punishment of Zhaoming with only permanent expulsion from the party and removal from all positions seems to be still too lenient. We propose to your seat to further propose to the central government that Zhaoming's surrender to the enemy and betrayal of the country should be ordered by the National Government to be arrested and brought to justice, and to correct the canon and invigorate morale. We have tried this, and we respectfully ask to express the same righteous indignation and unanimous advocacy, so that the traitors who surrender to the enemy and sell the country cannot escape punishment. This is what we pray for. (6th Telegram)

### Xue Yue Discusses Reasons for Silence on the Yangtze Front: Strong Defensive Works Built in the Mufu Mountains of Hunan and Jiangxi, Naval Operations Hampered by Low Water Level in Poyang Lake

(Hong Kong) Changsha Telegram, Xue Yue discussed on the 9th his belief that the Japanese would concentrate their forces to prepare to invade western Guangxi, and cited the reasons for the silence on the Yangtze front: (1) Hunan and Jiangxi have built strong defensive works in the Mufu Mountains, naval operations in Poyang and Dongting Lakes are hampered by low water levels, and only one railway and highway each connect Wuchang Changsha and Jiujiang Nanchang; (2) The Xiqiang River and the Mishui River west into Dongting, and the river east into Duyang, creating a natural defense line between Hunan and Jiangxi; (3) The Mufu Mountains have endless small mountains and trees as a formidable defense. If the Japanese advance south from Wuchang Jiujiang, they will suffer heavy casualties; (4) Before attacking Nanchang Changsha, the Japanese must have four new divisions. Xue finally suggested that in the future, China should concentrate its military, political, and economic power and implement an eastward advance, which will be able to achieve the results of 瓤造 and truly implement a sustained war of resistance.

Editorial

### On "Anti-Communism"

Wang Jingwei's telegram of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country has long been abandoned by the people of the whole country. This newspaper has also repeatedly written articles to refute it. Unexpectedly, according to yesterday's newspaper, Wang has recently spread rumors in Hong Kong, confusing the public, and especially emphasized the "anti-communist" point to confuse people's minds, damage the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and alienate the unity of the Chinese people. His ill intentions are truly hateful. Therefore, we do not hesitate to elaborate and discuss the "anti-communism" point again to correct public opinion.

The so-called "joint anti-communism" is to force China to join the "Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact." Therefore, first, we must understand what the essence of anti-communism is. If we join this pact, will it be beneficial to China?

We can answer directly in one sentence: the Anti-Comintern Pact is a "confounding right and wrong" conspiracy of fascist aggressors. It is their hypocritical guise to cover up their aggression. The famous British political commentator, Gottman, once gave a good explanation of this:

The line of aggression, by raising the "communist bogeyman," can confuse the formidable enemies in the democratic capitalist countries, and many liberals have been confused by it. If these liberals had not been blinded by the fascist anti-communist smoke, they would have opposed aggression long ago.

The aggressors took advantage of this weakness of the democratic countries to carry out their aggression under the smoke screen of "anti-communism." The German-Italian joint attack on Spain was said to be "anti-communism"; Hitler's seizure of Austria and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia was said to be "anti-communism"; the Japanese warlords' large-scale invasion of the Republic of China based on the Three People's Principles was also said to be "anti-communism"! If it is anti-communism, why don't the brown-shirted troops march towards Moscow, but instead "pick on the weak to bully"? If it is anti-communism, the Zhanggufeng conflict should be a very good opportunity to fight against communism. Why did the Japanese warlords turn back? Seen in this way, although the "Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact" is under the guise of "anti-communism," it is actually an organized attack on democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Not long ago, it was widely rumored that a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy was about to be signed, and this alliance was more clearly aimed at Britain, the United States, and France. In a nutshell, the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact is an alliance of aggression. China is a victim of aggression. May I ask if China is willing to cast itself into a net and become a vassal of the aggressors? This is one point. Furthermore, the foundation of China's nation-building is the Three People's Principles, and the spirit of the Three People's Principles lies in the realization of democratic politics. Joining the fascist "Anti-Comintern Pact" is tantamount to abolishing the Three People's Principles and abolishing the Kuomintang. Again, the Anti-Comintern Pact not only makes the Soviet Union its enemy, but also makes democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France the target of its attacks. Today, it is the Soviet Union and countries such as Britain, the United States, and France that are helping China resist Japan. Joining the "Anti-Comintern Pact" is tantamount to "recognizing a thief as one's father" and severing ties with friends. The above points are all based on external relations. Secondly, in terms of internal relations, everyone knows that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the foundation of today's national united front for China's war of resistance and the greatest guarantee for China's war of resistance to achieve final victory. The painful experience of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party over the past ten years has created an opportunity for Japanese imperialism to invade, making the survival of the Chinese nation a problem. Now, they have finally resolutely abandoned their previous grievances and cooperated closely to save China's independence and survival. Today, no one can deny the fact that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party stand together like brothers. Today, the Chinese Communist Party has obviously changed its revolutionary policy and is striving for a China based on the Three People's Principles. The Chinese Communist Party's loyalty to the war of resistance is recognized even by the Japanese. This can be proved by the profound hatred of Japanese imperialism and traitors for the Communist Party.

Since cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become a huge force to prevent Japanese imperialism from invading, Japanese warlords and traitors will naturally do everything possible to destroy it. They took advantage of the prejudices of some people to spread many rumors about friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in an attempt to break up their unity. "Anti-communism" has become a false guise for traitors to sell the country today, and has become a synonym for Japanese warlords to destroy China. The Chinese people should pay great attention to this point.

Therefore, today, the people of China must use all their strength to support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and must deeply understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's announcement in the second year of the Republic of China: "It is not necessary to ask about the size of the party's power, but only to ask whether the policies advocated by our party and its usual actions are in line with public reason and whether they are in line with the times. If the policies are just, upright, and clear, and they are approved by the general public, even with thousands of difficulties and setbacks, we can expect the final victory. As for other parties, in addition to discussing political views, all emotional disputes are not only unnecessary, but also enough to damage the honor of the political party."

As long as the Chinese people sincerely support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all the conspiracies of the enemies and traitors will be useless; as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can strengthen cooperation, the national anti-Japanese united front will inevitably become more and more consolidated, and China's war of resistance will inevitably achieve the final victory.

### Central Memorial Week: Ho Ying-chin Attends and Reports, "Victory in the War of Resistance is Certain, Nation-Building Will Surely Succeed," Everyone Must Have the Determination to Sacrifice for the Country, Cultivate the Courage That Revolutionaries Should Possess

(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegraph, This morning, the 9th, during the Central Memorial Week, Ho Ying-chin gave a broad report stating that victory in the War of Resistance is certain and nation-building will surely succeed. (Special dispatch, 9th)

(Chongqing) On the 9th, Ho Ying-chin reported at the Central Memorial Week (on firming up the belief that victory in the War of Resistance is certain and nation-building will surely succeed). The content was divided into: 1. Reorganization of the army; 2. Replenishment of soldiers; 3. Construction of ordnance and various military industries; 4. Improvement of personnel management and education and training systems. He stated that due to the gradual improvement of the quality of the army, the gradual replenishment of weapons and equipment, and the genuine unification of personnel management and education and training, our national army is becoming stronger as it fights. The enemy, due to the difficulty of a quick victory and quick resolution, has suffered a great blow to its morale. Its military expenditure requires 3 trillion yen per month, its casualties amount to 700,000, 649 aircraft have been shot down, and 2,202 have been damaged due to accidents. More than 580 warships have been injured. The anti-war atmosphere in its country is increasingly intense, and the war-weariness of the combat troops is growing. There is even talk of a century-long war domestically. All these expose their difficulties. The enemy is at the end of its rope, and we must strengthen our belief in certain victory and success. In spirit, we must: (1) Everyone must have the determination to sacrifice for the country and fight the enemy to the death; (2) Everyone must fulfill their responsibilities to the country; (3) We must cultivate the integrity that revolutionaries should possess. Kuomintang members must have the spirit of sacrificing themselves for righteousness, abandoning life for justice, and fearlessness, taking teaching the nation and saving the nation as a lifelong career. Every word and action should be based on the national policy of the country and the leadership of the leader, sacrificing the individual to seek a way out for the country and nation, and never taking individual interests as the premise. One day making one proposal, and the next day making another, treating national affairs as child's play, departing from the position of a revolutionary; (4) We must not be blinded by the enemy's deceptive tactics or swayed by their propaganda policies. Although the battles on various fronts seem calm on the surface, they are actually actively preparing. After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the means of aggression will become more intense, and the desire for a quick victory and quick resolution will become more urgent. With the deep sympathy and assistance of the international community, we should make persistent efforts, prepare for the greatest sacrifices, firmly establish our confidence in victory, calmly respond, and final victory will surely belong to us.

### The Japanese Establish the "China Aviation Corporation" and Exclusively Seize Civil Aviation Rights in China, Excluding Joint Sino-Foreign Aviation Industries

(Chongqing) According to reliable Chinese sources, the "China Aviation Corporation" established by the Japanese is preparing to carry out passenger and mail delivery in various occupied areas.

After formal approval by the "Asia Development Board," it will be launched soon. (Associated Press Telegraph, 9th)

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Resolves to Strengthen Sichuan's Defense Capabilities and Organizes Militias to Back Up the Army

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is holding meetings with military and political leaders in the Southwest. According to reports, when Chairman Chiang spoke with Deng Xihou, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan Province, and Wang Lingji, the Chairman of Sichuan Province, yesterday, he expressed his determination to strengthen defense capabilities, intensify all self-defense measures, organize militias, and mobilize the people to back up the army. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

The main points of Chairman Chiang's discussions with Southwest leaders in the last two days have been about economic issues. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

### The Tragic State of Robbery and Killing by the Japanese Army Invading Guangdong in Jiujiang: More Than a Thousand People Were Killed, and the Loss of Pawnshops Exceeded Ten Million

Shiqi correspondence: Whenever the Japanese army invades Guangdong, upon reaching a town, they implement a policy of arson and looting. Guangzhou was burned and looted, and no essence was spared. Shops and residences, gold and silver treasures, calligraphy and paintings, were, of course, plundered. Even salt, tungsten ore, rice, and so on, were all swept away. Therefore, ten houses out of ten were empty, and even those that were not destroyed had nothing left inside. The towns of Foshan, San, Southwest, Hekou, Chencun, Daliang, and Jiujiang all suffered the same tragic looting. Among them, Southwest and Chencun had the most houses burned, while Jiujiang suffered the greatest loss from gunfire. Jiujiang is a major town under the jurisdiction of Nanhai County, almost as famous as Foshan, with prosperous people and abundant resources, and a high culture. It is a town praised by the Cantonese. When the Japanese army attacked the city on the morning of December 3, the local self-defense corps resisted at the southern area, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. However, due to their inability to match the Japanese army's firepower, they had no choice but to withdraw from the city. The Japanese army deeply resented the resistance of the self-defense corps and launched a large-scale massacre after entering the city as revenge. More than a thousand men were killed. Women who could not escape jumped into nearby fish ponds to commit suicide, showing their unwillingness to surrender. Therefore, hundreds more died, truly a tragic event in the world. The valuable items of all households in Jiujiang were looted. Among them, the biggest loss was to the pawnshops. According to investigation, there were more than thirty pawnshops in Jiujiang City. Each pawnshop was built in the center of a fish pond. In the past, in the event of military affairs, each pawnshop would revoke the bridge and feel safe. Therefore, the citizens of Jiujiang often stored valuable property in the pawnshops for a small price. Now that the Japanese army arrived in Jiujiang, the citizens of Jiujiang did not expect it to be so urgent, so they did not retrieve and evacuate their valuable items beforehand, resulting in the gold and silver objects stored in the pawnshops being looted by the Japanese army. Among them, the largest loss was the Gongyuan Pawnshop in Zhabian, with gold, silver, and jewelry reaching more than one million yuan. Eyewitnesses saw the Japanese using several vehicles to transport the above items away. The loss of other pawnshops ranged from 200,000 to 300,000 or even 500,000, with a total of around 15 million. The citizens of Jiujiang, suffering such an unprecedented looting, deeply hate it, and it will be difficult to forget even after hundreds of generations. The Japanese army currently occupying Jiujiang City consists of three or four hundred people, but they are often transferred to Shunde and various parts of the Xijiang River as tools of aggression. Those who have not been transferred often gather in the market area between the south of the city and Heqing during the day, arbitrarily harassing, and at night they retreat to the Zudansha Mountain (isolated island in the river) along the Xijiang River, with dozens of speedboats patrolling and guarding. Inside the city, Chinese traitors, acting on the instructions of the Japanese army, organized a puppet maintenance association, nominally to maintain law and order, but in reality to oppress the people and make them obedient citizens. It is rumored that a guerrilla unit led by Deng once entered the city, but this is not confirmed.

The day after the Japanese army invaded Jiujiang City, they continued to attempt to advance, attacking Gubu, which belonged to Heshan County, with several hundred people. At that time, the Chinese army's self-defense corps fought bravely and eventually repelled the Japanese army. Subsequently, the Japanese army transferred several hundred more people stationed in Jiujiang to reinforce, but they were still defeated by the self-defense corps, and two or three hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army initially thought that they could take advantage of their victory and advance sharply, so they carelessly advanced deeply. Later, the Japanese army successively increased their troops in Jiujiang, with cavalry and artillery, and used Jiujiang as a base to successively occupy Gulao, which belonged to Heshan County, and Ganzhu, which belonged to Shunde County, and claimed to invade Jiangmen, which belonged to Xinhui County. However, Jiangmen is still safe. It is heard that the Japanese army's cunning plan is to attempt to take the Gaoming County route along the Yaoming Highway, obliquely exiting Xinhu, Baishi, and Jinduli, in order to flank Zhaoqing. Therefore, the loss of Jiujiang is of great importance to the war on the Xijiang River.

### Both German and Italian Dictatorships Lack Coffee

(Rome) Italy is experiencing a severe shortage of coffee. The government recently limited each person to purchasing only 500 cubic centimeters, but in reality, it is impossible to purchase any. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)

(Berlin) Germany is experiencing a severe shortage of coffee. The government recently limited each person to purchasing only 125 cubic centimeters at a time. According to reports from the Berlin Stock Exchange, since 1933, the purchasing power of the German people has increased and the territory has continued to expand, resulting in a 50% increase in coffee consumption. The supply falling short of demand is to be expected. However, the main reason for the domestic shortage of coffee is the poor relationship between Germany and Brazil (which is also the main coffee-producing country). All citizens should economize on coffee consumption, and at the same time, the government must do its best to meet the needs of the people. If producing countries can sell coffee according to the "barter" method, then Germany should purchase more of it. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)

### Chamberlain Departs for Rome, Carefully Considering the Far East Situation Beforehand and Studying Various Ways to Help China Restrain Japan, the US is Also Trying to Assist Chinese Currency

(London) Reuters learned today that responsible figures here believe that various rumors creating the impression that the British government intends to take immediate action to force Japan to respect the open door policy in China are inaccurate. They say that the British government has been studying ways to protect its interests in China for a long time, viewing freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River as crucial, but the entire issue is very complex. Although it can now be said that the attitudes of both the United Kingdom and the United States have a clear tendency to become tougher, careful consideration must be given to how to proceed in the most appropriate way before action is taken. (Reuters Telegraph, 9th)

(London) The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent claimed that when British cabinet members met today before Prime Minister Chamberlain's departure for Rome, the Far East issue would also be discussed. In recent days, the British government has been closely considering how to put pressure on Japan to maintain the open door policy in China in order to respect British interests, and has been studying various ways to exert pressure on Japan, including increasing import tariffs on Japanese goods and preferential treatment for China. The US government is also reviewing the situation and seeking ways to assist Chinese legal tender, which will definitely be detrimental to Japan. (Reuters Telegraph, 9th)

(London) The Conservative Party's Daily Mail recently published an editorial commenting on the Far East situation, stating: "The relationship between Western countries and the Far East is not very good. In fact, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States are now discussing what kind of pressure should be exerted on Japan to prevent it from abolishing the principle of the open door in China. At this point, the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees equal opportunities in trade for all related countries, has been virtually declared abolished by Japan. After the cabinet with strong nationalist colors succeeded the Konoe cabinet in governing, it may take more aggressive actions. Any large business country cannot tolerate this kind of treatment, especially since the United Kingdom has invested a total of £244,000,000 in China, and has sufficient reason to take various measures within its power to protect its huge investment. But what means should be used to achieve this goal? When the British Cabinet meets today, it is said that it will consider a measure to increase import tariffs on Japanese goods. In addition to this, there will be other suggestions that will also be submitted for discussion. After the implementation of this measure, Japan's trade in countries around the world will suffer significant losses. Even if the country can forcibly implement an economic closed-door policy in the Far East as a countermeasure, it will definitely be counterproductive." (Havas Telegraph, 9th)

### The United States Will Build the Largest and Fastest Warships: Two 45,000-Ton Battleships and Quadruple the Number of Naval and Army Aircraft

(New York) The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that the government will soon submit the 1939-40 naval construction program to Congress, which includes two battleships that, when completed, will become the largest and fastest warships in the United States. According to information received from the Navy Department, Japan plans to build battleships of 40,000 to 46,000 tons, so the US Navy authorities have decided to build two 45,000-ton battleships to cope with this. These battleships will be equipped with nine 16-inch guns, with a speed of 30 to 36 knots per hour. Their armor will be thicker than that of the 35,000-ton battleships currently under construction, in order to enhance their resistance. However, their size will not be too large, so that they can pass through the Panama Canal. The cost of each ship is between 90 million and 110 million US dollars. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)

(Washington) It is expected that President Roosevelt's defense message to Congress this week will advocate strengthening the US defense, paying attention to air defense. According to reliable predictions, this message will state that the German Air Force is now much stronger than any other country in the world, so the United States cannot lag behind. He will advocate the following points: (1) Quadrupling the number of naval and army aircraft ordered in the next fiscal year; (2) Training 20,000 pilots and more than 20,000 mechanics each year; (3) Increasing the number of army pilots from 20,000 to 60,000; (4) Infantry and artillery must also be expanded; (5) Allocating more than 100 million yuan to arm protective forces; (6) There must be more training orders in the field of arms manufacturing; (7) The Army and Navy must have eight new air force bases. According to political circles, in addition to the above seven points, President Roosevelt will advocate placing orders for at least 5,000 aircraft in the first year, and continue to increase in the second year, so that the Army has 2,000 aircraft and the Navy has more than 3,000 aircraft. (Reuters Telegraph, 9th)

(New York) The Foreign Affairs Association Monthly recently published an article stating that since the Munich Agreement was established, the possibility of conflict between Germany and the United States has greatly increased. Since then, Germany has no longer attacked the Soviet Union, France, or Czechoslovakia, but has attacked the United Kingdom and the United States. "The country's attitude is aimed at controlling the world, and it can conflict with the United States in South America and with the United Kingdom in Africa. This conflict will not be an armed conflict, but Germany can use various methods of threats, propaganda, and economic expansion to dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States. The country has used this method to annex Austria and the Sudetenland without bloodshed. Why not apply it to South America?" The conclusion is: "The United States is now preparing to strengthen the defenses of Latin American countries to prevent the invasion of National Socialism." (Havas Telegraph, 9th)

### Japan Implements Technician Mobilization, Short Five Million People

(Tokyo) An imperial edict was announced today to carry out the compulsory registration of technical personnel. From the 20th, all male technicians and workers, from the age of sixteen to forty-nine, must register. It is estimated that it will reach five million people. Registration will be completed by March. (Telegraph, 8th)

(Chongqing) Foreign news: Since Hiranuma formed a cabinet, most of the opinions of various countries believe that its policy towards China will become more aggressive. Although Soviet newspapers only published the list of cabinet members in the Hiranuma cabinet, they also excerpted a comment from the Parisian People's Newspaper, believing that Hiranuma's cabinet will become more closely aligned with Germany and Italy. Its foreign policy will not only be unfavorable to China, but will also greatly affect the Soviet Union and the United States. British public opinion, due to the US president's speech and various European issues, does not attach much importance to the Japanese cabinet reshuffle, and publishes such news in a decided position. However, public opinion unanimously believes that the new cabinet has Fascist tendencies, the power of the military is stronger, and its internal and external policies, with military aggression against China, will become more tense, and will also express its urgent situation. French newspapers also have similar comments, believing that Konoe's resignation was forced by the military, and Hiranuma came from the right wing, so the trend should be more active. However, the newspapers have recently paid great attention to the fact that the last cabinet member did not participate in the new cabinet, because they said that the new cabinet's policy may still be based on the recent decision of the Imperial Council to find ways to negotiate peace with China, and said that the Hiranuma cabinet obviously has a transitional nature and is the last attempt of the moderates. If it fails again, it may not be possible to avoid dictatorship. In short, Japan has now reached the most difficult stage, and all factions feel that there is no way to deal with the war, and there is no way to step down domestically. Its financial figures do not want to serve as finance ministers, which shows that the finances are difficult. It is also worthy of attention. Public opinion commonly believes that Hiranuma's cabinet has increased the power of the military, but the United States has a tough attitude, domestic contradictions have increased, and the old financial official, Mr. Ike, has left office and been replaced by a newcomer. I am afraid that the new cabinet will not dare to be too aggressive. The Italian side has not yet expressed its views on this, while German newspapers mostly imply that Konoe's downfall was due to his inability to satisfy the desires of the military. The Hiranuma cabinet will definitely do its best to end the military against China. The Tokyo correspondent of the French Daily reported that Konoe's attempt to seek peace was unsuccessful, and there was no way to improve relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. He was forced to resign. The new cabinet's responsibility is to deal with war-weary elements and eliminate the panic of international deterioration. It will inevitably implement economic mobilization in an attempt to achieve final victory, etc. It can be seen that Japan has reached the end of its strength and is still trying to make a final attempt at aggression against China.

### Disturbance Around Rangoon Becoming More Intense, Troops Deployed for Patrol

Rangoon: In the past two days, the civil resistance movement has become more intense. There are 2,000 people on hunger strike in various nearby places, coming here in formation to demand improved treatment, causing the number of demonstrators to increase greatly. Saboteurs are gradually becoming active, so starting this morning, soldiers are patrolling various parts of Rangoon. A temple caught fire last night, destroying three houses and burning one person to death. Because the authorities found that the temple was the site of a major conflict between Muslims and Buddhists in July of last year, they dispatched military and police to guard the temple after the fire.

### Japan-Russia Fisheries Dispute: Negotiations Remain Fruitless, Tōgō Visits Litvinov for the Eleventh Time, Soviet Russia Confers More Honors for the Battle of Zhanggufeng

(Moscow) According to the Associated Press correspondent quoting Japanese sources, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigenori Tōgō and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov continued their talks for two hours this afternoon. However, there was still no progress on the fisheries dispute. It is reported that these negotiations have reached their eleventh session. Newspapers today expressed opinions on the Soviet government's attitude. The Red Army's organ, Red Star, stated, "The Japanese government permitting the Soviet Union to fish in Japanese territorial waters is not the same as the Soviet government permitting Japan to fish in Soviet territorial waters. Hence, the result of this kind of irreconcilable difference." The newspaper concluded by comparing the current deadlock in fisheries negotiations with the Zhanggufeng Incident, saying, "The Japanese people, based on their own past experience, should deeply understand the fundamental difference between the armies of the Tsarist era and the Red Army. In the Zhanggufeng area, the Red Army gave the Japanese people an excellent lesson. They should know that the Soviet people will not allow anyone to infringe upon their rights anywhere." (American United Press dispatch, 8th)

(Moscow) Another group of Red Army combatants, commanders, and political instructors who were previously ordered to be awarded medals received their honors on the 7th. The medals were personally awarded by Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Among those receiving awards were many soldiers who participated in the Battle of Lake Khasan. In addition to Lieutenant Tereshin being awarded the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, others received the Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, and Order of the Red Star. Lieutenant Tereshin and Captain Leisenko's wife were also awarded medals for their meritorious service in caring for the wounded. During the medal presentation, Lieutenant Tereshin, on behalf of all the awarded officers and soldiers, delivered a speech of gratitude, saying, "When we fought in Zhanggufeng, everyone remembered that every inch of our country's land was exchanged for blood from the enemy by our compatriots. Therefore, we are determined not to sacrifice an inch of land. If the Soviet Union is attacked in the future, we will still vigilantly defend our motherland." During the awards ceremony, Kalinin warmly congratulated each member. (TASS dispatch, 8th)

(Moscow) Foreign newspapers reported that General Kamenev, commander of the Ural Military District of the Soviet Union, had been dismissed. Local authorities have denied this, saying that the current commander of the Ural Military District is General Safronov and that there is no General Kamenev. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Anglo-Italian Talks: No Fixed Agenda, Exchange of Views on Various Issues First, Italian Press Says Britain Encouraged by the United States

(London) Today is the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax's visit to Rome. However, The Times and the Daily Telegraph are unable to clearly reveal the true intentions of the two ministers. According to The Times' diplomatic correspondent, the Rome talks seem to have no fixed agenda. Both sides want to understand the other's views and positions on various issues before proposing a formal understanding formula. However, rumors that Britain intends to alienate the German-Italian axis or break France's resistance to Italy's demands during the Rome talks are absolutely unfounded. Regarding Anglo-Italian business relations, the Rome talks have no special provisions for this kind of trend. However, economic matters will be involved in the meeting. The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent said that the rumors that Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Rome to discuss the withdrawal of Italian volunteers in Spain are not true. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

(Berlin) Regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's upcoming visit to Italy, Italian newspapers have published comments, saying, "In any case, Italy's demands will be satisfied." German newspapers have reprinted these comments, saying that after the British cabinet members arrive in Rome, they must use the spirit of the Munich Agreement as a basis to facilitate the resolution of the entire Mediterranean issue. The "Monday" newspaper used a large headline to report, "The Italian government believes that French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Corsica and Tunisia is useless." It also said, "After the Munich Agreement was reached, the 'practical benefit' policy has been remarkably effective. The crisis in the Mediterranean, that is, the crisis in Europe, can be resolved with a 'no concessions' policy. The crux of the matter is here on the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome. As for the Spanish issue, from a European standpoint, it is the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Since both British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are concerned with maintaining the balance of power among countries, the Spanish issue has naturally become the main issue of future talks between Britain and Italy. In short, if Spain becomes a 'branch' of Moscow, the status quo in the Mediterranean guaranteed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement will be destroyed. The British government must be aware of this." (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Rome) On the eve of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's visit to Rome, political figures here superficially believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain will act as a mediator between Italy and France. However, they also know that this hope is difficult to realize in practice. Moreover, they are quite unhappy that British cabinet members will make a brief stop in Paris to meet with French cabinet members, in order to show that Britain and France maintain allied relations. In addition, the Spanish Nationalist Army's current attack on Catalonia, which is being participated in by Italian soldiers, has left a bad impression on London. The local Tribune commented on this matter, saying, "After U.S. President Roosevelt's address to Congress, British imperialists have been encouraged and are criticizing our country's volunteer soldiers' brave actions." (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Rumor of Secret Agreement Between Russia and Italy

(London) The Daily Express recently reported that Germany and Italy signed a secret alliance treaty in September of last year during the tense situation with the Czech Republic, stipulating that both sides would refuse to join any alliance treaty that opposes either of the signatory countries. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### New Chancellery in Berlin Completed, Including Bomb Shelter

(Berlin) Hitler formally received the new Chancellery building today. The building is a quarter of a mile wide and connected to the old Chancellery. A total of 4,000 construction workers built it. Its rapid completion has set a new record. During the acceptance ceremony, all 4,000 workers were present. It is said that a sophisticated bomb shelter has been built in the building. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

(Berlin) The inauguration ceremony of the new Chancellery was held this morning. Head of State Hitler and other dignitaries, as well as 8,000 workers, participated in the ceremony. The Head of State also delivered a speech in public, praising the achievements made by the National Socialist government in all aspects. This new building is one of the great buildings of Greater Germany. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Berlin) The new Chancellery was completed at the end of 1938, symbolizing the Greater German nation completed that year. The new Chancellery was designed by the famous architect Professor Speer and is extremely magnificent. The central hall is 164 meters deep. The greatness of the entire project can be imagined. Eight thousand people worked tirelessly, day and night, through wind, rain, and severe cold, for four and a half months to complete it. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 8th)

### Czechoslovakia and Hungary Agree to Redraw Borders, and Temporarily Establish Neutral Zone, Czechoslovakia Denies Mobilizing Reserves

Hungarian Capital: After negotiations in Munkács, the delegations of Czechoslovakia and Hungary have agreed to redraw the borders between the two countries and temporarily establish a neutral zone to prevent accidents. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Hungarian Capital: Regarding the events in Munkács, the semi-official Hungarian News Agency recently issued a message stating that the Czech troops who invaded Hungarian territory have withdrawn from the vicinity of the city in accordance with the Hungarian government's proposal, and prisoners of war will be exchanged. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Hungarian Capital: Regarding the events in Munkács and Ungvár, the chargé d'affaires of the Hungarian Embassy in Czechoslovakia is scheduled to submit two requests to the Czech government this afternoon: (1) compensation for damages, and (2) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Hungarian Capital: Prime Minister Imrédy received two representatives of the autonomous government of Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia today and held talks with them. Regarding this matter, the authorities are unwilling to comment. However, newspapers say that the representatives were reported to have proposed to Prime Minister Imrédy to exchange 55 villages in the province for the cities of Munkács and Ungvár, which were assigned to Hungary by the Vienna Conference. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Hungarian Capital: The fascist party's National Front, namely the Gray Shirt Party's organ "Világ," recently reported that two representatives recently sent by the autonomous government of Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia came to the Hungarian capital for negotiations, advocating the exchange of 25 villages belonging to the province for the cities of Munkács and Ungvár (i.e., Uzhhorod), which were previously ceded to Hungary in accordance with the Vienna Arbitration Award. This was rejected by the Hungarian government. The Czech troops' attack on Munkács was probably caused by this. It is said that the Munkács incident was instigated by Ukrainians in that country. These autonomists are supported by "a certain great power" (referring to Germany), and they do not hesitate to act recklessly. In fact, although Czechs and Ukrainians say that this great power is behind them, even with cannons, tanks, machine guns, and five times the manpower, they still failed to cross the line. The anti-Hungarian struggle that has been going on in diplomacy since the Vienna Conference has also failed. Observers here recently commented on this article, saying that it is the first time that Hungarian newspapers have openly accused "a certain great power" of supporting Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

Hungarian Capital: After the incident that occurred last night in Nagytárkány near Ungvár (i.e., Uzhhorod), the semi-official Hungarian News Agency recently issued a message on the course of events, stating that Czechs threw incendiary bombs at that place at 9:00 last night, causing fires in three houses. A Czech lieutenant also crossed the border into Hungarian territory and was shot and wounded by Hungarian border soldiers. (Havas, 9th)

Munkács: Government authorities solemnly held a funeral here yesterday for the soldiers who died in the incident on the 6th of this month. Cabinet Minister Yarossy attended the funeral on behalf of the government, and a large number of people participated in the funeral. Congressman Voltay of this city delivered a speech, saying that the attackers of this city were indeed regular Czech troops and had made meticulous preparations in advance. All of this has been proven by documents seized from the Czech soldiers. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Czech Capital: After repeated border disputes between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, there were rumors that the Czech government had conscripted reservists and concentrated troops in the border area near Poland and Hungary. The government recently issued a public statement today denying this and issued a proclamation stating that anyone who dares to spread this rumor will be severely punished. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Turkey Cracks Down on Private Arms Trafficking Organization, Supplying Spanish Nationalist Army, Former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrested

Istanbul, Turkey: Police in this city cracked down on a private arms trafficking organization today that specializes in purchasing airplanes for the Spanish Nationalist Army. It planned to purchase 50 airplanes from the United States and Canada and transport part of them to Spain. The Turkish Embassy in the United States learned of this and immediately telegraphed the government, leading to the cracking of the case. The main culprit, Rub, the former director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been arrested. An accomplice, Hamondy, was arrested in the Vormania border area, but was released after powerful people interceded for him. He escaped to France, but was arrested again because the authorities of a certain country filed a complaint. In addition, several Turkish congressmen and many people from the local community and business circles are reported to be involved. (Havas, 8th)

### Spanish Nationalist Army Breaks Through Main Force of Government Army, Preparing to Attack Catalan Mountain Fortress, Dozens Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Valencia

Burgos: The Nationalist Army has now crossed the two main roads leading to Barcelona and is making rapid progress. The central army, based in Lleida and Balaguer, has occupied Mollerussa, an important town 14 miles east of Lleida and on the northern road to the Catalan capital. The government army is retreating rapidly to Sefra, about 20 miles further east, and is blowing up bridges. However, Nationalist Army engineering teams are rapidly repairing roads and railways in order to attack Sefra and the mountains of Mount Blanch, two strongholds in the Catalan mountains. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Zaragoza: The Spanish Nationalist Army has now occupied the new village of Pola de San, which is 19 miles from the Mediterranean and 24 miles from Tarragona. According to authorities here, the Nationalist Army's general offensive against Catalonia has now entered its third week and has broken the main resistance of the government army on the Ogier Plain. However, there are still difficulties ahead, which the northern front is particularly concerned about. It can now be noted that General Yagüe's Moroccan army built a pontoon bridge in the Mora area, crossed the Ebro River, and established contact with the local army in Navarra Province. It is now waiting for an opportunity to attack Faucet, 25 miles west of Tarragona. This action, which has long been expected, will threaten both the southeast flanks of Tarragona. The Nationalist Army headquarters now claims that since the start of the general offensive, the Nationalist Army has gained at least 1,200 square miles and captured 30,000 enemies. The army attacking Catalonia has 300,000 men, most of whom have now crossed the Ebro River, which is the main natural defense line of the government army. The Aragon Legion crossed the river upstream from Lleida by building a bridge yesterday morning and joined forces with the army that set out from the Balaguer bridgehead, dispersing in the countryside dotted with farms. Two of the government army's last strongholds were occupied last night after heavy shelling. The Aragon Army has now advanced to 12.5 miles east of Balaguer. The Nationalist Army is now advancing westward to eliminate the positions between Altesa and Potjes Blanes. The government army is retreating under artillery fire along the highway between Lleida and Tarragona. Although there is a lot of fog on the northern front, the climate elsewhere is quite suitable. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Barcelona: After the government army launched a sudden offensive on the Extremadura front four days ago, it has now, according to government reports, made important new progress, capturing three towns and four villages in Badajoz Province. The government army cleared enemy lines along the Sue River north of Fuente Obejuna and occupied the Leán highway, about 90 miles from the Portuguese border.

### France and Iran Sever Diplomatic Relations, Iranian Ambassador Returns Home

(Paris) After Iran decided to sever diplomatic relations with France, its ambassador, Foroughi, was ordered to lower the flag and return home. It is reported that a French magazine published a short piece last year that used a cat's name (pronounced "chat" in French), which was a pun on the Iranian "Shah" (title of the king). The Iranian royal family was very dissatisfied and decided to sever diplomatic relations with France. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Situation in Northern Europe, Fortifications on Åland Islands

Swedish Capital: Åland Islands, located in the Baltic Sea, are between Finland and Sweden, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, in a strategic location. Until 1917, they belonged to Russia. By 1921, Finland and Sweden had a dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. Later, the Council of the League of Nations ruled that they belonged to Finland. Russia's declaration in 1856 promising not to establish defenses on the island was also accepted by Finland and confirmed by a treaty between Sweden and Finland. Today, Sweden and Finland, due to changes in the international situation, are negotiating again on the issue of fortifications. According to official statements, a plan has now been agreed upon and will be submitted to the governments of both countries for approval. The main points are as follows: (1) Finland may take military measures in the southern part of the Åland Islands; (2) Although some military measures may be taken in other parts of the islands, the scope will be determined by separate agreements between the two parties; (3) Finland may implement conscription on the islands, but Swedish officers and adjutants must be stationed on the islands and issue orders in Swedish.

### Syrian Independence Movement

Beirut: The treaty signed between France and Syria on September 9, 1936, stipulated that Syria would become an independent country after three years. After the French Parliament refused to ratify it, residents of major cities in Syria held demonstrations, but their scale was not as large as expected. For example, only 400 residents participated in the demonstration in Homs. Most stores that closed in the morning reopened as usual in the afternoon. About 3,000 residents of Aleppo marched in formation, and several thousand citizens of Damascus held a rally. The hosts delivered speeches, including Minister of the Interior Jabri. It is said that Syrian nationalists are willing to form an alliance treaty with France, but since Syrians are an entire nation, they naturally enjoy the right to self-determination. The demonstrators then marched to the Prime Minister's residence to petition. Prime Minister Mardam delivered a speech to them, urging the Syrian people to unite to ensure independence. The demonstrators dispersed at noon, and the whole city returned to calm. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### American Reporter Hanson Talks About China's Greatest Strength: Chiang, Bai, and Zhou Work Together and Are Determined Not to Compromise with Japan

The Continental Daily reports that American journalist Hanson, who has traveled extensively throughout China for three years, recently returned to the United States. While passing through Tokyo, he expressed his views to an American business newspaper, stating that China's greatest strength lies in the harmonious cooperation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, General Bai Chongxi, and General Zhou Enlai, who were once at odds. Hanson came to China three years ago as a reporter for the Boston Post and has since worked for several American newspapers and news agencies in the Far East. He spent a year in China, often staying in Peiping, Shanghai, Hankou, and Fujian. While in Fujian Province, he studied the situation regarding poisons. In the last half-year of his stay in China, Hanson traveled to a particularly wide range of areas. Last summer, he traveled to guerrilla areas in northern China, including Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Suiyuan. According to the American business newspaper in Tokyo, Hanson said that Bai Chongxi and Zhou Enlai were at odds with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek before the war, but now they are his right-hand men. These three, along with those loyal to them, control China's military, economy, and personnel. The only person capable of undermining them is Wang Jingwei, but he has no military or financial power and now seems to have been driven out, with no one supporting him. Any peace negotiations must be based on these three, and as long as they are in power, there will be no chance of compromise with Japan. General Bai Chongxi, from Guangxi Province, with a population of eighteen million, has devoted all of its economic wealth and most of its manpower to the war of resistance. His only chance in the future is to obtain a position in the government, so Bai will definitely cooperate with Generalissimo Chiang to the end. When Chiang was the head of the Whampoa Military Academy, Zhou Enlai was the head of the political department, so he has a close personal relationship with Chiang. Zhou was the one who advocated for Chiang's release during the Xi'an Incident and is now one of the dozen or so leading figures in the Communist Party. If he were to compromise with Japan, the Communist Party would see him as a traitor. Seven or eight out of ten of China's new troops are loyal to Generalissimo Chiang. At the beginning of the war, about half of the troops were under the command of warlords, but most of them have now died on the battlefield, so there were more deaths in the early stages of the war. Later, the troops trained by officers directly under Chiang Kai-shek were used to replenish the ranks. Very few troops under the warlords remain, and even these few have been assimilated by the replacement troops loyal to Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, Chiang Kai-shek promoted all the warlords to very high positions, so that they no longer have direct control over the troops, and almost all of the warlords have been appointed as commanders of army groups, directly under the command of the Supreme Military Council. At the same time, the warlords have also become unswervingly loyal, and are no longer as easily bought as they were in the past, such as Shi Yousan, Director of Pacification for northern Hebei, Zhang Zizhong, Mayor of Tianjin, Feng Zhian, Chairman of Hebei Province, and Liu Ruming, Chairman of Chahar Province, who were the main figures in the peace negotiations at the Lugouqiao incident. They are now all in the ranks of army group commanders. The strategy and manpower of the troops directly under Chiang Kai-shek are now stronger than at the beginning of the war, their officers are more experienced, and their equipment is more complete and suitable. Take heavy artillery as an example, it is much better than before. In addition, the gasoline stored in the Northwest can be used for six months, and at the same time, a large amount of gasoline is being transported into China, and a large amount of military supplies are stored, enough for a year of combat. Chiang Kai-shek still employs a former senior German officer as an advisor. Bai Chongxi is one of the most outstanding military leaders in China today, and his wisdom amazes even the German advisor, who once said that the only person whose military strategy he cannot fathom is Bai. Bai is also recognized as the supreme leader of China's twenty million Muslims, and his trusted troops number four hundred thousand. Zhou Enlai is the representative of the Communist Party and does not hold a position in the government, and since the Communist Party has dedicated itself to the war of resistance, it has not increased its political power or status in the government. Only seven of the two hundred councilors are members of the Communist Party. Zhou once served as the commander of the Eighth Route Army, but he is mostly a political leader who was educated in France and the Soviet Union. Among the things that have most surprised foreign observers about the Chinese government during the war of resistance is the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation. Almost all of the organizers are former college professors or technical experts, and many were at odds with Chiang Kai-shek before the war. Among these figures, the most outstanding is the famous geologist Weng Wenhao. Weng is definitely not someone who blindly follows others. Appointing people according to their talents may have started with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in modern Chinese history. Almost all of those working in the ministry are students who have studied in Europe and the United States, and almost all are university professors. The supply of troops and the development of industry and raw materials all depend on these two ministries.

### The Dream of Issuing Counterfeit Money by the Japanese Army in North China Turns into a Pipe Dream; Counterfeit Money Cannot Usurp the Legal Tender's Position; Japanese Businesses and the Financial World Suffer

The North China correspondence of the 字林报, December 29th, Tianjin: The counterfeit money of the "United Reserve Bank" has not been successful in North China to date. The so-called "united" refers to the united banks of North China. The Japanese issuance of counterfeit "United Reserve" money emulates the precedent of the puppet "Manchukuo," without considering the situation of North China itself for many years. The currency change in North China differs from the puppet "Manchukuo" in one important point: in the puppet "Manchukuo," the Japanese replaced worthless Fengpiao notes, but in North China, there was valuable currency in existence, namely the legal tender of the Chinese National Government. Hence, the difficulty in counterfeit money usurping legal tender is one of the main reasons. The establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" originally had two intentions: first, it was purely a political measure to clearly demonstrate the change of regime and to incorporate the economy of North China into the so-called yen bloc. However, more importantly, the Japanese military authorities hoped to obtain legal tender through this means, which they would transport to Shanghai and use to purchase much-needed foreign exchange. However, this plan failed because the Chinese government issued special regulations to control foreign exchange. Moreover, there was a need to recall the large number of yen notes in circulation in North China, which are said to amount to 60 million yen. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to collect legal tender was initially thwarted. Furthermore, there are three reasons why the counterfeit "United Reserve" money has not become the sole currency of North China: (1) Most of the guerrilla areas in North China are in the hands of the Chinese, where the use of counterfeit money is prohibited. Those who carry counterfeit money are immediately executed. Therefore, those who purchase goods in that area all use legal tender. (2) The "United Reserve Bank" itself cannot use its counterfeit money to purchase foreign exchange. The Japanese originally intended to obtain 60 million yuan in silver that remained in North China as a reserve for purchasing foreign exchange, but this silver is stored in the banks of the Tianjin concessions and has not been obtained to date. (3) Foreign banks refuse to accept counterfeit "United Reserve" money and refuse to sell foreign exchange in exchange for counterfeit money. It is said that the Japanese military authorities, who single-handedly established the "United Reserve Bank," disregarded the advice and warnings of the Japanese financial world and, using special methods, attempted to expel legal tender by threatening strict punishment for those who did not comply, ordering that legal tender be devalued to 90 cents for one yuan of counterfeit money, and issuing another order stating that after March of this year, legal tender would be illegal currency and those who risked using it would be severely punished. However, to date, these measures have all failed to achieve their goals. Not only that, but the issuance of counterfeit money has seriously affected Japanese trade. Initially, legal tender was worth one shilling and two pence, and Japanese banks also treated counterfeit money as part of the yen bloc and exchanged it at face value. Later, when legal tender fell to around eight pence, Japanese banks suffered heavy losses and had to stop accepting counterfeit money, resulting in a sharp decline in Japanese import commerce. This clearly shows that counterfeit money cannot be called a stable currency; at best, it is just a gambling chip. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese business and financial worlds are suffering greatly from the current financial chaos in North China, and they definitely do not welcome the devaluation of legal tender, as they are also hit hard. It is said that they are also making every effort to oppose the extension of counterfeit money to other parts of China. Although it is rumored that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai and southern China do not allow counterfeit money to circulate in those two areas purely out of jealousy, the main purpose of establishing the "United Reserve Bank," namely to obtain a large amount of foreign currency, has not been achieved to date. It is also heard that the Japanese military authorities in North China are now planning to completely control export and import trade, only issuing export licenses to merchants who pay foreign currency to the Yokohama Specie Bank or the "United Reserve Bank," while strictly controlling imports. If this were to happen, the Japanese military authorities could obtain a large amount of foreign exchange deposits. However, many export locations in North China are still under Chinese control, and Mongolia continues to strictly enforce its exchange controls. Therefore, it is doubtful whether these plans can achieve their goals, and it is feared that the trade in North China will come to a complete standstill, causing counterfeit money to decline in value.

### A Prisoner Who Participated in the New Fourth Army's Work

— Yan Su, from southern Anhui

Because I heard Commander Xiang Ying talk last night about the New Fourth Army's methods of dealing with Japanese prisoners, which are very interesting, I requested to speak face-to-face with a Japanese prisoner.

According to Commander Xiang, the New Fourth Army not only does not kill prisoners, and not only treats prisoners favorably, but also actively gives Japanese prisoners freedom to go out, communicate, read, and work. Therefore, Japanese prisoners in the New Fourth Army are like being at home, wearing the same uniforms as the New Fourth Army, and wearing military caps with the blue sky and white sun emblem. When they have nothing to do, they can freely stroll down the street, and the common people and brothers do not find it strange. The New Fourth Army's special organ in charge of educating and managing prisoners is the "Enemy Work Department." According to Commander Xiang, in the half-year since the New Fourth Army started fighting, it has captured more than 590 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and some of them have already been able to participate in the New Fourth Army's political work.

Today (December 2nd) morning, in a peasant's home, I met two young Japanese prisoners through the introduction of Lin Zhifu, the Minister of the Enemy Work Department of the New Fourth Army, and Deng Zihui, the Deputy Director of the Political Department. When I entered the house, they were both bent over the table reading books. They were both wearing gray cotton overcoats and Chinese military caps. As soon as they heard someone, they immediately ran over with smiles, showing a welcoming attitude. If it hadn't been for Minister Lin's explanation, I would have thought that these two were New Fourth Army staff in charge of managing prisoners.

I talked with the prisoners for more than an hour, from their backgrounds, families, and love affairs to the future of the Sino-Japanese War. Now, in order to reflect their true opinions, I will write down the entire Q&A record below. Reporter (Q): What is your name? Japanese prisoner (A): My name is Kono Masao, and he (pointing to another Japanese prisoner) is named Tahata Sakuzo. (The following is a conversation between the reporter and Kono Masao) (Q): When did you come to this place? (A): About the end of July or the beginning of August this year. (Q): How old are you this year? (A): I am twenty-two years old this year. (Q): What position did you hold in the army? (A): I was a member of the transport corps in the Third Division of the Army. (Q): Where is your home? (A): In Tokyo, Japan. (Q): Who else is in your family? (A): My father, mother, and two younger brothers. (Q): What was your occupation in Japan? (A): I had no occupation. I was studying at a senior commercial school in Tokyo. (Q): Where did you land in China? (A): We landed at Wusong, but Japanese soldiers do not necessarily land at Wusong. Some land in Nanjing. (Q): When were you drafted into the army, and when did you leave the country to come to China? (A): I was drafted into the army in February of this year and transferred to China in June. (Q): What did the Japanese military tell you to do in China? (A): They told us to fight against China's red bandits and Chiang Kai-shek. At first, we did not know that the Japanese army was invading and committing many atrocities in China. (Q): When you were drafted into the army to come to China, what did you and your family feel? (A): At that time, I was very distressed spiritually. Limited by national laws, I could not resist. My family, of course, felt the same way and did not want me to go out. (Q): Where did you live for two months in Shanghai? (A): In a textile factory in the east of Yangshupu. (Q): What places did you visit in Shanghai? (A): I visited Zhabei and Nanshi, but the scenes were very bleak. I have not been to the bustling center of the concessions. (Q): Have you ever seen Japanese soldiers raping and killing Chinese people? (A): I have not seen the rape of women myself, but I have heard the brothers in the army often talk about it. I think some of them must have done it. I have not only seen the massacre of Chinese people, but I have also seen many thousands of Chinese people being killed alive. At that time, I felt very sad, but only sad. (Q): Before you were captured in Zhu, you had already been in China for two or three months. Just based on these three months in China, what are your thoughts, especially about the Sino-Japanese War? (A): Because the time was very short, I did not see many things. However, one thing is that when I arrived in Nanjing, I saw many Chinese people being killed. At that time, the superiors told our soldiers that they were all "bandits"—Chinese guerrillas—so they should be killed. At that time, I thought, why are there so many "bandits" and so many guerrillas in China? My brothers and I felt the same way, so we gradually began to doubt the news of the war in Central China that was being promoted in Japan—but it was only internal doubt and depression. It was very difficult to take any action or resistance.

Shanghai Special Edition

### The Financial Market of Shanghai

— Zhang Yifan

Since Shanghai fell, the population between the concessions has increased sharply. However, the people's livelihood and economy cannot increase the vitality of Shanghai's commercial market, so financial activities should continue to stagnate. However, the reality is not the case: the Japanese side is advocating the "United Bank" in North China, recklessly plundering legal tender, and selling foreign exchange in Shanghai. Our side then resolutely implemented foreign exchange controls. All parties did not understand the truth and misunderstood our intentions. Even foreign banks abolished the "gentlemen's agreement" and temporarily suspended cooperation with our currency and financial system. Although our central bank always supplied foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate, initially supplying 400,000 to 500,000 pounds per week, which far exceeded the regular needs of Shanghai's foreign trade, it was still not understood. They used their privileges in China to maintain their "free market" for buying and selling foreign exchange outside our central bank, creating shocking black market prices every day. Although the motive may not have been to help the wicked and disrupt legal tender, the fact was that it was being used by the enemy to attack legal tender. In addition, ignorant Chinese people, fearing the devaluation of legal tender, rushed to flee their funds; or they tried to order goods from abroad as much as possible to avoid reducing foreign exchange losses. Also, because we restricted the import of various luxury goods and non-essential goods, those who sought profit even increased their imports to make profits. As a result, the demand for foreign exchange in the black market was extremely urgent, and the exchange rate plummeted. Starting with this kind of foreign exchange speculation, the cash, securities, and other markets also set up dark markets outside the exchange, wriggling and moving. The stagnant Shanghai financial market was thus revived in an atmosphere of speculation.

(IV) The Revival of the Bill Market

This kind of unreasonable transformation can be seen in the rise and fall of the bill turnover of the silver and money industry. (Unit: millions of national currency)

Exchange and settlement of bills by the Shanghai silver and money industry

The use of bank bills originally developed after the establishment of the acceptance center. Last July, the exchange volume reached a record high of over 900 million yuan. However, with the outbreak of the war, it plummeted. By February of this year, it had fallen to only 85 million. But then it gradually recovered; now it is almost on par with the exchange volume of the previous year. Recently, the China, Communications, and Bank of China have been cooperating with foreign banks in exchanging clearinghouse bills, allowing them to be used in the same way as those of the Bund clearinghouse, without discrimination. This not only makes Shanghai's currency market more active than before, but also gives hope for further increases in exchange volume in the future.

The number of money shop public slips redeemed each month this year also seems to have decreased sharply compared with the early months after the war. This is due to the contraction of credit and cautious lending by the shops, which has led to this. But the main reason is that the debts left over from before the war have been transferred to the book, so it cannot be used as a measure of their rise and fall.

(V) The Transition of the Interest Rate Market

Since the currency system reform and centralized issuance, there has been a regulatory mechanism to balance the supply and demand of currency in the market, so the high-interest-rate state of previous years has gradually returned to normal. In 1936, the silver and money industry and even the financial authorities unanimously advocated the implementation of a low-interest-rate policy to promote national economic construction. Therefore, the interest rate in Shanghai was no higher than one cent. In the first half of 1937, there was a period of tension due to the tea market and speculative frenzy, but it was only 1.67 cents, and it soon fell back.

With the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the situation changed dramatically. Credit in the shops shrank greatly, and it was very difficult to borrow money. It immediately jumped to two cents. There were still few suppliers. It has now softened, so suppliers are even harder to find. This can be seen in the decline in the number of money shop public slips redeemed.

From the rise and fall of bank bill exchange volumes in the past and present, it can be seen that the interest rate market currently opened by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry can better indicate the profits and losses of the Shanghai financial market today. Since the implementation of the financial stabilization measures, in addition to public slip call rates, acceptance discount rates, and exchange rates, the committee has added a clearinghouse call rate. Although this type of clearinghouse bill has illegal discounting today, and once reached 70 to 80 yuan per thousand, it is still not easy to obtain this kind of credit, so this call rate is now as high as 2.5 cents. Clearinghouse credit is even more difficult to obtain. Last winter, the call rate reached three cents.

In addition, after the establishment of the Discount and Loan Committee by the China, Communications, Agricultural, and Central Banks to handle interbank discounting and lending, Shanghai has another interest rate market, which is the discount rate and lending rate announced by the committee. The former is based on weekly interest, while the latter is based on monthly interest. The committee is responsible for regulating finance during the war, so its discount and loan policy is more policy-oriented than market-oriented. Everyone knows that the authorities have a desire to contract the currency in the Shanghai financial market. Therefore, the committee's steps have always followed the wishes of the authorities. This goes without saying. However, it is a pity that the situation in Shanghai is special, so the committee's activities have not yet had any impact.

(VI) Gold Market Speculation and Overseas Gold Prices

As mentioned earlier, the key to reviving the Shanghai financial market lies in the illegal speculation of foreign exchange. Before the currency system reform, our country's foreign exchange market was always affected by the fluctuation of gold and silver prices. Since the legal tender broke away from silver and became a managed currency, the China, Communications, and Central Banks have used artificial means to stabilize it at the legal rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. It completely lost its connection with the changes in world gold and silver prices. However, since our country implemented foreign exchange controls in early March of 1938, and illegal black markets have emerged, speculators have abused the fluctuations in gold and silver prices as a basis for stirring up trouble. They meant that most of China's foreign exchange reserves were still in silver and had not been converted into gold or foreign exchange. Therefore, the changes in the gold and silver ratio could affect the foreign exchange foundation of the legal tender. A drop in the price of silver would weaken the foreign exchange foundation; conversely, it would strengthen it. In addition, since the beginning of this year, the British pound has fluctuated due to the continuous tension in the European situation, and the Sino-American silver agreement is also expiring. Therefore, the price of gold in London rose sharply after May of this year. At that time, Shanghai already had an illegal foreign exchange market, so the impact was even worse. The spot price of gold in Shanghai rose to 2,000 yuan in mid-June, then softened briefly, and then rose again. In November, it reached a new high of 2,068 yuan.

Changes in Gold Prices in Shanghai and London (The index is based on 100 points in July 1937) Unit: Shanghai national currency yuan, London pence. Before August of last year, the Shanghai price was the spot gold price. In September, it was the standard price. From October to April 1938, it was the bank purchase price. After that, it was the black market closing price.

The Shanghai spot gold market was originally a gathering place for speculators. After the number of transactions reached 30 to 40 million over the years, it became deserted. For example, in April and May of 1935, the number of transactions often reached 2.7 to 2.8 million bars. In November of the same year, it dropped sharply to 390,000 bars. In November 1936, there were only 28,700 transactions. By 1937, it was very low. In January and February, only about 10,000 transactions had been completed. Later, there were only 7,000 to 8,000 transactions. By July, there were only 3,647 transactions. It stopped completely after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Since the emergence of illegal transactions, the huge difference between the high and low prices, which is even greater than the rate of rise and fall in London, shows the intensity of the competition among the parties.

Comparison of the Difference Between High and Low Gold Prices in Shanghai in Recent Years (Unit: national currency yuan)

Since the establishment of the Sino-American loan and the Sino-British loan one after another, and the negotiations on the extension of the silver agreement have been successful, in addition to the increasingly favorable international situation for China, and the war situation in the War of Resistance has also undergone a progressive change, the people's morale has been greatly boosted, and the entire city has shown a slight recovery. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has also promulgated a policy requiring domestic gold production to be sold to the Central Bank and its agencies, and has initially implemented a national gold policy to replenish foreign exchange reserves. Although this cannot have much effect on the Shanghai gold market in the occupied area, it also has a certain effect on the speculative psychology in the gold market.

### Pudong Shangnan Border: Tensions Rise Again; Encounters Occur Daily in Japanese Defense Zone; Three Counties' Guerrilla Forces Complete Re-deployment

The situation at the border between Pudong and Shangchuan had barely eased when tensions rose again at the Shangnan border. An unspecified number of Chinese guerrillas had already moved into Beicai, about three to four li from Pudong Avenue. The area around Yanjiabridge, Liulibridge, and Yujiabridge was threatening the Japanese defense zone in Nanmatou and Shangnan Road. Encounters had been occurring daily, and the Japanese seemed to be suffering serious blows, with twenty to thirty killed or wounded in five days.

Dense Gunfire

would sporadically erupt at night. The Japanese troops would remain holed up in their defensive works, not daring to venture out. At 2:00 PM on the eighth, Chinese and Japanese forces clashed again west of Yanjiabridge. More than ten Japanese soldiers were ambushed, and two were wounded and retreated. Afterwards, the Nanmatou brigade came to reinforce them, cutting off land and water transportation. The Japanese merchant inland tugboats sailing into Bailianjing Port were also turned back by the Japanese army. The situation was

Unusually Tense.

However, the guerrillas adopted a strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness, purely using harassment tactics. By the time the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they had drifted away again, leaving the Japanese soldiers to toil in vain, exhausted from running around. Rumors were flying in Zhoujiadu, the starting point of Shangnan Road, and Zhoupu, its endpoint, causing great panic among the Japanese troops, who increased their alert. Every evening, Zhoupu Town would

Use Searchlights

from the high observation tower, shining them into the surrounding fields to guard against guerrilla attacks. The Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company's Beijing Maru and other ferries, which connect Nanjing Road's North Bund to the Shangnan train at Zhoujiadu, have canceled the Zhoujiadu route. It is still operated by the Japanese Nanhui Garrison's military ferry, the Nanhui Maru. Passengers without a "citizen's certificate" are at risk of arrest and loss of life. It is also understood that in the

Pudong Shangnan Border Area

around Bailianjing, Liulibridge, Nanmatou, and Yanjiabridge, the Japanese army has recently occupied civilian land, excavated farmland, and piled up six or seven grave mounds, claiming that they contain the bodies of soldiers who died in battle in the Shangnan area. However, according to internal sources, these are empty graves. All the corpses have been secretly cremated, and the ashes taken away. It is unknown what these empty graves are for. As for the

Guerrilla Forces

operating in the Chuansha and Fengxian areas of Pudong, after being ordered to be reorganized in Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang, the authorities recently dispatched ×× units from Western Zhejiang to the Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian areas to continue their activities. As a result, the situation in various places has become tense again, and the Japanese have also stepped up their alert. Along the Shangchuan and Shangnan lines, the Japanese have begun to increase their troop deployments. However, traffic to and from the east and west of the Huangpu River remains normal.

### After Gold Control: Stabilizing Market Gold Prices; Preventing Gold Outflow and Curbing Speculation to Directly Increase China's Foreign Exchange Reserves

In order to prevent the outflow of gold and curb speculation, the Chinese government is implementing gold control. In addition to issuing measures for the exchange of gold items for legal tender, it is also supervising measures for silver shops to collect and exchange gold items, aiming to stabilize market gold prices and increase foreign exchange reserves. Details are as follows:

Stabilizing Gold Prices

After the war, silver shops and gold shops in various places took advantage of the opportunity to raise and lower gold prices at will, manipulating the market for private gain. As a result, inland gold prices have been trending upward, with prices even exceeding world gold prices or Hong Kong gold prices. This has disrupted the financial market and hindered the future of the war of resistance more than anything else. The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance specifically stipulate that the value of gold jewelry shall be based on the value jointly determined by silver shops and the Central Bank, or the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, aiming to prohibit arbitrary raising or lowering of prices in order to stabilize market gold prices.

Increasing Reserves

The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that all gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, placer gold, and ore gold stored throughout the country, as well as gold items that are not in the shape of ornaments, shall be sold to the Central Bank to directly increase foreign exchange reserves, which indirectly protects the credit of legal tender. However, in order to take care of the business of merchants and civilians, silver shops are still allowed to continue to collect or sell red gold and 90% gold bullion in the shape of ornaments and utensils, and may be entrusted by the Central Bank to collect gold items that are not in the shape of ornaments and utensils, as well as placer gold and ore gold.

Freedom for the People

The central government has promoted the movement of thrift and frugality in many ways, but the people still follow old habits, either using gold items as ornaments and various utensils, or storing gold items in cellars and transporting them abroad, which violates the principle of thrift and frugality and hinders the strength of the war of resistance. The government stipulates that gold items stored by the people that are not in the shape of ornaments and utensils should be sold to the Central Bank, while gold items in the shape of ornaments and utensils are still allowed to be freely bought and sold or processed and transformed by the people in silver shops. This still implies that civil habits are not rejected in the ban of cash flight.

### Japanese Troops Retreat from Along the Yangtze River in Northern Jiangsu; The Ports of Qidong and Haimen Counties Still Guarded by Chinese Troops

According to Modern News Agency, the Japanese and puppet troops who invaded Qidong and Haimen counties in northern Jiangsu, after occupying the ports along the Yangtze River last year, have recently been severely attacked by Li Mingyang's troops. The Japanese and puppets suffered heavy losses and, due to insufficient troop deployment, have retreated. According to a visitor from Haimen yesterday, when the Japanese troops had not yet retreated, plainclothes teams dispatched by regular Chinese troops had posted slogans in various towns along the river. The Japanese troops, suspecting that the main force had arrived, were terrified. Gunfire erupted at night, chilling the Japanese and puppets to the bone. On the seventh of this month, at dawn, they boarded gunboats and left in droves. Now, the ports along the Yangtze River in Qidong and Haimen counties are still guarded by Chinese troops dispatched to their original defense areas. Local order has been restored. All foreign merchant ships sailing to Beisha have resumed normal operations, and cargo transportation is being actively adjusted by the administrative organs of the two counties, and it can be restored to its old appearance in the shortest possible time.

### To Increase Funding for the War of Resistance: Various Provinces Implement Monopoly System; Zhejiang Province Has Already Implemented Monopoly of Cigarettes and Matches; Expansion Will Be Considered After Trial Implementation Proves Effective

In order to increase funding for the war of resistance, the Chinese government has decided to implement a monopoly system, which will first be promoted by the provincial governments. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government's trial implementation of the cigarette monopoly has been effective, and it has also implemented a match monopoly, which is also managed by the Cigarette Management Office. Details are as follows:

After Management

After the promulgation of the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Times of Emergency, it was stipulated that cotton, silk, ramie, wool and their products, food, vegetable oil, tea, sugar, leather, wood, salt, coal, coke, kerosene, gasoline, diesel oil, lubricating oil, alcohol, cement, lime, matches, glass, bricks, tiles, fertilizers, electrical machinery tools, educational equipment, transportation equipment, and minerals shall be subject to management. When necessary, they may be nationalized or jointly operated with investment. Unless approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, they may not cease operations, suspend operations, or stop work. At the same time, the entire or part of them may be purchased at fair prices. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.

Implementing Monopoly

The monopoly system occupies an important position in finance. Therefore, in recent years, various countries have changed consumption taxes to a monopoly system in order to enrich the national treasury. Although the Chinese government has had plans for a monopoly in the past, none of them have been implemented. Now, because the monopoly system is the only good way to increase funding for the war of resistance, it has been decided that the provincial governments should first find ways to implement it. The goods that are suitable for a monopoly include tobacco, alcohol, tea, salt, sugar, matches, and cigarettes. It is heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, etc., will first handle the monopoly of tobacco and matches, and will consider expanding it after the trial implementation proves effective.

Effective Trial Implementation

After Zhejiang Province's trial implementation of the cigarette monopoly, it formulated the Wartime Match Monopoly Regulations, which were approved and implemented by the provincial government's 1029th resolution meeting. The Cigarette Management Office was designated to also manage the match monopoly. After receiving the order, the office has already completed preparations and will implement it from January 1st of this year. Regarding the match monopoly affairs in various places, relevant agencies shall be responsible for handling them. The county branch offices are specifically designated to also handle the match monopoly affairs within their jurisdiction, without setting up additional agencies, in order to save money. As for the Match Monopoly Regulations, they are omitted.

Benefits of Monopoly

Under the monopoly system: (1) Taxes and profits are combined into the monopoly price. These profits originally belonged to private individuals, but as a result of the monopoly, they are completely incorporated into the national treasury. (2) The method of taxation is adopted, but it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no tax evasion or leakage. Under the monopoly, because taxation is implied in the selling price, more complete results are obtained than with taxation. (3) The state must establish collection agencies for taxation, but the monopoly can save expenses. (4) Although the monopoly price is regulated, it can be increased at any time as needed for financial reasons, without hindering the national economy.

### British Army Clarifies Stance on Closing of Puppet Police Station; Major Ashmore Issues Statement Denying Japanese Reports

According to the Continental Daily, a Japanese newspaper in this city reported that last Thursday, British troops closed a puppet police station and threw mud at a photograph of former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, etc. Yesterday (the 8th), British Army Major Ashmore denied this, saying that when the puppet police station was closed, there were no photographs of Konoe or anyone else. This action was personally supervised by him, and the actual work was done by the puppet police themselves. As for the Japanese newspaper's claim that the puppet five-color flag was torn to shreds, Major Ashmore said that when the British troops were about to leave, they saw the flag, took it down, and handed it over to the puppet police. As for the claim that a puppet policeman was beaten by several British soldiers, it was not true. The Japanese newspaper also published a message from a semi-official news agency, criticizing Major Ashmore for his "arrogant" attitude when he met with representatives of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government," and also severely criticizing the British authorities. According to Major Ashmore, a Japanese person went to the British Army Headquarters to inquire about the reasons for closing the puppet police station. He met with the Japanese person and told him that the puppet police station was within the British Army's defense zone and was adjacent to the concession road. This was the main reason for closing it. The display of the five-color flag in the British Army's defense zone would be a source of discord between the two sides, and the British Army authorities also believed that this flag should not be displayed in the defense zone. He then explained to the Japanese person that the British Army authorities did not recognize the puppet police in this area.

### Shanghai West Guerrillas Execute Japanese Spy; All Units Notified to Intensify Strict Investigation

Guerrilla forces in the area around Hongqiao Road, Qinghong Road, Huhang Road, and Humin Road in western Shanghai have recently been unusually active. In addition to the Japanese soldiers protecting the railway lines at the Lao Xin, Longhua, and Meilong Cuizhuang railway stations, there are a small number of Japanese soldiers stationed at Shanghai Middle School, Hongqiao Road, and Lincoln Road. However, the Japanese army is afraid of being intercepted by the guerrillas and does not dare to cross the Lei Chi River. Therefore, it buys over traitors to spy on the guerrillas' whereabouts. A person was arrested by Captain Qin in Chengjiaqiao, Hongqiao Road, the day before yesterday, and has been executed. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, a Shandong native named Yang was also arrested by Mei, the captain of the Zhongyi Salvation Army Brigade, in Guanzhang, at the southern end of Humin Road. A military reconnaissance paper issued by the Japanese was found in the lining of the suspect's clothes, as well as four Kangxi coins. After strict interrogation by Captain Mei, the suspect confessed to spying on military intelligence and revealed that there were more than ten people in the Shanghai West area. After obtaining the confession, Captain Mei executed the suspect by firing squad yesterday and notified all the teams to pay close attention to strict investigation.

### Japanese Army Sends New Recruits Again; Merchants Forced to Enlist; New Recruits Lack Healthy Condition Based on Physical Strength

At 10:00 AM yesterday, a huge Japanese transport ship, full of Japanese army soldiers, all unarmed, sailed into the Huangpu River and docked at the Hongkou Huangpu Wharf. They immediately formed teams and went ashore, temporarily stationed at the Yong'an Textile Factory temporary barracks, only issuing firearms to be transferred to combat. Most of these soldiers wore glasses and were not as strong as before. They were all new recruits drafted from merchants.

### Sufficient to Maintain Legal Tender Reserves: China Has Abundant Silver Reserves; Monthly War of Resistance Consumption is Only 5 Million Gold Yuan; Foreign Exchange Rate Will Not Rise or Fall in Two Years

Since the start of the War of Resistance, which has lasted for eighteen months, China's financial situation has remained stable and consolidated. According to the results of a thorough investigation by banking circles:

China's Current Silver Reserves

amount to 690 million yuan. This figure was obtained based on statistics on China's silver imports and exports over a fifty-year period from 1888 to 1938. It was also found that at the end of November 1937, the legal tender issuance amount was 1.683469 billion yuan, and by May 1938, the issuance amount had increased to 1.700532 billion yuan, that is, an additional 100.6 million yuan was issued between November of the previous year and May of the last year. As for the

Amount of Silver Stored in the United States,

as of the end of June 1938, there was still 84 million US dollars. When China originally had US dollars stored in the United States in November 1937, it was 84 million US dollars. Between June and June 1938, 63 million US dollars were used, and then the sale of 140 million ounces of silver replenished the 84 million US dollars. From this, it can be seen that

China's Monthly War of Resistance Consumption

is at most only 5 million gold yuan, and since the US dollars stored in the United States are the reserve for foreign exchange, the value of legal tender in foreign exchange will fluctuate between the current exchange rates, and there will not be a huge rise or fall. Moreover, after the implementation of the legal tender system, the export and use of silver are only between 500 million and 600 million yuan, which is more than enough to maintain the preparation of legal tender and foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, according to the observations of banking circles, if half of the remaining silver stored in the country can be used, its ability will not only be enough to increase the issuance of legal tender by 200 million yuan, but at the same time, it will continue to maintain the current foreign exchange rate for two years.

### Frugality for Disaster Relief Donations Sent to the Association; Citizens' Group Holds Standing Committee Meeting; Benefit Performance by Amateur Performers Scheduled

Township Group Holds First Standing Committee Meeting

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Township Group Fundraising Committee is scheduled to hold its first Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 PM today at the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, 16 Longmen Road.

### Korean People's League Expresses Wishes for China's Victory in the War of Resistance; The Day of China's Victory in the War of Resistance is Also the Day of Korea's Liberation

The Korean People's League, organized by Koreans residing in China, has issued a letter to the Chinese people, expressing deep sympathy for the Chinese government's 18 months of resistance and supporting General Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of China's war of resistance, and paying tribute to the officers fighting on the front lines. The letter to the Chinese people states, in essence, that since the Chinese government began resisting the Japanese army, it has lasted for 18 months. Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, the entire Chinese army and people are in high spirits and have no intention of retreating, shattering the Japanese dream of a "quick war and quick victory." The Japanese army has now deployed more than one million troops to the east, west, and north of China, which can be said to have exhausted its efforts, but the result is only the occupation of a part of the cities. The control of the villages is entirely in the hands of the Chinese army. This result is sufficient to form China's victory. The day when the 450 million people of China are liberated is also the day when the 30 million people of Korea regain their freedom. Since Korea was destroyed by Japan, it has been 29 years. During these 29 years, all 30 million Koreans have been under heavy oppression. Their lives are worse than those of dogs and horses. Therefore, Koreans who have been destroyed for 29 years are eager for the victory of the motherland's war of resistance. China and Korea have the same history. The people of both countries have been suppressed by Japan in recent years. This decision for China to launch a full-scale war of resistance is not only to revitalize China, but also to save the weak and small nations of the world. With the unanimous support of the Korean people, we wish China's war of resistance to achieve final victory.

### Sauce and Wine Industry Undertakes Donations

### Dr. Baker Returns from Inspecting the Southwest: Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Guangdong All Suffer from Disease; Severe Housing Shortage in Kunming and Chongqing

According to the Continental Press, the Shanghai International Red Cross is about to publish a public announcement containing a report by Dr. Baker, a standing committee member of the China International Relief Committee. The report states that Hunan Province, northern Guangxi, eastern Jiangxi, and parts of Guangdong Province are suffering from a particularly severe epidemic of malaria, and the relief work to aid civilians suffering from disease and injuries is completely inadequate. Dr. Baker recently went to

Southwest Inspection

and reported on the relief situation before returning to Shanghai last month. Regarding the inability to cope with the relief situation in the interior, Dr. Baker cited two reasons: first, a lack of transportation, resulting in a shortage of medicine; and second, the dispiritedness of Chinese doctors and nurses. Concerning possible remedies, Dr. Baker proposed establishing a fund to operate regular automobile transportation services to evacuate hospital personnel close to the front lines. As for doctors and nurses whose

resolve is wavering

he believes it is because there is no guarantee of evacuation when Japanese troops arrive in the area. He heard that many doctors and nurses, fearing abandonment, were already abandoning their posts before it was absolutely necessary. Dr. Baker praised the national government's plan to provide as much assistance as possible to wartime refugees. According to Dr. Baker, dispersing refugees to rural areas some distance from highways and railways is the most effective way to reduce the suffering of ordinary people. Dr. Baker

after the Changsha fire

arrived in the area soon after. Although the properties of some churches, such as the American Presbyterian Church, remained intact, many other churches in the city were reduced to ashes. With a few exceptions, the Changsha relief program was smooth and very effective. While staying in the ruined city, Dr. Baker met refugees scattered in the countryside and saw refugees presenting their identification papers and being given relocation subsidies. During this inspection, Dr. Baker

traveled through six provinces

covering a distance of 3,700 miles. Due to transportation difficulties, he traveled by sampan in some areas. He took a ship from Hong Kong to Haikou, determined to see the malaria epidemic now rampant in southwestern China. It is said that although many fishermen in Beihai and Haikou have become wartime refugees in the area, this is not the main relief problem in the area. In Kunming, Chengdu, and Chongqing, the housing problem is even more severe than the refugee problem. Near Chengdu and Chongqing, there are

wartime orphans

who are supervised and cared for by Madame Chiang. It is estimated that the cost of maintaining each orphan is only five yuan per month. Kunming and Chongqing are experiencing a severe housing shortage due to the influx of refugees from the Yangtze River basin and South China, making it difficult for both the rich and the poor to find a place to live. In Kunming, there is no refugee problem at all. The situation in Guiyang is very similar to that in Yunnan and Sichuan, but a large number of Chinese doctors and nurses have fled to the area from the war zone or

war-threatened

areas. When Dr. Baker arrived in Guizhou, the provincial government's relief plan had not yet been implemented, but Dr. Baker believed that shortly after he left Guizhou, the plan would be put into practice. The plan includes establishing a registration station on the Hunan-Guizhou border highway, the only route from Hunan to Guizhou. Farmers, builders, and metalworkers entering Guizhou Province will be directed to Guiyang by the station. Upon arrival, merchants and workers will begin working in the suburbs of Guiyang, while farmers will be sent further into the

interior for cultivation

Dr. Baker traveled by car from Guiyang to Liuzhou and Guilin in Guangxi Province. Liuzhou still has no refugee problem, but it is quite unsettled due to refugees passing through and treating civilians injured in air raids. The local church is currently engaged in relief work, and the county government is also cooperating to deal with the situation. Guilin urgently needs medicine to treat injured civilians and refugees from Guangzhou who are sick along the way. In addition, there is

disease epidemic

The Guilin County Government has formulated a plan to disperse refugees, but the implementation of these plans is hampered by a lack of funds. However, some missionaries have organized an international relief committee to help alleviate the refugee situation. Dr. Baker then traveled from Guangxi to Hengyang, Hunan, and saw that most of the churches there were deserted, and the doctors and nurses in the hospitals had retreated elsewhere

transportation is convenient

Therefore, transportation for the shipment of supplies and the evacuation of civilians is urgently needed. It is now a problem to care for the wounded soldiers in the city, but the county government's plan to relieve the wounded is still being implemented. When Dr. Baker arrived in Changsha, what he saw was almost all ruins and rubble. He then departed from Lingling, traveled by train through Jiangxi, and arrived in Zhejiang. There is also a malaria epidemic in Jiangxi, and

many wounded soldiers

Only missionaries are engaged in a small amount of civilian relief work. The missionaries in Jinhua are busy treating the diseases of refugees, but there are no refugees in Lishui. Most of the relief work in Wenzhou is handled by the local Chinese Relief Committee. After arriving in Wenzhou, Dr. Baker returned directly to Shanghai.

### Amateur Actors Form a Group to Perform Famous Plays Regularly

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's amateur actors' group, in order to provide food and clothing to maritime refugees, has specifically scheduled a charity performance for the 13th of this month at the Renewal Stage on Niuzhuang Road. There will be two shows, day and night. In addition to famous amateur actors from various troupes, famous actors such as Zhou Xinfang, Lin Shusen, Zhang Yipeng, and Jin Suqin will be invited to perform their best plays. The charity performance is organized by Zhang Chunbao, a well-known figure at sea, and supported by Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Shang Shenbo, Rong Mingda, Xia Chengliang, Jin Xinmin, Sun Lanting, Bao Xiaodie, Wang Jinghu, Liu Anqing, Zhu Shichang, Yao Youbang, and others. It is said that tickets have already been distributed by various sectors.

### Japanese Troops Shoot Chinese People: One Dead, One Wounded

At around 8:15 yesterday morning, a Japanese patrol shot two Chinese people on Xward Road near Yuanfang Road, killing one and wounding one. The details are not yet known, but it is known that as the Japanese soldiers were escorting the two Chinese people, one of them suddenly tried to escape. In the confusion, the Japanese soldiers opened fire, accidentally killing the Chinese person who had not escaped. The escapee was only injured. It is reported that the authorities in the Public Concession have begun investigating the case.

### Ningbo-Taizhou Ships Banned from Docking at Dinghai: Dinghai Route Temporarily Interrupted; Ningbo-Shanghai Cargo Ships Prohibited from Carrying Passengers

Guo Chiping, commander of the Ningbo garrison, telegraphed the shipping industry in this city yesterday, temporarily prohibiting Ningbo-Dinghai-Taizhou ships from docking at Dinghai. Tangsai and Meda have complied and sailed directly on the Ningbo-Taizhou line. The details are recorded as follows:

### Tangsai and Meda Temporarily Banned from Bay Ding

The Tangsai, a ship of the American-owned China Merchants Navigation Company, and the Meda, a ship of the Portuguese-owned Merry Company, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Taizhou-Ningbo line. They were then notified by the Ningbo authorities to prohibit sailing from Taizhou to Shanghai. Therefore, the two ships complied and only sailed on the Ningbo-Taizhou line, also serving Bay Dinghai and Shipu. Unexpectedly, on New Year's Eve last year, a misunderstanding and conflict occurred in Dinghai between guerrillas and resident police. All transports suspended sailing to Dinghai. Subsequently, as order was restored, Tangsai and other transports also resumed serving Bay. Yesterday, China Merchants Navigation Company and others received a telegram from Guo Chiping, commander of the Ningbo garrison, notifying them to temporarily prohibit Tangsai and Meda from docking at Dinghai and Shipu. After receiving the order, the companies decided to comply and sail directly on the Shanghai-Taizhou line from today. It is reported that the Tianbao and Libao, which originally sailed on the Ningbo-Dinghai route, have also been temporarily suspended. In addition, after Shanghai-Taizhou transports were banned from Bay Dinghai, no order has been received to restore it. Therefore, navigation to Dinghai has been completely interrupted. (Above from Modern News Agency)

### Loading Cargo to Ningbo, Prohibited from Carrying Passengers

Ningbo Garrison Command Order No. 0055 states: "Upon investigation, it has been approved that transport ships loading local products from Ningbo to Shanghai are specifically for carrying native products that have been approved for export. All other passengers and local products that have not been approved for export shall not be attached for export. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered that you strictly comply with the above and implement it effectively. This is the order."

### Shanghai-Ningbo Combined Transport Is Quite Effective

The American-owned China Merchants Navigation Company's Tangsai ship on the Taizhou-Ningbo line and the Tangbei ship on the Shanghai-Taizhou line, and the Portuguese-owned Merry Company's Meda ship on the Taizhou-Ningbo line and the German-owned Lihe Foreign Firm's Hailun ship on the Shanghai-Taizhou line, handle Shanghai to Ningbo combined transport, with Taizhou (i.e., Haimen) in Zhejiang as the center. Since its implementation, passengers and cargo owners have praised its convenience. Passengers can purchase joint tickets in Shanghai and Ningbo, and cargo can be directly picked up in Shanghai or Ningbo. (Above from New Sound News Agency)

### Italian Warship in Huangpu River Celebrates Italian Queen's Birthday

According to the North China Daily News, yesterday (the 8th) was the birthday of the Italian Queen. The Italian 7,000-ton cruiser Carloeni, berthed in Shanghai, held a celebration at night. Warships of various countries berthed in Shanghai all flew the Italian flag to celebrate.

### Yemeni Prince Concerned About the Suffering of Muslims; War Extends North, Affecting Muslims; Believes in the Necessity of Unity

According to the Continental Press, Prince Hussein of Yemen stated to reporters yesterday (the 8th) that Yemen is deeply concerned about the suffering of Chinese Muslims due to the Japanese invasion and urgently called on all Muslims to unite in this time of global turmoil. The reporter interviewed the prince at the Cathay Hotel. It is said that I find it difficult to talk about any events concerning China, because I know very little about China and feel that I should not talk about it. I am staying in Shanghai briefly, compelled by miscellaneous matters, and even have no time to meet with local Muslim leaders. But I can say that the people of our country are deeply concerned about the developments in China and agree that these developments affect Chinese Muslims. In recent years, the war has spread north, affecting many Muslims. As the world continues to be turbulent, all Muslims must unite. Events in Arabia have forced Muslims there to begin to unite. Muslim countries around the world will follow suit, not only as a religious movement but also as a political and economic force. Prince Hussein recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo by plane, stayed for only four days, and then flew to Japan yesterday. When asked about his purpose in going to Tokyo, he did not admit that this trip had a political mission, saying that he went to Japan last May to open a new mosque in Tokyo and hoped to assist in the development of Islam in Japan to the best of his ability. He will return to Shanghai soon, but cannot say for sure when. If he does return to Shanghai, he hopes to stay longer to study the local situation.

### Post Office Stops Sending Small Packages to Various Places; Remote Provinces and Guerrilla Areas Temporarily Stop Receiving Except for Medicines

The joint dispatch group for small packages of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday stating: "Due to transportation difficulties, (1) all small packages sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Xinjiang, etc., should be temporarily suspended; (2) all those sent to the west of the Pinghan Railway in Henan should also be temporarily suspended; (3) all those sent to the west of the Yuehan Railway in Guangdong Province should also be temporarily suspended; (4) all those sent to Jiujiang, Xingzi, De'an, Ruichang, and Guling in Jiangxi Province should also be temporarily suspended; (5) all those sent to Hukou, Pengze, Duchang, Yongxiu, Shanxiadu, Wucheng, Poyang, Wuning, Xiushui, etc., in Jiangxi Province should also be temporarily suspended, except for medicine packages; (6) all those sent to Tonggu, Anyi, Jing'an, Fengxin, Yifeng, Gao'an, Shanggao, Wanzai, Shanglishi, etc., in Jiangxi Province should also be temporarily suspended, except for personal packages and medicine packages; (7) all those sent to various places in the war zone where the post office has not yet resumed business should also be temporarily suspended. Small packages can be sent to all places except those listed above. This is a special announcement."

### Rice Prices Slightly Rebound; Prices Always Rise at the End of the Lunar Year; Prices Will Drop After the New Year

Since the opening of the rice market this year, due to the balance of production and sales and the large amount of rice in storage, rice prices have remained at the closing prices at the end of last year. However, in the past day or two, due to the cold weather, inland water transportation has been more difficult, and the arrival of goods has been slightly affected. It is now estimated that only three to four thousand bags of rice arrive at the port each day, a decrease of one to two thousand bags compared to last week. Rice prices in the Shanghai market have rebounded slightly by two or three cents in the past two days. The highest price of japonica rice is currently 12.45 yuan per picul. Medium-sized rice shops, due to their large inventory, and brokerage firms, due to their busy transactions, have also seen prices rise uniformly. According to the rice industry, rice prices in the Shanghai market always rise at the beginning of the lunar year and the end of the lunar year, but this is due to the cold winter and has little impact on the overall market price. Prices will drop after the end of the lunar new year.

### Postal Service in the Occupied Areas Maintains Independence; Postal Flags Should Be Flown, Not Changed

According to reports from postal workers in the interior to the Shanghai Postal Administration, postal bureaus that have resumed operations in the occupied areas may be forced to hang counterfeit flags. Therefore, the Postal Administration has forwarded a request to the Director-General of Posts that all bureaus in the occupied areas that resume postal services should, in principle, fly any flag that was originally flown, but should also fly the postal flag to maintain the independence of the postal service.

### Negotiations to Open Hongkou; No Important Results in Recent Days

Yesterday, rumors spread that the Eastern District issue would be resolved soon, and that Hongkou and Yangshupu would be opened soon. However, according to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, although negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Japanese side are still in progress, it is unlikely that normal conditions will be restored soon. The spokesman also stated that no important results have been achieved in the negotiations in recent days. According to Chinese newspapers, the issues of transportation, police affairs, and the status of the Eastern District have not been resolved.

### Three Sons Arrested by Japanese Troops, and Defrauded of a Large Sum of Money; Mao Yusheng's Frustration is Conceivable; Jiang Buting Detained for Interrogation

Mao Yusheng, a local resident living at No. 127 Longjiang Road, has three sons. Suddenly, on October 24 last year, his three sons were arrested and detained by the Japanese Command on suspicion of stealing cotton. After many days had passed without their release, Yusheng was very anxious about the fate of his three sons. A nephew, Mao Lianlian, introduced him to a friend, Jiang Buting, from Haimen, who claimed that he could find a way to release the three sons, but demanded a reward of 300 yuan for expenses. Mao Yusheng agreed at the time, and paid 100 yuan first on November 18, which Jiang Buting transferred to Lu Xuhong, a comprador at Xinlong Foreign Firm at No. 209 Yuanmingyuan Road, to handle. Four days later, Yusheng paid another 200 yuan because his sons had not yet been released. Unexpectedly, another month passed without any news, and when he went to Xinlong Foreign Firm to inquire, the firm had closed down and the building was empty.

### Giant Mansion on Fangbang Road Robbed Clean; Bandits Visit Rosewood Workshop; Apprentice Guard Beaten

Behind Hongfu Lane on Fangbang Road in the Shanghai Old City, there is a giant mansion, five up and five down, where a certain Fang lived. When Shanghai fell, Fang took his family, gold jewelry, clothing, etc., and moved to Xiamusi Road in the French Concession. The house in the city was assigned to two male servants, Lu Afu and Jin Baochun, to guard it. They were robbed by bandits twice, and all the rosewood furniture and valuables were looted. The two servants, Lu and Jin, were beaten twice by the bandits, making it impossible for them to live in peace. They returned to the master in the concession to report, but there was nothing they could do. In recent days, the bandits, because there was nothing to rob, started demolishing the house, first selling the doors, windows, and panels, and then selling the bricks, tiles, and wood. Now the giant mansion has been turned into a flat ground.

Li Fuxing Rosewood Workshop, opened by Li Fusheng at No. 31, Yinying Temple Road, at the end of Penglai Road inside Ximen, when the suburbs fell, Li hired people to transport the finished rosewood furniture, etc., to the western part of Fuli Road in the French Concession and rented a house to store it. There was also unfinished rosewood material, and he sent apprentices Zhao Xiaogou and Zhang Asan to guard it. They were repeatedly searched by local gangsters three times, and all the rosewood material and valuables were looted. Unexpectedly, the night before last (the 8th) at 11:30 pm, five bandits wielding iron rods, bayonets, and other weapons suddenly came, smashed open the gate, and first dragged Zhao and Zhang, who were already asleep, out of their blankets. They forced them to hand over the hidden silver, but they did not succeed. The bandits then beat the two apprentices with iron rods, leaving them covered in wounds. Then they searched the entire house, but there were no valuables. They took the two old cotton quilts and one cotton pad that the two apprentices were covering, as well as an old cotton-padded jacket and pants each, blue cloth short shirt and pants, more than three斗 of white rice, one piece of salted fish, and one piece of salted meat, etc., and fled with the loot.

Five or six middle-aged men jumped out and rushed upstairs, knocking on the door of a room on the second floor. They seized a guest staying in the room, took him downstairs, and forced him into the car, which then drove off. At the time, the hotel staff were greatly surprised and were about to report it to the police when a male guest named Huang Zhaoxing, who lived in the same room, explained the situation. It turned out that the kidnapped person was named Tang Maonan, who is the current battalion commander of the Third Detachment of the Jiangzhe Border Region Guerrilla Force under his command. He had recently engaged in combat with the Japanese army in the Y窩沙 (Ya Wo Sha) area outside of Wusongkou, posing a considerable threat. He and Tang had come to Shanghai the day before yesterday for official business. When Tang was kidnapped, he was at the entrance and thus avoided being taken. After speaking, Huang left. The hotel reported all the information to the police, and the police department is currently investigating, but there has been no news so far.

Zhou Limin, a 30-year-old Ningbo native, lives at 55 Yongji Lane, Xinzha Road. He sells picture magazines for an evening newspaper and earns a considerable commission. In March of last year, Zhou Limin became involved with a promiscuous woman named Zhou Xiujuan (29 years old). He gave all his monthly commission earnings to the woman for her use. Over the past few months, she spent over 500 yuan in legal tender. In August of last year, Zhou Limin's wife in Ningbo learned about her husband's situation in Shanghai and came to Shanghai to live with her husband at 55 Yongji Lane. Every day, she urged her husband to separate from the prostitute, abandon evil, and return to righteousness. For the past two or three months, Zhou Limin has not gone to Zhou Xiujuan's place. Zhou, due to the interruption of income, has experienced financial difficulties. She still wanted to lure Limin to her, and tried to visit him many times but could not meet him. Last night at 7:00 PM, she again went to meet with Limin and went with him to a secret rendezvous at the Shunxing Inn on Guba Road in the French Concession. It is unknown what happened, but she bit off the tip of Limin's tongue, causing him to bleed profusely and scream in extreme pain. The tea attendant heard the noise and entered, seeing a person lying on the ground moaning. He immediately went out to report to the Chinese police. The Chinese police, upon receiving the report, immediately went to investigate. The prostitute, seeing the Chinese police arrive, pretended to be dead on the ground, not responding when called and not moving when pushed. Zhou Limin was sent to Tongren Hospital, and Zhou Xiujuan was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was determined that Xiujuan was not injured. The Chinese police took her to the police station to await handling.

### Steamboat Comprador Accused of Extortion; Five Defendants Released on Bail After Continued Trial Yesterday

Xu Guansheng, a wealthy merchant from Nantong who resides at 73, Lane 125, Albert Road, and his friend Wang Yigong (residing at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area), jointly invested in the Hengren Shipping Company at 125 Hankou Road on November 2nd of last year. They rented a Changde steamboat to operate between Shanghai, Nantong, and Zhanghuanggeng, with Xu serving as manager, Wang as assistant manager, Shanghai native Zhang Bingchu as steamboat comprador, Jiangyin native Chen Zhongwen as assistant comprador, and Jiangyin native Li Ganchen and Nantong native Chen Zhengzhi as business directors and deputy directors. The employees were responsible for various tasks such as transporting goods and passengers at various ports and purchasing coal in Shanghai. The steamboat operated until December 2nd, when the one-month contract expired and accounts were settled. It was discovered that the employees had profited from the company by secretly collecting commissions, causing the company to lose 30,000 yuan. The comprador Zhang Bingchu and others delayed settling and clearing the accounts, so the company commissioned lawyer Jiang Bao to publish a warning in the newspaper, setting a deadline for account settlement. Zhang and others also published rebuttals in the newspaper. While the two sides were negotiating, Chen Zhengmin, the elder brother of Chen Zhengzhi, the deputy business director of the company, also joined in demanding payment from Xu Guansheng because the company owed him a deposit and commission. On the afternoon of December 20th, Xu Guansheng and Wang Yigong received threatening letters from Chen Zhengmin, each with strong language. It was believed that Chen Zhengmin was colluding with the comprador, deputy comprador, business director, and deputy business director. They reported the matter to the French police, who arrested and detained Chen Zhengmin, Zhang Bingchu, Chen Zhongwen, Li Ganchen, and Chen Zhengzhi and sent them to the Second Special Court requesting detention for investigation, with a new hearing scheduled. As reported in this newspaper, Judge Zhang Minsheng continued the trial at the Criminal Court One yesterday morning.顾守熙 (Gu Shouxi), the lawyer representing the French Concession administration, presented the case and prosecuted based on Article 346 of the Criminal Law for the crime of intimidation. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wang Shizong and Zuo De. The first plaintiff, Xu Guansheng, did not appear due to illness; the second plaintiff, Wang Yigong, appeared and stated the situation of organizing the company's business and discovering the comprador and directors

colluding to commit fraud, urging them to settle and clear the accounts, and receiving threatening letters. Defendant Chen Zhengmin confessed that because Hengren Shipping Company owed him water fare, deposit, and commission, he came to Shanghai to demand payment from Xu Guansheng. Because Xu refused to meet him several times, he wrote a letter urging him to settle the matter as soon as possible. He admitted to the threatening letter incident. The remaining defendants, Zhang Bingchu, Chen Shenwen, Li Ganchen, and Chen Zhengzhi, all denied being involved with the threatening letter. The court ordered a new hearing on the 13th. The defendants each submitted a guarantee of 2,000 yuan and were released on bail with a guarantor who could be summoned at any time. Those without a guarantor were detained.

### Concealing Opium Soil, Arrested; Mastermind at Large

Chen Xiaotang, from Chaozhou, used to operate a soil business in Ji畝地 (Jiu Mu Di). Since the outbreak of the war, he moved to 23 Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road, and secretly sold opium soil for considerable profit. On the morning of the 7th of this month, Chen and his family member Chen You (also known as A Long, 22 years old) went to Caojiadu to purchase 50 taels of opium. He ordered Chen You to tie it to his chest and transport it home by car. While traveling to the intersection of Beile Road and K愷自邇路 (K愷自邇路), they were inspected by French police detectives Jiang Changwen and Chen Wenbin, and patrol officers. Chen You's chest was protruding, which was suspicious. They searched him and found the opium soil. After taking him to the police station, they went to his home to arrest Chen Xiaotang. Because he had not yet returned home, only his wife, Chen Li, was arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were jointly sent to Criminal Court One of the Second Special Court, requesting that the investigation be rescheduled to arrest the fugitive mastermind Chen Xiaotang and investigate the matter together. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, he ordered a new hearing on the 18th. The defendants were returned to detention.

### Fake "Police Station" Abuses Torture; Three Civilians Sentenced to Death; Fake Judge Cries Out "Bullshit"

After the opening of the war zone in the suburbs of Shanghai, although some poor people have moved back to live there, there are too many organizations, military power is higher than "police" power, "police" power is higher than "judicial" power, and management is complex. The people have no so-called "legal" protection. It is found that in the area under the jurisdiction of the fake "Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau" in West Shanghai, due to the rampant gambling and opium dens, and the rise of bandits, it has long become a world of terror. Last year, three civilians lost huge sums of money in gambling dens and had no way to make a living. They took the risk of robbing pedestrians on the road. One acted as a lookout, one robbed four corners (of currency), and one robbed eight corners. Unexpectedly, they were captured by the fake "police," and three fake pistols were found. The criminals were detained in the fake "Sub-bureau," subjected to private torture, and treated as major thieves with shackles and handcuffs. They were privately detained for five or six months. The former instructor sentenced them to death and sent them to the fake "Judicial Office" in Pudong for execution. However, the fake "Office" considered that the three men's situation was excusable, and a sentence of one or two years of imprisonment would be sufficient, and there was no plaintiff. When questioning the criminals, they all denied committing the robbery, saying they were coerced by the fake "police" using torture such as the "tiger bench" and "waterboarding" (i.e., pouring cold water down their noses) to extract confessions. The fake "Judicial Office" considered the evidence in this case to be insufficient, removed the instruments of torture, and ordered that they await "appropriate sentencing." Unexpectedly, the fake "Police Bureau" urged the execution, saying it was instructed by the Japanese side to handle it this way. The fake "judge" refused to obey and cried out "Bullshit, bullshit!" The fake "police" fled in dismay. It is heard that due to the dispute over this case, a major conflict has brewed between the fake "Judicial Office" and the fake "Shanghai West Sub-bureau," and it is unknown how it will be resolved.

### Fake "Court" Opens Door to Corpse; Collects 5 角 (Jiao) for Inspection Fee

The Nanshi fake "Local Court" received a report from a local bailiff in West Shanghai, saying that an unidentified male corpse, about 30 years old, wearing short clothes with knife wounds, was found outside Caojiadu in the opium and gambling district. However, the fake "prosecutor" and fake "inspector" etc., because the journey was inconvenient, ordered the bailiff to carry the corpse to the court for inspection. Therefore, this case is still the first one, and the fake "court law" also began to collect 5 角 (jiao) of silver.

### Someone Throws Bomb and Opens Fire in Dasheng Gambling Den in West Shanghai; Bomb Does Not Explode, Gunfire Rains Down; Gamblers Flee for Their Lives, Old Woman Injured

At about 10:45 AM yesterday, in the Dasheng gambling den in 忻康里 (Xin Kang Li) at the intersection of 极司非而路 (Jisi Feier Road) and 康腦脫路 (Kang Nao Tuo Road) in West Shanghai, just as the gambling den was preparing to open, a middle-aged man holding a hand grenade suddenly mixed among the gamblers and threw it towards the gambling den's hall. However, the grenade did not explode. The rogues who worked as bouncers in the gambling den, and two fake policemen stationed in the den, were shocked and quickly drew their Mauser pistols and fired at the grenade-throwing man. The man did not show weakness and also returned fire. Thus, a fierce fight broke out. The general gamblers, caught in the rain of bullets, were frightened out of their wits and fled for their lives, causing chaos. The grenade-throwing man retreated while fighting, and seemed to have other companions protecting him, and fled towards Caojiadu, before the fighting finally stopped. In total, both sides fired more than 20 shots. An old woman living in 忻康里 (Xin Kang Li), Zhu Sunshi, was injured by a stray bullet, breaking her left shoulder bone, and was subsequently sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After this incident occurred, the police方面 (fangmian) have taken strict precautions in the border area and are inspecting pedestrians, so the general bad guys have nowhere to hide. As for the origin of the incident, it was due to a dispute over business between someone in the gambling den and the gambling den owner.

### Chauffeur of Yuan Shikai's Sixth Son Scams Huge Sum of Money; Falsely Sells Master's Car, Defrauds Over Three Thousand Gold; Knowing That Matters Will Be Exposed, Colludes with Accomplices to Hire Lawyer in Advance

The sixth son of the late President Yuan Shikai, known as Yuan Laoliu, currently resides at 7, Lane 108, Huanyulong Road in the French Concession. The car he drives is a 1937 Ford model, which is not considered old. His hired driver, Liang Alin from Haidou, heard but did not forget his master's words about replacing old cars with new ones. Last month, Liang was driving the car and parked it outside the Yuan residence,

waiting for his master. It happened that the chauffeur of Tian Baixiang, a Cantonese who works at the Heji 洋行 (Heji Yanghang) on Sichuan Road, who lived in the neighboring residence, was also driving a car and waiting outside the door for his employer. The two drivers were very close to each other, so they chatted casually. Hu, because his master was eager to buy a car and saw Liang's car, asked Liang about the car owner's name. Liang knew Hu's intentions and took the opportunity to lie that his car owner was planning to sell it. Hu immediately returned to tell his master, and Tian Baixiang ordered his representative to negotiate with the other party. Liang first demanded a deposit of 200 法幣 (fabbi), and refused to issue a receipt with the excuse that the master had gone to Hong Kong and the wife could not sign it.

The receipt for the money was never issued. Hu said that the deposit he paid was temporarily borrowed from others. Since he did not receive a receipt, it was difficult to get the money from his foolish master, so he negotiated with Liang every day. Until the 7th of this month, Liang Hu finally agreed on the car price of 3,500 法幣 (fabbi). Although Hu asked to meet the car owner, he was ultimately rejected by Liang, who said that only the goods and money needed to be exchanged, why make things complicated? Hu's master initially planned to pay with a bank check, but Liang also used excuses to shirk it off, so he agreed to pay in cash. The date was set for noon on the 8th at 75 Mou'er Wulu Lane. When the date arrived, Tian Baixiang ordered his 18-year-old son, Tian Younian, to carry

a bag of 法幣 (fabbi), totaling 3,500 yuan, and take his own car, still driven by Hu Mingchu, to the predetermined location. Liang Alin was already waiting alone. After receiving the money, he turned around and entered a house in the lane. He came out after a long time and said that his master had taken the car he wanted to sell to visit friends on Ximolu, and the received car price had been transferred to his wife. Later, after Tian Hu and his servants urged him, he had no chance to escape, so he reluctantly led Tian Hu to drive to Ximolu, setting up delaying excuses all the way, until 5:00 PM,

no car was seen. Tian and others questioned him sternly. Liang's attitude suddenly changed, claiming that Tian Hu was extorting. So the master and servant joined forces to twist Liang to the 静安寺 (Jing'an Temple) police station. Under the investigation of the police chief, Liang still denied selling the car and embezzling the money, but later he confessed because he could not deny it. He admitted that he used the sale of the car as bait to swindle the money, which was all given to his relative Cao Cailin, who was hiding in the lane, to take back to Cao's residence at 8 Yu Qiaqing Road for storage. The police chief obtained the confession and immediately sent detectives Guan Huchen, detectives Lu Lianding, Wang Jiaobin, and

West detectives to his room to search under the bed, where they found the original payment. Upon inspection, it was found that 200 yuan was missing. According to Liang, the 200 yuan had been sent by Cao and Zhao Maolin to attorney Xu Jiazhi as public fees for hiring Xu to defend him. Because Liang knew that his matter was bound to be exposed, he had hired attorney Xu in advance on the night of the 7th through Zhao Maolin, the chauffeur dismissed by Xu Jia, in order to be defended. He initially did not pay, and after

swindling a large sum of money, he immediately ordered Cao Zhao to send the money. The detectives and others arrested Cao Zhao, who were accomplices, and went to attorney Xu's office to inquire. Attorney Xu then returned the original payment to the detectives. Yesterday morning, Liang, Cao, and Zhao were escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Criminal Court Eight and interrogated them. The police lawyer Qian Ju Jiu stated the circumstances of the case, but because the 200 yuan paid by the car driver of the Tian family to the defendant was

still missing, it was still necessary to request a change of date to facilitate the investigation. Then, Tian Baixiang and his son, and his car driver Hu Mingchu, separately stated the beginning and end of the incident. The court then questioned Liang Alin, who fully admitted everything, saying that his master had no intention of selling the car. Hu had just joked at the time, but later he was given a deposit of 200 yuan, which he took to the gambling den and lost. He then decided to take the opportunity to cheat, etc. The two defendants Cao Zhao both refused to take responsibility. Judge Dai then ordered a new hearing on another day.

### Woman's Abdomen Swells; Huge Amount of Opium Found; Three Women Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment Each

Zhou Kaiwen, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station, learned the other day that someone would smuggle a large amount of opium soil from Pudong to Shanghai for sale, so he secretly waited near the Bund on Jiujiang Road. At 4:20 PM, he saw three women, Sun Liushi, Zhao Liushi, and Li Sanjie, coming from Pudong. After landing, he saw that Sun Liushi's

abdomen was swollen, as if she were pregnant, but her buttocks were not raised high, which was suspicious. He reported back to the police chief and, together with a female search officer, stopped the three women and searched them. He found three large bags of opium soil on each of them, totaling 27 and a half pounds. He took them to the police station together and questioned them, who confessed that the opium soil was entrusted to them by Zhang Jinsheng and Yaozi, who lived in Pudong,

to be brought to Shanghai and delivered to 247 Fujian Road, for which they would receive a reward of five yuan.

the case. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. Judge Xiao ruled in court that Sun Liushi, Zhao Liushi, and Li Sanjie were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for transporting opium, and the opium soil was confiscated.

### Various Educational Associations Inform All Members to Carry Out the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" and Concentrate the Strength of All Educational Groups in the City to Repay Debts Based on the National Self-Reliance Principle

The Shanghai Educational Association, in order to concentrate the power of all educational groups in the city to promote the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" in the Shanghai educational circles, has contacted the Shanghai Private Secondary School Advancement Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Federation, the Shanghai Secondary School Advancement Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Staff Federation, the Shanghai Secondary School Moral Education Directors Research Association, the Shanghai Primary School Education Advancement Association, etc., to jointly promote it. The letter to the members issued by these groups is recorded below. China's strategy is a protracted war, and only through persistence can it transition from a relative advantage to an absolute advantage. After a year and six months of the War of Resistance, not only have the army and the people been forged into revolutionary bastions in the volcanoes and seas of blood, but also international trends have inevitably become increasingly favorable to China with the development of the War of Resistance. In the past, we deeply felt the sympathy and assistance of all democratic countries towards China. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have given economic support in the political sense. This is certainly an inevitable trend in the development of international contradictions, but the kindness of friendly countries is worthy of twelve points of gratitude. Originally, the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation were to be fought for through self-reliance, not entirely dependent on foreign aid. We certainly welcome and need friendly countries to aid China for justice and peace. However, what China needs assistance with is even greater than this. Therefore, this debt repayment loan can be repaid based on the national self-reliance principle. The "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been launched one after another by all sectors of Shanghai. All members of our association should actively respond, because in this way, the friendly countries will be stimulated by the Chinese people's fervent emotions and will be more determined to take the correct path in the Far East. It is very possible for international peace organizations to be formed from this, and for fascist powers to become weak. It all depends on the intensity of our struggle.

### Supplementary Education Association Stipulates Outline of Behavioral Training for Vocational Youth (Part Two) Striving to Cultivate a Completely Independent Personality and a Spirit of Serving and Transforming Society

Training Methods

Part Two (4) The methods of vocational youth behavioral training. In terms of individuals, they should develop self-education methods. In terms of groups, they should develop collective education methods. (5) Methods of self-education. (1) Self-reading: Use spare time to develop an interest in reading and develop reading ability. (2) Observe things: Observe social and life phenomena from your own vocational life to strengthen your own life knowledge. (3) Self-criticism: Be open-minded to analyze yourself, learn from others' strengths and make up for your own shortcomings. At the same time, you must be able to correct your own shortcomings in time and promote your own strengths. (6) Methods of collective education. (1) Collective research: Use spare time to carry out spare time activities, gather colleagues, and put forward problems for joint research. (2) Collective action: Participate in various social activities and absorb social experience in the activities to enrich your own basic knowledge. (3) Mutual criticism: Point out each other's advantages and disadvantages, supervise and encourage each other. This is the best way to achieve a healthy life.

Training Paths

Part Three (7) The path of vocational youth behavioral training is to grasp the reality and determine the individual and collective behavioral policies that are suitable for the actual situation. (8) Grasp the reality. (1) Analysis of various social phenomena: Collect materials, analyze the causes and practical significance of the reality. (2) Research on the realistic environment in which you are located: Analyze your own existence from reality, and look at reality from your own existence. (3) Determine your attitude towards reality: If reality is beneficial to you, how should you strive for these beneficial conditions? Otherwise, how should you overcome the difficulties of this reality? (9) Reality and collective behavior. (1) Determine the scope of collective behavior based on realistic conditions, such as national or local, down to the smallest industrial sector. (2) Determine the guidelines for collective action based on realistic conditions. Absolutely avoid blind actions, and also oppose excessive movements that are divorced from reality. A certain policy should be set under certain conditions. (3) Determine the steps of action based on realistic conditions. There must be a scope of action, a policy, and also certain steps, that is, the stages of action. This will prevent confusion and enable you to realize your own views in a planned way.

Highest Goal

Part Four (10) The current stage of behavioral training for vocational youth is to strive for personal freedom and national independence as the highest goals. (11) Personal freedom. (1) Freedom of speech and publication. (2) Freedom of assembly and association. (3) Freedom of action. (12) National independence. (1) National independence and personal freedom are inseparable. Without national independence, personal freedom will be empty. (2) Personal freedom is organically related to national independence. Striving for personal freedom is the first step in striving for national independence. Of course, after national independence, individuals will gain more extensive freedom. (3) Striving for freedom is the common goal of the Chinese people at present. Vocational youth are naturally of the same fate. (13) Conditions for completing the task. (1) Personal and collective actions must be completed from the highest principles. (2) It is necessary to obtain practical methods. (3) There must be practical paths. With these three, the historical mission undertaken by vocational youth can be completed. (End)

### School Overview: Wuxi Middle School

Wuxi Middle School was founded in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920) by educator Gao Jiansi, who donated 50,000 yuan in accordance with his father Qiuquan's will. At that time, the school board hired Tang Weizhi, the former president of Shanghai Nanyang University, as the principal. He served for ten years, planning and managing the school on a grand scale. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), it was approved for registration by the Jiangsu Education Department. Later, through the efforts of successive principals and the support of people from all walks of life, the facilities became increasingly perfect, and it enjoyed a considerable reputation in Jiangsu Province. The school's curriculum is aimed at connecting with the courses of Jiaotong University. Most of the graduates have entered Jiaotong University and other famous universities in China. Talents have emerged one after another, making great contributions. Last winter, when Wuxi was occupied, the school was temporarily disbanded. This summer, the school principal, Mr. Zhou Zhenbo, in response to the requirements of students' parents, consulted with Qian Sunqing, Tang Weizhi, Gao Jiansi, and other school board members, and relocated the school to Shanghai. He leased a building at No. 451 Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, as a temporary school building. At the same time, he reported to the Education Department, and soon received Instruction No. 4989 from Huai, approving the record. The school is now divided into six grades of senior and junior high school, with more than 200 students. The hired teachers, such as Shen Hong, Sheng Shuzhou, Wu Gaiting, Shen Zuifeng, Zhang Qifu, Guo Jinyang, Lu Renbo, Qian Zhonghan, Gao Naian, Wang Yaode, Wu Youmei, Jiang Wenhua, Zhang Yuanbai, etc., are all learned scholars. All the facilities in the school are still based on the educational purpose and the past spirit of the school. Teaching management is practical, and coursework is serious. Each senior high school grade has 30 hours of instruction per week, and each junior high school grade has 28 hours of instruction per week, which meets the standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The tuition fee is 32 yuan per semester for senior high school and 28 yuan per semester for junior high school. Recently, Lin Xisheng and Ding Houqing of this city, considering the school's long history and outstanding reputation, have specially approved the establishment of 18 scholarships in the school from the next semester. The scholarship amount is 35 yuan per semester for each senior high school student and 25 yuan per semester for each junior high school student. All new and old students of the school who are from poor families and have excellent character and learning have the hope of obtaining this scholarship. At the same time, the school also added six free places to show encouragement. Other than that, the equipment of instruments and the purchase of books are all strived to be enriched to benefit the students. Once transportation is convenient, it is also planned to transport the instruments and books stored in Wuxi to Shanghai for application.

In addition to listing the two fees for the management institutions of eight secondary schools and seven primary schools, it also adds subsidies for secondary school vocational education work groups, complete counties for handling compulsory education classes, and education funds for subsidized occupied counties. This budget summary will be submitted to the provincial government for approval.

(Cologne, 9th - Huitong News Agency) The European Davis Cup Committee held a meeting here yesterday, chaired by President Girod, and, together with the International Lawn Tennis Association, put forward important recommendations regarding the European Zone competition system. The first recommendation is that the competition should adopt a four-week system instead of a five-week system. It was also decided that strong teams should be placed in seeded positions to avoid meeting in the first week. Furthermore, teams eliminated in the first week of the previous competition will not be allowed to participate in the following year's competition. This way, the five-week system can be changed to a four-week system.

New Medicine and New Drugs - Edited by the Shanghai Medical Association

### Inaugural Address

— Song Guobin

A newspaper is the voice of the people, the compass of society, bearing the responsibility of guiding the public. When a newspaper includes a medical and pharmaceutical supplement, its responsibility becomes even greater. Medical and pharmaceutical knowledge is related to human life; when used well, it is a tool for saving lives, but when used poorly, it becomes a weapon for killing. Those who run medical and pharmaceutical publications should be especially cautious. This newspaper has long had a medical and pharmaceutical weekly supplement, and the Medical Association also publishes "New Medicine and Society." Both publications have adhered to this principle, being cautious in their words and meticulous in their work. They have been published for many years and are well-regarded by readers. After August 13th, both publications ceased to exist. Now, ghosts and demons are emerging into the light of day. Colleagues in the Medical Association and the newspaper management cannot bear to stand idly by. We wish to continue the spirit of the past and seek cooperation in the future. This is why this publication has been created. I hope my colleagues will join me in this endeavor.

### Commentary - Charity and the Law

— Qu Shaoheng

The phrases "doctors have charitable hearts," "doctors are willing to cut flesh to heal," and "doctors are benevolent guards" are all praises for doctors, and also words of encouragement. Therefore, doctors must first have a benevolent heart before they can practice their benevolent art. What is benevolence? It is charity. Hence, the Western proverb: "A doctor without benevolence is not to be trusted." This is indeed true. Today, however, some treat charitable medical work as a personal profit-making venture. Some even pretend to be doctors, using deceptive practices to confuse the public, pursuing only profit, deserving of scorn and condemnation, and dragging the medical profession through the mud. Therefore, the government has enacted laws to regulate this, and those who serve with enthusiasm are also protected. Acts such as failing to provide aid to the dying, extorting money, refusing to treat patients without reason, and causing death through negligence are all prohibited by law. Furthermore, the law restricts doctors from performing surgery unless they first obtain the consent of the patient or their family, completing all necessary procedures before treatment. Otherwise, it is illegal and subject to punishment. Preventing problems at an early stage is not unreasonable in principle, but in practice, there are significant discrepancies. For example, if a patient needs emergency care, waiting for all the procedures to be completed before treatment could mean missing the critical window for recovery. In such cases, if the doctor adheres strictly to the law, they can only stand aside and watch the patient die, failing in their mission of charity. How can they bear this in their hearts? But if they act, they risk breaking the law and facing accusations of unintended consequences, which would be unfair. What should they do? Obstetricians face this dilemma even more often. Obstacles during childbirth often arise suddenly, without any prior warning to the mother or the doctor. Dealing with these obstacles often requires immediate action. How can there be time to seek the family's consent in such urgent situations? I recall a news story from Hangzhou that was widely reported in Shanghai newspapers a few years ago. A woman went to a hospital, and because of an emergency during childbirth and her imminent danger, the hospital's doctors performed an emergency operation without completing the necessary procedures. After complications arose and she passed away, her husband falsely accused the hospital's doctors. The court found the doctors guilty of failing to follow procedures and fined them. Doctors throughout Hangzhou were outraged and jointly issued a strongly worded statement. However, medical associations in other areas did not offer any sympathetic response. I have always felt strongly about this and have never been able to forget it. If this is not addressed, it will create significant difficulties in our work. Let me give two recent examples from my own experience. One day last year, a man and a woman came to the hospital because the woman was in labor. The man signed the admission form, paid the hospital fees, and left. Unexpectedly, the woman experienced severe pain at night, and at midnight, complications arose that required surgery. The hospital staff tried to find the man using the address on the admission form, but he was not there. The situation became increasingly critical. I had no choice but to find an Annamite policeman on the street, explain the situation, and ask him to be a witness. Another time, this past December, a woman came to the hospital late at night, knocking urgently on the door. She was in a terrible state, sobbing and unable to speak, with severe abdominal pain and unable to stand upright. I immediately had the staff carry her to the delivery room. When her pants were removed, the baby's head was already visible. In such a situation, who would have time to complete the legal procedures? To refuse her treatment would be a matter of life and death, not only impossible for humanitarian reasons, but also unacceptable to my conscience. Fortunately, both cases turned out well, but if anything had gone wrong, I would have suffered the same fate as the doctor in Hangzhou. It is difficult to balance law and charity perfectly. If this continues, how can we protect ourselves? Obstetricians, in particular, face these sudden complications more often than other doctors. To protect our work, we must collectively call for a satisfactory resolution. Now, as the Shanghai Medical Association launches "New Medicine and New Drugs," I dare to express my humble opinions in the hope of encouraging discussion.

### Popular Medical Talks - Prevention of Winter and Spring Diseases

— Yu Yunxiu

What are seasonal diseases? They are infectious diseases. The most common infectious diseases in summer and autumn are cholera and dysentery, while the most common infectious diseases in winter and spring are influenza, followed by scarlet fever, diphtheria, smallpox, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. Cholera and dysentery affect the stomach and intestines, so if one is careful about what they eat, they are unlikely to contract these diseases. However, winter and spring infectious diseases are all transmitted through the air, making them very difficult to prevent.

How can air transmit diseases? Disease-causing substances float in the air and enter the body through the mouth, eyes, and nose. For example, the sputum and saliva droplets expelled when a person with influenza coughs or sneezes all contain infectious substances. If people around the patient inhale this air containing infectious substances, they will be infected.

The secretions in the mouth and nasal cavity of a person with diphtheria also contain infectious substances. Coughing and sneezing pose the same risk as with influenza. Furthermore, diphtheria bacteria are more resistant to drying. When attached to pillows, bedding, clothing, hats, books, and toys, they can be easily dispersed into the air as dust after drying and a slight brushing.

At the beginning of scarlet fever, the secretions from the patient's mouth and nose are already infectious. Therefore, coughing and sneezing can transmit the disease, just like influenza. Furthermore, the red rash on the skin is highly contagious. Therefore, after a scarlet fever patient recovers, the shedding skin is most likely to infect others. Raising a hand or waving a sleeve can release the skin flakes into the air, spreading the virus to the surrounding area.

Other diseases, such as epidemic meningitis, smallpox, and measles, are transmitted either through droplets in the air or through dust in the air. They are all collectively referred to as airborne diseases. It is not that air can transmit disease, but rather that the air carries the infectious agent.

The best way to prevent airborne diseases is to isolate patients with the virus in isolation hospitals. Not only patients with the virus, but also healthy people who carry the virus should be placed in isolation for treatment. People who are in close contact with patients may not be sick themselves, but their mouth, nasal mucosa, and clothing often carry the virus, serving as a medium for transmission that people may not notice. This is why recent infectious disease prevention efforts have focused so much on these virus carriers. Furthermore, people who have recovered from the disease but have not yet cleared the virus can also transmit the virus without people realizing it.

However, Chinese people are not fond of going to hospitals, and during these times of economic hardship, they are reluctant to be isolated for long periods of time. Therefore, this best course of isolation cannot be strictly enforced. Moreover, most Chinese people who contract infectious diseases seek treatment from traditional doctors. Those traditional doctors who are clear-headed and conscientious can still guide patients to proper channels such as isolation and vaccination. However, those who are completely muddle-headed and have lost their conscience stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that infectious diseases are caused by germs and are unwilling to let patients go to scientific doctors. They only care about their own personal interests, not the public's welfare.

If the best course of action cannot be taken, then the next best thing is to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary outings. However, this requires cooperation between virus carriers and healthy people to be effective, otherwise it will be of no use. For example, people who are sick or carry the virus should absolutely avoid going out to play, joining crowds, or visiting friends and relatives, unless absolutely necessary. Even if friends and relatives come to visit, they should be told the reason and not be received. When coughing or talking, they should cover their mouths with a handkerchief, and if they have sputum, they should spit it into a covered or disinfected spittoon. Those with a sense of public morality should be careful!

When airborne infectious diseases are prevalent, healthy people should also stay indoors and avoid unnecessary outings in order to reduce the risk of being hit by stray bullets of infectious diseases. However, if relatives and friends who have infectious diseases or are carriers visit, it is difficult to refuse them. Furthermore, it is impossible to know in advance that visitors have had infectious diseases or have been near people with infectious diseases, so it is impossible to avoid them. Therefore, unless people who have had infectious diseases or have been near infectious diseases uphold public morality and do not spray healthy people with the machine gun bullets of infectious diseases, it will not be effective.

### On Tonics

— Cai Yumen

The Chinese people have a habit of indiscriminately taking tonics, especially during the coldest days of winter. They believe that not taking tonics will not only hinder longevity but also make them susceptible to colds and various diseases in the spring. This view has been around for a long time. However, the so-called tonics are nothing more than deer antler, ginseng, tiger bone, donkey-hide gelatin, and the like. Some also prescribe and make so-called "medicinal pastes." These medicines may have some effect on some people, but others find that they interfere with digestion, reduce appetite, and cause physical discomfort. Recently, I personally saw an old Mr. Wang, over seventy years old, who was still vigorous and nimble. Heeding a friend's advice, he took deer antler. After only a few days, he developed a severe stomach ailment that lingered until he passed away. Therefore, in this era of rapid scientific advancement, there are definite standards for how to nourish the body and how to remedy its deficiencies. It is necessary to carefully examine and then use food or medicine to correct and remedy them, so that one can benefit without suffering harm. The biggest problem in our country is that everyone thinks they know medicine, and it can also be said that everyone is ignorant of medicine. When they see that someone benefits from eating something or taking a certain medicine, they say that it is good for everyone and encourage others to take it arbitrarily. They do not understand the quality of the person's body, whether the food or medicine is suitable for them, or whether they need it. This kind of senseless behavior, where I have seen people harm others in the name of love, is not uncommon. It is very dangerous, truly like a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond at midnight. Human life is not like an object; once a mistake is made, it is too late to regret. Knowledgeable people must be deeply cautious.

Therefore, when discussing tonics, the first thing is to know what the body needs normally; the second thing is to know how to correct the body when its chemical processes cannot function properly; the third thing is that when there is an existing disease or the body is emaciated, food alone cannot remedy the situation. It is necessary to carefully examine what the body is lacking and what kind of tonic is suitable, so that one can benefit without suffering harm. Therefore, in today's science, one either does not talk about tonics, or if one does, one must clearly distinguish the above three levels. I will now describe them separately:

(1) A person with a seven-foot body must rely on nutrients to replenish all the cells in the body and to provide the source of thought and action. In simple terms, the nutrients needed by humans are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. In broader terms, water and salts are also added, making a total of five. The main material that makes up the cells in the human body is protein, so it is necessary to constantly add protein to replenish its consumption. Furthermore, in human life, the substances that generate heat and energy for thought, action, etc., must be constantly replenished with carbohydrate and fat. Water and salts are important supplements to the first three, so they are also included in nutrients. Once the definition of nutrients is clear, we can know that the daily metabolism replenishes the nutrients that are consumed. The body's miraculous and incredible chemical processes constantly replenish its deficiencies, so there is no need to seek additional nourishing substances. The ancients said, "Medicinal nourishment is not as good as food nourishment," which is truly a hygienic maxim. Therefore, if our meals are suitable and our digestive power is good, then our bodies can be strong and healthy. Why would we need tonics?

(2) If a person's body was initially very healthy and there were no other diseases, or if they ate irregularly, or if they did not maintain a certain amount and overate, causing the stomach and intestines to be unable to handle the workload and causing problems from time to time, then the food they eat cannot be nutritious and will cause the body to become thin and the energy to become weak. At this time, it is also not advisable to use tonics immediately. One must first treat the stomach and intestines, restore their digestive power, and allow the food to enter the body and complete its replenishment. Then the thin will become fat, the pale complexion will naturally become rosy, and the tired body will be able to exert itself. At this time, if one does not know how to restore digestive power and recklessly uses our country's traditionally thick and sticky tonics, it will inevitably further reduce the stomach's digestive power and cause a state of stomach sluggishness. Therefore, using tonics indiscriminately at this time will not only fail to remedy the situation but will also cause harm.

(3) If the body already has diseases, such as lung weakness, blood deficiency, brain weakness, poor sleep, heart weakness, incomplete function, and palpitations; or after childbirth or illness. These various conditions each have their own relationship to disease, and it is not only that ordinary tonics will be effective. Moreover, each person's constitution is different, and the ready-made medicines in pharmacies may be suitable for A but not for B, and suitable for C but not for D. At this time, if you want to take tonics, you must pay attention to the following three conditions, which I have: What are the three conditions? (1) Easy to absorb, (2) Has a real effect, (3) Suitable for the individual's constitution. Otherwise, it is not only a waste of money

### Notice to Members

Respectfully, since the Shanghai community initiated the Shanghai Relief for Shanghai Refugees movement, the 17th Executive Committee has discussed the matter and believes it is extremely important to support it. The Refugees Relief Association was established on the 18th of last month and will begin soliciting donations from the 1st of this month. Our association is a free professional group, and the 18th Executive Committee has decided to notify all members to do their best to pledge donations and record them. It is hoped that

You, with your compassionate heart that feels the hunger and drowning of others, will generously open your purse to complete this benevolent undertaking. We are deeply grateful.

With best wishes for your health. Shanghai Medical Association. and may even harm the body's health. In short, when it comes to taking tonics, first, if the body is already in good condition, there is no need to rely on medicine, as the saying goes, "medicinal nourishment is not as good as food nourishment"; second, if the digestive function of nutrients is reduced, there is also no need for tonics, only to restore its digestive power. If one does not seek correction and recklessly takes unsuitable tonics, it will be harmful and not beneficial; third, if the body is weak and needs tonics, it must be suitable for the three conditions and meet scientific principles. Moreover, it must be subjected to a detailed examination by a doctor to select the appropriate product, so that after taking it, one can obtain real benefits and not waste money.

### Symptoms - Influenza

— Xia Shenchu

What is commonly known as a "severe cold" is influenza. It is an international infectious disease that can be epidemic in a small area, becoming a local epidemic, or dispersed throughout various regions, becoming a sporadic epidemic. Recently, from 1926 to 1927, it was epidemic in Canada, and from 1918 to 1922, it was epidemic in Spain. At that time, the disease was rampant, and the world was shaken, calling it the Spanish Flu. Of course, there have been epidemics in the past. Recently, it is also epidemic in Shanghai, but many people do not pay much attention to it, thinking that a cold is not a serious disease. Because they underestimate it, they often delay treatment. Therefore, I am giving a special introduction here.

Cause

The pathogen of this disease has not yet been discovered. Previously, it was called Pfeiffer's bacillus, but according to recent research, it is believed that the bacteria of this disease are too small to be discovered by existing microscopes.

The pathogen of this disease invades through the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. It occurs mostly in spring and winter and is mostly transmitted directly. During coughing, sneezing, talking, and kissing, the disease is transmitted by droplets from secretions, or indirectly by objects used by the patient, such as handkerchiefs. This disease affects everyone, regardless of age or gender. If there is a major epidemic, our susceptibility rate is 70% to 80%.

Symptoms

After infection, the incubation period of this disease is only one day, up to two or three days. It suddenly starts with chills and shivering for one or two minutes, followed by a high fever of 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, one feels tired and has a headache, or pain in the back, spine, waist, and limbs. This kind of pain is difficult to describe. There may also be vomiting, stomach upset, sore throat, hoarseness, and bronchitis. There may also be conjunctivitis. The fever may be high or low (intermittent fever) or persistent (sustained fever). This state lasts for three to seven days before the fever subsides. This is called bronchitis-type influenza.

If the disease gradually worsens, bronchitis can progress to bronchopneumonia. Or, brain symptoms may occur, such as confusion or even coma. The symptoms are very similar to true meningitis. There may also be headaches and nuchal rigidity (the symptom of the trunk rising at the same time as the head when it is lifted). If this is the case, it is generally a severe case. The outcome is often fatal. In addition, there may be neuralgia, neuritis, and mental illness.

Influenza can also specifically affect the stomach and intestines, with vomiting as the main symptom. In addition, there may be abdominal pain and diarrhea. Severe abdominal symptoms are very similar to dysentery or peritonitis. Jaundice may also occur. This is called gastrointestinal-type influenza. If it is not during an epidemic, this type of gastrointestinal influenza is difficult to diagnose.

The most terrible thing about influenza is pneumonia, which usually occurs on the third or fourth day after the onset of the disease. This type of pneumonia may take the course of mucosal inflammation or asphyxia. If the pulse is fast, breathing is rapid, there is much coughing, and it is difficult to cough up phlegm, then the nose will flare and the lips will be dark. This is the most dangerous phenomenon in pneumonia, and the outcome is often fatal. Fortunately, if one escapes death, after recovery, there is still a risk of bronchiectasis, lung abscess (pus accumulation in the lungs), lung gangrene (part of the lung decays), and pleurisy. Often, empyema occurs due to pus accumulation in the pleura.

If one has had pulmonary tuberculosis in the past, one must pay attention, as it often triggers the old disease. In influenza pneumonia, the respiratory symptoms may not subside, or there may be a slight fever that lasts for a long time, which is often mistaken for pulmonary tuberculosis. If this is the case, it is called chronic influenza, and is often accompanied by chronic bronchitis, chronic pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, suppurative otitis media, lethargic encephalitis, neuritis, and mental disorders, or it can be a sequelae of influenza.

Prognosis

The mortality rate of influenza varies greatly, ranging from just 1% in mild cases to 10% to 20% in severe, malignant cases. Pregnant women, the elderly, people with heart disease, and people with pulmonary tuberculosis have a poor prognosis. The virulence of the pathogen during an epidemic is also a major factor.

Treatment

The most important thing in treating this disease is rest. Being able to rest can prevent the occurrence of complications and has a significant effect. It is essential to eat nutritious food that is easy to digest. In addition, use a damp cloth around the chest and neck, and use an ice pack or ice pillow on the head. At the beginning of the illness, taking antipyretics to reduce the high fever by one or two degrees is also acceptable. However, it is best to follow the doctor's instructions. If symptoms such as pneumonia, gastrointestinal type, and meningitis occur, there are appropriate treatments for each. Patients should be aware that they should still stay in bed for a few days after the fever subsides and should not take a bath.

Prevention

Prevention of this disease is very difficult. During an epidemic, it is advisable to go out less. It is not advisable to go to places with large crowds and poor air quality, such as theaters and playgrounds. When going out, it is best to wear a mask and gargle frequently with mouthwash. Avoid being close to patients, especially the elderly and children. Injecting influenza vaccine is also quite effective.

### Medical News - Doctors Losing Diplomas and Certificates - Public Group Certification Method

Recently, there has been a surge in the number of doctors in Shanghai, most of whom have come from the interior. Among them, a large number have lost their diplomas or certificates for various reasons. Those who have already obtained a doctor's certificate from the Ministry of Health, but whose certificate or diploma from the graduating school has been lost for various reasons and have not been able to register with the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, can first prepare a letter stating the reasons and submit it to the joint committee formed by the Shanghai Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Association on Chi Bang Road in this city for review. If the investigation is true, the committee can issue a certificate of proof, and then register with the Health Department. In addition, those who have graduated from medical school but have not yet received a Ministry of Health certificate and want to register with the Health Department can also request the joint committee to issue a certificate of proof.

### Information on Sending Infectious Disease Patients to Isolation Hospitals

Infectious diseases have been prevalent in this city recently, with smallpox being the most common. Residents of the Public Concession who encounter infectious diseases can call 1461 Xin Zha Road, or 162 North Hai Road, the Chinese Isolation Hospital of the Municipal Council, telephone numbers 30218 and 91055. Residents of the French Concession can call 190 Rue Massenet, the French Concession Isolation Hospital, telephone number 71985. Residents of the concessions who have infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, meningitis, and typhoid fever can be sent to the hospital for treatment, and there are ambulances available for transportation.

### The Bat of the New Era

— Gao Gao

The bat that joined the animal herd when beasts were winning, and the bird flock when birds were winning, ultimately faces rejection and abandonment due to the reconciliation of birds and beasts. The bat's cleverness is precisely what makes it foolish as a bat.

People evolve with the times. The tricks of the bat of the past cannot be compared with those of the bat of today. In the past, the bat determined its flight posture based on the victory or defeat of the bird-beast struggle. In terms of flattery, it not only lacked foresight but also followed others and was always exposed. Now, bats have group organizations and a spirit of division of labor and cooperation. They are the maintenance associations, the village chiefs and town heads under the puppet county government, and the bandits who rob homes and kidnap for ransom. Each hangs its own sign and displays its own abilities. From a certain perspective, a certain type of bat is used to perfunctorily deal with something, and a certain type of bat is used to handle a certain task, dealing with everything comprehensively and handling everything practically and beneficially. In this chaotic situation during the war, the occupied areas, no, the guerrilla areas, are their nests, their world.

However, this kind of trick that they think is cunning still has times of exposure and failure. First, can the local survivors who are exploited and robbed not resent it? Can they not report it to the × army stationed behind the front lines? Second, after the war ends, can the local officials who have suffered pain and uphold the law and humanity not settle accounts with them? The bat's cleverness is precisely what makes it foolish as a bat.

The situation creates heroes, and the bat has evolved again. Landlords who live off land rent, aren't they looking forward to rent rice morning and evening? But they don't dare to go to the countryside in the guerrilla areas to collect it. Officials of the puppet county government, aren't they very much looking forward to the revenue from land taxes? Taxes come from rent, and landlords who don't get rent rice naturally can't pay taxes, and these puppet officials don't have the courage to directly collect taxes from the farmers in the countryside. There are too many gangs and complex elements in the maintenance association, so they don't dare to openly and directly collect taxes from the farmers. Everyone stretches their necks and drools, but in the end, they are just drawing cakes to satisfy their hunger. If someone is kind enough to take care of us and share some crumbs of the cake, we will be endlessly grateful. As for the farmers, the grains are piled up on the threshing ground, fearing that they will be burned by the × soldiers. After being husked into rice and hidden at home, or the rice is sold and the money is hidden, they fear that the tragedy of robbery and kidnapping will be staged. And farming and paying rent is a matter of course and unavoidable. If the landlord doesn't collect rent immediately, it will only increase endless responsibilities and anxieties. The bat sees through the psychology of many parties, so it comes up with an organization of a rent collection agency. This year's rent rice is a certain percentage, the handling fee is a certain percentage, and the landlord gets a certain percentage, which is clearly defined. The so-called handling fee includes the land tax of the puppet county government, the donations of the maintenance association, and the remuneration of the bat itself. This method can achieve a win-win result based on the principle of international reciprocity. It can collect real benefits in the present and have no future troubles. There is no better method or design than this.

However, from the perspective of the war of resistance, they are using wealth to help the enemy and serving as an accomplice to the tiger. From the perspective of the local vitality, they are maintaining the power of many parties and creating a permanent chaotic situation. Who is ultimately benefiting and happy besides themselves? What Wang Kemin and his like are using to appeal is nothing more than international reciprocity and everyone's happiness.

Alas! Clever new era bats. I wish you to take good care of yourselves! Reside in each county and town forever! See how long you can prolong your lives!

### Remembering Agnes Smedley, Reviewing "China Fights Back"

— Yang Fei

Agnes Smedley is now on the battlefield again, going to the New Fourth Army near Wuhu, serving on one hand and writing communications that expose the crimes of the enemy and praise our army's resistance on the other.

Before our army withdrew from Wuhan, she came south from northern Shanxi, once appealing for donations for the soldiers at the front. At that time, I saw her photo published in the newspaper. Her appearance of traveling around in the wind and dust was so simple and crude that she looked like a strong peasant woman.

I remember on the way to send off Mr. Lu Xun's funeral, I, Zhang Ximan, Zhang Naiqi, and others followed behind the coffin. There were four or five foreigners walking together in front, including a middle-sized, middle-aged woman whose demeanor was casual but also a bit wild. She always had a cigarette in her fingers, talking incessantly and walking nimbly and lightly. It is said that she was Agnes Smedley.

Since "Daughter of Earth" was translated into Chinese, we have known that Agnes Smedley is a fighter for the oppressed. In the national salvation movement before the War of Resistance Against Japan, she cooperated with Soong Ching Ling and others, directly participated in the national liberation struggle in China, and edited an English-language journal called "China Forum," making anti-Japanese cries. During the Xi'an Incident, she happened to be in the Northwest. The newspaper said that she was in charge of international propaganda. Whether this news is true or not, we have a more profound impression of her.

When the War of Resistance began, the Eighth Route Army went to the front line, and she also "went north with Zhaopu, hungry and cold, with wounds on her back." In the extreme busyness and exhaustion, she wrote some diary letters, which are now compiled into Chinese as "China Fights Back."

This is a book that records the author's experiences and observations in northern Shanxi and the life of the Eighth Route Army on the front line of the War of Resistance. Louis Fischer said in the preface: "The reason why this book is important is because it comments on the Eighth Route Army's first battle in northern Shanxi. That battle produced China's new hope and new tactics." This is a very pertinent remark.

The success of the Eighth Route Army lies in their political education, social work, and guerrilla tactics. Their almost magical achievements should be understood from the historical roots and daily life of these points. Regarding the former, "Red Star Over China" has already narrated it quite precisely and in detail. Perhaps Agnes Smedley's "China's Red Army Marches" also has detailed records, but I have not read it. After reading "Red Star Over China" and then reading "China Fights Back," we have a more comprehensive understanding of the development of the consistent spirit of the Eighth Route Army and their life in the anti-Japanese war. It turns out that most of the soldiers in the Eighth Route Army are country folks, some of whom were even surprised to see trains and movies for the first time, and some even regarded a thousand dollars as a large sum of money. However, as the preface says, "Although they are so ignorant, they know one thing very clearly, that is, how to unite the people to resist the Japanese invaders." Their material enjoyment is a century behind the people in the cities, but their political understanding and practical spirit are probably a century ahead of most of the people in the cities!

This American female reporter traveled through mountains and rivers in that remote area, sometimes even sleeping in the stables with those soldiers. Her service and visits were full of hardships, but not for material rewards, but for the pursuit of truth. She records the poverty of the Eighth Route Army in general, but it is happy, brave and determined! They are used to living a poor material life, their army and people are harmonious and equal, they have seen a bright future and are determined to fight, coupled with their flexible tactics, which has become an important factor in their repeated victories and even the final victory of the entire War of Resistance.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Snow added an appendix to "Red Star Over China," but it was a theoretical text that focused on the comparison of the combat power of China and Japan. From the point of vividly recording the activities of the Eighth Route Army on the anti-Japanese front, then this book "China Fights Back" may be read as a sequel to "Red Star Over China."

However, because her narration is too hasty, this book is written a bit trivial and not compact, not as systematic and structured as "Red Star Over China." The material only starts from her departure to northern Shanxi and ends before she went south; and because she did not achieve her wish to go straight to the front line, she did not describe the great scenes of battle. Furthermore, there seems to be a flaw in the fact that too much space in the book is devoted to her personal trivial matters. This was compiled by her friends. She said that she will "edit it herself once in the future; I hope she can sort it out and supplement it soon.

Some people say that Agnes Smedley is a true "friend of China." I think this is not very accurate. It should be said that she is a fighter on the same front as the oppressed countries and people.

### Confiscation of Arms

— Song Gui

The winter night is long and silent. It has been a long time since six o'clock, and the sky is still only dimly lit. Therefore, the market in × town also opens particularly late. When the newly rising sun shines on the Guankou (the gate for entering the town) at the end of the south market, you can see batches of villagers going to the market.

Recently, the opening of Guankou has been particularly delayed, not because the townspeople are greedy for peace and sleep late, nor because the villagers have farm work to do and are not in a hurry. It is because there is an additional "card-checking" ×× sentry at the Guankou. It is said that there are too many plainclothes teams mixing in and out, and the Guankou has to be opened late in order to prevent it.

The southern road is the most unstable, and the degree of prevention is naturally relatively strict. The villagers who go to the market often detour to the east to enter because they are afraid of trouble when passing the "card". Therefore, the ×× sentry "card-checking" at the south Guankou also appears particularly lonely. Apart from his own shadow printed on the ground in the sun, there are no other companions.

But this ×× sentry, who couldn't help feeling lonely, finally found a friend. He saw three figures flashing at the end of the stone road in front of him. He immediately focused his eyes to look, and then found that three people came out at the corner of the road. They didn't look strange. But he seemed very alert. He immediately realized that these three people must have bad intentions towards him, because all three of them were wearing coats, and all the plainclothes soldiers of this type of clothing had suffered a lot from them. Time did not allow him to fully consider and investigate. The three people were already standing in front of him.

"Good... citizen's certificate?"

This ×× sentry used his strong tongue to utter this heavy sound. He still arrogantly made various gestures of wanting to search.

"Search!"

These three people without "good citizen's certificates" replied to his threat in a straightforward tone. As soon as he said that, the three coats suddenly opened together, revealing each person's lapel in the style of a hero in a Peking opera, and each person's chest was impressively hung with a row of grenades like medals!

This damned ×× sentry was really frightened this time. Should he resist? The few are no match for the many, and his own life will not be guaranteed first. If he doesn't resist? He doesn't know the intentions of these three people, and he is afraid of implicating the safety of his troops. But the judgment of reason, which is neither left nor right, was finally overcome by the emotional function of cherishing death. At this time, he involuntarily raised his hands and burst out in a trembling voice:

"Good citizen's certificate... not... no need!"

"Search!"

"I... I dare not..."

"Hand over your gun!"

This ×× sentry, who was as dumb as a wooden chicken, woke up. He didn't take down the gun on his back. With a terrified look, he used his hand that he put down from his head, took the gun, and respectfully offered it out.

At this time, they took off their coats and quickly searched the ×× sentry's body and the inside and outside of the Guankou gate. Of course, this time they were "not in vain." Look, aren't two of them carrying a small cannon on their shoulders? And the one in his hand is not empty either. Isn't that the gun just now?

As for that ×× sentry, he was still standing there alone.

### The Cynical Philosopher

— Li Tingkang

Jun was carrying his lecture notes and planning to go to class. There was a class on the history of political thought at ten o'clock. He looked up at the clock in the racecourse flashing in the gray clouds. It was only five past nine. There was still plenty of time, he thought, and strolled slowly along the sidewalk.

Every day, he watched the professor play the monkey and listened to him tell stories of the Middle Ages. Let your hatred and joy be placed on the dead ancients, so that you forget yourself and forget others, and temporarily indulge in the appreciation of antiques. But this is a great era! His heart hummed: "Isn't this just trying to find a bowl of rice? Haven't you seen the very realistic subject matter in front of you!"

He remembered the idea he had decided on earlier: "Go to the interior." In this era, only action can show one's own position. All talk is in vain, unless you go to the real battle line—the interior—to do it! "What's the point of being a spectator playing the monkey? I've made up my mind!"

A sneer hung on the corner of his mouth, and he looked contemptuously at the pedestrians on both sides, as if to say, "With these brainless things, it would be strange if China didn't perish." Yes, he also saw the most magnificent theater building in the East at a glance, and imagined the crowd of spectators crowding before the premiere. Was he a little angry? No, he just sneered: "Pompeii hasn't been destroyed yet, so what's the big deal!"

"Jun, are you going to class?"

"Um, Ying, what are you doing?"

"This issue of the weekly has been published, and the content has been greatly enriched. This will greatly increase our working strength. We hope that the serious attitude of this publication can restore the declining atmosphere of this isolated island a little bit. Here, take ten copies."

"..."

"You haven't attended the meeting for several times. Are you sick? Please try to write something when you have time."

"No, I'm preparing to go to the interior."

"Working in the interior is the same. When are you leaving?"

"Not yet."

"Then please let us know after it's decided. I have something to do now. Goodbye, goodbye."

Jun watched his back, and sneered again. He thought: enrich the content, working strength, hey! You work, you enrich, but you give the brainless people something to pass the time! That's a waste, a waste, a hundred wastes! Waste is more sinful than luxury!

Moreover, moreover, serious, meeting, and then you go to the dance floor to hug the dancing girls. It's better to teach yourself than to teach others. There is no work here, no everything...

He didn't even look at the publication and gave all of them to a roadside newspaper stand. …

Two months later, he was still strolling leisurely on the road, a sneer hanging on the corner of his mouth.

### Destruction

— Wang Yishi

The commander issued the order to dig roads,

Several thousand strong men were to be gathered that night:

One from each household in the villages and towns,

People from eighteen to forty-five years old.

… … …

The sky continued to rain,

The ground was still muddy.

Patriotic elements, unafraid of hardship:

Most of them carried rakes or hoes,

A few moved saws or axes,

All advanced towards the enemy's lifeline.

… … …

The national army leading and protecting said:

The roads should be dug more than ten feet deep,

The bridges should be destroyed completely without leaving anything behind.

Patriotic people, don't be afraid of the enemy, we will resist in the front line!

… … …

The sound of machine guns firing continuously,

The people working had no time to listen;

The highway shone with dazzling light,

The people working were also indifferent.

… … …

Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

The work did not stop all night.

Wide and long highway surface,

Many deep ditch-like depressions were added:

The wooden planks and wooden piles on the bridges,

Were all thrown into the river, nowhere to be found.

… … …

Until the cock crowed, awakening people from their dreams,

They completed a mission of saving the country.

The sun, surrounded by black air, appeared in the east,

As if jealous of the people working there.

Arts and Entertainment Circle

### After More Than a Year of Exile and Thousands of Miles of Travel, Sun Min Returns from Kunming, Recounting the Wandering of a Large Group of Film People

— Xing Ren

A large group of film artists, when the Battle of Shanghai was raging, formed the "Shanghai Film People's Troupe" and left Shanghai directly for Sichuan. Now, after more than a year, many people are still living an exile-like theatrical life there. Last winter in Wuhan made people feel even more earnestly. Yesterday, I heard that the famous actors Sun Min and Gong Jianong had just returned from Kunming after traveling thousands of miles. In order to inquire about the exile of these artists, I specially ran to Mr. Sun's house to conduct a brief interview.

Mr. Sun had just unloaded his luggage, his face full of dust, wearing an old tweed suit. After shaking hands and greeting each other, he lifted his clothes and showed the tattered lining, laughing and saying, "This is called Sichuan clothes. In other words, it is a souvenir of the hardships of this trip!"

Exile Situation

Speaking of the situation of exile: He and Bai Yang, Wang Xianzhai, Gong Jianong, Wang Zhengxin and other more than forty people left Shanghai by car to Nanjing, then transferred to a boat to Chongqing. The journey took a month. They encountered many air raid dangers in Nanjing and Hankou, but fortunately everyone was safe and sound, and no one suffered any damage.

They arrived in Chongqing in late October of the year before last. They performed "Battle of Lugou Bridge", "Night of Shenyang", "Thirty Million Refugees", "Living in a Drunken Dream", "Traitor" and other dramas at the Guotai Theater for twenty-six days. The ticket sales totaled more than 20,000 yuan. Although the business performance was extremely satisfactory, due to the restrictions of the contract conditions, each person only received more than 100 yuan in remuneration. It turned out that this troupe was organized by Sichuan film merchant Xia with an advance payment! It was stipulated in advance that the travel expenses must be deducted from the proceeds, and after the theater split the amount in half, Xia and the troupe would each split the remaining amount in half. Therefore, everyone had the name but not the reality, and it was inevitable that they would get very little.

Moved to Chengdu

Because of such harsh treatment, they were deeply dissatisfied, and many people raised a series of negotiations with Xia after the performance in Chongqing. As a result, the method of fixed monthly salary—from 40 yuan to 150 yuan—was changed, and then they went to Chengdu.

The performance situation there was also very good: The first performance of "Battle of Lugou Bridge" was performed for seven days, and the theater was full day and night. Then "Thirty Million Refugees" continued to be performed under enthusiastic circumstances. Unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the local garrison commander Yan Xiaohu watched the play, and suddenly had a great misunderstanding about the scene where the masses drove away the enemy and a red sun appeared behind the curtain to show the reunion. He actually said that they had a strong suspicion of anti-propaganda. He immediately ordered the closure of the theater and limited all the actors to leave the country within three days. Everyone was living in a foreign land, almost at a loss. It was really an unexpected disaster.

Great Storm

After this storm, they repeatedly stated the reasons why the script had been examined and approved in advance, and the plot was purely for propaganda and national salvation, and then eliminated the misunderstanding and returned to calm. However, the name of the troupe had to be changed. The troupe internally expressed opinions and split into two organizations. He and Wang Xianzhai, Ma Shouhong, Wang Zhengxin, Yuan Zhu Ru, Zhou Manhua and other seven men and women separately went on stage to other theaters; the remaining Bai Yang, Wu Yin, Xie Jun and other dozens of people changed the name to "Chengdu Troupe" and continued to perform in the original place. This lasted for three months before it ended. Their seven-member troupe was held back there for more than two months due to a salary dispute with the theater. Then they returned to Chongqing and accepted the invitation of the Kunming Theater. Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Shi Chao, Gu Eryi and others on that side joined the Central Photography Field in Chongqing.

Kunming Trip

In September of this year, their group of seven went to Kunming for two years of theatrical life, and it ended again. He and Long Jianong were eager to return to Shanghai, so they went from there to Haiphong by transfer to Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai first. Wang Xianzhai and others, in order to accept the invitation of the Guiyang Theater, had to wait two months before they could finish their work and return.

Finally, talking about the anti-war sentiment in the rear: the military and civilians in various places are of one mind and are extremely enthusiastic. Under such a vigorous and determined "final victory will belong to us" situation, the future is indeed absolutely optimistic, and it can be asserted that it is not far away.

### Lambeth Walk Dance Competition Record: Driving to the New District to Compete for the Championship

— Tianma

Recently, a film called "Me and my Girl"

The film has not yet been released in Shanghai, but the new dance step "Lambeth Walk" has swept the entire dance market, and Daxin has held a "Lambeth Walk" dance competition for several consecutive days.

Naturally, a simple new style is easily loved by people. In the dance market, when "The Lambeth Walk" music starts, the men and women in the dance floor have to tear open their smiling lips and shout "Hey!" "Hey!"

The crowd was just as expected. Under the stimulation of cigarettes, alcohol, and sensuality, the pale purple light played the most intense surreal music. The dance floor gradually became narrower due to the addition of seats for the dancers. However, that was only at six or seven o'clock.

Jin Yong stood in front of the band conductor Ai Pi Santo and reported the numbers of the dancers participating in this dance competition, ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-four... one hundred and two. But three were absent and forfeited. Wearing the number cloth on his arm, and hugging his chosen dance partner, there were dancing girls, and also female guests, some in suits and leather shoes, and some in gowns and cloth shoes. Only six or seven pairs were competing, but the patterns were not simple.

The order was a bit chaotic, and there were playful cheers and applause from all around. More inevitably, the audience around the dance floor formed a square formation.

The music stopped, and the judges said: "One more time." Sure enough, the "ninety-one" and "ninety-seven" dancers showed some skills more generously. The joyful, relaxed, romantic, and funny "Lambeth Walk" dance steps aroused a burst of enthusiasm. In addition to them, there were also two pairs who received awards. In fact, the prizes were just a bunch of toys. Perhaps for the sake of entertaining this interest, it was not too dull?

### Silver Train

— Silver Flute

The Golden City for the New Year's Lunar holiday, and the New Light theaters, have already scheduled their films. Golden City will screen Guohua's second production, the period drama "Meng Jiang Nu," and New Light will screen Yihua's historical film "The Hegemon King of Chu," directed by Wang Jue Long. Huaxin Company's palace drama "Wu Zetian" is planned for screening at the Nanjing Grand Theatre or the Great Shanghai Theatre, currently still under negotiation.

Yue Feng directed, and Yuan Meiyun starred in "A Young Lady," completed a long time ago, originally prepared for public screening at the Golden City Grand Theatre. Now, because Golden City is crowded with films, it has agreed to transfer it to the New Light Grand Theatre, to be screened after "Pearl Shirt."

Yuan Meiyun has a cousin named Wang Huichan, the daughter of the famous Qin master Wang Baishui. Not long ago, she performed at the Cathay, having a good foundation in old operas. At the same time, she is also a movie fan. Some time ago, she once applied to Yihua Company, attempting to play the female lead in "The Hegemon King of Chu," but did not succeed. Now, with Yuan Meiyun's recommendation, she will join Xinhua, and the contract is scheduled to be signed within days. Ms. Wang's appearance and figure are very suitable for the conditions of a film actress, and there is no doubt that she will shine in the future.

Yang Xiaozhong's idealistic comedy "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" will be publicly screened at the Golden City Grand Theatre after "The Romantic Ghost." This film stars the old partners Han Langan and Liu Jiqun, with many unexpected new gimmicks such as cars with wings and machine scoops.

Chen Chali's first detective film after returning to the country, "Pearl Shirt," will be screened in Hong Kong. The copy was entrusted to Gu Wuwai to take there. Gu is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today (the 10th) on the Borden liner.

### Broadcasting Miscellany from Da Fa

— Longevity Tune

The famous amateur performer, Mr. Bao Xiaodie, recently established the Da Fa New Year Cake Company on Tongfu Road with Mr. Yuan Senzhai, Wang Qijun, and Mao Jiahua. After the formal opening, in order to expand publicity, they also made a large-scale broadcast at the Great China Radio Station on the evening of the 6th, inviting famous performers and actors to participate and assist. When we arrived at the radio station, it was already 9 o'clock. The room was small and crowded, making it difficult to stand. Xiaodie was also busy answering phone calls to finalize orders for New Year cakes and handwriting order forms for customers. Miss Jin Suwen had just finished broadcasting a section of the slow tempo of "Wu Jia Po" and slowly came out of the broadcasting room. I saw that her face was covered with rouge and powder, and her eyebrows were thick and reaching into her temples, as she had just come here from the backstage of the Carlton. After singing, she urgently needed to rush to the next venue. Fearing being seen, she wore a copper basin hat and wrapped herself in men's clothing outside her cheongsam. Her appearance was extremely laughable. After dressing up, she hurriedly ordered a car to be sent back, which attracted attention for a while. Afterwards, Miss Wang Yaoqin sang the slow tempo of "Fen River Bay," and her voice had completely recovered its original state. Jiang Bogong sang "Fish Hiding Sword," and the clown Yi sang a "xusheng" role, which was also quite flavorful. Later, Jiang Yiqiu and Liang Cishan sang "Chasing Han Xin," Miss Wang Huigu sang "Hanyang Yuan," and the actor Liu Wenkui sang "Nanyang Guan." The most noteworthy was the large group of famous amateur performers singing Peking opera, mostly from the Mei School, carrying forward the tradition for future generations. Unfortunately, I have a bad memory and cannot list them in order. There was Miss Ji Lingzi singing a section of "Three Copies of The Legend of Taizhen," a "sipingdiao" melody, Zhang Xiaowen singing a section of "Life and Death Regret," a "erliu" melody, with Ni Jun Qiuping and Wang Jun Ruoqi playing the accompaniment. Zhou Dongshan sang a section of "Killing the Fisherman," with Zhou Dongming and Li Shishan playing the accompaniment. The gathering of Mei School "huqin" players can also be said to be a grand event of the time. Later, I heard that Miss Jin Suqin and the famous amateur performer Zhao Peixin and others had broadcasted their performances, but it was already late, and I left without hearing them to the end.

### The Hegemon King of Chu Falls from His Horse and Gets Injured. Jin Suqin is Determined to Film.

— A Well-Known Person

Yihua's epic historical war film "The Hegemon King of Chu" has been working extremely hard in recent days. The other day, filming the scene in Lishan where the Hegemon King was surrounded was extremely grand. For a time, the Jin Situ Temple was filled with the sounds of killing, and the scene was strange and incomparable. The "Hegemon King" Wang Yuanlong was thrown from his horse twice that day, wearing heavy armor, and suffered slight injuries. However, Wang did not find it bitter, which shows a glimpse of his efforts.

Also, the female lead, Yu Ji Jin Suqin, because the company's filming date is increasingly approaching, requested Huangjin authorities for permission to conclude her performance in ten days, so that she can concentrate her efforts on "The Hegemon King of Chu." Jin's acting skills are famous both in the North and South. This time, her appearance on the silver screen will surely add to her brilliance.

This publication yesterday carried "Yihua Gives Up Jin Suqin." The Yihua Company authorities stated that this was inaccurate and put forward three points: (2) Because Jin Suqin's appearance on stage at Huangjin would not last long, Yihua postponed Yu Ji's scenes for the time being. Therefore, Jin had only filmed one palace set at Yihua. The so-called "inevitably often failing to arrive on time" is quite inaccurate. (3) Since Jin had only filmed a few opening shots at Yihua, her so-called "always happy to be autonomous," etc., is again an intentional slander. The term "always happy" suggests that it seemed as if a film was about to be completed, but who knew that nine-tenths of the film was waiting for Jin to finish her performance at Huangjin before filming could begin. (4) Given the above two points, Xin Shijun's saying that "therefore, they sought Jin's consent and immediately stopped filming" is self-defeating.

### Secret History of the Palace and Opera World in the Old Capital (70) The Landlord of Luoma Lake is Named Ma

— Xu Muyun

His shock almost turned him into a rigid corpse like the ones in Jizhou City. At that time, gusts of cold wind pierced to the bone, and the howling sounded like a lion's roar. Moreover, the palace walls were tall and large, and even if he shouted until his throat was hoarse, the people inside would not easily hear him. Fortunately, he had practiced some martial arts, so he immediately picked up a stone and went around to the northwest corner of the guard pavilion, forcefully aiming and throwing it upwards. Only then did he alarm the palace guards. After a few words of questioning and answering, they learned that the Fourth Prince was locked outside the palace gate. Just at this moment, the military officer surnamed Ma also arrived for inspection. Looking down in the snow light, he saw that it was indeed the Fourth Prince (In the Qing Dynasty, since Kangxi deposed the Crown Prince twice, he ordered that no heir should ever be formally designated. The succeeding monarch's name was secretly written in advance and stored, mostly hidden in the "Justice and Brightness" plaque in the Yuanmingyuan. Only at the time of death was the decree revealed. Therefore, most of what is said in the records calling him the Fourth Crown Prince is in fact due to a lack of knowledge of Qing history). Standing in the snow, calling at the gate, Ma thought about the importance of the duty he was undertaking. Moreover, once the palace gate was locked, it was never allowed to be opened at will. If he let the Fourth Prince into the palace out of sentiment, it would be fine if nothing unexpected happened. But if something went wrong in the palace within the next day or two, and the treasures of the inner palace were lost, he would be the first to bear the blame. Moreover, the Fourth Prince's actions were very suspicious, and he had heard that the people he associated with were all from the "green forests" (bandits). After considering it for a while, he decided that it was best not to open the gate. That night almost froze the Fourth Prince to death. Although the Fourth Prince resented him, he could do nothing about it. Later, the Grand Eunuch knew about this matter and reported it to Kangxi. The Emperor greatly praised him for it, and therefore designated land as a reward, granting him all the wasteland near the shores of Luoma Lake. The Ma family's land did not pay taxes and had no fixed boundaries. Later, they actually came to occupy two thousand "qing" of land (20,000 "mu"), becoming the first major landlords of Xuzhou. According to local elders, the chieftain of Luoma Lake, Li Pei, was the Ma family's head steward. Because the master held an official position in the capital, local officials did not dare to provoke him. Li Pei also learned the airs of the "royal grain stewards," committing adultery, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. The military officer Ma, who founded the family, was himself extremely law-abiding, but his descendants were very different from him.

### Zhang Nantong's Elegant Legacy

— Poetry Tasting Studio

Nantong was at the height of Zhang Jian's (Sengong's) career after 1916. Famous people from all directions came to visit, and Sengong often had elegant gatherings amidst his busy schedule, creating them for local people. At that time, Wang Xinpu, the magistrate of Haining, retired to the countryside, but came to Nantong for pleasure during the good days of spring and autumn, occasionally performing Kunqu opera. Although he was nearly seventy years old, he showed no signs of aging when he stepped onto the stage. The elegance of the predecessors was admirable. Yuan Hanyun also came to Nantong several times, happily performing. The people of Tong were shocked by his name, and the listeners were numerous. His performance style was excellent, both elegant and refined, surpassing others. To this day, the people of Tong still enjoy talking about it. When Sun Xinyuan came to Tong as the warlord, Xu Shuzheng accompanied him. One night, Sengong held a private banquet for Sun and Xu at the Haonan villa. The guests were all famous people and scholars. In the heat of the wine, Shuzheng sang a song, "The Great River Flows East," overflowing with heroism, captivating everyone present. Xiaotu's special car went north but encountered an accident, becoming a final performance. There were still many famous people living in Tongcheng at that time. Therefore, during festivals and under the clear wind and bright moon, Sengong often took a small boat with three or five close friends, drifting in the middle of the river, drinking wine, composing poems, and singing loudly, all lamenting being like immortals. How long ago was it that the man and his music suddenly disappeared, and the elegant legacy remains forever in people's hearts. Recalling the past, how can one not be saddened!

Mickey Mouse Creates Havoc in the Circus - The creator of the colorful cartoon "Snow White," which caused a sensation around the world, Walt Disney, recently published a book, "Mickey Mouse Creates Havoc in the Circus." The entire book is full of wonderful and humorous images. Five million copies have already been sold in the United States. The publication department of Cathay Company, No. 8 Wenzhou Road in this city, has translated the explanation into Chinese and selected it as the first collection of comic books. It has already been published at two "jiao" per book. To give preferential treatment to readers, anyone who clips this publication's news will only be charged one "jiao" and six "fen." It is especially wonderful to give it as a New Year's gift for siblings by parents and older brothers.

Commercial News

### Yarn and Cotton - Buying Craze Rages - Yarn Prices Rise in a Straight Line - Double Horse and Globe brands both jump by ten yuan - Japanese Yarn Also Follows Suit with an Increase of Four to Five Yuan

The price surge in the yarn market is intensifying. Prices are soaring in a straight line, mainly due to recent active real demand and the relatively low inventory of factories. In addition, the markets in Hunan and Jiangxi are showing signs of recovery, and commercial prosperity is increasing. This news was reported in this newspaper earlier. Now, merchants from the South China, Chaoshan, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Yunnan regions are continuing to purchase tirelessly, and demand is increasingly picking up. This has shaken people's hearts, and the buying craze is raging. Another theory is that the route from Kunming to Chongqing is becoming increasingly smooth, and transportation is convenient. Therefore, the demand from the rear is indeed strong, but it is still difficult to remit funds back to Shanghai. However, with this news spreading in the market, spot traders are becoming more enthusiastic, and everyone is rushing in. 20-count "Special Golden City" yarn has already surged to a price of 400 yuan. Judging from the actual situation, this can be temporarily confirmed. However, the atmosphere in the market is lively and boiling. The general opinion is that we need to watch the price of 420 yuan. With the price surge being too rapid, the subsequent reaction cannot be ignored. Yesterday's market situation: At the opening in the morning, because all parties had real demand, buyers crowded in, and the opening price jumped by 11 yuan. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 385 yuan. Then, with Southern and Eastern Zhejiang regions purchasing one after another, the market price rose higher and higher. Moreover, a certain yarn merchant was still scouring the market for spot goods, and the market conditions were very tight. The closing price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 394 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The morning transaction statistics totaled 2,015 bales. The market conditions: 20-count "Double Horse" rose 20 yuan, "Special Golden City" rose 18 yuan, "Heavenly Maiden" rose 20 yuan, "Double Globe" rose 20 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn rose 15 yuan, and 16-count yarn rose 13 yuan. The Yong'an factory opened 50 bales at a price of 400 yuan. Today, the exports will include 145 cotton yarn pieces to Wenzhou, 515 pieces to Shantou, 275 pieces to Hong Kong, 125 pieces to Haimen, 340 pieces to Beihai, and 955 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by the various merchants are listed on the left.

The Japanese yarn market conditions: Because Chinese yarn has been soaring for days, people's hearts have been stirred up, and prices have also risen by 4 to 5 yuan. However, demand has not been very enthusiastic. The spot price for 20-count "Water Moon" is 312 yuan, and the price for this month is 309 to 310 yuan. The spot price for 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn is 309 yuan, and the price for this month is 305.5 yuan.

### With Yarn Sales Thriving, Factories Are Urgently Replenishing Raw Cotton - Fire Machine Has Already Exceeded the 60 Yuan Mark - Sales of Fine Velvet Cotton Are Also Gradually Picking Up - Foreign Cotton Purchases by Chinese Factories Have Increased Significantly

The raw cotton business is becoming increasingly developed, and market prices continue to rise high. Prices for both coarse and fine cotton have increased by more than one yuan, and the demand from the Hua Ying factory is also very active. Since the beginning of the red market, the sales of cotton cloth and cotton yarn have been thriving, and the selling prices have soared. Therefore, factories naturally have to replenish their raw materials. As for the Tianjin fine velvet cotton, which had been sluggish and suppressed by foreign cotton, the raw material for 32-count is also showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, the Shenxin factory alone purchased more than 500 pieces. However, with the exception of the Donghua factory, which purchased 500 bales of Taicang cotton, the Japanese factories showed no interest at all. This is because the Indian cotton has fallen another two "ropi," the converted price is also cheap, and the Japanese factories have purchased huge amounts due to preferential terms. Therefore, they still have no intention of actively purchasing Chinese cotton in recent times. The rising trend can still be suppressed to some extent. However, "white package" cotton still has the upper hand. Because the sources in the interior are not smooth, and the demand from all sides is urgent, the British factory Jardine Matheson purchased a huge amount of 1,500 bales of Beishi cotton. "Fire Machine" cotton has already exceeded the 60 yuan mark, reaching a new high since last year. The sources from the Subei region are gradually increasing. 3,559 bales of Tong cotton, both coarse and fine velvet, arrived in two days. Changyinsha cotton accounted for 691 bales, Niantuo Port arrived with 640 pieces, Beisha arrived with 570 pieces, and the Yangtze River arrived with 410 pieces. The current cotton sales prices and the amounts of transactions are listed below, according to He Peiben.

### Industrial and Commercial Assistance - Hanging a Sheep's Head, Selling Dog Meat

— He Peiben

As the weather turns cold, stoves and coal are on the market. The Shanghai people, who are raised delicately, cannot tolerate the heat or the cold. After the autumn horse races, everyone is rushing to install stove pipes in their mansions to prepare for heating. Some, more particular, like apartments, mansions, hotels, and dormitories, have installed natural "water ting" heaters and electric heaters, which are magnificent and exceptionally clean. Therefore, despite the rain and snow falling outside and the biting cold wind, it feels warm and comfortable inside, as if it were the third month of spring. The gap between the rich and the poor is like heaven and hell. However, the more superior human enjoyment is, the greater the consumption of materials. The consumption of hot water "ting" coal stoves, which are transformed from minerals into nothing, amounts to more than 100,000 tons per year. This includes four or five types of bituminous coal, anthracite coal, lump coal, and coal dust. Sales of coal dust are relatively large, with a ratio of six to four compared to lump coal, because various industrial factories, motor steam furnaces, and "water ting" stoves, as well as raw materials for coal balls, all require the use of dust, and its price is also lower, differing from lump coal by six to seven yuan per ton.

Two years ago, when the 1813 war broke out, domestic coal mines fell into the war zone, transportation was blocked, and sources disappeared, leading to the depletion of stocks in this city. Coal prices soared, and we had no choice but to "drink poison to quench thirst," purchasing foreign coal. As a result, the cost was difficult to reduce due to foreign exchange contraction and high freight rates. Anthracite coal rose by 40-50% compared to before the war, and bituminous coal even exceeded double that amount. Previously, Kai Ping "smothered coal" dust, which cost 12-13 yuan per ton, now costs 36-37 yuan, which is truly unbelievable and unexpected. Especially strange is that bituminous coal dust is actually more expensive than anthracite coal dust (No. 1 Hongji anthracite coal dust only sells for 29 yuan per ton), which can truly be said to be "extraordinary circumstances for extraordinary prices."

Because of this abnormal situation, some people thought they had an opportunity to take advantage of it and make a fortune from foreign goods. They mixed and matched No. 2 Hongji anthracite coal dust, which costs 20 yuan per ton, with recycled dust from coal ball factories, pretending it was Indian bituminous coal dust and selling it to various factories for 28 yuan per ton. In any case, outsiders "judge by ear instead of eye," only listen to the price, and have difficulty distinguishing good from bad, often being "deceived by a fish eye mixed with pearls" and agreeing to a deal of 50 or 100 tons. By the time they find out when using it, the "money has already fallen into their hands," and it is difficult to recover. (It is heard that more than ten companies in the same industry have been deceived). There are also some factories that have not yet traded with him, but when they hear about this price, they are furious and go to negotiate with the old coal companies they trade with, thinking that they are charging too much and making too much profit, demanding price reductions. In reality, whether they are "foreigners" or "Chinese," doing business is about profiting from capital. "Being beaten and scolded, one doesn't lose capital." How can there be a merchant in the world willing to lose money to please buyers? In fact, it is those "hanging a sheep's head, selling dog meat" slippery merchants who are cheating and disrupting the market. Customers are unaware and thus misunderstand. Therefore, I am using this small space in this publication to express this, hoping that the coal industry authorities will investigate and prove it, and that factory users will be careful not to believe it lightly. Otherwise, "greed for cheapness buys an old ox, and you fall twice a year," wanting to be cheap but instead suffering losses.

Foreign Cotton Prices: The New York cotton market is quiet. All industries are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, expecting the development of legislation in Washington regarding cotton loans and the sale of loaned cotton. Sales reports of cloth are still good. The market fell due to selling pressure at the opening, but recovered slightly due to purchases by the same industry. As a result, it still rose six or seven "bangyin." Indian cotton fell three "ropi," with a forecast increase of one "ropi" and seventy-five "pieces." "Liangche" is still down more than one "ropi." The Egyptian market is closed. Yesterday's exchange rate did not fluctuate much. Converting to legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose five "jiao" per "dan," and Indian cotton fell more than two "jiao."

Foreign cotton transactions in this city have been loose for days due to brisk sales of yarn and cloth. Yesterday, cotton yarn surged more than 20 yuan again. The native cotton "Fire Machine" Yao flower also created new high prices of 67 and 65. The prices of Indian cotton have recently fallen by more than one yuan. Because Chinese factories are in great need of cotton, they have forgotten the harsh conditions of foreign merchants and are willing to pay a deposit of 20% to order large amounts of foreign cotton. Yesterday, the transaction of Indian cotton was over 10,000 bales, with Chinese factories accounting for 3,000 bales. According to the current cotton situation, the number of foreign cotton imports may increase daily. Previously, the price of fine velvet cotton was high and occupied by Brazilian cotton, but now Indian cotton will also replace short velvet cotton. Yesterday's transaction volume and spot market prices are listed below.

### Securities - Unified A Seen Again at New High Price - Rumor of Interest Suspension Proven to be Fabrication - Floating Capital Turns to Public Bonds

The off-market securities market yesterday initially showed a trend of firm and slowly rising prices, and then showed a new atmosphere of a sharp rise. Last week's rumors of problems with public bond interest have been confirmed by the financial community to be completely unfounded. People's hearts have been calmed. The new Japanese cabinet's policy towards China is based on the fixed strategy of the old cabinet. And our highest authorities are tolerant of Wang Jingwei's absurd remarks, hoping that he will reform and start anew. Combining observations of various situations, it is not difficult to get a rough idea of the recent trends. Recently, with no opportunities to profit from yarn, flowers, socks, gold, and foreign exchange arbitrage, and with an abundance of floating capital, public bond trading has become more lively and is gradually becoming more prosperous. It is a pity that the exchange has not been able to open, so the market cannot be fully developed. Yesterday, in the morning, only retail investors had more demand. Later, Runli Company successively purchased, and the market price gradually climbed. Before noon, the price rose by one to four "jiao." In the afternoon, the atmosphere was even stronger, and various merchants enthusiastically absorbed them. Among them, a large household entrusted Dafeng Company to cover its short positions, with a very large amount. The price surge suddenly rose sharply, and the chips on the market suddenly became depleted. The supply and demand were absolutely disparate, and the price rose by about one yuan again. All types closed at the highest price of the day. Type A saw a new high price of 63 yuan and 35 fen, exceeding the high price of the 24th of last month by 95 fen. The reason for Type A is that the seventh lottery draw is approaching, and the number of lottery branches has suddenly increased to 28, making it easier to win, so people are flocking to it. Although other types have not yet seen new high prices, they are not far away. The prospects for the market are indeed optimistic. As a result, the price rose by 1 to 1.45 yuan, and the number of transactions was over 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Finance - People's Hearts Unstable, Cash Gold Prices Fluctuate Rapidly - Resulting in a Continued Drop of Six Yuan

Yesterday's off-market conditions for cash gold were still fluctuating rapidly, purely based on foreign exchange contraction and people's hearts. Initially, due to the sharp fall in British pure gold again, it gradually fell to a low of 80 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry and the Dalian merchants suddenly showed buying intentions. At the same time, the domestic foreign exchange market weakened, causing a temporary rise. Later, because gold merchants and silver shops supplied and sold, it suddenly fell back, but there were many fluctuations in the middle, but there were no excessive ups and downs. People's hearts were unstable, and trading throughout the day was still not deserted.

Silver Shops and Gold Shops Sell "Sha Chi" Gold

From the morning, initially, because various parties saw that British pure gold had been falling sharply for days, prices went slightly downward. Therefore, buyers did not come forward. The opening price in the morning was six yuan lower than the previous trade. First, the silver shops sold 50 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 1,985 yuan. Later, the silver shops' selling intentions were still strong, so prices continued to fall. The silver shops sold 30 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82 yuan. After that, the "rangquan" merchants, the Qian Dui industry, and the Dalian merchants suddenly came to scour the market, causing prices to turn upward. The securities merchants bought 50 "liang" from the silver shops at a price of 82 yuan, and immediately sold them back to the Dalian merchants at a price of 86 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry did 20 "liang" of mutual trading at a price of 85 yuan. In the meantime, gold merchants suddenly came to sell sharply, causing the price to fall back. The gold merchants sold 50 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82.5 yuan, then sold 30 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 80 yuan, and then sold 40 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82 yuan. The afternoon closing price: In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, causing buyers to be slightly optimistic. At the same time, sellers were reluctant to sell, so the price rose slightly. First, the silver Dui industry did 30 "liang" of mutual trading at a price of 86 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the gold merchants at a price of 88 yuan. During that time, gold merchants' selling intentions were strong again, so the price gradually fell back. The gold merchants sold dozens of "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 84 yuan. After that, the gold merchants stopped selling, so the price rose again. The Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the silver shops at a price of 87 yuan. Finally, the Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the same industry at 1,985 yuan, which was the closing price in the evening, a drop of six yuan compared to the Saturday noon closing price. The difference throughout the day was eight yuan. The selling price of cash gold by the gold shops was 1,995 yuan, and the purchase price was 15 yuan lower. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was no trading.

Jewelry Gold Reduced by Another Yuan Yesterday

The price of jewelry gold per "liang" remained unchanged initially. But upon hearing that "sha chi" gold had fallen, the price was uniformly reduced by one yuan at 10:15 in the morning. Datonghang listed 201 yuan, and Xintonghang listed 199 yuan (purchase price was uniformly 193 yuan).

Guan Pure Gold Plummets Following London

The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold ("sha chi") suddenly plummeted again to 1,214.6 yuan. The listed customs gold plummeted by one "fen" and one "li," falling to 2 yuan, 4 "jiao," and 1 "li." The Shanghai standard gold price plummeted by 5.8 yuan to 1,209.9 yuan, which was caused by London's cable on the 7th, British pure gold plummeted to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9.5 "pence" per ounce.

### Japanese Gold Notes - Demand is Quite Strong - Most Currencies Rise Slightly

Last Saturday, British pure gold continued to fall by 8.5 "pence," and the British-American exchange rate continued to rise by 625. Although the supply of foreign exchange was strong, the settlement of accounts was very frequent, and the trend was slightly tight. Trading of "sha chi" gold was not strong, and the profitability of sales was slightly high. The market was slightly soft. Foreign currencies rose slightly with the slight tightening of the foreign exchange market. The demand for Japanese gold notes at the door was very urgent, and the price tended to be strong. The association's transactions were strong. Changtai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Yingfeng sold 500 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Tongfeng, Xiangtai sold 500 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Yikang sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Qintai sold 500 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Dingyuan sold 400 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Qintai sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Sentai sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Yuantai, Xiangyuan sold 400 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Tongyuan, and Chengtai sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Litong. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 1 "jiao," British gold notes rose by 6 "fen," American gold notes rose by 5 "li," Hong Kong notes rose by 4 "li," French franc notes rose by 1 "li," Canadian notes rose by 3 "fen," and other currencies did not change.

### Supply Exceeds Demand: Currency Market Turns from Loose to Tight, British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Rise, Unexpectedly, Japanese Banks Engage in Settlements in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the currency market continued to strengthen as the British pound was supported by the authorities. The rise in exchange rates between the British and American currencies did not cease, so the situation continued to be tight for the British and perhaps for the American currency. Midway, due to the large-scale disposal by Standard Oil of New York and the insufficient supply from banks, coupled with unusually high demand, and the sluggishness of remittances from Hong Kong and other places, the situation turned from loose to soft. Eventually, the sale by the British firm Sassoon and the willingness of money changers to sell caused the market to return from tight to flat. Japanese banks suddenly became active, and the market softened again in the afternoon. Trading was quite active throughout the day.

In the early morning, London "large accounts" (major commercial paper transactions) decreased due to their distance, and New York spot rates remained unchanged. London spot gold fell sharply by 8.5 pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 25, and the rate against the French franc rose by 7. The rate against Shanghai remained the same. The American currency also rose by 625 against the British currency, increased by 375 against the French franc, and increased by 2.5 cents against Shanghai. The central bank's official exchange rates remained unchanged and stagnant. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 8.515625 pence for the British currency and 16.625 yuan for the American currency, which was 0.015625 pence looser for the British currency and 0.0625 yuan tighter for the American currency compared to last Saturday. After the opening, the situation eased slightly due to joint selling by Hong Kong telegrams and Sassoon. When the HSBC official rates were announced, they remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was reduced by one cent. Thereafter, the demand for settlement by Standard Oil of New York suddenly increased, the banks' willingness to sell was weak, and the demand was strong, causing the underlying trend to suddenly tighten. The British currency softened to 8.46875 pence, and the American currency to 16.53125 yuan. Subsequently, foreign telegrams suddenly started selling, and Sassoon also offered to supply. The banks' willingness to sell improved slightly, and the trend gradually turned firmer. Furthermore, money changers sold British and American gold notes and Hong Kong currency, increasing liquidity. The Hong Kong currency rose to 57.125 yuan. The market situation turned flat at noon, with the British currency at 8.5 pence and the American currency at 16.5625 yuan.

In the afternoon market, the selling from foreign telegrams and Hong Kong was not strong, and the demand from foreign firms and various banks suddenly increased. Japanese banks also engaged in settlements, causing the supply to temporarily fall short of demand, and the situation further softened. The British currency fell to within 8.5 pence. However, the Hong Kong currency remained at 57 yuan. Subsequently, transactions became scarce, and the process gradually stabilized. The banks' selling prices at the close of the day were 8.484375 pence for the British currency and 16.53125 yuan for the American currency. As a result, the British currency was 0.015625 pence tighter compared to last Saturday, and the American currency remained unchanged. The transactions for the day are summarized as follows:

### Cash-Filled Cards: Discount Rates Plunge, Lowest Dropping to 25 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange continued to fall. The discount rate per thousand yuan had fallen to within the 30 yuan range. The clearing house also lowered it to 30 yuan. It is said that although China is experiencing war, its finances remain sound. Foreign exchange rates are stable, and fewer people are settling foreign exchange. Furthermore, many people are issuing legal tender (fabi) to collect government bonds, resulting in an overabundance of cash. The market was stable in the early morning, but news of another reduction in the clearing house's discount rate spread, causing morale to weaken, suppliers to concentrate, and prices to plunge to a low of 25 yuan. At noon, the price recovered slightly to around 26 yuan. It was low in the afternoon, with some absorption, and suppliers were cautious due to the low price, causing it to continue to rise. It finally closed at 29 yuan, a sharp drop of 3.5 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### Sugar Market: Newly Arrived Slab Sugar, High Price, No Transactions

Five thousand seven hundred bags of Dutch sugar arrived. The sugar market trended stably yesterday. The association's standard price for No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was traded for over 800 bags. The price for goods from this warehouse was 24.5 yuan, while the price for goods from other warehouses was 24.3 yuan. Re-exported goods were priced at 16.25 yuan, spot Dutch brown sugar at 16.6 yuan, and re-exported goods at 11 yuan. Taikoo "Car White" B mark goods from the eastern warehouse were priced at 23.8 yuan, and the western warehouse at 23.8 yuan, with a volume of around 500 bags traded. The price negotiation was quiet. The Chaozhou guild opened the price for top-quality brown cotton sugar at 14.95 yuan, settling at 14.78 yuan, for refined green sugar at 12.4 yuan, settling at 11.78 yuan. The price of cotton white sugar increased because the Ningbo guild did not import any. There were no transactions. The Fujian guild continued to open the price for over a hundred bags of unrefined green sugar at 11.2 yuan, over two hundred bags of miscellaneous white sugar at 19.56 yuan, over a hundred bags of Chaozhou Beijing brown sugar at 14.6 yuan. The Guangdong guild newly arrived one hundred and twelve boxes of Beihai slab green sugar, asking for 11.5 yuan, but there were no transactions.

The day before yesterday, there were 5,700 bags of sugar transported from the Netherlands. Yesterday, 100 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong, and another 400 bags came to Shanghai from Shantou.

### Piece Goods: Although Cloth Prices in This City Have Increased, Shipping to the Interior Still Yields Substantial Profits, Everyone Says the Eastern Piece Goods Market Looks Promising

National Cloth

The market situation continues to improve due to the soaring yarn prices and demand from all regions. Selling prices continue to rise. Lun Chang blue cloth, printed cloth, satin, and colored zigong continue to rise by one jiao per bolt. The opening price of Xin Feng "Dancing Butterfly" blue cloth yesterday was five jiao higher per bolt compared to last week. Blue cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and fine twill from other factories also uniformly increased by one to four jiao per bolt. However, there were no changes in the prices of coarse cloth and coarse twill due to slightly clearer current sales and abundant inventories. However, the factories' attitudes are quite firm due to inventory costs. Current sales of blue cloth and colored twill are the largest. Changzhou and Wuxi purchased over 5,000 bolts. The Tianjin guild continued to purchase over a hundred pieces of blue cloth. The Ningbo and Shaoxing guilds purchased over two hundred pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and printed goods. The Oujiang, Jinhua, Lanxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan guilds also had strong demand, purchasing over three hundred pieces at higher prices. This is because cloth prices in the interior are much higher than in Shanghai, so even if Shanghai increases prices, there are still substantial profits. However, the amount of purchases is limited due to difficulties in remittance.

Eastern Cloth

Fine cloth and fine twill were already extremely firm last week due to the sharp rise in raw cotton and smooth dyeing and sales. Yesterday, the market price jumped again. Fine cloth rose sharply by three to four jiao per bolt, and fine twill rose by one and a half to two jiao. The local industry firms were excited and ordered over 2,500 pieces of current and future goods from various firms. As for actual sales, in addition to around 2,000 pieces of various brands of grey cloth for dyeing cloth and colored twill continuing to be traded, sales to northern customers also expanded. The Tianjin guild purchased 1,500-1,600 pieces of fine cloth with "Dragon Head," "Colored Ball," "Yang Crane," "Flying Fish," and "Trumpet" brands, as well as fine twill with "Dragon Head," "Five Blessings," and "Baby" brands. The market sentiment and business are becoming increasingly prosperous. The general consensus is optimistic.

Exports

Today's exports include seventy-two pieces to Wenzhou, three hundred and ten pieces to Shantou, nine pieces to Hong Kong, seventy-two pieces to Haikou, thirty-five pieces to Beihai, and thirty-eight pieces to Haiphong.

### Seafood: American Coral Abalone, Supply and Demand in Equilibrium

American canned coral abalone has a balanced supply and demand, so retailers do not feel a shortage. The recent market price is 57 yuan per case (including permit). If sold locally, the price can be slightly reduced.

Yesterday's seafood arrivals in Shanghai included one hundred cases of sea cucumber and two thousand four hundred bags of raw starch, transported from the Netherlands.

### Medicinal Materials: No Need for Honeysuckle in Winter

Honeysuckle has sales outlets everywhere. For export goods, the bulk is shipped to Hong Kong and Guangdong. Sales were strong during the summer, with high-quality goods selling for 95 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Since the season has passed, demand has decreased. The current market has fallen by more than ten yuan compared to before. It is found that the most inventory is held by local wholesalers, and there is no outlet for it at the moment. Only high-quality goods are said to be in short supply.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign-Type Dry Cocoons, Directly Knocking on the 300 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's silk market: New York was closed on Sunday. Yokohama spot price was 830 yuan, and the forward price was 829 yuan, a decrease of five yuan compared to the previous week. The local market sentiment remained bullish. The asking price for foreign-type dry cocoons directly knocked on the 300 yuan mark. However, foreign firms' purchasing interest was not strong, and their price limits were harsh. No sales were reported by the factories. According to the current situation, white silk factories would not sell at a price below 1,300 yuan. Internal transportation of white raw silk has not been interrupted. However, Shanghe's stimulus did not affect the foreign silk market. Yesterday, Samsung and others purchased 10 dan (a unit of weight) of spun silk. The market price was lower by 10-15 yuan compared to before the New Year due to excessive local inventory.

### North-South Goods: Black Dates Are Running Out, Inventory Less Than 3,000 Bags

Black dates are now running out of supply, and the market trend is gradually tightening. It is found that the total inventory is less than 3,000 bags, which must be sold until mid-June or July of this year. It is estimated that there will inevitably be a day when the supply is insufficient, so the negotiated price is becoming more attractive. Shandong merchants have been opening sales sporadically in recent days, with prices rising by more than four yuan compared to the previous market. Retail prices are therefore also increasing.

### Chen Jian Mushrooms Fear Seeing New Ones

Fujian shiitake mushrooms are currently in the transition between new and old crops. All guilds are presenting a sluggish purchasing trend, and merchants are eager to unload old goods in hand, resulting in further price declines. For example, medium-grade thin mushrooms are only priced at 175 to 180 yuan, a drop of about 20 yuan compared to the previous market. It is reported that Xiang is planning to start purchasing, but it is still in negotiations.

### Grain: Nanyang Guild Buys Flour Smoothly, Customer Purchase of Futures Not Confirmed

Yesterday's flour market trend continued unchanged. On the customer sales side, the sales of the Beiyang Guild were mediocre, because the goods previously purchased were still being loaded and transported, and there were few new transactions. The rumor that the customer was negotiating with the factory to purchase futures in batches has not been confirmed. However, the demand from the Nanyang Guild has increased. The goods previously batched by the Shantou and Fujian guilds have been shipped one after another, and the purchasing interest seems to be continuous. The purchase of nearly 20,000 bags of No. 2 flour such as "Green Sky Bamboo" and "Green Fisherman" is planned. In addition to the 7,000 bags of retail sales of No. 2 flour from the "Car Boat" brand in this street, the sales of the Hebei and Shandong guilds also have 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The factory price of No. 2 flour is still 4.9 yuan, and the price of the negotiated No. 2 flour is also stable. Today, 7,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Shantou.

### Wheat Supply Increases Slightly, Some Ships Blocked in Inland Rivers Have Been Released

The wheat supply yesterday and today was slightly higher than before, because some ships blocked in inland rivers have been released. The total number of wheeled vehicles arriving with goods is no less than 20,000 bags. Famous factories' purchasing interest is gradually improving, and eating dishes are also becoming more lenient. A total of 16,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Puzhen, Chuzhou, Wuhu, etc. are planned to be purchased equally by Fuxin and Fufeng factories. The highest price has reached 6.7 yuan, an increase of several points compared to last week.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Market Becomes a Place for Speculation by the Propertied Class, Expected Sales Will Be Strong at the End of the Lunar Year, Market Prices Have Become a Trend of Near-Term Falls and Long-Term Gains

The soybean oil market was initially just a spot market transaction, but under abnormal development, it has now become the only speculative market for the propertied class inside and outside the industry. Yesterday, the market price for Dalian oil delivered in the second half of January differed by more than four jiao in a single turn of events, and the result was the same price as the current oil. According to the speculation of the general public, one reason is that Dalian City is bullish, and the second is that the second half of January is the beginning of the twelfth lunar month, and it is estimated that the sales market in various regions will be more active, so speculators have ordered them one after another. Therefore, the spot market is mediocre, and the market price has fallen by 5 points to 1 jiao compared to last Saturday. It is estimated that 190 barrels of current Dalian oil cost 27.5 yuan and 27.4 yuan, 30 barrels were delivered in 10 days at 27.2 yuan, and more than 500 barrels in the second half of January, the price rose from 27.15 yuan to 27.5 yuan. The price for 50 barrels of agreed-upon colored oil was 27 yuan, the original market price. Other flue oil and Qiyou also opened at the original price of 20.08 yuan, and 150 pieces were agreed upon.

Yesterday, 35,800 bags of white wax were imported from the Netherlands to Shanghai.

### In Order to Solve General Family Disputes Today: The Efforts that Married Couples Should Make Regarding Love!

Since the promotion of equal rights for men and women and open social interaction, many disputes have increased within families. From the perspective of social evolution, this is a natural phenomenon and nothing to be surprised about. However, too many disputes within families will affect social stability. If we open various newspapers, they are almost full of tragedies such as divorce, elopement, love killings, and love suicides! Why do men and women in the world do this? It must be due to unavoidable difficulties and historical reasons.

Things will inevitably go to extremes and then reverse. Enough is as good as a feast, and the shortcomings are the same. Chinese women have been imprisoned in their families for thousands of years. Now that they have been liberated, some people have been deeply poisoned by the remnants of the old ethics and are difficult to change. Although they are in this new trend, they are still ashamed to meet people. How can they talk to people about social interaction and love? Even more, they suffer from secret diseases in their body and mind due to the constraints of the old ethics and are not worthy of talking to people about social interaction and love? In addition, there are fashionable women who have turned their backs on their previous mistakes.

They curl their hair, heighten their heels, powder their faces, redden their lips… They enter dance halls, singing houses, tea houses, and restaurants… They talk to people about social interaction and love everywhere they go, changing partners frequently and being willing to marry anyone… If this type of woman has a husband, wouldn't family problems arise? As for men, there are also similar situations. The most common contradictory phenomenon is that they need fashionable women as wives, but they still have the old ethical concepts and want to exercise their authority as husbands in the family. It is true that in a patriarchal society, the husband's authority in the family is above everything else. The wife calls her husband "Heaven," and the husband regards his wife as a "slave." But how can this work in today's liberated and fashionable wife? Therefore, the family is prone to problems.

In order to solve general family disputes today, if the corrupt forces of the old ethics in marriage and family must be overthrown, then the love between husband and wife, the foundation of a new family, must be established. With this solid new foundation, a happy family can be formed. Love is also above all else. Any family disputes can be resolved with love. At the same time, the love between husband and wife is like a seed in a seedbed, which is easy to cultivate. Because it is naturally endowed with the ability to grow, we only need to pay attention to watering and fertilizing it regularly, and it will easily flourish and grow. However, the most fundamental issue about love is the physical condition of both husband and wife. As long as the man is strong and the woman is healthy, it is easy to bring them into the kingdom of love, living a sweet life as a couple, striving for each other and for a common future. How happy and glorious this is! If either the man or the woman is poisoned by the old ethics, or suffers from weakened sexual function due to early masturbation and debauchery, the man suffers from spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc., and the woman suffers from irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, insensitivity, breast pain, and facial aging, then they must find a way to cure it. If they procrastinate and do not take it seriously, it will not only affect the love between husband and wife, leading to family disputes, but also spread the disease, weakening the whole body, and even endangering life. Therefore, it must be treated as early as possible. An effective treatment is to purchase and take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" (the medicine is for both men and women, and all pharmacies sell it). After taking it, it can produce sperm, strengthen the brain, and promote blood circulation in one day and night, treating diseases and strengthening the body when there is no disease. The most amazing thing is that after women take the "Female Gonadogen," not only are the diseases cured, but it can also develop the breasts, make the face rosy, and enhance health and beauty. However, men with spermatorrhea must also take "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect is faster! These medicines have been proven by famous European and American doctors such as Kamdoring and others to be of the purest quality and the most effective and great, so they have long been popular around the world and have won praise. I have also conducted precise and long-term experiments to see if this medicine is suitable for the Chinese people's physique, and I deeply feel that it is also very suitable for the Chinese people and that it is indeed effective in treating the above-mentioned venereal diseases. According to statistics, tens of thousands of people who have come to this clinic or have taken this medicine to treat themselves through correspondence have recovered.

### Common Diseases of Youth: The Problem of Nocturnal Emission During Adolescence

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

The most important juncture in one's life, where career and happiness converge, is undoubtedly the golden age of transitioning from childhood to the period of spring passion. Young people in this era, on the one hand, are like newborn calves that are not afraid of tigers, and everything seems to be the most courageous and progressive. But on the other hand, they also feel the most dangerous and terrifying! Because young people in this period often have unstable blood and weak willpower. Once tempted by the outside world, they can easily fall into the quagmire and become incurable. Now, let's put aside the big topics of academic career and only talk about health. There are many, many young people who are either stimulated by their own hormones, or driven by curiosity, or seduced by the environment, who are indecisive, regardless of the consequences, and boldly commit masturbation.

Masturbation is a simple and despicable bad habit, but once young people break the taboo and get involved, it is easy to become a habit. Once a habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although they know the harm, they cannot completely eradicate it. Because they cannot completely eradicate it, the pubertal glands are first destroyed, the sperm gate is relaxed, and there are phenomena such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, dizziness, blurred vision, drowsiness, poor memory, etc. If they are left untreated, the semen will be lost in large quantities, resulting in kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, testicular atrophy, etc. It is difficult to escape such symptoms. Therefore, young people's inherent health and natural function are completely lost, and his life's great career and sweet happiness are completely destroyed!

However, how can young people who have the above misfortune seek to remedy it? I say: The medicinal power of the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" can be used to fulfill their wishes. Because "Gonadogen" is made from the essence of the gonads of strong animals, it can continuously supply new energy to us after taking it, creating a strong body and complete reproductive function. The aforementioned symptoms can be cured naturally. However, nocturnal emission is caused by excessive use of the sperm gate, and it cannot be cured by tonic. It is advisable to quit bad habits and also take the sperm consolidation medicine "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to completely restore the control of ejaculation. However, if the patient is in this city, it is best to come to this clinic to use the "Dietmann" electrotherapy machine for electrotherapy, so that the effect will be faster.

### Health and Beauty: Complexion, Breasts, Hips, Health and Beauty Methods

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

What is considered beautiful? This is determined according to each person's aesthetic concepts. Therefore, there is often a situation where A thinks it is beautiful and B thinks it is not beautiful, and B thinks it is beautiful and A thinks it is not beautiful. But this is just a difference of opinion. Modern people no longer recognize women with "three-inch golden lotuses" and a swaying gait as beauties. Therefore, the concept of beauty is also shifting with the trends of the times.

The times' concept of beauty for women has emphasized the healthy beauty of well-developed female characteristics. This is in line with the requirements of life and the principles of physiology. The characteristics of women are nothing more than the complexion, breasts, and hips. The breasts are the main part of female beauty, because the development of the breasts must be based on the function of the ovaries. If the ovarian function is sound, the breasts will naturally be very developed, presenting a full and elastic phenomenon. At the same time, the development of the hips must also be sound, symmetrical up and down, which constitutes the unspeakable mysterious curve of the female body. If you wear a cicada-wing-like shirt, this curvaceous beauty is revealed from the slender and lively body. How captivating is this soul. In addition, because the ovarian function is sound, the metabolism must also be vigorous. Therefore, whether in the skin, muscles, or blood, it is full of new cells. Therefore, the face is naturally rosy, the skin is naturally fair… There is no need for makeup, and natural health and beauty is ten thousand times better than artificial beauty. However, in fact, most women, due to the constraints of ethics or the masturbation during the pubertal period and the debauchery after marriage, the ovarian function is destroyed, and because of the influence of secret diseases such as irregular menstruation and vaginal discharge, the ovarian function is weakened, so they present breast atrophy and facial aging, or even infertility. This type of woman is not only not liked by her husband and falls into the most tragic fate, but she herself is also surrounded by secret diseases and suffers unspeakable pain! But this phenomenon is not an incurable disease. The only solution is to take the ovarian preparation "Female Gonadogen," which can strengthen ovarian function and promote metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can not only be eliminated invisibly, but also naturally enhance the health and beauty of the face, breasts, and hips. Then, how ignorant is the act of applying makeup to women with breast atrophy and facial aging!

### Letters Received

— Zhao Jingzong, Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road

Editor-in-chief Dr. Zhan, New Medical Journal:

(Previous omitted) I am now 24 years old. When I was 17 or 18 years old, I learned about knowledge early when studying abroad, and I was addicted to masturbation. When I left school and started working at the age of 20, I gradually became aware of it, but I still relapsed from time to time. Soon after, I realized the despicability of this behavior and made a vow to quit it. However, although masturbation was stopped, spermatorrhea followed. At first, it was three or four times a month, then it increased to seven or eight times, almost every other day. Even when I saw women or used my brain a little during the day, semen would involuntarily seep out through the opening of my penis. Not only were my clothes often dirty, but I also felt dizzy, lightheaded, and had poor memory. I often suffered from insomnia and was upset. If I moved a little, I felt sore back and weak limbs, so I felt that I could no longer perform my duties, so I asked for leave to go home to recuperate. When my parents saw me in this situation, they thought that I could recover after "rushing to celebrate," so they took advantage of being at home to marry me to a woman surnamed Zhang. However, after marriage, not only could I not "rush to celebrate," but the disease became more and more serious, and kidney deficiency and impotence broke out. Therefore, since the marriage until now, it has been a year, and my wife is still a virgin. How similar must be the frustration of my wife! She often urged me to seek medical treatment immediately, but because I lived in a remote rural area, it was difficult to find a good doctor. After the "August 13th" incident last year, I came to Shanghai to take refuge. At first, I didn't know about your wonderful skills. After another half a year, my wife discovered the New Medical Journal in the newspaper. After reading it, she wrote a letter to inquire. I received your guidance and was told to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" and "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" together. After taking them, I no longer leaked semen. Later, I followed your instructions and took "Gonadogen" exclusively. In less than half a year, my health was completely restored. Now, because I have a friend named Zhang who wants to come to see a doctor, I am sending this letter to introduce him and express my gratitude.

### Don't Be Greedy for Cheap Things

— Lishi

Everyone loves cheap things, especially Chinese people, who not only love cheap things but also greedily seek them.

Loving cheap things is originally human nature, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, greedily seeking cheap things is a mistaken mentality caused by a lack of understanding, which is unacceptable.

There are genuine and fake cheap things. Those that meet subjective conditions and objective needs are genuine cheap things. Conversely, they are fake cheap things. The result of greedily seeking fake cheap things is suffering real losses.

Chinese people seem to be the most greedy for cheap things in commercial activities. Manufacturers, because buyers love cheap things, cut corners and seek cheapness in costs. Buyers, because of their weak economic capabilities and the temptation of cheap forms, become even more greedy for cheap things. The former does so to "quickly turn profits and make more money," while the latter does so to tighten their belts. The situation may be understandable, but in reality, both sides suffer significant losses. Countless manufacturers lose their reputations as a result. Many buyers also suffer material losses. It's truly a lose-lose situation. Moreover, this phenomenon is being exploited by economic aggressors as a path of attack.

In order to realize their dream of monopolizing China, they have used economic aggression policies as a vanguard for several years, shipping large quantities of low-quality goods to sell at dumped prices, thereby exploiting the Chinese people. General merchants only seek profit and are helping the wicked to do evil, desperately helping them sell. The general public only cares about petty gains, vying to buy. This mentality and behavior of greedily seeking cheap things has unexpectedly led to the tragic consequences of being massacred, burned, raped, and plundered today. Thinking of this, it is extremely painful!

Recently, the National Government, in view of the long-term war of resistance, which is still in its early stages, relies on the entire nation, united and sharing difficulties, to turn the tide. Therefore, it has ordered the people of the whole country to practice frugality and disaster relief, advocate the use of domestic goods, and ensure that profits do not flow out, harming the foundation of the country. This is a crucial measure in the war of resistance, and it is also the understanding that Chinese compatriots should have in the war of resistance. To advocate the use of domestic goods, the only requirement is to hope that all compatriots eradicate the mentality of greed for cheap things.

As the saying goes, "Suffering a loss is a gain," then cheapness should be a loss. Moreover, seeking cheapness at the point of the enemy's bayonet will lead to death!

### "Da Zong Ri" in Shanghai

— Tian

"When a son is grown, he needs a wife; when a daughter is grown, she should be married." This is an ancient "clear instruction," so all parents treat their children's "marriage affairs" very seriously. Not only must they be "well-matched in social status," but also the "eight characters" must be pressed before the Stove God and Bodhisattva for three days, and then a blind fortune teller must be asked to calculate the auspiciousness. This is the engagement procedure. The date of the wedding naturally requires selecting an "auspicious day and auspicious time" without any clashes. However, perhaps because "auspicious days and auspicious times" are hard to find, whenever the lunar calendar has a "long embankment head" (there is a saying in the countryside that villagers look at the lunar calendar for long embankment heads), men and women all squeeze their weddings on that day. This phenomenon is very common in the inland, but in Shanghai, it is difficult. Everyone knows that Shanghai is "an inch of land is worth an inch of gold." Perhaps a front building is wide-hearted enough by the second landlord to keep the common living room, but in this small living room, it is still possible to worship ancestors during festivals, but it is really impossible to set up dozens of tables for a wedding banquet. Thus, on this "auspicious day and auspicious time" "Da Zong Ri," every hotel and restaurant in Shanghai hangs a sign saying "Full," especially after becoming an "isolated island."

According to the manager of a large restaurant, their three-story building, the large restaurant in the front hall, is usually very deserted. Even if there are a dozen tables of banquets, it seems that the average small restaurant is already overwhelmed, but they still feel deserted and there is no lively atmosphere at all. However, once it's "Da Zong Ri," up and down, there are no empty seats, and it's still not enough to accommodate everyone, so they politely refuse customers. If the business of "Da Zong Ri" could be evenly distributed, opening a restaurant in Shanghai would definitely be profitable. Now, the "snack bars" attached to each restaurant are indeed for the needs of customers, and also to prevent those empty days from being too deserted and lifeless; moreover, they can at least earn some money to compensate for the empty room rent.

As for renting hotels for weddings, it's because there are not as many auditoriums as there are restaurants, and auditoriums must be reserved early, some even a year in advance. Now is the transition between winter and spring, which is the wedding season for Chinese people. On "Da Zong Ri," which restaurant or hotel entrance is not crowded with dense lanterns and people celebrating weddings?

Marriage is indeed a "major life event," but it seems unnecessary to be so extravagant and wasteful in getting married, some even borrowing money to maintain this empty facade. The city government's promotion of group weddings is to allow citizens to hold the most grand wedding ceremony at the lowest cost. However, the custom of "auspicious days and auspicious times" has indeed been broken, but those who participate in group weddings still want to have a large banquet once, the harm of "facade" is too great!

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, when all parties are shouting about frugality and disaster relief, we have indeed seen a few lines of wedding announcements published, or the banquet expenses donated to refugees. However, the customs passed down for thousands of years have not been completely broken after all. I wonder what a huge number is spent on a "Da Zong Ri"!

Stop being mired in superstition, empty facades, "If the Xiongnu are not destroyed, how can we have a home!"

### After Watching "Three Knights"

— Li Zhihua

A Fox Company production, showing at the Da Guangming Theater

When I tell you that this film "Three Knights" (Straight, Place, and Show) stars the Three Ritz Brothers, I don't think I need to explain to you what kind of thing this film is.

I don't know if you like their antics? As for me, I don't like it. Of course, because our living environments and personalities are different, perhaps we will also have differences in taste. For example, a pot-bellied foreign gentleman sitting next to me laughed several times while watching "Three Knights," but I didn't feel there was anything to laugh at. The reasons for laughter are complex: feeling that you are better than the other person, thus feeling that the other person's ugly态百出, then you laugh, this is one of the reasons; however, this feeling of being better must also be in line with taste to have, otherwise, that kind of pretentious action will only cause aversion.

I don't know what your taste is? So, there is no way to determine whether you will laugh after watching "Three Knights" (if you watch it too much, all the same, your laughter will also get tired), but there is one thing that is the same in us: when we step out of the theater door, and the cold wind blows, our minds are clear, the laughter is over, and what is left is a feeling of meaninglessness. So, we can't help but think of those meaningful, substantial plays we've seen before.

Of course, there must be exceptions, for example, you are originally satisfied with watching clowns tumbling and leaping tigers in the circus.

Oh, maybe you think I'm getting off topic, you want to know a little bit about what the content of this "Three Knights" is like?

To talk about content, "Three Knights" can simply be said to have none (you certainly know what the real meaning of the two words "content" is). Like arithmetic addition, there is only the superposition of materials, and the stories that are added up seem to be able to disregard reason.

If you want me to report a little bit about the material of this film, then I can report to you that there is a craze for horse racing, as well as two songs of unknown origin (that's because Israel Melman can sing), and inexplicable boxing, and then, that's the Ritz brothers' set of exaggerated to the point of being infinitely exaggerated movements - their signature skills. As for the Ritz brothers' equestrian skills, they are not high at all. If you have some basic knowledge of film production, you can see that this is either faked by photography techniques or replaced by a substitute.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes Freedom Village, Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery

At that time, Zhu Airen knew that her grandfather had lost an arm, but he was still alive and well. Being disabled could not be said to be not disabled, but it was an honorable wound. Her mother was still an old peasant woman, and she was also healthy. Just because her daughter was a Western-educated student who had returned with gilded fame, she didn't put on the airs of an old lady. She might even take off her socks and still go barefoot into the fields during the busy farming season. However, now China's agriculture has also improved, and many places have already switched to using machinery, and the labor force of farmers has been reduced a lot. However, when someone advised this lady not to go to the fields, she would immediately shout, "Why not? Is farming shameful?" Zhu Airen also often returned to Freedom Village to visit her grandfather and mother, coming once or twice a month. She was naturally very happy to see Freedom Village developing day by day. Because this new village was painstakingly built by her grandfather. Although many people helped, it was able to flourish like this. But her grandfather seemed to be the head of the village. Her grandfather was not only the principal of Freedom Village Elementary School, but also the village chief of Freedom Village. Now I will say that since Zhu Airen returned from the United States, less than two years later, two female classmates came to the hospital to visit her. Those two female classmates were very dear to Zhu Airen when they were in the United States. And they graduated from the same university at the same time. However, Zhu Airen studied medicine, while they both studied crafts. After graduating in the United States, they also traveled to various countries in Europe for a week, and then returned to China together. Zhu Airen returned to her hometown in Jiangsu, and they also returned to their native Guangdong. It turned out that these two female classmates were both surnamed He, and were twins, both twenty-two years old this year. One was called He Shuangyu, and the other was called He Liyu. Want to ask who is the older sister and who is the younger sister? It's really impossible to tell. Because in the past, there were two sayings about twins: Whoever comes out of the womb first is the older brother or older sister, and whoever comes out of the womb later is the younger brother or younger sister. Another saying is that whoever comes out of the womb first is the younger brother or younger sister, and whoever comes out of the womb later is the older brother or older sister, because the one who comes out later formed in the womb first. In fact, this is only a difference of a few minutes or even tens of seconds, so what's the difference between before and after? Just like the He sisters, how can they be distinguished as Miss He Da and Miss He Er? You can only call one Miss Shuangyu and the other Miss Liyu. (9)

### Shanghai Anecdotes

— Hangxie Zhaizhu

The Great Stage of the 20th Century

I don't know when China had theatrical magazines, but as far as I can see, "The Great Stage of the 20th Century" was the earliest. At that time, it was edited by the "Great Stage Congbao Society" in the autumn of Guangxu Jia Chen (1904). It was a 24-open road separate paper, with a single-color cover, titled by Zhu Suyun. The "Foreword" and "Inaugural Speech" were printed on red paper. The first insertion was images of Wang Xiaonong and Miyazaki Torazo, each on a page of copperplate paper, with inscriptions on the reverse. The one of Xiaonong was self-titled, very exaggerated. The poem said: Using copper clappers and iron plates as a career, competing to recognize the playwrights of the pear garden. This is the true face of Mount Lu, thoroughly smeared with rouge and powder.

Reversing the declining trend with great improvements, the sound is slow and the tone changes, vast and limitless. If it is wished to incarnate thousands, one old Wang in each singing stage.

The one of Miyazaki was titled by the pavilion chief of Chuihong. Later, Shi Huishi wrote a poem by Xiaonong. The "Inaugural Speech" was written by Ya Lu, stating that the purpose of printing "The Great Stage" was: "The descendants of the Yellow Emperor have suffered the poison of the Jiannu for a long time. The scholars and people of the Central Plains, resentful of the barbarian race, are everywhere. Only because the great righteousness of the nation cannot be popularized, the revenge of the country's destruction has been delayed. The organization now is actually based on the social thoughts of the whole country. Rise up in righteous armies, pull up the banner of Zhao and plant the banner of Han. In the future, when the people's intelligence is greatly opened, the rivers and mountains will be returned to us, and the pavilion of independence will be built to perform the magnificent and joyful plays of restoring the old things, overthrowing the barbarian dynasty, then China will live ten thousand years, and the great stage of the 20th century will live ten thousand years!" It can be seen that this magazine in the Qing Dynasty was actually revolutionary. The contents of the whole book are:

On the Benefits of Drama (Pei Ren) Biography of Yang Feihua, the Entertainer of the Southern Tang Dynasty (Pei Ren) Legend of Nanlewo (Jing An) Legend of Guilinhuan (Jingluzhu Ren) New Shanghai Opera Script (Xi Qiu) Changle Old Opera Script (Xiao Nong) Xiaohuncao Novel (Jingjisi An) New Water Margin Novel (Jingluzhu Ren) Stage Anecdotes (Chuihong Tingzhang) Xuanqu Zhi (Chuihong Tingzhang) Poems (Pei Ren, Xiaonong, Meng He, Song Cen, Gan Xing, E Lu, Huang Tian, Wu Men) Wishing Free God (Lover of Freedom) Criticism (Four Pieces) Liyuan Magazine (Eleven Pieces)

The author of "Anlewuo", Jing An, I don't know if it is Wang Jingan. The play performs the events of the Western Empress. Opening with "Zao Luo Pao": "Deep courtyard of sycamore trees, autumn wind is easy, secretly changing the fleeting years. The stars of gray hair age the beautiful face, afraid to wait for the dressing table to be seen in the morning. It is already light frost on the grass, short candles in the wind. How many times can you see spring flowers blooming, and the autumn moon is beautiful. It is good to feast in the hall, and do not put the golden cup shallow." This booklet contains the first "singing". It is not known whether the second issue or later has been published. The price of each booklet is two corners.
