### Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Retreat Toward Jincheng; Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Recover Chongyang, a Major Fire Breaks Out Within the City; Fierce Fighting Erupts on the East Bank of the Dongjing River, Japanese Troops are Surrounded; Chinese Troops Recover Ma'anshan Northeast of Xinkaitang Yesterday

(Luoyang) Japanese troops stubbornly resisting near the Ninety-Three Heights have suffered heavy blows from Chinese troops in recent days, sustaining significant casualties and fleeing toward Yangjiazhuang, Lizhuanggou (both west of Yangcheng), and other places. Chinese troops, seizing the momentum, are pursuing them like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The remaining Japanese forces are scattering at the sight of the Chinese. On the morning of the 25th, Chinese troops approached the outskirts of Yangcheng and, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' unsettled position, selected many daredevils to lead the attack on the city. After a prolonged hand-to-hand combat, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Subsequently, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in two directions: one group fleeing northwest to Qinyang, and the other scattering toward Jincheng. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue the Japanese troops. (Dispatch of the 26th)

Guilin On the night of the 24th, a unit of the Chinese army stormed into Chongyang city from the northwest, setting fire to all of the Japanese army's ammunition depots, granaries, and the railway station. They engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. By the morning of the 25th, the Chinese army had killed many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, having completed their mission, they safely retreated to 口口口 to await further orders. (Dispatch of the 26th)

(Hong Kong) This morning, the sound of machine-gun fire could be heard from afar, indicating that Japanese troops were again attacking villages and towns in the Zhongshan County area, and that Japanese troops were advancing towards the Pearl River Delta. (Dispatch of the 26th from Haitong News Agency)

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman commented on the situation in Shanxi province, saying that the Japanese troops in southwestern Shanxi were currently encountering many difficulties because the area was experiencing heavy rains, impeding their transportation. The Chinese army, aware that the Japanese troops attacking Taihang possessed superior equipment, concentrated its forces to attack the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops. As a result, the two armies are currently locked in a stalemate in the Yangcheng and Jincheng area. (Dispatch of the 16th from Reuters)

Fancheng On the night of the 20th, a certain unit of the Chinese army, together with Wang, the magistrate of Huaixian, launched a surprise attack on Huaixian. The puppet troops under Zhang seized the opportunity to defect en masse. More than half of the two hundred or so Japanese troops stationed in the city were annihilated by the Chinese army. The remaining troops broke through the south gate and fled in disarray. The county seat was recovered by the Chinese army, and a large amount of baggage, weapons, and ammunition were captured.

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, when the Chinese army in Shandong attacked Gaomi, the Japanese army's arsenal in the city suddenly caught fire. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's confusion, the Chinese army set fire to various depots, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the Japanese. In this battle, the Japanese army lost 300 tons of gasoline, a large amount of ammunition, and a large quantity of military supplies. Furthermore, the Chinese army recently attacked Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway and burned down the Japanese army barracks in Xinyang city. (Dispatch of the 26th from Associated Press)

Xingji Since the Japanese army's multi-pronged attack in southeastern Shanxi earlier this month failed again, the war has now become quiet. Although the Japanese have successively captured a few places such as Qinshui, Qinyuan, and Wuxiang, they are suffering from the Chinese people's scorched-earth policy, the constant attacks by Chinese soldiers, and the continuous rain, which makes it impossible to use machinery. Not only have the Japanese been unable to achieve their expected "mopping-up" operation, but now, although the fighting seems to have come to an end on the surface, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops are operating in southeastern Shanxi, sometimes regrouping, sometimes dispersing, to intercept, flank, surround, and lure the Japanese army, with the aim of annihilating the Japanese in the triangular area.

Shashi At noon on the 25th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops on the east bank of the Dongjing River in an encirclement maneuver. After six hours of fierce fighting, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese side sent more than two hundred infantry and cavalry troops, along with one artillery piece, from Qianjiang, dividing into two groups to attack the Chinese unit. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides at Meijiazui. The Chinese unit employed unusual tactics, attacking the rear of the Japanese with one part of their forces, and concentrating artillery fire to strike the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops. Until late at night, the Japanese, having suffered heavy casualties, fled back into the city. In this battle, more than fifty Japanese soldiers were killed and more than eighty were wounded, including the commander, Norio Fukuda. A large number of documents and spoils of war were captured. (Dispatch of the 25th)

Miluo On the 26th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Ma'anshan northeast of Xinkaitang.

The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses in this battle. The Chinese army also had one battalion commander wounded and more than ten company commanders and lower ranks killed in action. (Dispatch of the 26th)

(Zhengzhou) The Tong (County)-Gu (Beikou) Road, which was forcibly built by the Japanese army in Hebei Province, has not yet been opened to traffic due to repeated sabotage by the Chinese side. On the 19th, a train carrying supplies for the Japanese army, traveling from Fengtai to Tong County, detonated a landmine planted by the Chinese side on a bridge about four kilometers from Fengnan. The Japanese train overturned, resulting in many deaths and injuries. All of the military supplies sank into the river. (Dispatch of the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to reports indirectly received here from Luoyang, the Japanese army is again active in southern Henan. The fighting in this area has been suspended for a long time, but since the 24th, the Japanese army, under the cover of armored trains, has been moving north along the Pinghan Railway from Xinyang. (Dispatch of the 26th from the Second Haitong News Agency)

Pingjiang The important Hubei stronghold of Chongyang city was captured on the evening of the 25th. Previously, a certain unit of the Chinese army adopted a tactic of converging attacks from multiple directions. On the morning of the 25th, they successively arrived at their designated locations and, after occupying all the high ground around Chongyang, launched a coordinated encirclement and attack on the Japanese troops in the city. The Japanese troops at the south gate were unable to withstand the pressure and were broken through by the Chinese army. They then set fire to the warehouses storing ammunition, weapons, and provisions accumulated by the Japanese army in the city, while simultaneously mopping up the remaining troops in the city. By about 7:00 PM, Chongyang city was completely recovered by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops broke through the west gate and fled north.

Editorial

### Currency War

Since Hong Kong has restricted the supply of foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market, and North China has been trying to flood Shanghai with legal tender, the financial market in Shanghai has undergone tremendous changes due to this north-south exchange. In recent days, the changes have entered a static phase. According to the exchange rate posted by HSBC, one yuan of national currency is worth four pence in British currency, and one hundred yuan of national currency is worth $7.75 in US currency, gradually forming a new standard. At the same time, the responsible authorities of the National Government have also firmly declared that they will do their utmost to maintain the legal tender policy. The market situation should tend to be calm during wartime.

This large influx of legal tender from North China into Shanghai, on the surface, is due to a small number of speculative merchants taking advantage of the difference in exchange rates between Tianjin and Shanghai in an attempt to obtain huge illegal profits; but in fact, this is another act in the Sino-Japanese currency war. Because in the severely controlled North China, who can possess a surplus of legal tender in large quantities? Who can transport and export it in large quantities? This is clearly a planned and backed action; its purpose is to absorb legal tender through clever tricks and plunder, in order to obtain foreign exchange, and at the same time reduce the amount of legal tender in circulation, and promote its own chips.

As for the future, it can be foreseen that before the Sino-Japanese currency war ends in the occupied areas, Shanghai and other places that have obtained control of the currency will inevitably continue to find ways to undermine the credit of legal tender, while seizing the foreign exchange fund of legal tender; and China, which implements the legal tender policy, will also do its best to maintain the integrity and soundness of the legal tender system. Then the Sino-Japanese currency war in the future may become more and more intense as time goes on. The Chinese people residing in Shanghai and other occupied areas must have a thorough understanding of the truth of the currency war, in order to reduce personal economic losses and not harm the strength of the national war of resistance.

It is estimated that the amount of legal tender issued by China at the beginning of this month was 200 billion yuan; part of it is circulating in the mainland controlled by the Chinese government, and part of it is distributed in the occupied areas. The price of legal tender circulating in the Chinese mainland has not changed at all; the legitimate foreign exchange needed by the people can be supplied by the government at the statutory price. As for the legal tender distributed in the occupied areas, it is the target of the current currency war. Japan can directly put pressure on this part of legal tender with political, economic and military forces; while the Chinese government can only maintain it indirectly; allowing the black market of foreign exchange, which China cannot quickly ban for various reasons, is the biggest weakness that attracts the opponent's attack. Although legal tender in the occupied areas is in this environment, it is still trusted by the people everywhere; not only is it regarded as the only credit tool by the people in the vast occupied areas, but even in the cities where the Japanese army directly forces the prohibition of legal tender, it cannot stop its secret circulation. It can be seen that legal tender has a solid foundation that is not easily destroyed!

After a considerable period of currency war, it has proven the "long history" of legal tender, so the Japanese side is angry at the help of third countries. In fact, the circulation of a currency must have a legitimate political force to promote it, and sufficient issuance reserves as a basis, in order to gain the trust of the people and become a universal currency, which is by no means something that a simple gun can do. Borrowing the power of guns, its function is only like the range of bullets, and after the range, everything is invalid! In addition to military tickets, it is necessary to use other names and print other chips, which shows the truth of the range of bullets. But there is no room for nominal and flowery paper without issuance reserves, so their northern chips and counterfeit banknotes once claimed to be prepared with Japanese yen, but most of the gold and silver prepared by Japanese yen has been transported to the United States and exchanged for steel; even the textile industry, which Japan regards as the economic lifeline, has difficulty obtaining foreign exchange for the raw materials it needs, such as wool and cotton, so how can it supply the foreign exchange for counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, their Hongkou chips claimed to be prepared with Chinese legal tender, which is a poisonous plan to seize the foreign exchange fund of legal tender; unexpectedly, the Chinese strategy of making the black market of foreign exchange plummet not only made their chips have no place to rely on and exposed their weaknesses, but also caused a fatal blow to their monopolized commerce in the occupied areas!

The currency war is in full swing and will inevitably become more and more fierce. In the future currency war, in order to pursue the final victory, China must have the Chinese government and the people more earnestly fulfill their respective obligations than before. The Chinese government must quickly strengthen the control of trade, reduce imports, so as to avoid excessive consumption of foreign exchange funds; and must continue to obtain financial assistance from friendly countries. The amount of assistance is not the problem, but its main significance is to prove that legal tender has the qualifications to obtain assistance internationally; to prove that in the currency war, legal tender has exclusive assistance, that is, exclusive credit. In addition, it is necessary to use agile and effective methods to make legal tender flow to the mainland in large quantities. On the part of the people, they must firmly believe in legal tender, recognize that legal tender has a unique credit; and understand that if they want to avoid economic losses in the currency war, the safest way is to move funds to the mainland and engage in the development of various resources.

British Compromise with Japan

### External Announcement Expressing Disappointment to Britain; Britain's Acknowledgement of Japan's Demands is Truly Regrettable; Chongqing United Daily News Lambasts Britain's Attitude

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today, expressing the Chinese government's disappointment with the British government's attitude in the Tokyo Conference. The statement said that when the Chinese authorities learned of the content of the Anglo-Japanese proposal, they could not conceal their disappointment with the attitude taken by the British government. The Japanese army's aggression in China was declared unanimously by Britain itself and other member states of the League of Nations. Now the British government feels it appropriate to acknowledge the so-called special requirements of the Japanese army in China, which is truly regrettable. What is even more surprising is that the British government has undertaken to notify British officials and people in China not to take any actions or plans that hinder the Japanese army from achieving its goals. However, Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons that the British government's policy cannot be changed by the command of other countries, and the guarantee that the development in Tokyo does not contain any changes in the British policy in China that has been consistently implemented in the past, is still satisfactory to the Chinese government. The British government's guarantees under the League of Nations resolutions that it would not take any actions that would weaken China's resistance and increase the difficulties of China's war, and that it would do its utmost to assist China, are still in our ears. It is hardly necessary to urge the British government not to forget this guarantee. The Chinese government deeply believes that although the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese proposal has aroused doubts, the British government will take an attitude that conforms to its legal and moral obligations to China to deal with the so-called Tianjin local incident and express its firm policy towards the situation created by the Japanese in China through action. (Dispatch of the 22nd from Reuters)

(Chongqing) The United Daily News here this morning published an editorial strongly criticizing the attitude held by the British in the Tokyo Conference. The newspaper published the full text of the Anglo-Japanese compromise, as well as the speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax on this matter, and analyzed them, saying, "We dare not hastily define broad terms such as 'the special needs of the Japanese army in China.' The British know very well the goals that the Japanese army hopes to achieve in China. If the British provide assistance and convenience to aggression or violence, then the British government at least no longer has moral principles or concepts of justice. For example, if a strongman robs our house and kills our people, and suddenly a neighbor comes out and says to the robber, 'I have noticed your special needs and will undertake to prevent the family members of the robbed from interfering with your actions,' what would we think of this neighbor? The Chinese reaction to Chamberlain's remarks is also the same. Suppose this neighbor has no legal obligation to help us, but encourages the strongman, but at the same time declares that he has not changed his policy of treating neighbors kindly, what will our reaction be? Moreover, as long as the League of Nations has not been dissolved, the resolutions passed by it cannot be regarded as waste paper. We hope that when we occasionally recall the repeated resolutions passed by the League of Nations with British participation and support, we are not dreaming in vain. To provide effective assistance to China is in conflict with not taking actions that hinder the goals of the Japanese army in China. This attitude of Britain not only reduces China's resistance and increases its difficulties, but also creates international disputes and difficulties. We hope that Chamberlain's declaration that it does not contain any intention of changing the British policy towards China is a sincere remark. We do not doubt its sincerity, but its sincerity must be proved by its attitude and its actual actions at the formal meeting in Tokyo." The newspaper concluded by supporting President Chiang's speech calling on the people of the whole country to work hard on their own and not rely on others. Furthermore, a certain official of the Chinese government said to others, "British friends have invited me to a banquet, but I cannot accept their invitation." From this, one can get a glimpse of the mood of the Chinese people here. (Dispatch of the 26th from Reuters)

(Chongqing) The newspapers here today prominently published President Chiang's remarks made on Sunday night, but because of the Japanese air raid that night, the morning newspapers were not published until the afternoon. All newspapers carried news of British Prime Minister Chamberlain reading the Anglo-Japanese compromise document in the House of Commons, but did not criticize this compromise. An editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News pointed out the reasons why Japan's economic war is bound to fail, saying that China has an economic system that is unparalleled in the world and extremely flexible, and can resist all attacks from the Japanese side.

### Ambassador Gu Protests Anglo-Japanese Preliminary Agreement, Says it Conflicts with International Treaties; Britain's Concessions to Japan will Suffer the Consequences

(Paris) Chinese Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun recently issued a statement protesting the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan, with solemn wording. Its main points are two: (1) This agreement conflicts with the Nine-Power Treaty, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly and the Council, and the report of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference (held in Brussels, Belgium in November 1937). (2) Britain's spirit of concession is completely exposed, and this spirit is enough to hinder the foundation of general peace. The full text is excerpted as follows: Ambassador Gu first said that the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement is an "unpleasant surprise" for China, and the question of what Britain's true policy towards China is has also become a problem. This agreement, at least in its wording, does not distinguish between Japanese aggression and China's self-defense. "Britain is probably prepared to allow the aggressor country to act freely, while making the aggressed country obviously suffer. This attitude is difficult to reconcile with the Nine-Power Treaty, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly and the Council, and the report of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference. "Britain has accepted solemn obligations to China in the above-mentioned international treaties, and now seems to have ignored them, at least for the time being." Or the Anglo-Japanese agreement has proved Britain's spirit of concession. "It is still remembered that the Japanese warlords had taken violent actions against British citizens among the nationals of all countries in Tianjin. The British government initially took a firm stand in principle, but now it is calm and at ease, abandoning its original stand, which is really surprising. Those innocent British men and women in Tianjin who entered and exited the British concession were deliberately ordered by Japanese soldiers to take off their clothes and be inspected, and their faces were slapped. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain also called it a 'humiliating outrage.' Now it is strange to reward it with an agreement. It is reasonable to assume that Britain has dried its face and once again yielded to the front of power. What is worrying is that this agreement will have a bad impact on the cause of peace, not only is it not enough to prevent aggression, but even in terms of Britain's efforts to build a peace front in Europe, it is not enough to strengthen the confidence of all countries. It is foreseeable that Britain's concessions to aggression in the Far East will suffer the consequences in Europe. "However, the Anglo-Japanese agreement may only be a compromise, in order to resolve the difficulties before the start of negotiations on the Tianjin incident, so its wording is ambiguous and can be interpreted differently, which is naturally inevitable. As for the true meaning of the agreement, it should be supplemented by how future negotiations will be, and how it is actually implemented in China as a shift. In short, empty words are not the final conclusion, and the key lies in actual action. Therefore, whether the new Anglo-Japanese agreement is the beginning of Britain's implementation of a new policy towards the Far East and towards China, there must be facts from the future to prove it. It is hoped that the general public in China, who are now worried about Britain's intentions, will eventually be proven wrong by the facts." (Dispatch of the 25th from Havas)

### The Muslim Relief Association Convened a Representative Conference; Dozens of Ministers and Officials from Various Ministries Attended; President Chiang Personally Attended and Delivered a Speech

### U.S. Protested Beating of American

(Beijing) According to news here today, the U.S. Embassy has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Embassy because two Americans were slapped by Japanese sentries. One of them was an American Catholic priest, Father Stignauer, and the other was a physical education teacher at Fu Jen Catholic University, Smith Bijie. They were both attacked by Japanese sentries on Saturday. In addition to slapping, the two were also detained for a long time. When the Japanese sentries attacked the two, they threatened them with the guns in their hands. According to the two, on Saturday, when they were traveling to the Summer Palace and were about to enter a certain house, they were often stopped by Japanese sentries, who insisted on checking their passes. The two were then taken to the Japanese military camp. After the two entered the Japanese military camp, they were slapped by Japanese soldiers. Father Stignauer was first taken to the Japanese military camp by Japanese sentries and slapped by Japanese soldiers. Smith Bijie saw this and went to investigate, and was also slapped by Japanese soldiers. According to the Japanese military spokesman, this unfortunate incident will be resolved satisfactorily to the satisfaction of the United States. In short, this matter was purely a "misunderstanding." (Dispatch of the 26th from Associated Press)

### British House of Commons Discusses Chinese Legal Tender Issue: Finance Minister Offers No New Statements on Government Policy; The Times Advocates Anglo-American Cooperation to Stabilize Legal Tender

(London) The House of Commons discussed the continued decline in the value of Chinese legal tender. Labor Party member Mr. Bellenger asked Finance Minister Simon whether he was aware of the continuous decline in the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender, and whether the equalization fund had been exhausted. Simon replied that the current status of the Chinese currency stabilization fund must be kept secret, as is the case with British or other foreign exchange stabilization funds. Mr. Bellenger should be aware of this. Bellenger continued, since the Finance Minister requested the House of Commons to vote in favor of using British taxpayers' money to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender, the legal tender has depreciated by 50%. Does the Finance Minister intend to allow Chinese legal tender to find its own economic level? Simon replied that he could not add anything to his answer of July 11 to the last question. Labor Party member Mr. Noel-Baker asked the Finance Minister whether he could state unequivocally that for the sake of British interests, the British government considered it necessary to maintain the foreign exchange value of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that he had stated in his previous reply to the House of Commons that no discussion of further action had been taken at present, and that he could not add anything to his previous answer, unless circumstances changed in other respects. Labor Party member Mr. Strauss asked whether the government would maintain its policy on the Chinese currency system. Simon replied that this question had not been submitted in writing and could not be answered immediately. Mr. Mander, a Liberal Party member of the opposition, asked whether the government had yielded to Japan in the Far East. Labor Party member Mr. Greenwood asked whether the government should find a way to prevent Chinese legal tender from falling further. Simon replied that this matter still required congressional approval. (Reuters, 25th)

(London) Labor MP Strauss asked in the House of Commons today whether the Treasury had communicated with a certain bank with its headquarters in London about its branch in Shanghai allegedly cooperating with the Japanese authorities to weaken the Chinese foreign exchange stabilization fund. Finance Minister Simon replied that the Treasury had not done so. Strauss asked whether the Finance Minister meant that the Treasury had not contacted the bank in Shanghai. Simon replied that the question was whether the Treasury had communicated, and he replied that it had not, the meaning of which was clear. (Reuters, 25th)

(London) The chief writer on financial matters for the London Times recently published a lengthy article discussing the Chinese currency issue. It stated, "The general public was originally concerned that the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo might directly involve the issue of Chinese legal tender, and that Japan might exert pressure to establish an agreement on this matter. At this point, this issue is clearly not being raised for discussion. Even in the initial agreement reached between the two countries, both sides retain complete freedom of action on this issue. However, how to proceed with maintaining legal tender in the near future is a matter of great uncertainty, even for experts familiar with Chinese financial and economic issues. However, as things stand, the pressure on legal tender in Shanghai has been reduced, and market participants even believe that the price of legal tender may rise somewhat. But the problem remains significant, and most people believe that the assistance needed to fully restore public confidence in legal tender must be greater than what was considered when the stabilization fund was established in order to be effective. Some say that stabilizing legal tender is a major undertaking, and if Britain does it alone without the United States coming forward to cooperate, it will not be easy. For the sake of protecting its trade with China, it is in the United States' best interest to have Chinese legal tender reasonably stable, which is also obvious. Unfortunately, as of now, there are very few signs of the United States coming forward to cooperate, which is quite strange. In short, if Britain intends to continue to assist legal tender, whether the United States comes forward to cooperate or not, it must fully consider one thing: the weakness of legal tender may be caused by fundamental economic forces."

(Tokyo) This morning, Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Privy Council the detailed progress of the talks in Tokyo, saying that the Anglo-Japanese conference was proceeding smoothly. (Reuters, 26th)

(Tokyo) The third meeting of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations convened this morning at 10:00 AM and discussed for three hours. The main task was to present a report on the issue of maintaining security in the British Concession in Tianjin and to appoint a committee to study it. According to well-informed Japanese sources, the issues raised at this morning's meeting will be resolved at this afternoon's or tomorrow's meeting. Once the issues of an administrative nature are resolved, economic issues will be considered. It is said here that after reaching an agreement on basic principles regarding the Tianjin issue, Britain and Japan will continue to negotiate various pending issues in Tokyo, using the basic agreement as the basis for discussion. (Haitong, 26th)

(London) According to unconfirmed reports, the Japanese representative suggested at the meeting today that the Tianjin British Concession Bureau be reorganized, believing that the existing organization takes a hostile attitude toward Japan. It is said that the British representative rejected this on legal grounds. (Haitong, 26th) It is speculated that if the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo can reach a compromise, an Anglo-Japanese on-site conference will be held in Tianjin to discuss concrete cooperative strategies between Britain and Japan on security issues, as well as the implementation methods of the points decided upon by both parties on economic issues, in order to conclude the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. (Domei, 26th)

### Scope of Discussion Limited to Tianjin Local Incidents

(London) Sources close to the government here recently declared that the agenda for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo is currently being exchanged between the two sides. Once it is finalized, formal negotiations should begin. At that time, the discussion will be limited to purely local incidents in Tianjin: (1) The issue of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case; (2) The issue of cooperating with the Concession Police Department to punish terrorist activities and anti-Japanese activities based in the British Concession; (3) Certain financial issues within the British Concession, such as the issue of Chinese banks' deposits of 48 million Chinese currency. This item will be submitted for discussion last, and because France is also involved, it is expected that the country will send a representative to participate. Apart from these issues, Britain will refuse to discuss any other issues of a broader scope. When discussing the issue of deposits in the future, Britain will definitely not allow the Japanese side to raise general financial issues. (Havas, 25th)

### Japanese Side Prepared to Raise the Issue of the Chinese Currency System

(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the Cabinet has decided that the issue of the Chinese currency system must be raised at the Anglo-Japanese Roundtable Conference. The Japanese side will pressure Britain to help collapse the Chinese legal tender, through four ways: (1) British cooperation to prohibit the circulation of legal tender in North China; (2) The British side will transfer Chinese deposits in the Tianjin British Concession to the Japanese side; (3) British cooperation to support the activities of the United Reserve Bank; (4) The British side will effectively manage the business of Chinese banks and private banks in the Tianjin British Concession. As for Central and South China, Japan has decided to request concrete cooperation from the local British authorities for the Huaxing banknotes. (Reuters, 26th)

### Japanese Army Commander Honma's Remarks

(Berlin) The Nazi Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, carried the remarks of General Yamashita, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China (see separate telegram) in its first edition yesterday. However, the subsequent editions deleted these remarks and replaced them with the remarks of General Honma, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, the content of which expressed skepticism about the future of Anglo-Japanese relations within China. It stated that "Communists hide in the Tianjin British Concession, beyond our reach, but these people are engaged in disrupting the actions of the Japanese army, which we cannot tolerate. Moreover, can we waste time circuitously discussing whether these people are guilty? In short, unless the various issues are resolved definitively, we will countermand the British Concession every day. (Havas, 26th)

(Berlin) The Nazi Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, recently published remarks made by General Yamashita, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China, to a reporter from the newspaper. It stated that "The Japanese Army in North China will watch the progress of the negotiations between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin incident with an extremely calm attitude and the greatest attention. Within the scope of the new situation in the Far East, Britain must not demand more than it is entitled to. As far as the situation in North China is concerned, everything is completely in the hands of the Japanese army." It also stated, "The close cooperation between Germany and Japan is one of the most important realities in the world political situation." (Havas, 25th)

### British Opinion: A Glimpse

(London) British newspapers have commented extensively on the establishment of an agreement at the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. The Daily Telegraph's editorial stated that the principles established by Britain and Japan not only fail to reassure people, but also make them more uneasy, plunging them into a fog. The declaration that Japan has various privileges in China, which seem to be legitimate, and that this is in accordance with Britain's previous policy is utterly baffling. Whether Britain will continue to maintain the Chinese currency system and provide economic assistance to China remains to be proven. The Manchester Guardian commented that Britain is either deceiving itself or deceiving China, because Britain can never be bullied by Japan. The most obvious fact is that people do not understand the truth of this agreement, because the extent to which its wording is unclear is sufficient to make it insignificant. If Japan interprets this agreement to mean that this principle applies to the whole of China and believes that Britain has the possibility of cooperating with Japan, then China, Britain, and the United States will all suffer greatly. If the Japanese interpretation is not correct, then Britain should take remedial measures immediately and clearly state that it must support Chinese legal tender. The News Chronicle stated that the content of the Anglo-Japanese agreement is sufficient to prove that what the Japanese side claimed, that Britain has accepted the Japanese demands, is not false. If the British government wants to prove that the British interpretation is correct, it can provide China with a credit loan to show this. In any case, Britain should not take any policies that would hinder the implementation of the Chinese currency system. The Daily Express stated that if we want to stop Japanese aggression, closing our eyes and ignoring it will never work. At the same time, if we want to help China, it will not be successful by going in the opposite direction. The Times said that it is never easy to maintain friendly relations with a country at war. As far as Britain and Japan are concerned, maintaining friendly relations is impossible. Now that an agreement has been reached, at least it can temporarily avoid the two countries from taking an opposing stance. What is still unresolved is how to implement this agreement. (26th)

### Questions Raised in the British House of Commons

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, the situation regarding the initial agreement between Britain and Japan was extremely turbulent. Opposition Labor MP Baker used a sarcastic tone to ask, "Japan is planning to restrict food supplies to Hong Kong, and in Shanghai, it is arresting British officials. Is this how Japan is repaying our country for the concessions it is making in the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement?" At this point, opposition MPs shouted to Prime Minister Chamberlain, "Answer quickly!" The Prime Minister only replied no. Opposition Labor MP Wedgwood asked, "After the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement was established, it caused a major reaction in Tokyo. Will Prime Minister Chamberlain pay attention to it?" The Prime Minister replied again, "I have nothing to add. Britain and Japan began negotiations in Tokyo on the 24th of this month. As of now, they have only discussed procedural issues and reviewed various facts." (Havas, 26th)

(London) Political circles here today completely shifted the responsibility for Britain's initial agreement with Japan to the United States. In other words, the reason why Britain is now seeking a solution with Japan is entirely due to the United States' lack of support for Britain. Britain is not only bearing the burden completely independently in the Far East, but at the same time, due to the failure to amend the US Neutrality Act, the indirect assistance it should have received is also absent. Currently, Britain and Japan have agreed to establish a border committee to determine a fact to deal with the matter. (Associated Press, 26th)

(London) The preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin case is still a major topic of discussion in the Far East circles here. Cautious observers, including representatives of the North China business community, now feel more gratified. They compare the propaganda made by the Japanese newspapers and spokesmen at the time of the Arita-Craigie talks and the exaggerated claims that Britain would be forced to yield with the actual agreement, saying that the agreement does not indicate any fundamental change in British policy and that Britain has not undertaken anything other than what it has accepted. However, authors who oppose the agreement strongly reject this view, insisting that the agreement acknowledges Japan's right to engage in unjustified warfare in China and has become the basis for Japan to continue attacking British nationals and their industries whenever it deems it necessary. The Aid China Movement Committee is now planning a large-scale protest demonstration tomorrow, inviting Members of Parliament to convene a public gathering in the lounge and holding a large parade with placards and slogans in the West End of London. Authors on financial issues are studying the agreement from the perspective of continuing to aid China, and agree to pay attention to the stability of Chinese legal tender. The Financial Times wrote, "The Anglo-Japanese discussions are now limited to local incidents in Tianjin, which is a great improvement over the sweeping demands made by Japan originally to resolve all pending issues. It seems that we have now reached an agreement with Japan without losing our freedom of action towards China. The exercise of this freedom is an important matter, and there is an immediate point of contention, namely that the plan must not be allowed to affect Britain's attitude of supporting Chinese legal tender." The newspaper also published its views after reviewing China's trade status and China's new regulations restricting imports, saying that strengthening the foreign exchange fund is not the way to go, and that it will only throw good money into a bottomless pit. However, we must now devise a good strategy to prevent this money from indirectly falling into the hands of the Japanese. The Times also published its views in its local section, welcoming the fact that the Anglo-Japanese discussion avoided involving monetary issues and predicting that if we want to restore full confidence in Chinese legal tender, we must provide assistance on a larger scale than when the stabilization fund was established. It also emphasized that China should impose stricter controls on imports and encourage export trade. A reporter from the News Chronicle emphasized that the stabilization fund has not been exhausted, and that one of the least satisfactory aspects of its history is the enormous amount of this money, which is now believed to have been indirectly transferred into the hands of the Japanese. The newspaper also asked the public to pay attention to the recent trade agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union, and the plan implemented by the Chinese government to export products such as tea and tung oil from ports not controlled by the Japanese. Finally, it asked that China still holds extremely large reserves of gold and silver and foreign exchange, amounting to 20 million pounds, not including the 5 million pounds in the stabilization fund. (Reuters, 26th)

### Italian Newspaper Mocks British Surrender

(Rome) After the establishment of the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan, the famous reporter Gayda (known as Mussolini's mouthpiece) commented on it in the semi-official Italian Daily, expressing his delight. He wrote that the British Empire had declared its surrender to Japan, but whether it was sincere was not yet certain, fearing that it might be a mysterious strategy, which must be guarded against. It is also heard that Britain may offer Japan a loan. In short, Britain cannot cope with both the Eastern European and Far Eastern fronts at the same time, and its encirclement policy has imposed a heavy burden. Britain has begun to realize all this, and has had to change its attitude. However, the impact on the Soviet Union and countries that have been secured or plan to be secured by Britain and France is bound to be a bad impression, which is only natural. (Havas, 25th)

### The US Maintains Its Original Attitude on the Far East Issue; The US Does Not Intend to Recognize the Reality Created by Force

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the US attitude has not changed since the outbreak of the Far East dispute, implying that it does not intend to recognize the reality created by force. He also said that the original text of the initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo has been sent to the State Department by the Japanese government, but the British government has not made any announcement. As for the blockade of the Pearl River by the Japanese military authorities, the US government's attitude will be no different from when the Pearl River was blockaded previously. In other words, the US will inform American expatriates to be cautious, but if an accident occurs that damages American interests, the Japanese authorities will still bear full responsibility. (Havas, 25th)

(Washington) The initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo has been commented on by political figures here, who all say that those in the US who oppose President Roosevelt's policy will become more eloquent. Isolationists all say that Britain and France retreat whenever a blade is put to their necks, and it is all harm and no benefit for the US to join forces with these countries. Among them, Republican Senator Johnson said that the fact that Congress refused to amend the existing Neutrality Act according to the government's wishes was a wise move, as evidenced by the establishment of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement. US Congressmen have always been suspicious of the diplomatic methods of European countries, as can be seen from this. However, Secretary of State Hull made a statement this morning, still advocating a firm attitude towards Japan, which was approved by all in Congress, and emphasized that the US will definitely maintain the Open Door Policy in China and still refuse to recognize acts that violate international law. (Havas, 25th)

### Manchukuo Implements Air Defense Provisions

(Tokyo) Due to continued disturbances on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, the "Manchukuo" government has cited the air defense provisions of the National Defense Law and immediately implemented them throughout the territory. (Reuters, 26th)

### Chen Jiageng Leads Eight Million Overseas Chinese in Appealing to Influential Figures in British Politics: Do Not Make Concessions to Japan and Fall from Your Prestige

(Leading) Singaporean overseas Chinese tycoon Chen Jiageng, known for destroying his home to build schools, believes that Britain is trending towards making concessions to Japan in the negotiations in Tokyo, so in the name of eight million overseas Chinese, he has sent letters of advice to influential figures in British politics, warning Britain not to take steps that could affect its prestige, so as not to reduce the general public's confidence in Britain. It is said that former Foreign Secretary Eden, party leader Churchill, and other figures such as Lord Lytton, former Prime Minister Lloyd George, Sinclair, and Mr. Greenwood have all received this letter of protest. (Haitong, 25th)

### Opening of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation: Budget Submitted for Discussion

(Moscow) The second plenary session of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation opened today in the Kremlin. Many guests were present, such as Stakhanovites and shock workers from various factories in the city, representatives of intellectuals, members of the diplomatic corps, and domestic and foreign journalists. Party and government leaders Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Shvernik, Malenkov, Shkiryatov, Bulganin, Badaev, Vyshinsky, Gorkin, all members of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation, and government officials took their seats in the boxes, and all the deputies and guests responded with enthusiastic cheers. The plenary session was opened by Speaker Zhdanov, and after the agenda was approved, the People's Finance Commissar of the Russian Federation, Umanov, reported on the state budget of the state for 1939 as follows:

"This year's budget reflects the strong development of our country's economy and culture. The revenue part is estimated to be 24,415,000,000 rubles, an increase of 12.6% over 1938. In the expenditure part, the expenditure on social and cultural undertakings reaches 16,052,200,000 rubles, of which education expenses are 9,473,000,000 rubles and health expenses are 4,831,000,000 rubles." (Tass, 25th)

### Sakhalin Oil Rights Dispute: Japanese Authorities Insist on Patience; Soviet Reply Under Study

(Tokyo) Japan lodged a protest with the Soviet government on April 20, opposing the Soviet Union's oppression of Japanese oil and coal concession rights in northern Sakhalin. It is now heard that the Japanese government has received a lengthy reply from the Soviet government and is currently studying it before taking new action. According to Japanese sources, the Soviet government threatened Japan that if it did not pay the fines judged by the local Soviet court by July 19, it would take back the Japanese concession rights. The Soviet government has not yet taken this action, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared today that the handling of the North Sakhalin issue must be done with great patience. (Reuters, 26th)

### Foreign Mongolian Border Warfare: Japanese Exaggerated Propaganda

(Tokyo) According to a Japanese source in Changchun, the Soviet-Mongolian army positions on the west bank of the Khalkhin River were fiercely attacked by Japanese artillery yesterday. The bombardment continued from morning until dusk, ceasing only when the Soviet-Mongolian forces stopped retaliating. Yesterday morning, the Kwantung Army issued a public statement claiming that 59 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down by Japanese forces on the 24th, with 17 shot down in the morning and the remaining 42 in the afternoon.

### Overseas Chinese in Malaya Boycott of Japanese Goods Effective: Significant Blow to Japanese Trade; Regarding Overseas Chinese in the Malay Archipelago

A report on the boycott of Japanese goods by overseas Chinese, submitted by the British Trade Commissioner in Singapore to the Overseas Trade Department, has recently been published by the department. It states: "The large number of overseas Chinese in the Malay Archipelago are vigorously boycotting Japanese goods, with considerable success. The value of Japanese goods imported into the Malay Archipelago, calculated in Singapore dollars, was 40,482,000 in 1937, but decreased to 12,426,000 in 1938. Coal imports were halved, cement imports reduced by two-thirds, asbestos imports fell from 1,229 tons to 1 ton, cotton yarn and textiles fell in value from 7,406,000 to 2,787,000, woolen goods from 652,000 to 218,000, silk goods from 3,492,000 to 1,021,000, and copper, iron, and steel products from 3,361,000 to 305,000."

### Britain and France Accept Soviet Proposal: Conduct Staff Talks First; Representatives of Both Countries to Go to Moscow Soon; Political Agreement Awaits Further Negotiations

(London) Local newspapers recently reported that Britain has agreed to Moscow's request that staff talks between the British and Soviet armed forces should be held soon, without waiting for the detailed terms of a tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is now known in diplomatic circles that British staff representatives from the army, navy, and air force will soon depart for Moscow. (Reuter, 26th)

(London) Staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take place in the near future. According to the "Evening Standard," Britain's chief representative will be General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces. "He fought against the Red Army in Arkhangelsk (a Soviet port on the White Sea) in 1919. Although he was an enemy of the Soviets, he now advocates British-Soviet cooperation. The Soviet authorities also prioritize pragmatism over old grudges, so they have not expressed any objections. This is noteworthy." (Havas, 26th)

(London) Sources close to the government here recently stated that a political agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is about to be concluded, and staff talks between the three countries can begin in Moscow within ten or twelve days, before the political agreement is finalized. According to reports, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently suggested to British Ambassador Seeds and French Ambassador Naggiar that the remaining difficulty in the tripartite political agreement was the definition of "indirect aggression." Before this issue is resolved, staff talks could be held first. Britain and France immediately expressed their agreement. Once the respective cabinets have approved, military representatives will be sent to Moscow within ten days. These representatives will include a French army general, a British naval officer, and several air force representatives from both countries. Regarding this matter, the British government plans to submit a report to the House of Commons tomorrow. In addition, regarding the definition of "indirect aggression," the government plans to send further instructions to Ambassador Seeds by telegram. It is said that the content offers further concessions to the Soviet Union, and the proposed approach is more flexible than previously heard. In short, now that Britain and France have accepted the Soviet proposal to hold staff talks, the Soviet Union should no longer insist on its own views regarding the definition of "indirect aggression." Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood this afternoon to discuss the issue of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is said that the Labour Party is very optimistic about the future of the tripartite talks. (Havas, 25th)

### British Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "The government sent new instructions to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union last night. We hope to make an announcement regarding the latest situation in the negotiations in the early part of next week." Opposition Labour Party MP Dalton immediately asked, "Have all relevant parties agreed to the dispatch of British army and navy representatives to Moscow for talks?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government authorities have sent certain instructions to Ambassador Seeds, but we do not yet know the Soviet Union's reaction." Opposition Liberal Party MP Mander then asked, "Does the French government also intend to send a military delegation to Moscow?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Regarding the French government, I am not in a position to answer on their behalf. But I can assure the honorable member that the British and French governments are cooperating fully." (Havas, 26th)

### Germany and Italy Do Not Attach Importance

(Rome) Fascist circles here do not consider the rumored dispatch of British and French army, navy, and air force delegations to Moscow to discuss a military agreement with the Soviet Union to be important, but rather a method of self-consolation for the democratic countries. The British-French-Soviet agreement has been negotiated for months without success, so even if military delegations are sent, how can they achieve quick results? Furthermore, the eagerness of Britain and France to send military envoys shows that their desire to conclude this agreement is far stronger than that of the Soviet Union. Because of this, the Soviet Union may insist even more on its original demands. Moreover, this action by the British and French governments is also intended to demonstrate the results of their negotiations over the past few months. At least what Britain and France are currently seeking is a military agreement. At the same time, this action coincides with Britain's submission in the Far East, which is thought-provoking. Finally, this action is also intended to divert the public's attention from the Far East to other areas. (Associated Press, 26th)

### Joint Strength of British and French Air Forces is Powerful; French Air Minister Delivers Speech in London; 200 British Aircraft Fly to France for Training

(London) French Air Minister La Chambre, who arrived here yesterday, visited British Air Minister Wood this afternoon for a lengthy discussion. In the evening, he attended a banquet at the British branch of the Alliance Française, commemorating the late French aviator Blériot, and delivered a speech praising the strength of the British and French air forces and the size of their aircraft production. He said, "Considering the current aircraft production of Britain and France, the total number is comparable to that of a certain country that first expanded its air force, forcing other countries to join the competition and placing a heavy burden on all mankind. If necessary in the future, it can be expanded to more than double, because our current production capacity has not yet been fully utilized." British Air Minister Wood followed with a speech, saying, "British and French air force cooperation is close, more so than ever before. Our aircraft have repeatedly flown into French airspace, and we hope that the French government can also send aircraft to our country for training flights. All the facilities of Britain and France, and the powerful military force we are now creating, are solely for the purpose of maintaining peace, resisting aggression, and upholding justice and fairness. This is our only goal. In short, we not only absolutely do not threaten other countries, but also wish to live in friendship with all countries in the world. We hope that Britain and France can further expand the scope of cooperation in the future." (Havas, 25th)

(London) This month marks the 30th anniversary of the late French aviator Blériot's flight across the English Channel. The British Air Ministry specially dispatched 240 aircraft, carrying 2,000 pilots, divided into several groups, flying to French airspace via different routes for a third training flight. Several French aircraft also took off from certain locations to join the flight. One team of British aircraft flew the farthest, covering a total distance of 2,600 kilometers round trip, without landing midway. Their average speed was 500 kilometers per hour. The aircraft of each team then successively flew back to their bases. (Havas, 25th)

### Danzig Situation: Britain Does Not Express Excessive Concern

(London) Undersecretary of State Butler replied in the House of Commons today to questions regarding the Danzig situation, saying that although there are some military preparations in the area, the information received by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is not sufficient to cause him to express excessive concern about the current situation. (Reuter, 26th)

### Italian Army Scheduled to Hold Autumn Maneuvers Next Month

(Berlin) Italian army units are scheduled to hold exercises in the Po Valley in northern Italy in early August. A German military delegation, led by Army Chief of Staff General Halder, is scheduled to visit from August 1st to 9th. According to military sources here, this trip has no political significance. The German army will also hold exercises, and will invite an Italian military delegation to visit at that time. However, the exercises have not yet been decided. In addition, Germany plans to hold joint army, navy, and air force exercises next year. (Havas, 26th)

### Soviet Gold Flown to Britain by Plane

Chamberlain Has Different Views

### Dark Future for British-French-Soviet Alliance; Shudi; British Foreign Secretary Uses Resignation Threat Unsuccessfully; Chamberlain Firmly Rejects Churchill's Inclusion in the Cabinet

London News: In this world, due to different standpoints and interests, there are forces that promote the ongoing British-French-Soviet alliance, forming a driving force, and there are forces that hinder it, forming a countercurrent force. These two aspects of power are multifaceted, and it is naturally impossible to describe them all at once. What I want to talk about here is the most important force in Europe that is currently preventing the establishment of this alliance.

This force is none other than the "Chamberlain Cabinet!"

It seems that the tone of criticizing the "Chamberlain Cabinet" has been too high and too frequent this year. As a result, some well-meaning people are gradually beginning to doubt whether these criticisms are credible, and whether the critics themselves have ulterior motives. In fact, judging from the actual evolution of the situation, any observer with some insight here agrees that the force criticizing the "Chamberlain Cabinet" has only been too weak and insufficient over the past year, and has not been excessive in the slightest. The British-French-Soviet alliance, which has been in progress for several months without any concrete results, is the most appropriate example.

It may be hard for some people to believe, but the ironclad and ruthless fact is that as of this writing, July 14, 1939, Prime Minister Chamberlain is still stubbornly adhering to his so-called "appeasement" policy and refuses to admit any mistakes. In recent days, even some people in Britain who are known as "die-hards" have recognized the current crisis facing Britain and recognized that, apart from the British-French-Soviet alliance, British diplomacy has no other way out. However, when they conveyed their awakened opinions to Chamberlain, they were resolutely rejected. As a result, these awakened "die-hards" had no choice but to reach a conclusion: "The Chamberlain Cabinet is beyond redemption." Therefore, two weeks ago, these people's slogan was still to reorganize and adjust the current cabinet. Now, even their greatest hope has to be placed on the next general election, and they are moving towards overthrowing the current cabinet.

What are the excuses currently used by Chamberlain and his ilk to oppose the British-French-Soviet alliance? According to what I know here, in the past few days, the ones they have been mentioning the most are nothing more than these: (1) The future value of the Soviet Union to Britain and France in military terms is, at best, purely "defensive" and has absolutely no positive effect. Therefore, "it is really not worth haggling with Comrade Stalin any further." (2) The most we want from the future role of Soviet Russia is merely to supply military equipment to Poland. Well, the current situation is already sufficient. Why should we have to rely on the "whims" of Soviet Russia? (3) Regarding the matter of guaranteeing the independence and integrity of the Baltic Sea states, if the countries concerned themselves are unwilling to accept guarantees, then Britain "absolutely cannot automatically guarantee it." Why? Chamberlain said, "This is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We have criticized Hitler for the same reason, and we ourselves cannot naturally commit the same mistake again," and so on.

As reasons for opposing such a major event as the British-French-Soviet alliance, the fragility of these superficial excuses is obvious. Therefore, in recent days, it seems that there has been little debate in Britain with Chamberlain and his ilk from a positive standpoint. The problem now is clearly and simply placed before all the people of Britain: (1) Can the "Chamberlain Cabinet" change its course? Chamberlain has firmly answered "no" to this. Then, continuing on, (2) Can the current cabinet be reorganized to achieve the goal of changing the diplomatic course? This plan has also been fundamentally rejected by Prime Minister Chamberlain. Thus comes the third question, (3) Can a general election be held on schedule to improve the current situation?

These three consistently interlinked questions are a summary of the facts and provide a general explanation of the trend. Here, I would like to briefly describe a few concrete facts.

The core that directs current British diplomacy lies in the so-called "inner cabinet" within the British cabinet. The "inner cabinet" currently consists of four giants: Prime Minister Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Home Secretary Hoare, and Foreign Secretary Halifax. If we believe that the current British cabinet has recently given everyone some hope of a "change of course," then the origin of this glimmer of hope comes from Foreign Secretary Halifax. However, Halifax's advocacy, after reaching the alliance with Poland, the alliance with Turkey, and the guarantee to Romania and Greece, encountered a setback in negotiations with the Soviet Union. But even now, if Halifax were allowed to continue unimpeded, then, after considerable twists and turns, the British-French-Soviet alliance would probably still be established in the end. However, at this time, taking advantage of the temporary setback, Simon and Hoare ridiculed Halifax as much as possible. The one who vehemently opposed the British-Soviet rapprochement was Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. Therefore, Halifax has consistently been fighting a lonely battle in the "inner cabinet." His support comes from the majority of cabinet members and the broad British public.

It is said that Halifax is staking everything on his own position regarding his own views, using his resignation as a last resort. In other words, if his views cannot be realized, then he intends to resign from his position as Foreign Secretary. But judging from the current atmosphere in the British so-called "inner cabinet," it is extremely difficult for his views to be realized smoothly. Perhaps the most that can be achieved is to prevent Chamberlain's "appeasement" policy from being repeated, which would already be very good.

From the beginning of April to the end of June, after nearly three months of Halifax fighting a lonely battle in the cabinet, everyone knows that it is highly unlikely that the current cabinet will fundamentally change its course. Thus, around the last ten days of June, a wave of calls for reorganizing the current cabinet suddenly surged in Britain. The initial proposal was for Churchill, Eden, and former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper to join the cabinet at the same time. Later, as a preliminary arrangement, Halifax arranged a meeting between Eden and Chamberlain. At that time, Eden had just returned from a trip to France, and his opinions were also filled with the opinions of French leaders regarding the British-French-Soviet alliance. The result of this meeting was probably not very good, because since then, the calls for Eden to join the cabinet have suddenly subsided.

In this way, up until about two weeks ago, a movement to concentrate support for Churchill's entry into the cabinet suddenly erupted.

It can be said that the strength of this pro-Churchill movement was unprecedentedly concentrated and vigorous. Apart from the broad British public, almost all British newspapers and opinion organizations were making loud appeals. Needless to say, Halifax, even Eden and Cooper, who themselves had hopes of joining the cabinet, temporarily abandoned their efforts in their own political careers and openly stood up, voicing their support for Churchill's entry into the cabinet. The majority of members of Parliament stood on Churchill's side. Even Lady Astor, the hostess of the "Cliveden Set," stood up for the first time "in history" to support inviting Churchill to join the cabinet. In all of these aspects, the public opinion of both the United States and France was also mobilized. Churchill's name was echoing everywhere: in movie theaters, in advertisements, on the radio, and in Parliament.

But what is the result of this movement after two weeks? Just two days ago, when someone suggested to Chamberlain that Churchill should replace Stanhope as First Lord of the Admiralty, Chamberlain immediately rejected it.

"Why?" It is said that Chamberlain retorted angrily, "I will never commit suicide and end my personal political life by inviting him to come and foment a cabinet overthrow movement."

Metaphorically speaking, the movement to support Churchill's entry into the cabinet is currently surging like a raging torrent, while the "Chamberlain Cabinet" stands like a lonely reef, resisting the impact from all directions in the whirlpool of the giant waves.

However, the lessons of the past two weeks have finally led the general public in Britain to a conclusion that the only salvation in the future lies in a large-scale movement to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, they have placed their hopes on the next general election.

Therefore, Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz recently said to many people in one place, "During Prime Minister Chamberlain's tenure, it is feared that the British-Soviet alliance will be very difficult to establish quickly, and will only be delayed like this." Thinking about it, there is a lot of truth in that.

The remaining question is whether the British general election in November of this year will be held on schedule.

According to the current situation, the general election is probably planned to be held on schedule. Both the ruling and opposition parties are making preparations for the general election. However, there is still a danger here, which is that if Chamberlain believes that holding it at that time would be unfavorable (he himself had already planned to retire; the problem lies with his ilk). Then, it is also hard to say whether there might be a temporary postponement. In that case, the British movement to overthrow the cabinet would truly need to make even greater efforts.

### Why Does Love Become Dark and Painful?

Everyone knows that sexual love between men and women is full of infinite light and unparalleled joy. However, if physical health is impaired, leading to defects in love, then this light and joy immediately turn into darkness and pain. In particular, for men, the strength or weakness of their bodies almost determines their happiness or suffering in the conduct of love, and even the joy and sorrow of their wives are invariably affected by the husband's physical strength.

To measure one's own physical strength, one only needs to see if reproductive function is healthy, and whether there are any signs of local weakness. In addition, if one feels soreness in the joints and fatigue throughout the body after sexual activity, which does not recover until the next day, these are clear signs of physical weakness.

A clever, lively, and affectionate young woman, unfortunately married to such a husband, because she cannot obtain the joy of love, harbors deep dissatisfaction with her husband. The love between the two gradually becomes cold, until it eventually ruptures. In court, we often hear such complaints of divorce, and this is not a fictitious story by the author.

If the husband's weakness continues unabated, they must actively study it to see if there is hope of a cure. All methods that can promote health must be followed one by one, such as short-term abstinence, careful diet, attention to exercise, and avoidance of overwork. Then, apply targeted therapy, and they may not immediately regain their health.

There are many causes of weakness, the most common being seminal emission and spermatorrhea, which greatly damage the youth gland that governs sexual power. However, in order to make this youth gland flourish again and thoroughly treat the above-mentioned conditions, one should actively take the testicular endocrine agent for men, "Butikeong," which is the best of endocrine agents. It can enhance overall nutrition, revitalize weakened energy, promote development, nourish the brain, and nourish the kidneys. The medicinal effect begins in one hour, and generates sperm and nourishes the kidneys in 24 hours, so there is no fear of disappointment after taking it. Although reproductive function is a duty that couples should fulfill, if it is indulged in excessively, it will be harmful rather than beneficial. Excessive sexual desire can weaken a man's energy and also exhaust women. Therefore, for those who indulge in licentiousness, the activity of their functions must also decline. To prevent premature aging, supplementing with "Butikeong" is quite effective. The female "Butikeong" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility.

Modern Medicine

### Remedy for Mental Fatigue

— By American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Mental fatigue is most easily felt in the summer heat. Originally, a person’s spirit, if the work is not excessively overburdening, can always maintain a normal state. However, the work of ordinary people exceeds their original working hours, and they do not rest; then, a kind of fatigue toxin easily develops in their bodies, and they feel very tired. This is the cause of fatigue.

However, this is the situation for ordinary people. Many people with extraordinary endowments have much stronger endurance than ordinary people, and conversely, people with weak physiques are easily tired even if they do not do excessive work.

For people who are easily mentally fatigued, their nerves must also be very easily weakened, causing headaches, aversion to things, and extreme dislike of work. They are highly sensitive, so they are also prone to pessimism. Such patients cannot taste the true pleasures of life, and their careers cannot achieve anything. Patients feel even worse in the summer, because in the summer, the appetite of such delicate bodies is also weakened, so nutrition becomes even more inadequate, and the body feels even more unsupported.

To remedy this mental fatigue, mental distraction, and inability to concentrate, the only thing to do is to take German “Bu Ti Kang”. This agent is made from youthful glands as raw material under purple light electricity using scientific methods, so it does not lose the original fresh and lively youthful vitality. After taking it, it can invigorate the spirit and promote appetite, and it can help the development of youthful glands, enhance brain power, concentrate thinking power, and memory. Taking it in summer makes the body tireless, increases work efficiency, and clears the head and eyes. As for sexual neurasthenia, masturbation, excessive sexual activity, leading to impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, etc., “Bu Ti Kang” has even more extraordinary and saintly effects. Therefore, doctors in various countries have an excellent clinical impression of “Bu Ti Kang”.

### Latest Holy Medicine for Treating Lung Diseases

— By Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

There are many treatments for lung diseases, but there has never been a specific medicine that can cure them completely. Since ancient times, countless unfortunate lung disease patients have been sacrificed under the phrase "no specific medicine." Recently, with the development of science, medicine has made rapid progress, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made significant progress. The medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" was invented under the impetus of science. This agent has proven to be effective in a short period of time for lung diseases in various stages, and it can gradually reduce the hollow parts of the lungs until they are as flat as ever. Therefore, "Bu Fei Na Er" is considered the best internal medicine for lung diseases. This is truly not an exaggeration. For various coughs before consumption develops, taking "Bu Fei Na Er" can suppress coughs and stop coughing within three hours.

### Spermatorrhea Cured Case: The Evil Consequences Caused by Pornographic Books and Pictures

— By German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

The patient, Ju Ming, is 24 years old, a local resident. (Self-reported) — When he was developing at the age of sixteen, his feelings gradually opened up, and he collected countless pornographic books and pictures, reading them morning and night, even to the point of not thinking about eating or drinking. Furthermore, he was seduced by bad friends, and masturbation began. When he first committed masturbation, he only knew the momentary pleasure, but he did not expect that it would become a habit. He committed it every night. Soon, he felt distracted, and his dreams of intercourse increased. After three years, he suddenly felt that his face was thin and his spirit was insufficient. At that time, he had a little knowledge and knew that it would endanger his life, so he was horrified and abstained. However, spermatorrhea occurred frequently. At first, he only had four or five dream emissions per month, but later it became spermatorrhea, and eventually it became one emission per day, and his body became terribly thin, his memory became weak, he suffered from insomnia and dizziness, he was drowsy all day, his back ached, and he suffered all kinds of pain, and his development was thus hindered, and his sexual organs became unusually small. Because his wedding date was approaching, he was extremely anxious and requested immediate treatment. (Current symptoms) — His spermatic duct is loose, his sexual nerves are weak, and his reproductive glands are irreparably damaged. (Treatment method) — First, he was given “Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Pills”, and then male and female "Bu Ti Kang" to consolidate the spermatic duct and replenish the losses. At the same time, electrotherapy was applied to restore the sexual nerves to a normal state. After two months of treatment, spermatorrhea disappeared, his body recovered, and his development was also sufficient.

New Words on Gonorrhea

### The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road Intersection

Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with lightning speed, then the gonococci that have not yet gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if these bacteria are not eliminated at this time, all the pathological changes will arise from this. Generally, gonococci in the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal period of gonorrhea. When it enters the acute phase from the prodromal phase, the gonococci are no longer limited to the anterior urethra but also cross into the posterior urethra. All the symptoms are even more numerous, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal stage. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eradicate is that the anterior urethra has no complicated structure physiologically. Therefore, it is very easy to treat. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not yet invaded the urinary system, internal reproductive system, and blood circulation system, a radical cure is still not very difficult. However, if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is tantamount to indicating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. Its treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of the above are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only treatment is to take the special medicine for gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong," in order to have the hope of eradication. Because if the gonococci spread from the anterior urethra to the three major systems, the scope of the gonococci is wide, and it is absolutely impossible to complete the task of driving away the gonococci with a local operation of one branch and one section. I further assist with German static electricity therapy, so that the bactericidal power of "Ke Lin Nong" can be fully exerted. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 patients will be seen daily. Each number costs only five dimes and includes a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.

### The Exchange Stabilization Fund Will Not Be Maintained, and Foreign Exchange Will Be Unavailable; Maintaining the Exchange Market Does Not Benefit the Chinese; Yesterday, HSBC Further Reduced Supply

The Shanghai foreign exchange black market, due to rampant speculation and manipulation by speculators, caused prices to plummet. After the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and HSBC made every effort to supply it, it gradually stabilized. Yesterday morning, HSBC posted its prices as before, that is, British currency at four pence and American currency at seven yuan and seventy-five cents. However, it was rumored in the market that the Exchange Stabilization Fund would no longer maintain the Shanghai black market and would allow it to take its natural course. Therefore, the black market foreign exchange shrank again, but because speculators exited after profiting, the shrinkage was not very severe. The actual market price was British currency at four pence and twenty-five cents and American currency at eight yuan and twenty-five cents. It was also heard that the British HSBC Bank, in addition to those with legitimate needs in various industries, would not allow supply yesterday morning. As for the government's foreign exchange for non-occupied areas, it will still be fully maintained. For example, for the import of necessities, one can apply to the Central Bank for purchasing statutory foreign exchange. The statutory foreign exchange market price announced by the Central Bank has always been the same and has not changed. Because maintaining the Shanghai black market foreign exchange does not benefit Chinese merchants and people at all, and only helps the Japanese maintain their financial life.

Securities Gray Market Rises Again Yesterday Morning

Securities in the gray market unified various bonds, because the banking sector confirmed that the principal and interest due at the end of July were discounted and borrowed by the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture. Therefore, the price rose again. Yesterday morning's closing prices were: Type A, 52 yuan, up 3 dimes; Type B, 43 yuan and 45 cents, up 1 dime and 5 cents; Type C, 42 yuan and 35 cents, up 3 dimes and 5 cents; Type D, 41 yuan and 6 dimes, up 6 dimes; Type E, 41 yuan and 9 dimes, up 3 dimes and 5 cents.

Gold Rises Slightly, Discount Unchanged

The gold gray market meeting place opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The morning closing price was 3,760 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 3,795 yuan, which was 125 yuan higher than the previous evening's closing price. The price posted by the silver shops was 380 yuan, which was 10 yuan higher than the price posted the previous day. As for the exchange discount, it was 230 yuan yesterday, which was the same as the previous day. The businesses engaged in this discount business were generally small money shops, but the member banks and shops of the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association did not engage in exchange discounts.

### Wenzhou and Fuzhou Bombed Again

Claiming to Implement Military Actions, Losses Were Significant but Had No Impact

According to information obtained from the shipping industry: (1) On the morning of the 25th, at about 9:00 AM, six Japanese aircraft invaded Wenzhou to drop bombs, and bombed Leqing and other places. The Chinese side suffered minimal losses. At the same time, three Japanese aircraft scouted Zhenhai, but did not drop bombs. (2) On the 14th, at 2:00 PM, three Japanese aircraft dropped six bombs in Fuzhou, and dropped seven or eight bombs in Changmen and other places. The losses are unknown.

### Money Shops Apply for Exchange Allocations in Succession

Can Be Completed in Two Days

The new exchange allocation of 25 million yuan for each commercial bank, the total amount of assumed chips, was completely allocated by the Executive Committee of the Banking Association according to the amount of funds needed by each bank in its daily business. It is heard that collateral does not have to be provided in advance at present. When the new exchange allocation ticket is used, collateral must be provided according to the face value of the ticket. Regarding the assumed exchange allocation chip amount of 10 million yuan for money shops, the Money Industry Association has notified the 41 member shops in the north and south of the city on the 24th to declare the amount of funds they need to receive for allocation. Each shop has complied and reported to the association starting yesterday. The total number has not yet been counted. The member shops that have not reported will continue to handle the procedures today.

### Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains Is Exempt from Tax Across the Board

Implemented in Western Zhejiang, One Tax for Each Item

The Customs Regulations on Transshipment Tax stipulate that the tax-exempt items among miscellaneous grains and their products are rice, wheat, and wheat. From now on, bran, wheat, sorghum, corn, millet, soybean cake, cottonseed cake, peanut cake, rapeseed cake, other seed cakes, unnamed miscellaneous grain flour, etc., from No. 45 to No. 54, will all be allowed to be exempt from tax to show consideration. All customs offices have been ordered to comply. In addition, the Western Zhejiang Tax Bureau stipulates that only one type of special consumption tax is levied in the counties in the war zone, including liquor, local yellow wine, local tobacco leaves, local silk, sugar, cigarettes, table salt, matches, kerosene, etc. All other taxes originally levied in other counties will be abolished. Currently, taxation has begun in Yuhang, Fuyang North Bank, Wukang, Deqing, Wuxing, Hangzhou City County, Haiyan, Haining, Jiaxing, and other counties, and has been quite effective. Because there is only one tax on each item, it will not be taxed repeatedly after passing through the counties in the war zone, which is said to be convenient.

### Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Protests the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; The Insults Suffered by Tianjin Are No Less Than Being Recognized; British Prestige and Interests Are Hit

Reuters, London, 25th. The China Association here recently received a telegram from the Shanghai Branch and the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, protesting the initial Anglo-Japanese Agreement, stating: "In our view, the result of this agreement will see Britain abandon its rights and obligations in China, which is regrettable. The various insults suffered by British expatriates in Tianjin, which Prime Minister Chamberlain deemed unbearable, have also been recognized. Moreover, if this agreement is not clearly defined and restricted, it is tantamount to granting broad rights to the Japanese military authorities, allowing them to interpret it at will and subjecting Britons to their control now and in the future. In short, we believe that this agreement is a sign of Britain abandoning its duties, obligations, and legal status in China. As a result, Britain's honor, prestige, and its interests in China will be hit."

### Business Trends After the Coastal Areas Are Blockaded

British Shipping Companies Are Shifting Their Focus to Southeast Asia

After the war, national ships on the Northern Shipping Line were forced to suspend operations, and British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships were repeatedly obstructed, only barely maintaining the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Tianjin route. However, Japanese Nisshin, Dairen, Yamashita, Osaka Shosen, and International companies have now made every effort to expand and monopolize the shipping industry in North China. In addition, they have acquired the Zhengji Company's ships and leased Chinese ships exclusively for the North China routes.

On the Southeast Asian route, Japanese warships, under the pretext of military operations, attempted to blockade the ports of Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua, Sandu'ao, and Shacheng, and arbitrarily detained and inspected foreign ships along the coast, hindering navigation. As a result, those who barely sailed saw a sharp decrease in passengers and cargo, and their business declined. The ports of Shantou, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou are important lifelines for British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson's regular voyages. Now, on the surface, the ships are still docked in Shantou, but in reality, they have all stopped importing. As for Quanzhou, although British ships still send ships to sail, there is only one flight every week or within a week. Xiamen is already an occupied area, and freight and passenger transport are extremely scarce. British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson and other companies, in addition to barely maintaining the main shipping lines in North and South China, have mostly changed to the South China Sea routes such as Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, and Lolo. Taking Guangzhou Bay as an example, in addition to the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships, there are Chen Ping Pacific, represented by He Fa Cheng; Haicheng, represented by De Jishi; Changan, represented by Changan; Yongcheng, Yonghe, and Yonghua, represented by Da You; Dabaoshi, represented by Shunchang; and Liantong Chaozhou, represented by Jieshun. On average, there are at least two ships daily traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay. As for the ships sailing to Haiphong, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have the most. The Siam line, which was newly opened by Taikoo Company, is a direct flight from Shanghai to Bangkok in Siam.

Sailing Ship Rescued After Being Hit by a Hurricane Arrives in Shanghai

Tong Chunxun, the compradore of the Swedish Ruifeng Foreign Firm's Xin Anli ship, after being released by the Japanese, took a sailing ship from Dinghai to Shanghai on the 17th. On the 19th, it encountered a windstorm, and more than 30 people on the ship disappeared. For many days, everyone thought it had capsized and sunk to the bottom of the sea, and there was no hope of survival. Unexpectedly, the sailing ship suddenly arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 PM on the 25th. The sailors said that after being hit by the hurricane, they lost their driving ability and drifted to Xiaoyangshan. The tailwind brought them to Xinyangshan, and the wind weakened slightly before they were able to land. It was not until the 23rd that the Xin Anli ship, which had been sent to find them, came to Shanghai from there. All 30-plus people on the ship were able to celebrate their rebirth.

### Run on Currency Subsides, Value of Legal Tender Increases; Government's Full Maintenance Has Achieved Obvious Results; Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan Banknotes Are Mostly Remitted to the Mainland

After the Ministry of Finance decided to fully maintain the value of legal tender, sufficient preparations were also made for the legal tender in the occupied areas. The policy of issuing legal tender is cautious, and the cash reserve has always been above 60 percent. After the regulations for the acceptance and exchange of Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan local banknotes were established, the run on currency in Shanghai has subsided, and remittances to the mainland have surged. At the same time, banks are also trying to transfer funds to the mainland. The details are as follows:

Run on Currency Completely Subsides

After banks and shops in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan place names, holders of banknotes flocked to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to request exchange. After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications stipulated acceptance and exchange methods, those holding Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan banknotes all changed to requesting remittances to the mainland from the banks. The banks did not charge any remittance fees for remittances. As a result, yesterday, the number of people requesting remittances to the mainland from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications surged. Banknotes with place names other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan are still commonly used in the market at full value. Therefore, the run on currency has completely subsided, market rumors have disappeared, and people's hearts are at peace.

Encourage the Transfer of Funds to the Mainland

Shanghai is facing the risk of oversupply due to the concentration of funds. Improper speculative business operations have occurred in the market, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, buying and selling of foreign currencies, gold, and stocks, as well as hoarding of various commodities and renting and building of real estate and houses. To prevent speculation, prevent soaring prices, and affect people's livelihood, banks are strictly handling loans secured by goods, etc., and are trying to transfer surplus funds to the mainland to help the government develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, in line with the wartime financial policy. In addition, people are encouraged to remit funds to the mainland, and no remittance fees are charged.

Deposits in Banks and Shops Have Increased

Banks and money shops in Shanghai had a deposit run in early last month. After the Ministry of Finance's restriction by telegram, it subsided. Recently, the financial market has stabilized, and the organization of banks and money shops has become more sound. As a result, depositors have redeposited the money they had previously withdrawn into the banks and shops. Therefore, the new deposits in the banks and shops have increased. The public has a deep understanding of the government's measures to stabilize finance, and depositors are unwilling to withdraw because the money deposited in the banks and shops earns interest, at least 4 percent for current accounts.

### Japanese Troops Land on Nanri Island Outside Xinghua Port, Unsuccessfully

On the morning of the 25th, three Japanese warships arrived at Nanri Island outside Xinghua Port. They first lowered speedboats and patrolled. At about 9:00 AM, they fired artillery shells at the shore. More than 100 Japanese troops, riding speedboats, attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison was prepared and responded calmly. The Japanese troops failed to succeed. There are still seven or eight Japanese warships off the mouth of the Minjiang River, but there have been no other movements.

### Selling Rice Above the Price Limit, Authorities Send Police to Arrest

Jiuda Rice Shop Sold Rice Above the Limit Price in the Market Yesterday; Shop Owner Wang Youren Was Detained by the French Municipal Council

The Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department issued a message stating that recently there have been rumors in the market that the Public Works Department will relax the price limit on domestic rice. This statement is absolutely untrue. The authorities of the two concessions strictly enforce the stipulated prices, that is, the highest quality white rice should not exceed 20 yuan per stone on average, and the highest quality Rongxian rice should not exceed 16 yuan per stone. Yesterday (the 26th) morning, Jiuda Rice Shop, located at No. 780 Julai Road, was selling domestic rice in the Sima Road rice market for 22 yuan per stone. The Chinese and Western police officers stationed in the market noticed it and reported the facts to their superiors. The shop owner and manager of the rice shop, Wang Youren, has now been detained by the French Municipal Council. At the same time, the council sent police officers to the rice shop to monitor the rice sales and ordered the highest quality white rice in stock to be sold below the limit price of 20 yuan.

Rice Industry Reports to the Concession Authorities

Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, Committee Members of the Soybean Rice Industry Association, Fu Qian Geng, Director of the Market Management Committee, Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Shop Industry Association, and four others went to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to meet with Deputy Director He De Kui to report on the market transaction situation, the ban on rice in various places, and the amount of Shanghai Concession reserves, and requested the Concession authorities to make every effort to dredge the source to maintain the overall food supply in Shanghai. They left at about 4:00 PM. It is heard that the Concession authorities are determined to maintain the food supply, so there is no need to worry about the future.

Trying to Negotiate the Ban on Transportation in Various Places

Yesterday, the trading situation in the rice market was still chaotic. Goods such as white japonica, early japonica, thin rice, and premium rice were not sampled, only four types of white yuan, winter frost, sheep tip, and brown tip had transactions, totaling only five or six thousand bags. The prices of various types of rice have all risen to the top, and there have been secret transactions. After the manager of Jiuda Rice Shop was arrested by the French police for exceeding the price limit, speculators in the market were slightly wary. It is expected that the rice price may stabilize slightly starting this morning. Furthermore, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with a leader of the rice industry yesterday, who said that Wuhu, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places have successively banned rice from leaving the country, so that the rice from the above-mentioned places has disappeared from Shanghai. However, rice from the Songjiang area can still be transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, 1,000 bags arrived. Negotiations are currently underway in the banned areas.

Market Announcement: Strictly Comply with the Price Limit

The Soybean Rice Market Management Committee issued Announcement No. 77 in the market, stating that the authorities of the Special Zone restricted rice prices, and the association had long ago issued a notice to comply. Now, the previous case is reiterated, and it is resolved that the fresh white japonica without bags or over a Dou should not exceed 19 yuan and 70 cents per stone, and the shrinkage should be 19 yuan and 50 cents. The remaining goods should be valued separately. It is hoped that everyone will respect and comply. If anyone dares to violate it, they will be responsible for any accidents that occur. The association is not responsible for any responsibility. I hereby announce it again, and I hope that all merchants and customers will be informed.

### Searching for Missing Civil Ship

American Richard Halliburton departed from Shanghai on a Chinese civil ship to San Francisco in April of this year and has been missing ever since. The American authorities sent five aircraft to search continuously, but found no clues. If anyone knows any information about Halliburton, whether it is a short film, text, or photograph, whether it is in Chinese or English, please send it to the address below. The address of the person sending the letter is Louis S. Buckingham, 233 West 67th Street, New York City, U.S.A.

### After the Terrorist Attack, Newspaper Security Is Increased; French Police Guard Near Da Mei; The Editorial Department of Zhong Mei Is Converted into a Bomb Shelter

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, in order to prevent the recurrence of the terrorist atrocities that occurred on Saturday and Sunday, the French Concession authorities ordered workers to quickly build a permanent guardhouse on the empty space at the corner of Rue des Soeurs and Avenue Edward VII this morning (the 26th). Barbed wire fences were also placed around the side door and back door of the Da Mei Evening News building. The Public Concession Police Department also increased the number of patrol officers in front of the Saturday and Sunday shooting incident at the Times Building.

Stopping cars, rickshaws, and handcarts along the road is not allowed. The French Concession Police Department also dispatched two armored vehicles to stop in front of the Da Mei Evening News building and across the road from the Times Building. Zhong Mei Daily and other

Zhong Mei Daily has started to convert its workshop and editorial office into an "absolute bomb shelter" yesterday as a preventive measure against terrorist attacks. When completed, the cement walls around the building will be increased, the windows will be fitted with steel plates, and an alarm bell will be installed to directly contact the Central Police Station.

### Japanese Side Guarantees American Missionary in Nanchang

The Continental News reported that a Lieutenant Colonel, a liaison officer of the Japanese army in Shanghai, visited Mr. Gauss, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, at the U.S. Consulate General at 11:00 AM yesterday morning (the 25th) to briefly discuss the reported detention of American missionary Hollen in Nanchang. He left close to noon. After the discussion, no official announcement was issued, but it was heard that the lieutenant colonel had guaranteed to Gauss that Hollen was now living peacefully in the Nanchang Hospital and discussed sending an American to Nanchang to investigate the matter, but no definitive conclusion was reached. When the reporter asked Gauss last night, he only admitted that a Japanese military officer and a member of the consulate staff had visited Hollen for talks yesterday morning and was unwilling to say anything else.

### Broadway Mansion: Newly Opened Magnificent Casino; Gamblers are Wealthy Puppet Chinese; Operated by Beauties and White Russian Jews

The Continental Daily reports that the skyscraper Broadway Mansion, located on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, was purchased by Chinese puppets and Japanese businessmen at the beginning of this year. It is now heard that a magnificent casino has been newly opened on the 18th floor of the building, making all the gambling dens established after the Japanese army occupied the city in November of the year before last pale in comparison. Yesterday (the 25th), the reporter inquired of a certain employee of Broadway Mansion, who claimed that he was unaware of the existence of a casino on the 18th floor of the building, only admitting that a certain "General Association" had entrusted a famous lawyer here to rent several rooms. He was unwilling to disclose the name of the lawyer, nor did he know the name or activities of the General Association. According to news received by the Continental Daily several days ago, which was confirmed by reliable sources yesterday, the General Association officially opened last Friday. Its "activities" are not "secret." Furthermore, it is heard that the gambling in this money-burning den includes roulette, pai gow, and sic bo, etc. Those who frequent it are mostly people who live in Broadway Mansion, who have nothing to do after 1 AM, because at that time, traffic across the Suzhou Creek bridge to Hongkou is cut off, so they gamble to pass the time. It is heard that most of the gamblers are wealthy puppet Chinese. According to yesterday's news, among the operators of the General Association, there is one American and several wealthy White Russian Jews, one of whom is a jeweler.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line: Increase in Shipping Vessels

Japanese Soldiers Board Vessels for Inspection; No Incidents Occurred

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was interrupted after the Zhenhai estuary blockade, with the Taiping Lun deliberately sunk at the end of last month. This caused great inconvenience for Ningbo and Shaoxing natives in Shanghai. The German merchant Lihuo Yangxing's Moufu Lun applied to the authorities for permission to continue sailing. However, due to the blockage of the Zhenhai estuary waterway, it could not enter or exit, and had to anchor outside the blockade line to load and unload goods and transport passengers, using barges instead. This caused delays in anchoring outside the Zhenhai estuary, making it inconvenient for passengers to embark and disembark and for goods to be loaded and unloaded. However, the number of passengers remains extremely crowded, and tickets are difficult to purchase due to restrictions. Recently, the authorities have relaxed the restrictions slightly, so the number of passengers traveling back and forth has increased several times.

Hanabao Quickly Sails to Ningbo

The Sino-Italian Company's Deping Lun and the Moufu Lun have resumed sailing one after another. The German Far East Company's Hanabao Lun, which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, had both routes banned early on. Now, it has also applied for permission to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and departed for Ningbo on Saturday morning of the previous week at the same time as the Deping. According to the company, the Hanabao Lun is expected to return to Shanghai from the Zhenhai estuary this morning and may be able to enter the port tonight. It is now learned that the Italian merchant Yihua Yangxing's Baoli Lun, which also sailed on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, has been docked in Shanghai for a long time since the ban. It has now been granted permission by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Zhenhai on the morning of the 28th (Friday) at the same time as the Moufu Lun. The Baoli Lun passenger ticket sales office is located at 309 Beijing Road, and cargo loading should be arranged at 163 Guangdong Road.

Two Vessels Suddenly Inspected

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry from the shipping industry, at 4 PM on the 24th, a Japanese warship suddenly sent soldiers to board the Sino-Italian Deping Lun and the Far East Hanabao Lun, which were anchored at Qiliyu outside the Haikou, for inspection. The inspection lasted for twenty minutes before they withdrew.

Shenfu Attempts Sailing to Shacheng

The British merchant Yilong Yangxing has recently obtained the Japanese side's consent to resume the Shanghai-Wenzhou route and plans to send the Shenfu Lun directly to Shacheng tomorrow. It is not yet certain whether the voyage will be obstructed by Japanese warships, so it must wait until the return of this test voyage to Shanghai before it can be clear whether passage is possible. Therefore, the official sailing schedule will be determined after the test voyage.

Lude Opens Shanghai-Dinghai Line

The Shanghai-Dinghai shipping line has been restored by Japanese vessels, with the Hainan Daye and other vessels sailing one after another. It is now learned that the German merchant Delin Yangxing has dispatched the Lude Lun, scheduled to join the Shanghai-Dinghai-Daishan line on August 1st. However, there is almost no passenger or cargo transportation between Shanghai and Dinghai.

### Putuo Falls

Chinese Forces Retreat to the Hills; Japanese Warships Still Anchored Offshore

At dawn the other day, two Japanese warships suddenly sailed to the waters off the Western Boat (Xi Fang Chuan) in front of Putuo Island, one of the famous scenic spots, and anchored. Subsequently, four speedboats were lowered, carrying more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, who swarmed ashore at Duangu Daitou. They first strafed the mountains and forests with machine guns before slowly searching the entire island. They also shot and killed a farmer near the Fanyin Cave on the back mountain. The local self-defense forces, due to their isolated and outnumbered position, avoided unnecessary sacrifices and retreated to the hills, waiting for an opportunity to attack. After searching the entire mountain in groups, the Japanese soldiers stationed themselves at the Qian Shan Puji Temple (also known as the Former Temple) and Baoben Hall that evening. Except for a portion who returned to the warships the next morning, more than seventy soldiers are still stationed there. A double-funneled Japanese cruiser and a transport ship are still anchored in the waters off the mountain.

### Huzhou Maru Small Vessel Bombed and Sunk

Intercepted by Chinese Regular Army Near Xindai

There is one round trip per day. The Shanghai wharf is located at

the Sichuan Road Bridge. On the 23rd of this month, the Huzhou No. 1 was loaded with goods and returned to Shanghai. On the evening of the same day, when passing near Xindai, it suddenly encountered the 45th Brigade of the Chinese Regular Army's mobile unit, which was marching through. They ordered the vessel to stop and searched it, finding

certain items related to military affairs. They summoned the six crew members, poured kerosene on the Huzhou Maru No. 1, and threw hand grenades, causing an explosion and fire, and it sank in an instant. One of the six arrested persons was released yesterday, but the whereabouts of the other five employees are still unknown. After receiving a report from the released crew member, the Pinghu Company not only ordered the Huzhou Maru No. 2 to stop direct voyages to Pinghu, temporarily stopping at Zhujing, but also tried to rescue the detained five persons by contacting the Chinese military authorities in that area.

### Detained Public Works Department Employees Have Been Released

Detained for Two Days; Treatment Extremely Poor

According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Englishman Ross, German Bayerle, Russian Klohi, and more than one hundred Chinese workers, who were detained by the "Great Way Municipal Government" for two days, were released and returned to Shanghai this afternoon (the 26th). According to Ross, who spoke to reporters at 1 PM, the food was sufficient, and the Public Works Department sent beer and other items, as well as beds. However, the bedding was dirty. He spent the first night sitting and waiting for dawn, and last night he used rice bags as pillows, while the Chinese workers slept on the stone ground. After Ross and others were released, they first went to the Dixiwei Road Police Station and then returned quickly. It is reported that they were carrying garbage to Zhabei at the request of the Japanese Marines on Monday afternoon to fill low-lying areas, and were detained by personnel from the "Great Way," whose "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan attempted to demand fees from the Shanghai Municipal Council for dumping garbage on both sides of the downstream of the Huangpu River for the past two years, at 10,000 yuan per month, hence the illegal detention of Ross and others.

### Robbery of Female Fortune Teller Case: Involves Another Robbery Case; Former Dance Hall Girl Had a Gold Ring Robbed; Three Defendants in Both Cases Sentenced Separately

The female fortune teller Jiang Tianzhen, who had a sign hanging on the fifth floor of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, once worked as a dance hall girl. She was short and lively. On the night of the 8th of last month, she was suddenly summoned to room 316 of the Far East Hotel, and under the pretext of fortune telling, a diamond ring worth more than 700 yuan, a gold watch, and cash were robbed. She reported to the police station. Hua Detective Ding Huaguo and Detective Yin Zhanqing of the Xinzha Police Station arrested the suspects Sun Wenzhong, Yao Guisheng, Xu Gengsheng, and Cui Yucheng, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. During a subsequent investigation, the police station found a diamond ring (pledged for 460 yuan) at the Hongxingxiang Jewelry Store at 527 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. It was also found that the defendant Sun Wenzhong, together with Xu Azhang and Ma Pi Jinbao, who are still at large, hid a handgun and went to the Xuangong Dance Hall on Edward Road on the night of June 4th of this year. Sun Wenzhong acted as a dance partner and, seeing that the dance hall girl Pan Huizhen (who lived at 28 Sande Lane, Longmen Road) was wearing a gold ring, danced with her and spent 10 yuan to buy a dance ticket. He took Pan to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, danced for a short while, and then went to the Lido Dance Hall. However, when they arrived near Aivenyi Road and Dahua Road, it was already late at night, and the place was desolate, and the road was dark. Sun and the other two showed their handguns, threatening and robbing Pan of two gold rings worth 90 yuan each that she was wearing on her hand. At the time, Pan did not report this matter to the police station. It was not until Sun Wenzhong was arrested that he confessed everything. Detective Ding and others went to investigate and found that it was true. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui sat on the bench of the Third Criminal Court to continue the trial. The three defendants each hired lawyers to defend them in court. The police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above circumstances, saying that the diamond ring in the Jiang Tianzhen robbery case has now been recovered, but the watch has not been found, and the two gold rings of Pan Huizhen in the other case have not been found either. Jiang Tianzhen and Pan Huizhen then complained about the robbery. Judge Liu inquired of each defendant one by one and clarified the facts. He sentenced Sun Wenzhong for continuous gang robbery to six years of imprisonment, Yao Guisheng and Xu Gengsheng were fined 50 yuan each for receiving stolen goods, and Cui Yucheng was acquitted.

### Impersonating an Official for Extortion: Translator Sentenced

Yao Tingxin (also known as Yao Tingsen), a 29-year-old Shanghai native who worked as a translator for the Public Concession Police Station and lived at 1274 Jing'an Temple Road, colluded with Yue Qiuxin, a 20-year-old youth from Guangdong, and was instigated by Xu Hao (29), a Jiaxing native and teacher at Hengmao Primary School in Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao. He led a Russian to impersonate an official from the French Municipal Council's Zhao Hui Jian, extorting 1,000 gold from the headmaster of Hengmao Primary School, Yang Guoping (a native of Shaoxing, because he built four-story shelving in the school without a license). Yang entrusted Yang Yuan to negotiate with them, promising to pay 500 yuan, paying 300 yuan in advance, and agreeing to extend the deadline for the balance by two days to be delivered to room 332 of the Central Hotel. When the deadline expired, Yao and others went to urge the payment again, and Yang only gave 50 yuan. Yang had already realized that Yao and others were falsely impersonating officials to defraud him of money and reported to the French police station, who arrested Yao, Yue, and Xu and sent them to the Second Special Court. The lawyer of the French Concession Administrative Authorities filed a public prosecution for extortion. Judge Zhang Minsheng opened a court for investigation. The plaintiff Yang Yuan filed an incidental civil suit requesting the recovery of the defrauded sum of 350 yuan. He was ordered to announce the end of the trial pending a verdict. The details have been reported in this newspaper twice. The verdict in this case was pronounced yesterday morning. Yao Tingxin, with the intention of illegally possessing for himself, intimidated others to hand over his personal property and was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Yue Qiuxin assisted in the same crime and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Xu Hao incited intimidation and fraud and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.

He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was found that Ye was also suspected of being involved in this case.

Original School Building Was Not Enough

The International Refugee Children's Middle School, which is attached to the First International Place on Masnan Road, has been established for more than two terms, and has more than 130 students.

### China Athletic Referee Association Reiterates Rectification of Sports Ethics

The secretariat of the Shanghai China Athletic Referee Association issued the following notice to the sports community regarding the resolution of the meeting of all members of the association on "Rectifying Sports Ethics":

The Referee Association has been established for more than ten years, with more than one hundred members, and its footprints are all over the provinces and cities of the country. Its unwavering common belief is to maintain the dignity of referees and to rectify sports discipline. In order to maintain this consistent policy, the association has gone through all kinds of difficulties and tasted all kinds of pain for more than ten years, and it still moves forward bravely without any complaints. Whenever we encounter an unfortunate incident, we never forget public justice because of private friendship, nor are we willing to be accommodating and seek perfection. If justice is not promoted and discipline is not rectified, we are willing to endure any sacrifice. This spirit of great impartiality and fearlessness has long been deeply imprinted in the minds of all members, and it does not start today. However, those who do not understand the true meaning of sports generally retorted with this and thought that they did not know the current affairs and criticized them. They did not know where the Tao was, and they would not look back. If public justice was not promoted, they would not hesitate to go through fire and water. What is the value of advocating sports, and what is the value of advocating this sports that runs counter to it? The hearts of the people are not as old as they used to be, and it does not start today. However, the past can be learned from, and one can be punished by one. Why are things that are not divided between public and private, and things that are not clear about right and wrong, still lingering and unwilling to go away, and they are becoming more and more serious, covering up their mistakes, and stealing bells, and there are many things that are not enough. If it is not until the network is completely gone and there is no public justice, will it be happy? This is not only a tragedy for the future of sports, but also a sigh for the world and the human heart. Secretariat of the Shanghai China Athletic Referee Association, July 26, 28th year of the Republic.

Commercial News

### Finance Although Out-of-Town Banknotes are Said to be Accepted, They Are Still Not Fully Circulating in the Market Agricultural Bank of China Place-Named Notes are Universally Accepted

This newspaper has previously reported on the difficulties faced by those holding banknotes with place names from other locations. Yesterday, various news outlets reported that the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank will continue to accept banknotes with place names from other commercial banks. However, according to investigations, most stores are still unwilling to accept them. When asked why, they replied, "If we deposit them in the bank, the bank won't accept them, so we have no choice but to refuse them." They also stated, "Newspaper reports have recently been full of deception and cannot be fully trusted." This is truly concerning because currently, all types of businesses, even those involved in speculation and manipulation, are acting on their own. For example, rice merchants are monopolizing and hoarding rice, while still claiming to maintain the food supply for the people. Similarly, after the refusal to accept banknotes with place names from North China and Hankou, they can be remitted to those locations free of charge. However, they do not consider that the holders of these banknotes are mostly residents of Shanghai. How many of them need to remit money to Tianjin, Shandong, Jinan, Qingdao, and Hankou? The majority of people holding North China and Hankou banknotes cannot exchange them and have no way to remit them. Therefore, general speculators will buy these banknotes at a greatly reduced price to profit from them. It is now heard that North China banknotes have a market rate at a certain bank, with 1,400 yuan exchangeable for 1,000 yuan in legal tender. Hankou banknotes are exchangeable at 1,200 yuan for 1,000 yuan in legal tender. In essence, North China banknotes are discounted by 40% of their face value, and Hankou banknotes are discounted by 20%. Therefore, for the sake of their business prospects, to stabilize public confidence, and to attract deposits, banks should have a proper and clear statement regarding banknotes with place names from other locations. They should no longer rely on news policies. Whether or not these banknotes are accepted should be formally announced in newspapers by the banks or the banking association, so that the public knows what to do.

Since the banknotes with place names from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou stopped circulating, citizens and shops have also been mostly refusing to accept the place-named notes of the Agricultural Bank of China. Upon inquiring with the bank, it was said that all notes with place names such as Hangzhou, Hankou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, and Lanzhou, as well as the Hubei Provincial Bank changed to the Agricultural Bank of China, have long been considered to have no place names and are therefore universally accepted as always. They can be brought to the bank at Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet for unlimited exchange at any time. Local banks and money shops also accept them uniformly. However, some shops in the market accept them, while others still refuse them. When asked, it was also because some banks do not accept them. It is said that the ten-yuan and five-yuan renamed notes of the Hubei Provincial Bank have the words "Payable in national currency 〇 yuan at the Hankou head office," so shops that fear the hassle are mostly unwilling to accept them. Even one-yuan notes are not accepted. A certain gentleman had a one-yuan Agricultural Bank of China note with the place name "Lanzhou" and could not spend it, showing how deep the public's concerns are.

### Foreign Exchange Swap Transactions Quite Active Rumors that the Stabilization Fund Will Not Support the Black Market British and American Exchange Contraction Not Yet Too Significant

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing remained unchanged. In the British and American exchange black market, due to the sudden contraction of inter-exchange rates between Britain and America, the morning opening was British stable and American soft. After the opening, due to the busy settlement of accounts by foreign firms, the willingness of British banks and HSBC to supply was extremely weak, while the demand was very good. In addition, speculators continued to short, and there were rumors in the market that the Stabilization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the foreign exchange of the occupied areas, letting it fluctuate naturally, and that HSBC had stopped supplying, etc., which led to a rather tight potential. It is estimated that the British gold once fell to 4 pence 35, and the American exchange rate once softened to 8.25 yuan. Later, because foreign banks' willingness to sell increased, the market was rather loose. At noon, British gold recovered to 4 pence 375, and the American exchange rate also recovered to 8.5 yuan. Extending to the noon closing, the situation was slightly soft again, with British gold closing at 4 pence 134375 and the American exchange rate at 8.4375 yuan. As a result, British was tight by 15625, and American was soft by 375. There were many swaps in the middle, because the current month's settlement is imminent, and many parties are bound by the tightening of silver and high discounts. If they are not settled, they have to be swapped. Therefore, the swaps in July and August are becoming increasingly widened, with the distance between July and August British gold being half a penny, and the American exchange rate differing by one yuan, with the combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) being about 12 cents. It is heard that Lever Brothers and a certain American bank, etc., because of the huge amount of legal tender use, are mostly offering discounts, and the half-day transaction is still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate market is rather soft, and the selling price has broken into the 31 yuan mark.

Swap Arbitrage 12 Cents

In the early morning, the London spot exchange contracted by 1875, the forward exchange dropped by 125, the New York silver price was stagnant, the London raw gold recovered by half a penny, the exchange rate of British against the US dollar fell by 7 cents, against Shanghai was slightly 0625, against France was still flat, the US dollar against the British pound contracted by 065, against Shanghai was unchanged, against France dropped by 0625, the central listing of various exchange rates remained the same as before, and the bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence and a half for British gold and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the previous closing, British flat and American tight was 0625, which was the reason for the same contraction of the exchange rate between Britain and the United States. After the opening, although foreign firms were short, in addition to HSBC, there were still suppliers, and the Hong Kong telegraph and Jardine Matheson also slightly came to sell, so there was a lack of change. It is estimated that foreign firms first settled in Jardine Matheson spot British gold at 4 pence and a half, and shorted a certain bank's spot US dollar at 8.75 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong telegraph and Jardine Matheson sold HSBC spot British gold at 4 pence. Then, the British Bank's Lever Brothers absorbed foreign merchants' August British gold at 4 pence. When HSBC's listing was announced, it remained unchanged. And the silver equilibrium tax announcement remained exempt. After that, although foreign telegrams were congested, foreign banks ate well, and speculators also shorts, so the market was gradually soft. It is estimated that foreign firms such as Lever Brothers and speculators absorbed foreign telegrams and a certain bank's spot US dollars from 8.5 yuan, contracting to 375. Later, British gold called more than 4 pence and 25 at the softest, and the US dollar called more than 8.25 yuan at the tightest. Afterwards, the shorting wind slightly subsided, and foreign firms such as the Eastern Bank's willingness to sell increased, so the price gradually recovered. It is estimated that the Eastern Bank's current gold offered its counterparts spot British gold at 4 pence and 34375, and then foreign banks did spot US dollars at 8.375 yuan. At that time, foreign banks needed a large amount of legal tender, so they were willing to offer swaps, so the interest rate became larger, with the monthly interest rate being 11.5 cents and 12 cents, all paid by Japan's Bank and Jardine Matheson and Chinese merchants. Near noon, a certain bank offered spot gold to speculators at 4 pence and 375 and spot US dollars at 8.5 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate bank's spot selling price had softened to 30.0625 yuan. Extending to the bank's spot selling price at noon, British gold was 4 pence and 34375, and the US dollar was 8.4375 yuan. As a result, compared to the late closing of the previous day, British tightened by 15625, American softened by 375, and Hong Kong exchange rate also contracted by 625. There is no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Telegraph Exchange Rate Up 15 Yuan

Hong Kong, 26th - Today the exchange market was calm. The British, American, and Japanese telegraph exchange rates were unchanged compared to yesterday's closing.

Yesterday's spot gold market conditions continued to rise sharply, and the pouring wind was very strong. As a result, it soared another 125 yuan, but the ups and downs in the middle were still huge, making it difficult to grasp. This situation is entirely due to the manipulation of general speculators. The overall potential throughout the day generally first rose sharply, then plummeted, and then rose again. The initial opening inherited the remaining wind of the previous day. In addition, the foreign exchange reported tight, and the public's confidence was strengthened. General non-industry buyers also came one after another. As for those holding goods, the concept of rising prices was extremely strong. Although there was profit to be made, they were still unwilling to sell to seek huge profits, so the market soared straight up. Around 10 o'clock, it reached a peak of 3,850 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange recovered, the idea of floating more out of the cage arose spontaneously. At that time, cash shops and silver shops also sold more actively. In addition, buyers did not dare to add more when prices fell back, so they turned sharply downwards. At one point, it fell to a low of 3,718 yuan. At noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange had slightly tightened again, and the buying wind was re-ignited. The noon closing had recovered to 3,760 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry continued to search harder, and securities firms also continued to advance fiercely, rising again to the 3,800 yuan mark. The evening closing was 3,795 yuan. Trading was still active, with a total of more than 1,500 taels throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry also changed a lot. As a result, the listed price was 15 yuan higher, the customs gold was still flat, and the Sino-British pure gold and other items rose again.

Spot Gold Up 125 Yuan

Since the early morning, the buying interest for each bar (ten taels) was quite strong. At 9:35, the market opened 30 yuan higher. Securities firms entered silver shop firms 50 taels, price 3,700 yuan. After the opening, the buying interest became stronger, and securities firms and money exchange firms competed to advance fiercely without stopping. In addition, the foreign exchange tightened, causing sellers to increase their prices even more. In an instant, it soared 70 yuan. Securities firms entered money exchange firms 50 taels, price 3,770 yuan. Just after a slight recovery, silver shop firms sold to gold shops 20 taels, price 3,750 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange tightened even more, so the wealthy entrusted money exchange firms and others to purchase on their behalf. The intensity of the rise was like a galloping horse, soaring another 100 yuan. Gold shops entered silver shop firms 50 taels, price 3,850 yuan, the highest point of the day. But after 10 o'clock, there was a sudden reaction and a sharp decline, because the foreign exchange stopped tightening and trended easier, and sellers suddenly became active. In addition, the rise was too sharp, and buyers were cautious when prices fell back, so the decline was also strong. Before long, it plummeted 132 yuan. Money exchange firms sold to gold shops 50 taels, price 3,718 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange was slightly softer, and money exchange firms came to absorb again, so it recovered 42 yuan. Money exchange firms traded 20 taels with each other, 3,760 yuan was the noon closing price. The market was strong in the afternoon. The opening was 10 yuan higher. Gold shops entered money exchange firms 50 taels, price 3,770 yuan. After that, the wealthy again entrusted securities firms and money exchange firms to absorb forcefully, and the price rose again by 30 yuan. Money exchange firms traded 50 taels with each other, price 3,800 yuan. At 3:15, money exchange firms traded another 40 taels with each other, price 3,795 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, it soared another 125 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the closing, the buyers were able to take in 3,800 yuan. The price fluctuated by 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold. The current marked gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.

Jewelry Listed Price Up 15 Yuan

At the beginning, the selling price of silver shop jewelry was still 370 yuan per tael at Datong Hang. By 9:45, it listed 5 yuan higher, and five minutes later it was 10 yuan higher. At 10 o'clock, it was another 5 yuan higher. Later, at 10:10, it fell back 5 yuan, and at 10:30 it fell back another 5 yuan. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose again by 5 yuan. As a result, it was listed 15 yuan higher. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed its listing to 385 yuan, and Xintong Hang was 383 yuan. The purchase price was not fixed.

### US Dollar Pound 95 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency, because the foreign exchange trended softer, spot gold rose sharply, and the government said it would not maintain the black market foreign exchange, the public's confidence was weak, and the market conditions were very strong. In the afternoon, spot gold rose more sharply. General economically affluent people competed to purchase British and American gold pounds, British and American gold notes, and ultimately regretted that they could not purchase them smoothly due to the scarcity in the market. The demand for Japanese gold notes was very strong, and the market conditions were firm. The evening market was 1.16 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was scarce, and they also tended to be expensive. The evening market was 9 jiao 5 fen. The association's transactions were quite active. Zhenxing sold Xiangtai 200 yuan in American gold notes, Baoxiang sold Qintai 100 yuan in American gold notes, and sold Longchang 400 yuan in American gold notes, and sold Fuhexing 3,000 francs in notes. Xiangkang sold Sentai 30 British gold pounds in notes, and Xiangtai sold Fuhexing 2,000 francs in notes. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds up 1.1 yuan, British gold notes up 1 yuan and 8 jiao, American gold pounds up 3 yuan, American gold notes up 5 jiao 8 fen, Hong Kong notes up 1 jiao 2 fen, French franc notes up 1 fen 5 li, Singapore, Dutch, Annam, and Philippine notes all up 1 jiao, Canadian notes up 4 jiao, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Recovers 10 Yuan Call Loan Rate Again at 2 Jiao

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills saw a shift during the day, fluctuating between 230 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day, recovering 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association call loan rate suddenly rose by 4 fen, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 2 jiao.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Consistently Contract

London, 25th - In the silver market, Indian and American merchants bought and sold. When the price was low, some people shorted. The situation was flat and tired, and the market was flat and stagnant after the closing. India offered to sell at the listed price. The spot exchange contracted by 1875, and the forward exchange dropped by 125. New York silver prices remained stagnant. Also, Mumbai silver reported that Indian silver conditions were tired. Spot and August both fell 9 anna, and September also fell small 10 anna. A total of 100 transactions were completed.

### On the Future of Legal Tender

Since the start of the War of Resistance, China's financial measures, such as limiting withdrawals, controlling domestic and foreign exchange, and export trade, and implementing deflationary policies in the Seven Seas, have all been to maintain the stability of foreign exchange and lay the foundation for finance. After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, tax revenue suffered greatly. Following this, the North China Reserve Bank was established, issuing banknotes and collecting foreign exchange. At that time, although Chinese foreign exchange was controlled to resist, it was still being vigorously maintained, but it was not considered that the war could not be ended in a short time. According to the domestic economic situation, it was felt that the exchange rate was far above the natural level, and there was no need to maintain it forcibly. If at that time, it had been resolutely decided to sharply reduce the exchange rate to between six and seven pence, or to obtain a solid connection and strictly control foreign exchange, if either of these two could have been achieved, it would not only have made it difficult to collect foreign exchange, but also prevented capital from escaping. Unfortunately, the authorities did not have the courage of General Joffre to retreat to the final defensive line, which is truly regrettable.

This year, the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund was established, and in fact the price of legal tender was determined to be 8 pence 25. At that time, the financial situation in Shanghai gradually stabilized. However, due to the oversupply of currency, the financial industry lent recklessly, which led to the rampant speculation and hoarding. The increase in imports of foreign goods was drastic, and the overdraft of Shanghai people was unprecedented. As a result, the need for foreign exchange increased sharply, and the fund was spent greatly. Today, foreign exchange has been tightened again and withdrawals have been restricted again. Under this situation, imports of goods will inevitably decrease sharply, goods will actually be sold, stagnation will stop, hoarding will stop, and the need for foreign exchange will be greatly reduced. In addition, deflation is far more than the eve of August 13, and capital has reached the limit of no escape. International payments may naturally gradually move towards balance, and there is no reason for foreign exchange to shrink again.

Looking at the supply and demand of the foreign exchange market in recent months, speculators have purchased a large number of forward foreign exchange. Due to the impact of the deflation of legal tender and the lack of it, speculators will sell the forward foreign exchange that is due at that time, which is the reason for the recent slight recovery of foreign exchange. Therefore, from the above objective facts, regardless of whether the Equalization Fund will maintain foreign exchange, only considering the relationship between international animal husbandry and supply and demand, it is hoped that the foreign exchange value of legal tender will not fall again recently. However, the key is to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted and to ensure the stability of legal tender. The only way to do this is to stop the supply of black market exchange, and on the one hand, to supply the normal needs of industry and commerce in accordance with the legal exchange rate. In this way, the government will show great faith to the people, and the people's belief in legal tender will deepen, and the escape of capital will be cut off without persuasion.

### Grain Evil Merchants Act Lawlessly Disregarding the People's Food Supply Rice Merchants in Production and Sales Areas Increase Prices Simultaneously Black Market Price of Fresh Japonica Rice Reaches 23 Yuan

National Rice The market situation is still chaotic and feels deserted. The newly arrived goods are priced high because after the interior heard of the soaring prices in Shanghai, the prices of brown rice also saw a sharp rise. Thick brown rice japonica even reached 18 yuan out of zero, which is in line with the Shanghai price, so it must be sold for 22-23 yuan. The producers and sellers of rice are acting together, and the owners are unwilling to sell them, and they do not show samples. At the same time, the goods in the hands of hoarders and visiting merchants, the goods that came out of customs earlier, must be fresh, and there are many who bought them at low prices. However, because of the price limit, the old goods have all been limited, and they have not shown samples. The goods owned by brokers must be sold in stores, and they have all been sold out in the past three days, resulting in no goods on the market. Because the general stores are panicked and buy goods, the stores are unusually crowded (the public should not fall into the trap of evil merchants), and they cannot find any supply. Therefore, it is rumored that there are those who directly purchase from the owners outside the market and make private black market deals, with fresh thick japonica rice reaching 23.5 yuan. All parties are familiar with this and do not see it. The evil merchants act without restraint. There were only purchases of broken tips and water-stained miscellaneous tips on the market yesterday. The number was only more than 3,700 bags, and the price opened high: broken tips 16 yuan, medium broken tips 15.7 yuan, miscellaneous tips 15.5 yuan to 15.85 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice was traded at 325 bags, price 22 yuan. As for the sources of the various roads, there are no river boats, and only 1,200-1,300 bags of early and late rice from the south port were transported by car.

Guest Indica The high-quality goods have already exceeded the price limit by more than two yuan. Because the price limit is strictly enforced, brokers and hoarders dare not show samples for sale. Therefore, there are only broken brown rice and Jue indica rice on the market. However, the local merchants are very greedy and welcome broken brown rice, so the number of transactions is still 1,600-1,700 bags. The market price is also 3-4 jiao higher depending on the quality of the goods.

Foreign Rice The price of fixed orders is getting higher and higher, but there are still no buyers for the new Saigon rice at 26 yuan, so the official selling price in yesterday's market only increased by half a yuan compared to the previous day, to 25.5 yuan. 1,300-1,400 bags were opened.

### Customer Sales Continue The Flour Market Remains Stable

The flour market continues to be active with customer sales. It is found that after the Nanyang merchants started their activities at the beginning of the week, 28,200 bags have been shipped from Xiamen. Yesterday, another 2-30,000 bags were added. After the Northern merchants tried to sell them, their appetite was also linked. The street's retail transactions also increased as usual. The reason is that the prices of goods are rising sharply, and the demanders are more interested in buying and selling. A total of 50,000 bags of various brands of flour were traded in the market, and Nanyang merchants accounted for half of them. The rest were bought by local and Northern merchants in this street. The price of No. 2 flour factory continued to stand at 4.85 yuan in cash. Because the factories do not produce much, they still restrict the supply to external hoarders.

The source of wheat is endless. Because of the high cost, the sellers mostly put them on the shelves to wait for sale. However, the appetite of the flour factories has been sluggish in recent days. Although there are hoarders who inquire, they are not official sales. Therefore, the market has been hit invisibly. Yesterday, the market opened at 6.9 yuan for Suzhou high wheat, 6.75 yuan for Danyang wheat, and 6.6 yuan for Anting wheat. 1,300 bags were traded, and they were still bought by hoarders on this street.

### Securities Domestic Bonds Stable Foreign Bonds Unchanged

The securities black market was stable yesterday. The number of people attending the meetings has gradually become sparse. Generally, big investors are no longer interested in public bonds, because their elasticity is far less than that of foreign exchange and gold, and one is legal tender delivery and the other is exchange in and out. Therefore, speculators and big investors have abandoned this and turned to that. The news of the Anglo-Japanese conference is ambiguous. The British Foreign Office's reply to Ambassador Guo is full of empty promises, but it has not yet arrived. In short, the crux of the problem lies in the legal tender, so it is difficult for the market of public bonds to improve. However, there will be no more major storms. Because of the interest rate, there is more attention paid to them. There will be major changes after the interest is paid. The trend yesterday was first tight and then soft, and there were also rises and falls of 7-8 jiao. The number of transactions has decreased. Dingkang, Shuikang, Songmao, and Datong all sold out. Lianyi, Lianhe, Dafeng, and No. 22 all sold out. The table is still dominated by sporadic retail transactions. The market price was slightly better by 2-5 jiao. Compared with the covert price of the previous day, it was slightly tired by several jiao. The total number of transactions is estimated to be 4-500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing compared to the previous day

Unified A 52.60 51.00 52.00 Up 0.40

Unified B 43.50 43.20 45.50 Up 0.20

Unified C circle 42.90 42.10 42.45 Up 0.3

Unified D 41.60 ...... 41.60 Up 0.50

Unified E 42.0 41.80 41.95 Up 0.40

In stock trading, 100 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 11.8 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 14.4 yuan in exchange, which is up several jiao from the previous day. The listed prices of various British companies' stocks in London on the 25th of this month (Tuesday) rose slightly. The British registered shares of HSBC Bank rose by £1.5, with a price of £78. Curacao Trading Company rubber shares rose by 1.5 pence, with a price of 17 shillings, and the rest were unchanged.

The London Chinese foreign debt, on the 25th of this month (Monday), the upper and lower tiers of various public bonds were flat and unchanged.

### Yarn Flowers: Yarn Industry Shifts Towards Foreign Exchange; Cotton Yarn Price Hikes Subside; Concurrent Sluggish Actual Sales; No Hope for Monetary Easing

The yarn market remains in a state of precarious stability, but actual sales are unusually sluggish, and there is no hope for development from any quarter. This is primarily due to financial contraction, coupled with significant obstacles in various transportation routes. As for the Hong Kong route, patriotic sentiment is strong, and there is some procurement of both coarse and fine Chinese yarn. However, prices are soaring, deemed too expensive, and shipping costs and miscellaneous fees are high, making the delivered cost at the destination shockingly high. This lack of yarn sales is the biggest factor. Nevertheless, the general wealthy individuals in Shanghai are treating foreign exchange fluctuations as a ratio, and while they are still in high spirits regarding rising prices, the opening price for special Gold City factory 20-count yarn is a massive 625 yuan. However, the amount bundled is not large, and customers are adopting a buy-as-needed approach.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened quietly in the morning due to weak actual demand. Dealers are optimistic and unwilling to relinquish their hoarded goods. Therefore, although actual sales are stagnant, there is no hope for prices to rebound. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse foreign yarn from the warehouse is 555 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price is 544 yuan. Trading was lackluster in the middle of the day, and customer sales remained sluggish. Suddenly, the shouting of brokers in the warehouse receipt market intensified. Upon investigation, it was found that a certain firm had previously opened an order with Shenxin No. 9 Factory for 150 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 480 yuan, a full head, and the factory had been urging payment. If the payment was not made, the account would be closed and settled in the market. The price suddenly dropped 7 yuan, reaching 537 yuan, with foreign yarn from the warehouse carrying a small premium of 4 yuan, at 550 yuan. By the close of trading, the market was calm. It was found that 755 bales were traded in half a day, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn falling 4 yuan, and warehouse receipts falling 7 yuan. Coarse yarn also fell 3-4 yuan, but Shepherd rose 1.5 yuan. Wing On Factory opened with 50 bales of special Gold City 20-count yarn at a price of 625 yuan. It was found that 650 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Tianjin yesterday, and 680 pieces were shipped to Tianjin today. The amount purchased by each trading house is listed on the left: Hong Kong 165, counterparts 580, mainland 10, total 755.

The Japanese yarn market has slightly improved, but actual transactions are lifeless. However, trading in next month's football is unusually enthusiastic, showing that people are expecting prices to rise. However, there is no hope for monetary easing. The current asking price for 20-count Moon Lute yarn is 430 yuan, and the price for next month is expected to be around 433 yuan.

The recent trend in the cotton yarn market has been slightly more stable, with less active speculation than in the past. Generally wealthy individuals are said to be quick-witted and highly skilled. It is said that their speculative strategy has changed, with half of their money being transferred to the Bund to hedge by purchasing foreign exchange, thus temporarily relaxing their focus on cotton yarn... payment two months later.

### Rongfeng Factory Imports 1,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton; Payment Two Months Later

Cotton trading is quiet, but inter-dealer trading of Indian cotton continues unabated. Selling prices are very high. As for the factory, affected by the lack of hope for monetary easing, purchasing raw materials is proving particularly difficult. Various means are being sought to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw cotton. Yesterday, Rongfeng Factory purchased over 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton, all with delivery and payment terms of two months. Sources from Northern Jiangsu indicate that due to the high and attractive selling prices in Shanghai, there are quite a few people taking the risk of procurement, and if they can be delivered to Shanghai, the resulting profits are indescribably high. 542 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: New Special Flower 83.50, intraday trade 100 pieces, bank draft Peng Jia Pu 23.50 and another 100 pieces, bank transfer and Kang Di Xu 28.00, Rongfeng Factory imports 1,000 pieces (also sending to the factory for payment in February).

Another report states that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become a dead market since the second major upheaval in the financial sector. It is only known that previously ordered goods are being settled with foreign firms, extracting profits to ease the financial strain. No new transactions have been reported, while the daily arrivals of goods are crowded. Various manufacturers are diligently devising methods to manage their finances to cope with this difficulty.

Foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was quite active yesterday. The market opened higher due to bullish telegrams from Bombay and Liverpool, simultaneously triggering enthusiastic purchases from new buyers and short covering. Later, the cotton market saw increased foreign buying due to the implementation of US cotton export subsidies, driving up spot prices in the South. Speculators and banks purchased at the close, resulting in a gain of 20 points over the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose one rupee.

### Piece Goods: Woolen Fabrics Guild Convenes to Discuss Business Strategies

Since the sudden tightening of the exchange rate in this city on the 7th of last month, most woolen fabric firms have announced price increases of 15% to 20% based on samples. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, foreign exchange contracted sharply again. The Woolen Fabric Industry Guild decided to convene a meeting of its members at its headquarters on Henan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday (July 26th) to standardize future prices. A total of twelve companies attended, including Lianxing Zhaoji, Fushun, Shunxing, Meifa, Changji, Yichangtai, and Wangxingchang. Chaired by Wang Shanfu and Li Quanzhong, after two hours of discussion, decisions were made regarding future business strategies, credit terms, and discounts on fabric samples. In terms of credit, accounts that were previously settled quarterly will now be settled monthly (i.e., monthly clearance). Accounts settled monthly will now be sold for cash with a ten-day term (i.e., a ten-day draft can be issued). The above methods will be determined based on the customer's creditworthiness, and the remainder will be sold for cash. In terms of prices, regardless of whether the goods are new or old, prices will be based on five pence, so that new and old purchase prices can be offset. Furthermore, pricing for the same color will be standardized among members. If the exchange rate suddenly advances four pence, another meeting will be convened at that time to make a decision. As for sample discounts, there have been significant differences among firms in the past, with discounts ranging from 20% to 40% to 38%. These will also be standardized in the future. (Jun)

### Hangzhou Ammunition Bureau

The Hangzhou authorities have now established a manufacturing plant dedicated to producing foreign gunpowder, bullets, copper casings, artillery shells, etc. Many artisans from the Shanghai Ordnance Bureau have gone to work there. The factory employs a total of 100 artisans, supervised by 10 supervisors. Work commences every morning at 9:00 AM and ceases at 4:00 PM, with Sundays off, following the pattern of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. However, there are no Westerners involved. It is noted that Hangzhou has traditionally had a Military Equipment Bureau and a Gunpowder Bureau. Now, it is dedicated to producing Western-style ammunition to benefit from firepower, demonstrating the great attention paid to the military by the senior officials in Zhejiang.

### Recent Status of Overseas Young Students

The Chinese envoy previously ordered to go to Cuba to inspect Chinese laborers is said to have passed through the United States on his way back, visiting the schools where overseas young students are studying. It is reported that "although the students' proficiency in Western languages varies, some have made great progress. Not only can they understand the language thoroughly, but they can also explain Western texts that are not too profound." It is also said that "the students reside in American homes, and the Americans all praise them, saying that they possess gentle and diligent qualities, and thus love them as their own children. The Chinese teachers sent from China are periodically recalled to the General Bureau for examination, and they take turns studying Chinese every half month." It is also heard that after studying Chinese in turn, the students return to their respective American homes with joy, indicating that the Americans treat them well, or perhaps the teachers in the General Bureau are more strict in their supervision.

### Goddess Hall

Lu Erxi's daughter from Xishan has the reputation of being a prodigy. At the age of nine, her tutor gave her the line "The spring breeze is like a tiger" to complete. She immediately responded with "The autumn water is lighter than a gull." Using an idiom to match an idiom, it is truly wonderfully beyond compare. In the future, the title of "talented woman with painted eyebrows" should not be limited to the area below Jiulong Mountain.

### The Question of Residence: Countryside vs. City

— Ying Dai

Each Has Its Advantages and Disadvantages

Speaking of the question of residence, whether in the countryside or in the city, people will certainly raise a question, which is whether a person's lifespan is longer when living in the countryside than when living in the city? The answer is that the lifespan of rural residents is longer because, according to statistics, the mortality rate in cities is higher than in the countryside. This is true not only in China but also in various European and American countries, where the population mortality rate in cities exceeds that in the countryside.

Living in the countryside indeed has many advantages, the most obvious being that the air is very fresh. Farmers work in the fields all day long, not only absorbing fresh air but also getting plenty of sunlight. Due to daily work, their bodies are quite strong, stronger than those of city dwellers. Due to the sparse population, infectious diseases do not spread as rapidly as in cities. As for city dwellers, they generally do not get fresh air or sunlight, and they have less labor time. Due to overcrowding, infectious diseases can spread very quickly, and their physique is much weaker than that of rural residents.

However, living in the countryside also has its disadvantages, and living in the city is not without its advantages. Although rural residents can absorb fresh air and sunlight when working outside, when they return to their homes, all the houses are not only small but also have few windows, dim light, damp ground, and are located very close to cattle sheds, pigsties, and manure pits, with swarms of mosquitoes and flies, which is appalling. These are all sources of disease. The drinking water is not as clean as in the city, and the nutritional value of food is not very sufficient due to economic poverty. If they contract an infectious disease, they cannot be sent to a well-equipped hospital. On the other hand, buildings in the city are more sophisticated than those in the countryside, with dry foundations, open windows, and fewer mosquitoes and flies than in the countryside. The drinking water is tap water that has been filtered by sand, which is cleaner than in the countryside, and the nutritional value of food is also more sufficient than in the countryside. If they get sick, they can be sent to the hospital quickly. In particular, city dwellers are more educated than rural residents, so they pay more attention to hygiene issues and have a richer knowledge of hygiene. These are the advantages of living in the city over living in the countryside.

Seventy or eighty years ago, the mortality rate in European and American cities was more than twice as high as in the countryside, but in recent years, the difference has narrowed. The only reason why the urban mortality rate has been able to decrease so rapidly is the progress of hygiene education. Taking Shanghai as an example, public and private institutions often lead the public in carrying out hygiene campaigns, using various methods to arouse residents' attention to hygiene. Vaccination and inoculation, and widespread publicity, have achieved significant results. The fact that Shanghai has avoided major epidemics in the past two years is the result of paying attention to hygiene. Therefore, if people living in cities pay attention to hygiene issues, whether personal or public, then their lifespan will not necessarily be shorter than that of people living in the countryside.

### Summer Coats

— Yuan

Following the high-end woolen suit stores' promotion of winter coats and spring coats, I am going to advocate for a kind of summer coat.

Many people must be criticizing me for being heat-struck! Coats are inherently for warmth, and in the winter when the north wind is harsh and in the spring when it is chilly, a coat is needed to maintain body temperature. But in this hot season, people try to make their clothes as thin, light, and cool as possible, so where is the need for a cumbersome coat?

This is certainly true, but in the plum rain season, when the heat fades in the late evening, and especially in this climate ravaged by hurricanes, do people wearing thin, bare-chested, and bare-armed new clothes not need an outer garment to regulate their body temperature?

Many ladies have already seen this point, so we often see many long and short coats made of silk or floral cloth on the road.

These coats are certainly very novel and beautiful in appearance, and the colors are also suitable for the clothes and the season, but they have several shortcomings. Because the cloth is not smooth and is sticky, stiff, and not breathable; and the silk is expensive in terms of raw materials and labor costs, and a piece costs more than a dozen gold pieces, which ordinary people cannot afford in this time of rising prices and economic hardship.

Now I am going to promote a kind of summer coat that is both affordable and beautiful.

The raw material for this coat is any color of cashmere wool, one and a quarter skeins (selling for less than one yuan). Prepare the finest bamboo skewers, two or four at a time, and use a single strand of wool to weave it in your favorite pattern. You can match the colors of the collar and cuffs and embroider various flowers; (but one thing to pay attention to is that the collar, cuffs, and hem must be woven with double strands, and the body and sleeves should be large rather than small to avoid damage easily)

A coat made in this way is as thin as a cicada's wing and as brilliant as rosy clouds. Wearing it, it is light, warm, and beautiful, all in one. In the sunset with the breeze blowing, it is truly like floating in the air. Why don't you beautiful women give it a try?

### June Vegetarianism

— Long Jusheng

In the customs of our society, devout men and women who believe in Buddhas and Bodhisattvas generally start eating "June Vegetarianism" in the sixth month of the lunar calendar. On the eve of the first day of the sixth month, they eagerly "seal" their vegetarian diet, with chicken, shrimp, fish, meat, and other unclean items spread all over the table, eating to their heart's content! Disregarding the precept against killing in this way, they call it "sealing" their vegetarian diet, which is truly absurd. As for the traditionally practiced scramble to eat "June Vegetarianism," it is not entirely objectionable because eating vegetarian food during the hot summer has hygienic and health-promoting significance.

I remember that the custom of devout men and women eating "June Vegetarianism" was very prevalent in Wuxi because the vegetables there, nourished by the beauty of the mountains and waters, are fertile and lush, always better than those produced in neighboring areas. Vegetables like chicken feathers, edamame, Changgenglu, called Changmangdou in Shanghai, yellow soybean sprouts, green soybean sprouts, (although they are hatched from soybeans and mung beans, they are nourished by the spirit of blue waves and green waters, much more robust than those in Shanghai), winter bamboo shoots, eggplants, cucumbers, etc... are all rich in vitamins. And Wuxi's pig's blood fungus (produced at the foot of Mount Hui), oil gluten, small box tofu, and other vegetarian dishes are even more popular. Therefore, in my childhood, I often ate "June Vegetarianism" with my mother and was never attacked by the demons of abdominal pain or diarrhea in the summer. Unfortunately, the lakes and mountains have changed color today, and I think the June vegetarian dishes of the past are now also full of the stench of blood. As for me, trapped on a solitary island, my hometown dreams are broken, and I am even more saddened by this "June Vegetarianism."

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

These few days have entered the dog days of summer, which can be considered the most formal summer. As a result, the custom of eating vegetarian food in June is very popular for a while, not only do the ladies and grandmothers eat a lot, even the general men are eating quite a bit. This kind of vegetarian food can not be blamed on superstitious divine power, in fact, eating more vegetables in the hot weather is also a hygienic way, so it can also be called eating hygienic vegetarian food. What's more, in the era of expensive rice and cinnamon, eating less meat and more vegetables is also in line with the principles of economy. However, for the housewife, it is not easy to make vegetarian dishes, because if you just eat simple vegetables every day, you will get tired of it over time, and I am afraid that you will reduce your appetite, so sometimes you have to think of some tricks. Now I will introduce two vegetarian dishes that I love to eat; one: braised vegetarian bedspread; cut green vegetables, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, dried tofu, etc. into cubes, wrap them in tofu skin to form a bedspread shape, first fry them in hot oil until golden brown, and then braise them with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fungus, and golden needles together. Two: sweet sauce fried eggplant, first cut the eggplant into pieces, put it in the pot to simmer until cooked, then add sweet sauce and stir-fry until crispy, the taste is very rich and beautiful.

### Feng Yuxiang's Humorous Dining

— Lover of Apple Room

Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Feng Yuxiang, has many humorous gestures; in the past, he once gathered military officers for a picnic in the snowy weather, with only a few cold steamed buns and a little bit of vegetables, Feng looked around while eating, and was displeased when he saw people with a difficult expression. When Feng was in the Northwest, one day for breakfast, Feng sent steamed cornbread made of black flour to the officers and Feng's deputy director (i.e., General Feng Zhi'an) in the dining hall for them to eat, but all the cornbread given to them had been left for many days, and the taste was slightly sour, so everyone frowned and could hardly swallow it. Feng smiled and said to General Feng Zhi'an, "Deputy Officer Feng has the largest appetite, how many can you eat today?" At that time, General Feng Zhi'an had to eat as much as possible because Commander Feng was in front of him, so he smiled and said, "I can eat six!" Feng repeatedly inquired about it, a certain director said five, a certain officer said four, and there was a lot of laughter. Before long, the black flour cornbread had been divided and eaten.

Also, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Feng's army was stationed in Zhengzhou, on New Year's Day, Feng ordered the soldiers to replace firecrackers with the ping-pong sound of their mouths, and then summoned the military officers to give a speech, first saying, "Today is New Year's Day, everyone please sit down and listen." Finally, he said, "Although we have big fish and meat to eat today, we have prepared chicken eggs, and no matter what, everyone has to spread one, you have been working hard all day, and you have to be comfortable today, I will let your superiors serve you and give you nourishment, you don't have to move!" After a while, dinner was served, and the heads of each department were busy serving their subordinates, like waiters, and there were many people who secretly laughed.

Short Message: Mr. Jiang Zhongchuan of Wuxian County is the only collector of Chinese silver coins. Now, the Shanghai Universal Postal and Coin Company has asked him to make illustrations of the precious genuine gold, silver, and nickel coins he has collected over the past ten years, as well as the genuine collections of Chinese collectors. Each coin will be separately identified by Mr. Jiang, and described in Chinese and English. It is a necessary reference book for studying and collecting gold, silver, and nickel coins to identify authenticity. It has now been published, and each book is sold for 12 national currencies. The general distributor is the Universal Postal and Coin Company, 90 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and the distributor is Biefa Bookstore. It is said that printed samples can be requested from the general distributor by mail.

### Seek and Ye Shall Find

— Zhi

Why is there a "seek and ye shall find" reality? Originally, whenever a person seeks something, he must have a certain determination, followed by a certain action to achieve his goal. Suppose there is only an idea, a wish, without determined action, not even as good as the "waiting" and "expecting" of "waiting for a rabbit to strike a tree." Then this cannot be considered "seeking," and naturally, there will be no "finding."

People who understand "seek and ye shall find" can be said to be invincible: reasonable seeking can certainly be fulfilled, and even unreasonable seeking, such as stealing, robbing, threatening, and all the sinful pursuits in the world, can often be responded to as one desires. Seeking, seeking diligently, seeking with all kinds of means, is indeed the secret to all success!

The same is true for small things and big things. Some people in Western Europe have repeatedly demanded, and indeed, they have repeatedly returned fully loaded. Some people in East Asia have repeatedly kidnapped, and indeed, they have repeatedly boasted of "success" and achieved their goals. From then on, their appetite will naturally grow bigger and bigger, and they will seek more and more. There are certainly many good shows that seem unexpected but are actually intended to appear.

Is the power that comes from seeking really unstoppable, is there really no way to deal with this kind of seeking? Of course, there is no absolute thing in the world, and heaven never closes all roads for people. This kind of seeking has an end, and there is also a way to deal with it. However, the ground will not stop itself, it must be forced to stop by someone, that is, by using another method to deal with it.

This method of dealing with it has no secret, it is another kind of seeking. He seeks from you, and you also seek from him. He has determination and action, and you also have determination and action. He can succeed, and you can also succeed. The hope of mutual success, in pure theory, is fifty and fifty, mutually equal.

However, when the two sides fight hard, one side will always fail in the end. Why is this? Isn't seeking eventually something that cannot be obtained? I tell you: this is because of the righteousness or unrighteousness of seeking. When seeking nothing meets unrighteous seeking, seeking nothing can only fail. But when unrighteous seeking meets righteous seeking, unrighteous seeking can only fail. Only in these opportunities will seeking be unattainable. Justice will ultimately triumph over power.

From this, it can be seen that we must use seeking to deal with others' seeking, and we must especially use righteous seeking to deal with unrighteous seeking!

### Following in Each Other's Footsteps

### The Book of Truth (Part 1)

— Mara

The night was very gentle, but very dark. The wind of the wilderness whistled through the distant forests, fields, and hills, bringing the fragrant scent of earth, flowers, and grass, swirling above our heads. The moonlight was so faint it was just like a layer of white mist. The scattered trees around cast shadows haphazardly, painting a dim and terrifying picture like ghosts. The small stream flowed exceptionally loudly in the silence, like a garrulous old woman telling endless secrets. In hidden places, one could still hear one or two cries of wild beasts, desolate and shrill.

My father and I sat facing each other. The light of his pipe flashed intermittently, revealing my father's melancholic and silent wrinkled face, as if he were pondering something. At this moment, a rustling sound arose in the woods, like cautious footsteps treading on withered and fallen leaves. I suddenly became afraid. I looked at my father, but he had not changed in the slightest, as if all his senses had stopped. I could no longer endure it, and I impatiently called out, "Father."

My words interrupted his thoughts. He was slightly surprised, but then he said alertly:

"Child, what is it? Are you afraid? How about I tell you a story?" My father looked at me with a smile, his words filled with gentleness and concern, and my fear instantly vanished.

"Good, good, tell a beautiful one, Father," I said excitedly.

"Beautiful?" My father shook his head heavily. "None of my stories are beautiful, but they are all true." His eyes swept across my face, waiting for my reply.

"That's fine too, Father, then tell it quickly," I was already impatient.

"Once upon a time, there was a country in the West, the Daoxian Kingdom, not much different from ours. It also had a large number of impoverished people. You cannot imagine the kind of life they lived. You have clothes to wear, you have enough to eat, you live a happy life, you would not know what their lives were like," my father began his story like this.

"So, among those impoverished people, a piece of information spread: it was said that two years ago, God placed a book written by himself on Mount Mosun. The book contained the truth about how God told humans they should live. The words 'The Book of Truth' were engraved on the cover, with a footnote: 'Those who read it will receive life and happiness.' They glowed with brilliant light at night, which people across the whole kingdom could see, which proved that the rumors were true. Therefore, they decided to read this book of truth." My father's tone revealed great distress, as if he was worried that a great disaster had befallen them. He took a deep puff of his pipe, and the blue smoke rose in a winding wisp, gradually disappearing into the heavy darkness.

"But the King found out about this, and his panic was naturally great, because it would hinder his 'divine right'. He immediately ordered his cavalry to surround the mountain, forbidding the people to read the Book of Truth, and at the same time, he established a censorship bureau, using cruel punishments to suppress the people. After many bloody massacres, they surprisingly became very quiet." My father's face was covered with dark clouds, and he sighed deeply. The sigh lingered in the air for a long time, and my heart was filled with the sound of the sigh.

"Did they really become quiet from then on?" I asked doubtfully.

"No, child, wishes are immortal, and anger is something that cannot be suppressed. It is like a volcano under the snow. They patiently wait, waiting for the day to repay blood with blood." My father replied excitedly, his eyes dreamily gazing at the distant, dark mountain range that outlined an arc in the dim sky, slowly continuing in a gentle tone: "This day finally came, was it the year when famine broke out everywhere? Hundreds of thousands of people gathered together, bravely rushed past the cavalry's sharp and beautiful swords, and surrounded the palace. Their magnificent cries for bread rang loudly in the King's ears, making the King tremble, without any way to stop them. After the people recognized their power, the King had no way to stop them, so in the end, that tyrannical monster was destroyed." My father seemed overwhelmed by joy, as if their fate was also his fate, his face covered with a pleasant smile. I couldn't help but call out to him happily.

"Good child, let me continue, the tragedy is in the back." My father's face suddenly turned gloomy again.

I listened more attentively:

### From Translation to Rewriting

— Yang Jinhao

I also read books written by foreigners that discuss Chinese issues theoretically; but I have never liked reading books written by foreigners that depict Chinese stories. Although it is said that some of them are well-written, I always think that foreigners do not have a deep understanding of Chinese customs and social conditions. They write based on hearsay or superficial observations, which inevitably feels like scratching an itch through a boot. In addition, I also think that Chinese stories are always better written by Chinese people than by foreigners. Of course, this is close to prejudice and not worth following.

I received a copy of Pearl S. Buck's "Patriot" translated by Brother Zhu Sha. I read a bit and didn't continue because I found its plot bizarre and its technique very ordinary. Later, I read the criticism in this magazine and learned about its general content. Soon after, Brother Zhu Wen came to visit, and we talked about this matter. Besides talking about Pearl S. Buck's insufficient understanding of Chinese affairs—especially that she made assumptions and exaggerations based on certain propaganda texts of news policies, resulting in many inconsistencies with reality, which objectively amounted to insulting China…etc., I also expressed the following opinion:

"If you use the effort of translating it to create your own work, I think the result will always be better than the translated version. The understanding will indeed be much more accurate, the materials will be more abundant, and the technique is not necessarily worse than hers.

"Even if you want to translate it, you shouldn't translate it directly. You might as well use it as a base to rewrite it: supplement and elaborate on the more exciting parts, delete and correct the parts with wrong viewpoints; at the same time, in terms of wording and structure, you can also rewrite it to be more Chinese style. As for the publication, just state these situations in front of the book."

"That's right. The Japanese are much smarter. The Japanese translation of this book deletes all the parts that are unfavorable to Japan." Brother Zhu Wen seemed to regret being too "faithful" when translating it.

In fact, the above opinion I stated can be said to be my view on the entire translation problem, not just on the book "Patriot". I always believe that the work of translation (as well as writing) is to serve the reader, not to serve the original author. It is really undesirable to translate things with distorted consciousness and absurd viewpoints without changing a word, which is "faithful" to the original author. Even for works with correct consciousness and appropriate viewpoints, "literal translation" according to the original text, making it unreadable and awkward, making people feel "headache" as if reading a "heavenly book", I don't think this is the best way to be "faithful" to the original author.

It goes without saying that the basic condition is to translate the original text of foreign grammar into Chinese grammar, so that people can read it smoothly. Fortunately, after a "translation debate" before September 18th, "hard translations have been much less; but I still don’t seem to be satisfied. I believe that in addition to having complete translations of the first-class world masterpieces that grasp the era, it is also necessary to publish rewritten versions that can truly convey the spirit. May I ask, how many people with lower cultural levels can understand those complete translations of masterpieces? First of all, that series of long names of people and places is already dazzling to them; and those overly delicate descriptions also make their impressions slack and unable to comprehend; and there are many plots and tones that do not conform to Chinese customs and habits, making it difficult for them to understand accurately. In many places like these, I think it can be rewritten to be more Chinese, and shorter and more popular. Long works still have to be compressed, with a few "clean versions".

During the September 18th Incident, someone used the words "Das Kapital doesn't necessarily have to be understood by the masses" (this is the general idea, the original text is published in the Art News) to oppose my opinion of advocating "smooth" translation, I don't know what identity he was speaking from. Indeed, I don't advise everyone to go to revolution after they must understand Das Kapital, but if the masses can also understand a little meaning of Das Kapital, that is always a good thing, right? In Europe and America, there are publications such as "Student Das Kapital" and "Worker Das Kapital", and in China, there are also translations such as "Popular Das Kapital", which is nothing more than a popularization work to improve the cultural level of the masses.

In literature, such popularization work is also needed. In the Soviet Union, several masterpieces have also been published in compressed popular versions for children to read; in China, there are not many masterpieces that can truly grasp the era, then, borrowing foreign masterpieces to rewrite and publish a set of compressed popular versions for the masses to read is indeed very meaningful and urgently needed.

However, rewriting world masterpieces is not something that can be done casually. In addition to a selection effort, the plot, color, consciousness, and spirit of each masterpiece must be grasped, and resolved in the Chinese-style crucible, like extracting steel, to extract and retell its essence. Therefore, this is a very labor-intensive and thoughtful hard work, which requires collective discussion and cooperation from the literary and art circles, and even more the support of cultural institutions.

I hope that this rewriting (or re-translation) of world masterpieces will be implemented in a planned way in the near future.

### Before Dawn

— Lin Junxiang

Through the fog-like rain curtain,

A green flash of lightning occasionally shines,

Illuminating the child's terrified face.

Thunder rumbles in the wet sky,

Water vibrates from the broken window,

Mixed with the child's frightened cries.

"Liuzi, don't cry, don't panic,

After the thunderstorm, the sky will be bright!" —

A yellow halo of light lights up in the broken house...

### Joy (6)

Joy of faith; extremely simple, extremely holy and clean, simple: is the reason for joy, pure must not be mixed. Some people say: I believe in Christ, my family is harmonious, husband and wife follow each other, so I am joyful; some people say: I believe in Christ, my business is prosperous, and I make millions of dollars, so I am joyful: some people say: I believe in Christ, my official career is smooth, and I am promoted out of order, so I am joyful... These reasons for joy are not pure, and may not come from faith. Although there is joy, I am afraid it is not reliable. Holy and clean: is the nature of joy, holy and pure, not to be joyful in worldly things, nor to mix worldly things; like the various things mentioned above, true Christians not only do not think of them as joy, but also as dung and filth. The prodigal son who wanders homeless, once returns to his father's lap; the hungry and weeping baby, once returns to his loving mother's arms, that kind of joy is close to the joy of Christians.

The joy of Christians comes from the only true God, and what is joyful is only the only true God. The true God is unchanging, so the joy is unchanging. There is joy in peace, and there is also joy in hardship and difficulty; there is joy in honor. There is also joy in poverty, humility, humiliation, persecution, ridicule, whipping, and imprisonment. It is not that joy is inhuman, but that it is beyond human affection. So-called human affection is the common emotion of mediocre people, shepherds, and woodcutters. Taking the common emotion of everyone as emotion is to be a human being; Christians are above the emotions of all people and have only divine emotion. Divine emotion: is what the world does not have, and the joy of divine emotion is also what the world does not have, and cannot be understood. To get this noble joy, only believe in Christ.

### Me and "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears"

— Lan Lan

I remember that it was still long ago, after the Carlton performance of "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears", the China Women's Mutual Aid Association specially convened a symposium. In addition to the actors of Flowers Sprinkled with Tears and the press, the majority of those present were dance hall sisters. At that time, the sisters in the dance world felt unusually excited about this first performance of a script with dance girls as the subject, which vented a sigh of relief for the dance girls. They couldn't help but recount many of their own tragic situations. In order to make the outside world understand their environment, in order to make the outside world know that they are not experts in living in a drunken dream, for they, like other women, have clear minds and clean souls. Under the sponsorship of the Mutual Aid Association, the dance world itself wanted to perform "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears". Their difficult and painful lives deeply moved me. Surrounded by this fiery atmosphere, after the request and encouragement of the venue, I mustered up my courage and, regardless of everything, took on the responsibility of directing this time. But recently, the public performance on the 27th—the same grand performance as participating in the drama festival—and bearing the mission of "charity" again, made me tremble at the heaviness of the burden.

In the process of rehearsal, what we felt was the greatest difficulty was the limited time of the actors. "What is the most appropriate rehearsal time?" Of course, no one can bear to deprive them of their only sleep in the morning. Besides meal dances, tea dances, and evening dances, the only thing left is the short two hours from two to four in the afternoon. But they still have to socialize and entertain. So these only two hours have become a problem. This of course affects the rehearsal work, and even for a very long period we simply had no way to continue our rehearsal. But in recent weeks, for those displaced, lonely and helpless refugees, they sacrificed sleep, overcame difficulties, and actively rehearsed. This enthusiastic spirit is really moving!

Five fifteen, this special performance time, was specially requested from the conference. Although the sacrifice of the tea dance is unavoidable, it can not affect the evening dance. The full performance of "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears" takes four hours. For the convenience of the audience, it was finally decided to follow the example of the Art Society's Sunday performance and only perform two acts. Please forgive the audience for this unavoidable difficulty.

I dare not predict the results of the performance. My own limited knowledge, coupled with my recent busy work of filming and rehearsing "Women's Apartment" and "Night Shanghai", is really a case of the spirit being willing but the flesh being weak. Because of the efforts of the actors, and the enthusiasm for the enthusiastic assistance and the support of the drama comrades, although it is said that this performance is for a greater purpose, I still very much hope that there will be some small achievements.

Here I also want to say: Thank you to the playwright Yu Ling for allowing me to direct this play, so that the audience can understand through this performance the lives of this group of weak and over-exploited dance hall sisters, so as to give them a lot of encouragement and help, so that they will not end their unfortunate body and mind with passive suicide, but will actively strengthen, tenaciously, and strive towards the bright future of liberating their lives. This is also the painstaking effort of the Mutual Aid Troupe to participate in this unprecedented "grand event" in the history of Chinese drama at this time and place, hoping for abundant fruits.

### Miss Chen Yanyan tearfully talks sadly: Film is my life (Part 2)

— Leng Fang's Notes

－－A lifetime of regretful film history－－

…Her debut work was Spring in the South

One year after coming to Shanghai, she first appeared on the silver screen, starring in "Spring in the South". The director, Mr. Cai Chusheng, was also doing his first solo work. Because she had no acting experience, she really made a fool of herself when she went on stage. She didn't understand anything. Fortunately, Mr. Cai patiently taught her and happily overcame this first difficulty under his careful guidance. Later, "Spring in the South" was filmed and released. The general reviews and box office situation were surprisingly good. I was also considered to have succeeded because of him and established a foothold in the film industry. Therefore, I am always grateful for Mr. Cai's kind assistance.

…The hard work of filming caused a deep stomach illness

"It's not human to eat the film industry" This sentence is indeed true. Filming is indeed harder than working in other careers, and it is really extremely tiring. Therefore, to be a film actor, one must have a spirit of enduring hardship and have a strong body, and a weak person will be unable to cope. Like me, in order to rush to film, I often ate irregularly, causing a very deep stomach illness. However, my idea of film work is absolutely to like labor and hate leisure. No matter how hard the work is, I only hope to act in more plays and make more films; the more films I make, the more excited I feel; on the contrary, if I don't have any plays to act in for a long time, it's really more uncomfortable than anything else. Because I believe that film is my life. Acting is extremely hard but I will never feel bored; if I really don't let me film, I simply can't hope to continue to survive.

…Every time I act in a tragedy, I shed real tears

I have acted in dozens of films before, and most of them were tragedies. The general opinion is that I am more suitable for performing tragedies; but I have no fixed opinion and I hope to play many different roles. It is best if I have the opportunity to try out all kinds of different personalities. Regarding the performance of tragedies, I have a prejudice, that is, I absolutely do not want to use fake tears. There is a kind of potion that you put under your eyes, and although it looks very realistic, it can be seen that it is stagnant and will not drip down when shooting long shots. Every time I encounter this kind of performance, I only need to move my true feelings, and I will shed a lot of tears myself. However, in the photography studio, sometimes when I see others performing this real weeping performance, I can't help but laugh.

A lifetime of regret is an infinite pain in my film history, and it is also an invisible encouragement that makes me work hard and be positive. Now that I have achieved some small achievements, my father has passed away for many years, and his tomb has long been arched! Alas! Besides entrusting my whole life to the film industry and striving for progress, what else can I do to redeem this great sin? (End)

### Chatting about the romance between film actors and dance girls

— Yu Yihua

During the Shanghai Amateur Drama Circle's Charity Performance Week, the 27th was Lan Lan's directed "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears". The dance hall members of the "Mutual Aid Troupe" participated in this performance, such as Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, Lily Zhang (namely Zhang Xinzhu in Yuan Muzhi's directed "City Scenery"), and Lily Fang, etc. And this Yang Wenying, who plays Mimi, is now rumored to be in love with Bai Yun, a Guohua actor, so one day when they were rehearsing, the author talked to them about this issue.

That day, they were rehearsing the scene where Mimi commits suicide. When Yang Wenying was holding the cigarette tin as if she was drinking Lysol, I had just talked to Wei Chuyun about Bai Yun, and Yang Wenying heard it, and slammed the cigarette tin on the table, angrily saying: "Talking to yourself"

Wei Chuyun and Yang Wenying are old friends. They once lived together in an upstairs room of a wood shop on Jing'an Temple Road, and they went in and out together. They can be said to be sworn friends, so Wei Chuyun paid very close attention to the records of the Yang Bai romance incident. However, perhaps Wei Chuyun's emotions were a little calmer. Seeing Yang Wenying's angry appearance, she said:

"Rehearse your play properly." Then she said to me: "It is common for dance girls to be talked about by others. Of course, there is some reason for Yang Wenying and Bai Yun, that is, when our Dance Industry Women's Association was established last month, we performed a play at the Carlton once, and Bai Yun participated in our performance through the introduction of a friend. At that time, because the Dance Association could not find a meeting place, the rehearsal was temporarily borrowed from Yang Wenying's new home. Perhaps it was because of the relationship between rehearsing and acting that the rumor of romance spread."

"Therefore, I feel that: Wei Chuyun really became agitated like Ding Xiang, our Dance Association should strive for development, so that the general sisters can know their status and personality, being a dance girl is not lowly, as long as they live seriously, outsiders will naturally change their eyes to look at us!"

At the same time, friends also met Bai Yun, and he also tried his best to deny it. He said: I want to act in a few plays properly.

Dance girls and film actors are all living people. We have no reason to oppose their love, but it is precisely because they are dance girls and film actors that they attract special attention. To change the eyes of outsiders, you have to work hard as a price; romance is a small problem.

### Big King, Second King – A Tale of Two Heroes Fighting in the Wilderness (Part 3)

— Li Feishu

— Random Memories from Beside the Plum Tree (5) —

On this day, the colleagues backstage were both surprised and taken aback! They secretly dispatched a martial arts performer to follow them and investigate. They watched as the two men walked to Black Dragon Pool. The martial arts performer hid himself on a "mound" amidst the desolate reeds and weeds, holding his breath to observe from a high vantage point. If he hadn't looked, it would have been fine! But upon seeing what he saw, the specially appointed envoy was so frightened that his "tongue almost came out and couldn't go back in"! He quickly "whipped his horse" and returned to the backstage, reporting the situation to his colleagues. Everyone who heard it was terrified! Fearing for their lives, the entire troupe rushed to "Black Dragon Pool"!

Before they even reached the battlefield, they could see from afar "smoke billowing, rocks flying, fists and feet clashing, like a rabbit leaping and a dragon ascending." The two heroes were fighting fiercely, evenly matched. Suddenly, they saw so many people coming and knew that their secret had been exposed. It was a pity that "after building a mountain to nine levels, the work was ruined by a single basketful"! They didn't even greet the crowd but only sighed at each other, waving their hands silently! At this moment, their expressions were like "Yue Wu Mu receiving twelve gold tablets halfway, regretting not being able to 'directly attack Huanglong and drink to your heart's content'!" Everyone approached and first offered some words of comfort. Looking at their bodies, they were all bruised and battered, like two colored maps. Only then did everyone realize the real reason why they refused to change their underwear when playing roles backstage. Everyone asked them, "What great feud do you two have that you need to duel here?" The answers given by the two heroes were truly mysterious! They said, "Even we ourselves don't know why! But before fighting, we always felt a bit of a grudge when we met. Since we started fighting, we've actually felt much better! You ask us why we're doing this, and we really don't know why!" Everyone who heard them was both amused and annoyed! They could only give them a slight warning and rebuke. They picked up their clothes from the ground, helped them dress neatly, and walked back to the city together, sending them home.

The next day, after a public discussion among the backstage colleagues, a banquet was held to make peace. The two men immediately declared in public, "We will never act so recklessly again!" This martial arts drama, "Dragon Tiger Gate," was finally closed.

Later, according to their own admission, they had been arguing for a month. Although neither side had clearly won, Xu Deyi seemed to have a slight advantage in comparison. Therefore, the backstage colleagues called Xu Deyi "Big (homophone) King" and Zhu Xiangquan "Second King," and this nickname still exists to this day.

Louis Hayward in "The Man in the Iron Mask" wears an iron mask, and his expression is terrifying enough. It is said that during the filming process, if he was thirsty, he could only use a very thin rubber tube to suck water from a bottle. In fact, it was also very difficult for him to breathe in it.
