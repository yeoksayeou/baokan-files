### Japan Conducts Anti-British Movement; Craigie Lodges Strong Protest; Tokyo Round Table Conference Fears Difficulty in Continuing; Britain, the United States, and France Maintain Close Contact; British Member of Parliament Questions Negotiation Details

(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, opposition Labour Party members Henderson and Baker questioned the progress of the Tokyo negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain responded immediately, stating, "Foreign Office official Butler reported on the progress of the Tokyo negotiations to the House of Commons last Monday, and there have been no changes since then. Regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, the government has instructed Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, to lodge another strong protest with the Japanese government." Henderson further asked, "Given the situation in the Far East, is the government in close contact with the governments of the United States and France?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Yes." Baker then inquired about the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Hsi-keng case. The Prime Minister replied that no decision had yet been made on this matter. Labour Party member Wedgwood then said, "Any action we take that appears to betray China may incite anti-British movements within China. I wonder if the Prime Minister can bear this in mind?" The Prime Minister did not answer. Liberal Party member Mander then inquired, "It is heard from Tianjin that two British women were forced by the Japanese to strip and be inspected. What does the government intend to do about this?" The Prime Minister replied, "I have not yet received an official report regarding this matter." (Havas, 2nd)

(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Bellenger inquired whether the Tokyo negotiations involved the issue of Chinese legal tender. Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "No, the current negotiations are limited to local issues in Tianjin." Bellenger then followed up, "Can the Prime Minister provide assurances stating that the British authorities will never allow Chinese legal tender to lose its legal status within the Tianjin Concession?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "This matter was explained in detail yesterday." Opposition Labour Party member Burke inquired, "There are widespread rumors that Britain intends to revoke the legal status of Chinese legal tender in Tianjin and transfer the silver reserves in the Concession to the Japanese side. Has the Japanese side made this suggestion? Can the Prime Minister clarify this?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Rumors are rampant at all times and in all places and should not be easily believed. When the House of Commons discussed the situation in China yesterday, I fully explained the British government's position. There is nothing more to add." (Havas, 2nd)

(London) Foreign Office official Butler stated in the House of Commons today that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, due to the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese naval and military authorities on British trade in the Yangtze River Delta, sent a letter to the Japanese government on June 6th to negotiate this case. As of now, a response has not yet been received from the Japanese government. The British government considers the problem extremely urgent and has requested Sir Robert Craigie to urge the Japanese government to respond quickly. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Craigie Declares British Viewpoint

(London) According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, London has not yet indicated that it intends to terminate the Tokyo talks due to the anti-British movements occurring in the Japanese-controlled areas. However, the British government is deeply aware that the anti-British movements have made the Anglo-Japanese negotiations extremely difficult. Ambassador to Japan Craigie has made this point clear to the Japanese government, stating that if a harmonious atmosphere cannot be established, the success of the negotiations will be significantly hindered. It is heard that Craigie made the following statement when expressing the British viewpoint: The Japanese side has the responsibility to maintain public order in the areas it occupies, and the plan agreed upon in the Tokyo talks is based on the premise that the Japanese side will bear this responsibility. However, the current situation indicates that public order has not been maintained. From this perspective, the Japanese government seems unable or unwilling to maintain public order. If it is able to maintain it but does not, then the Japanese side is not fulfilling its obligations under this plan. If it is unable to maintain it, then the Japanese side should not claim that it is capable of maintaining it. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Tokyo) Regarding the report in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie requested Kato, the Japanese representative to the Round Table Conference, to ask the Japanese government to strictly restrain the anti-British movements in China and Japan, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied it today, saying that the Nichi Nichi Shimbun's report was purely fabricated. According to British sources, Craigie did indeed raise concerns about the anti-British agitation recently, but he did not mention this matter during his conversation with Kato last night. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson also stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's claim that those agitating against Britain in North China were under the influence and control of the Japanese was not true. It is reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday have been banned from publication in Japan. Japanese newspapers are prohibited from publishing them. (Reuters, 2nd)

### US Chargé d'Affaires Also Protests to Japan

(Tokyo) According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, British Ambassador Craigie requested Kato, the leader of the Japanese delegation to the Round Table Conference, last night to ask the Japanese government to strictly restrain the anti-British movement in China, saying, "If not, the Anglo-Japanese talks may be difficult to continue." It is reported that the British Ambassador further requested that this intention be conveyed to Foreign Minister Arita. The newspaper also reported that at the same time, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Dooman visited the Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explaining that the anti-British movement in China has now turned into an anti-white movement, endangering American expatriates in China, and requesting the Japanese government to fully restrain the anti-foreign movement in China. According to the newspaper, Mr. Kato replied to the British Ambassador that the anti-British activities and the Tokyo talks were two separate matters. The anti-British activities in Japan were spontaneous expressions of the people, and if they hindered the maintenance of peace and order, responsible Japanese officials would take appropriate measures to restrain them at any time. As for the activities of the Chinese people, they had nothing to do with the Japanese government. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Tokyo) According to reports from here, both the United Kingdom and the United States have protested to the Japanese government regarding the anti-British movement instigated by Japan in Japan and China. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that Ambassador Craigie notified the Japanese government that under the current circumstances, it would be difficult for Britain to continue negotiations with Japan, and that the Japanese government had the power to restrain the anti-British movement and should not condone it. The Japanese side replied that the anti-British movement should not be confused with the Tokyo negotiations, and that the anti-British demonstrations were a natural expression of the people's will. Unless the actions were excessive and violated the law, the Japanese government could not restrain them. The U.S. protest stated that the anti-British movement in Japan had the intention of targeting the white race, and as a result, Americans residing in China were being subjected to sacrifices. It was hoped that Japan would restrain actions that attacked foreigners. Political figures here feel indignant that the UK and US have taken joint action, which obviously implies a demonstration of force. (Haitong, 2nd)

### Britain Does Not Yield on Economic Issues

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that the British representatives on the Economic Issues Subcommittee acknowledged yesterday the historical background of the silver reserves in Tianjin and the special nature of the economy of North China, as expressed by the concentration of foreign exchange in the Joint Reserve Bank. The above-mentioned circumstances have been clarified by both sides through the exchange of documents. However, the British representatives are still holding a strong attitude, believing that economic issues have a serious impact on the United States, France, and other countries, not just Britain. Therefore, they show no sign of acceding to Japanese demands, and believe that acceding to them would be tantamount to acknowledging the "Interim Government" rather than the Chinese government. Given the obstinate attitude of the British side, it is almost useless for the Japanese representatives to proceed with the discussion of economic issues in the Round Table Conference. In this situation, only British Ambassador Craigie and the chief Japanese representative Kato can first hold private talks to pave the way for the Round Table Conference to proceed. Therefore, the Round Table Conference could not be held today. (Reuters, 2nd)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that while the transfer of Chinese silver in the British Concession in Tianjin had been mentioned in the Tokyo talks, the Japanese government has not yet made this request. If such a request were made, the British government would consult with the governments of other countries concerned, as Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons last Monday. Although the progress of the negotiations is being notified in detail to the French and American governments at all times, such consultations have not yet taken place. It is expected that the British government will issue instructions to Ambassador Craigie within days. (Reuters, 1st)

### British Newspapers Comment on the Tianjin Silver Reserves Issue

(London) The situation in the Far East continues to be a matter of special attention in London and local newspapers. The Birmingham Post reported that the issue of Chinese legal tender is of equal importance to other countries as it is to Britain. If we also regard it as a local incident, this issue will become "a thin edge of a very wide wedge." If this matter becomes the main issue in the Tokyo negotiations, it will undoubtedly be submitted to the governments of other countries in a practical form. However, the main point of contention at present seems to be the issue of the silver reserves in the British Concession in Tianjin, which is of a more limited nature. At the same time, the rumor that the British government intends to hand over the four Chinese who caused the Tianjin incident to the Japanese side can also be denied. No decision has been made at present, nor is it intended to be considered in the near future. The News Chronicle also published similar solemn remarks. The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Mail commented on the recognition of the Chinese puppet government and the currency issue, saying that the Tokyo negotiations have clearly encountered a setback. French Ambassador to Japan Henri notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that the French government attaches great importance to this issue, and that if negotiations are held, a French representative must be present. London officialdom has firmly denied the news spread by the Japanese side that the British government has agreed to transfer the silver of the Central Government stored in the banks of the British Concession in Tianjin. According to the Tokyo correspondent of The Times, regarding the historical aspect of the silver issue, the Japanese side claimed that the silver reserves do not belong to the Chinese government but to the former Peiping local government. Because the Peiping government is now succeeded by a new regime under Japanese patronage, the silver reserves should legally belong to the new "government." According to Reuters, various Chinese circles in London do not feel seriously troubled by the currency or silver issues. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Japanese Foreign Minister and Finance Minister Exchange Opinions

(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and Japanese Envoy Plenipotentiary Kato met at the Tokyo Club from 4:45 PM to 6:10 PM today. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, Foreign Office official Sawada, Finance Minister Ishiwata, and Finance Office official Ono also gathered today to exchange opinions on various economic issues in Tianjin. Regarding the Japanese request that the British side prohibit the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the Tianjin Concession and hand over the Chinese silver in the hands of British banks, the Japanese side believes that Craigie must obtain instructions from his own government before he can make any statements. (AP, 2nd)

### Police Affairs Subcommittee Met Yesterday

(Tokyo) Apart from the subcommittee on discussing police affairs in Tianjin, no other meetings were held today. It is said that this was necessary to extract the records of past resolution meetings. At the same time, Japanese newspapers all say that Britain now holds a difficult-to-understand and strong attitude towards the issues of legal tender and silver reserves, apparently disregarding the principles of the Arita-Craigie Agreement. The newspapers also draw attention to the "skillful" policy "that Britain is good at," attempting to threaten Japan by uniting with the United States. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Tokyo) Counsellor Todd of the British Embassy in Japan visited Mr. Kurihara, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 11:00 AM this morning for half an hour. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Tokyo) Minister Kato and British Ambassador Craigie met at the Tokyo Club at 4:45 PM on the 2nd to discuss how to proceed with the Anglo-Japanese talks in the future. The talks ended at 6:10 PM. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Chang Pengchun Flies from US to UK; Recalls US Abolition of Treaty; Had Long Talk with US Secretary of State Before Departure

(London) Professor of Chinese University and member of the People's Political Council, Mr. Chang Pengchun, arrived in England today by Yankee Clipper flying boat from New York, becoming the first Chinese to fly across the Atlantic. Mr. Chang told the Reuters reporter who visited him that his trip was only slightly delayed because the flying boat stopped in Newfoundland for a day. He initially did not fully believe that the U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty would prove to be a turning point in the war. Before leaving the U.S., Mr. Chang had a long talk with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. President Roosevelt was too busy with political affairs to meet him, but Hull relayed a letter stating, "I am very happy to know that you have good news to bring to the United States." Mr. Chang also told the Reuters reporter that at the last moment before his departure from the U.S., he was very uneasy. At that time, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee was discussing Senator Vandenberg's resolution in favor of abolishing the U.S.-Japan treaty, but some people expressed opposition, and the result was yet to be determined. It was not until the evening that he learned that the majority supported the abolition of the treaty, so President Roosevelt decided to act, and the notice of abolition was announced that evening. Although this matter had the above-mentioned process, it was still generally regarded as surprising. The British ambassador did not know about this until the next morning. Mr. Chang continued, stating that there were two main reasons for the U.S. abolition of the treaty: (1) The U.S. government was willing to do its best to avoid actually provoking war and undermining peace, and to issue a direct warning to all dictators; (2) The U.S. government wanted to use this to express the American people's feelings about Japan's invasion of China. According to Mr. Chang, who has traveled all over the U.S. in recent months, the trend of the majority of the American people supporting action against Japan has undoubtedly been advancing day by day. It is said that the abolition of the treaty was unanimously welcomed by newspapers of all factions. President Roosevelt has clearly accomplished a popular thing. Mr. Chang also said that the U.S. is naturally very cautious about this decision to abolish the treaty. There is a very noteworthy feature at present, that is, all officials are strictly silent. The last time he was in the U.S., U.S. officials were discussing all aspects of the Chinese war. Now they have decided to act and no longer want to talk in vain. Mr. Chang also said that the experts of the U.S. government are now studying two points regarding the abolition of the treaty: (1) the issue of continuing to purchase surplus silver from Japan, which Japan wants to use to make up for its trade deficit in purchasing raw materials from the U.S.; (2) the tariff issue for Japanese goods exported to the U.S., such as cloth and raw silk. Mr. Chang concluded by saying that he believes that the meaning of the U.S. abolition of the treaty is actually an invitation to Britain to take the same action. If Britain cannot take a firm attitude in the Far East, the U.S. will be extremely disappointed. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Ambassador Guo Presents Memorandum to Britain Regarding Silver Reserves Issue Reaffirming Government's Attitude

(London) According to the political correspondent of the Yorkshire Post, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has, upon the instructions of the National Government, delivered a memorandum to the British Foreign Office. The memorandum first raised the issue of the silver reserves in the Tianjin Concession. The amount of silver deposited by Chinese in British and French banks in Tianjin is very large, worth as much as £800,000. The British government had previously stated that the scope of the Tokyo negotiations would not extend beyond the issue of the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin and related incidents. Therefore, if the Anglo-Japanese negotiations discuss the issue of the transfer of silver reserves, it would clearly exceed the scope and be difficult to avoid going back on its word. The correspondent also stated that last night, when Ambassador Guo delivered the memorandum, he met with Foreign Secretary Halifax to reaffirm the attitude of the Chinese government. The Foreign Secretary assured that the British government is determined to respect China's rights and interests regarding the monetary system. It is heard that in the memorandum sent by Ambassador Guo, the strongest criticism was directed at the British recognition that the Japanese army in China has certain rights and interests due to maintaining order and protecting its own safety. China believes that the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory is a violation of sacred treaties and has no justifiable reason. (Haitong, 2nd)

Editorial

### New China's Economic Construction Movement

China's economic development during the past twenty-five months of war has created a new era in history. Before the war, China's economic situation was generally more prosperous in the coastal areas, while the inland areas were mostly poor. After the outbreak of the war, although the economic organizations in the coastal areas were destroyed by artillery fire, the economic center of gravity gradually shifted to the inland areas. As a result, the inland areas have transformed from poverty to prosperity, and have gradually entered the stage of industrialization from purely agricultural production. Thus, the economic activities in the inland areas, on the one hand, supported the huge financial consumption during the war period; on the other hand, they shouldered various construction tasks. The greatness of its power and the speed of its development cannot be estimated by anyone.

The government has not yet been able to make a concrete and detailed report on the economic development of the inland areas; however, by examining various scattered materials, one can get a general glimpse of the general status of its activities. First of all, in terms of transportation, the transportation in the northwest and southwest has always been backward. Now, on the land side, highways are distributed like a spider web, among which the Northwest Highway and the Burma Road have become international trunk lines. It is estimated that in the past two years, the newly built highways in the southwest have reached 7,500 miles. In terms of railway construction, in addition to the old Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, there are also the Xukun, Yunnan-Burma, Chengyu, Xianggui, Xiangqian, Dianqian, Chuanqian, and Chuankang Railways, which have either been opened to traffic or are still under construction. The Mengsu Railway has recently been completed in the Northwest. The Longxin, Baoning, Baocheng, and Baolan lines are still being planned or constructed. Air transportation has been connected with the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Secondly, in terms of industry, the inland areas, which were once regarded as barren, can now hear the rumbling of machines everywhere. For example, the ancient city of Chongqing has now become a newly emerging industrial city. According to a survey by the China National Economic Research Institute, in the past two years, there have been 472 factories in the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan with newly created industries with capital of more than 20,000 yuan. In terms of agriculture, the government has recently devoted itself to the reform of agricultural technology and agricultural loans. According to a report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, agricultural products have increased greatly in recent years. For example, wheat in Shaanxi increased by 12 million dan last year compared to the previous year, and cotton in Sichuan increased by more than 900,000 dan last year. In terms of mining, the underground in the northwest and southwest contains various large amounts of resources, and the government is still working on development. For example, gold in Xikang, and oil and coal in Sichuan and Shaanxi are all being actively mined. In terms of commerce, due to the government's legal management, such as the balance of prices, the adjustment of transportation production and sales, and the control of exports and imports, foreign trade has become a surplus under the various customs controlled by the government. At the same time, domestic trade has also become increasingly prosperous with the prosperity of various industries in the country. China's inland areas are the richest treasure house, but in the past they were neglected by the Chinese people for various reasons. Now, due to the War of Resistance, they can be developed as much as possible, which is not necessarily a blessing in disguise for the Chinese nation. President Chiang Kai-shek recently stated when meeting with foreign reporters that China is now capable of fighting the war independently in terms of military affairs and economy without relying on foreign aid, which shows that the entire economy has had an amazing development!

In the economic construction movement to create a new China, the most active force is naturally the government, which is in charge of the overall plan for resisting the war and building the country. She is making continuous efforts to achieve the greatest achievements in various economic activities under state ownership. This year, in order to focus on economic construction, the government issued 600 million yuan of construction bonds as a fund for various state-owned enterprises. For private enterprises, the government guides and encourages the people in various ways. For example, in order to develop industry, the government has guided the people to engage in the industrial cooperative movement. It is said that in the seven months after the establishment of the China Industrial Cooperative Association, more than 300 industrial cooperatives were established in the northwest and southwest to help the people engage in various small-scale industries. The second is the hard work and efforts of the people of the whole country. Overseas Chinese and residents in various places have tried their best to transfer funds to the inland areas, and various scientific and technical personnel have not avoided sacrifices to serve their motherland. Malaria is rampant in the southwestern border areas, which has always been regarded as a daunting task. Now, many entrepreneurs and scientists have gone to investigate and survey. This patriotic spirit is no less than that of soldiers who charge into battle. In addition, international assistance is also a major driving force. The construction of many important transportation projects relies on the investment of friendly countries. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund has helped the Chinese government to investigate resources in various border areas and train various technical talents, which has made indelible contributions.

At present, only a part of the people in the occupied areas seem to have not yet exerted their full efforts in this new economic construction movement promoted by the entire nation. Some of them escape with funds to the concessions to engage in various speculative activities; others escape to foreign countries in order to seek future security; or they temporarily suspend production in order to quickly restore peace. They do not use useful funds to help the government engage in the national construction movement, which is inevitably a loss to the country. From the perspective of current interests, all economic activities in the occupied areas not only have no opportunity for development, but also have extremely great dangers. Japan's blockade of the entire Chinese coast will inevitably cut off trade between Europe and the United States and China. In order to prevent aiding the enemy, the Chinese government will also strengthen the economic isolation of the occupied areas. If the economic relations between the occupied areas and domestic and foreign countries are cut off, what way out is there! What's more, all economic activities in the occupied areas are completely under the control of others. For example, industry uses the name of "cooperation," which is tantamount to offering assets to others. The purchase, transportation, and sales of agricultural products cannot escape the oppression of so-called "control." According to reports, Suiyuan has been forced to grow opium in order to extract exorbitant taxes, causing great losses to farmers, which is a clear example. As for transportation related to military transport, it is entirely under control, which goes without saying. In short, in the current process of New China's resistance to the war and national construction, if the people in the occupied areas want to save themselves, they must first save their own country and use their own blood and sweat to promote the economic construction movement of New China. In Shanghai, a special environment where floating capital is concentrated, wealthy people should rise up to find ways to promote it, and the harvest of practical effects can be guaranteed.

### British Credit Loan to China: Negotiations Approaching Maturity; Technical and Minor Issues Awaiting Chinese Response Before Decision; Secretary of Commerce Stanley Answers Questions in the House of Commons

(London) Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today, in response to questions, that negotiations on proposals to guarantee British manufacturers' exports to China have been ongoing for some time, and that certain technical and legal issues are still under consideration. The questioner was Labor MP Henderson, who asked whether the British government had proposed guarantees to the Chinese government, to aid China, for the purchase of British goods in accordance with agreements between the British government and other governments. After Stanley's response, Henderson further asked whether he would make a statement before the House adjourns on August 4. Stanley replied that he could not specify when he would speak, as there were technical and legal issues, some of which depended on receiving a response from China. Henderson asked if these were not particularly important issues, as the Chinese government's purchases had been restricted for the past eighteen months. Stanley replied that it depended on the response received. (Reuter, 1st)

Treasury Secretary Attaches Importance to Chinese Statements

During the House of Commons session in London today, Labor MP Belenger questioned Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon regarding a statement issued on June 8 by the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee concerning Chinese legal tender, which stated, "There will be no problem with the authorities' ability to maintain foreign exchange." He asked if this could still represent the opinion of the British government. The Chancellor replied that this statement was not issued by the British government, and the British government had not expressed any opinion on the future exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. Belenger then recalled that the Chancellor had previously cited the aforementioned statement from Hong Kong, including its wording, and stated that he did not know if the Chancellor had any intention in citing this statement, knowing that the Chinese legal tender had continued to depreciate since his citation. The Chancellor replied that, as he recalled, Belenger had asked for information, and he had provided the statement issued by China. Belenger further asked what the Chancellor meant by mentioning this statement, even though he did not consider it entirely accurate. The Chancellor replied that he considered most of the statement to be a declaration about future conditions, and that one must pay attention to the opinions expressed by the relevant national authorities regarding their own currency. (Reuter, 1st)

No Change in Policy Towards China

Following the explanations of financial and commercial perspectives on China policy by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and Secretary of Commerce Stanley yesterday, various morning newspapers prominently commented, asserting that other countries' attempts to prevent Britain from economically assisting China had no further effect. The diplomatic affairs reporter for the London Times declared, "While the statements of Chancellor Simon and Secretary Stanley contain nothing new or surprising, they are accurate considering that certain countries, including Germany, have entered into commercial agreements with China during its difficult times. However, there have been misunderstandings regarding the preliminary agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, with some even claiming that Britain is no longer assisting China, making these statements beneficial. The British government's desire to maintain its original China policy, while also establishing temporary measures with the Japanese authorities in North China, demonstrates sincerity. In essence, these temporary measures do not constitute a policy, merely establishing 'rules' for daily relations between Britain and Japan." The Financial News reported, "Well-informed sources here generally believe that the British government will again provide export credit loans to China, and its attitude towards Chinese trade and currency issues has not fundamentally changed, which can be demonstrated here. However, the response from Japan and the impact of the negotiations underway in Tokyo on Anglo-Japanese relations are of interest here." (Havas, 2nd)

British Lending to Japan

During the House of Commons session in London this afternoon, opposition Labor MP Price questioned Chancellor Simon, "Japan is purchasing wool and other raw materials from the Commonwealth of Australia, financed by loans from certain banks in London. Is the Chancellor aware of this? And can he take necessary measures to halt such financial assistance, and have Britain purchase a portion of this wool and raw materials for its own war preparations?" Chancellor Simon replied, "I do not believe the claim that London banks have increased the amount of credit extended to Japan." (Havas, 1st)

Importance of Supporting Chinese Legal Tender

A political correspondent for the London Financial News, referring to Secretary of Commerce Stanley's statement in the House of Commons that proposals to provide guarantees to British manufacturers to benefit exports to China have been under consideration for some time, stated that well-informed sources therefore expect the British government to eventually lend export credit to China, as this would demonstrate that Britain's attitude towards the trade and financial situation in China has not fundamentally changed. Many believe that if Japan attempts to force Britain to abandon its support for Chinese legal tender as the price for resolving the Tianjin incident, Britain's stance on this will be a major test of its future policy towards China. France has indicated that it will support and align with any action Britain takes on this issue. The British government is currently awaiting Washington's opinion on this matter. There is a strong sentiment in political circles that if Britain concedes to Japan's monetary demands, Tokyo will achieve a significant diplomatic victory, and Britain's prestige in the East will suffer severe damage. The most relevant sectors in this city are currently giving close consideration to the issue of Britain's support for Chinese legal tender. What can be said now is that the representatives of British trade and finance strongly advocate for continued support, even if this involves various difficulties, it is worth doing. Many feel that Japan's control of exports and customs revenue, as well as the flight of Chinese capital, seem to require a large expenditure to maintain the stability of the legal tender. At the same time, it is also felt that the Chinese government can still find ways to close major loopholes. One point that should be clearly stated is that supporting legal tender is only a matter of a limited time. Because existing signs show that Japan's economic exhaustion is not far off. Well-informed sources also point out that even if the equalization fund is replenished, these increased resources will be lost again. However, this loss is insignificant compared to all British assets and interests in China. If China is incorporated into the yen bloc, British assets and interests in China will not be protected and will never be recovered. If the foreign exchange controls currently imposed by Japan in North China are allowed to extend to other parts of China, British trade with China, which was more than 15 million pounds even under last year's wartime conditions, will be lost without hope of recovery, and British capital in China, estimated at as much as 250 million pounds, will also be difficult to maintain. All these reasons are sufficient to show the necessity for Britain to continue to independently assist China's foreign exchange. All parties are now urging that Britain should take joint action with other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain the open door in China. (Reuter, 2nd)

### Chongqing Newspaper Praises America's Treaty Abolition

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News today praised the attitude of the New York Times, Washington Star, and Baltimore Sun newspapers toward the U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, stating that "the American public's unanimous support for the U.S. government's action to abolish the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty cannot be called a great event in history, because this is how the United States expresses its attitude toward Japanese aggression, whether from a moral standpoint or from its own interests, it has reached the point of being unbearable." It also stated that "since the European War, although the United States has always adopted the traditional policy of not interfering in other people's affairs in Europe, it has often adopted a policy of active leadership in the Far East. The U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is a powerful action by the U.S. against Japan. Since Washington sent a dispatch to Tokyo last winter, requesting Japan to maintain the open door policy, the U.S.'s Far East policy has become clearer. We firmly believe that in the second half of this year, the U.S. will definitely adopt a more severe policy towards Japan. Finally, the U.S.'s decision to take action against Japan and the improvement of international relations are also due to our resolute resistance and unyielding efforts, so we firmly believe that if we can do our best to engage in the war of resistance, international assistance will definitely continue to come until we achieve final victory." (Reuter, 2nd)

### High Prices in Chongqing City

(Chongqing) The cost of living here is getting more and more expensive. "Three Cannon Tower" cigarettes are now sold for four yuan per can, brandy is forty yuan per bottle, beer is five yuan per bottle, the price of rice has risen by two yuan in one month, and is now sold for fifteen yuan per stone. Leather shoes used to be sold for less than ten yuan per pair, but now they exceed thirty yuan. A box of 25 "Corona" cigars is now sold for around one hundred yuan. Gasoline is sold for eight yuan per gallon, and cannot be purchased without a government permit. (Reuter, 2nd)

### British Female Missionary Stripped in Kaifeng

(Beiping) Information received here indicates that two British female missionaries were stripped of their clothes in front of a Japanese or Korean man while en route through Kaifeng, which is under Japanese occupation. They were traveling with another British missionary and a Dane from Xi'an to Beiping. At the same time, the local "Anti-British Committee" sent letters to 516 Chinese servants in Beiping's British community and British shops, informing them that if they did not resign, they would be dealt with in a final action. Some Chinese servants have resigned as a result. The British Embassy has lodged representations with the Japanese Embassy. (Reuter, 2nd)

### Japanese Troops Invading Westward from Xinyang Crushed and Retreating by Chinese Troops; Fierce Fighting in Xia County, Shanxi Province; Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Central China Confirmed; Quiet Front on the Northern Hunan Front

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, a Japanese detachment advancing westward from Xinyang has been crushed by Chinese forces and is now retreating. Meanwhile, Japanese troops attacking Chinese positions west of Yuezhou, toward Xitangshagang and Huangmiao (transliterated), since July 25, have been checked by Chinese forces. In Shanxi Province, fierce fighting is occurring in Xia County, southern Shanxi, but the situation for Chinese forces in that area appears increasingly favorable. (Associated Press, 2nd)

(Hong Kong) Foreign sources confirm that Japanese troops in Central China have undertaken a large-scale withdrawal. Military sources report that two Japanese divisions have recently been transferred to Pukou, then transported north by rail. Heavy artillery units have also been seen, reportedly heading to Manchukuo. Many Japanese troops from South China have been deployed to Yulin Port on Hainan Island, where a submarine base is being constructed.

International Red Cross Society: Relief Expenses in China for the First Half of the Year Reach Over 300,000 Yuan; Mostly Donated by Individuals from Britain and America; Mostly Used for Refugee Relief

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese Committee of the International Red Cross spent 339,926 yuan for relief in China in the first half of this year, of which 60 percent was for refugee relief expenses, the funds were used to subsidize hospitals for refugee disease treatment, or to subsidize various refugee children's homes and refugee relief organizations. The funds donated by the Hankou branch and the medicines donated to various hospitals are not included. The Committee's funds and medicines were mostly donated by individuals from Britain and the United States. The establishment of this organization was initiated by Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling in September 1937. The number of hospitals subsidized by the association reached 80, accommodating 4,000 wounded soldiers, and their locations are all over the place, so air raid refugees in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou have been beneficiaries. In total, each patient received more than five jiao of donations from the Red Cross Committee per day, and discharged patients were also able to receive a medical subsidy of one jiao per day. According to the initiator of this association, Madame Chiang Kai-shek Soong Mei-ling, and former Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen, and former British Consul in Hankou, Mus, after the Committee headquarters moved to Guiyang, it has been presided over by former Tsinghua University President Zhu Jun as the president, and Guizhou Provincial Government Chairman Wu Dingchang as the honorary president.

### Japanese Planes Spy on Chongqing

(Chongqing) It was learned yesterday that two Japanese reconnaissance planes spied over Chongqing yesterday afternoon, flying extremely high. The weather was bad yesterday afternoon, with dense clouds and unclear vision. The Japanese planes were not detected by Chinese forces until they were about to reach Chongqing. Because they were not carrying bombs, no alarm was sounded. Chinese planes took off to intercept, but the Japanese planes fled east immediately after the engagement. (Reuter, 2nd)

(Chongqing) According to sources here today, Tianbai (transliterated), 65 miles east of Guangzhou Bay, was bombed by Japanese planes. A middle school was destroyed. Also, Japanese planes bombed Yongpingzhen, 35 miles northeast of Yan'an. However, although Japanese planes reconnoitered Yichang four times yesterday, they did not drop bombs. (Associated Press, 2nd)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, when Japanese planes bombed Guilin this Monday, a French Catholic church and its hospital were completely destroyed by the Japanese. No fewer than seven bombs hit the church buildings and the hospital itself (Associated Press, 2nd)

Once this village is completed, all retired soldiers of the Tang Enbo unit who participated in the Nankou campaign can live there for free. The groundbreaking ceremony for the village is scheduled for August 8, the third anniversary of the Nankou campaign. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### German Widow Mrs. Taulder in Qingdao Forced to Relocate by Japanese Troops; Small Apartment Operated by Mrs. Taulder Occupied; German Community in Qingdao Extremely Indignant

(Qingdao) Mrs. Taulder, a German widow who has been operating a small apartment here for 30 years, was forced to move out by Japanese troops on July 27. Mrs. Taulder's livelihood depended entirely on the income from this small apartment. After this blow, she suffered a great mental shock and seemed to be insane. The German consulate sent her to a hospital in the city for treatment. It is reported that the Japanese have coveted Mrs. Taulder's house for 18 months. In the meantime, she had been repeatedly warned by the authorities, ordering her to hand over the house, claiming that the house belonged to the former Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and should be returned to the Japanese. However, Mrs. Taulder repeatedly refused the Japanese request, stating that she had leased the house from a certain owner and that her livelihood depended entirely on it. On July 27, the Japanese broke into her house, threw out all her furniture, and finally drove Mrs. Taulder out. Mrs. Taulder had nowhere to go and stayed at the German consulate for a few days before resting in a certain hospital. It is reported that the German community here is extremely indignant about this matter. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Chinese Entering Shameen in Guangzhou Still Subject to Inspection

(Guangzhou) Chinese people entering and leaving the British and French concessions in Shameen are still subject to strict inspection. Reuters staff residing in the city have recently had to wait in line for inspection every morning, taking as long as three hours to enter Shameen. The Japanese have offered varying explanations for the inspections. The Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou stated that the purpose was to prevent local currency from being smuggled into Shameen for speculative purposes, while a Japanese spokesman told reporters that the measure was to ensure that all Chinese passing through the British concession were vaccinated against the plague. The Japanese have also published an article on the matter, stating that since the outbreak of the plague in Hong Kong, there have been 256 cases and 200 deaths. The British authorities are very concerned about the epidemic and have collected a compulsory vaccination fee of five cents from each resident, but this has failed to reduce the epidemic. They are now planning to move impoverished Chinese people away from Hong Kong, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the Chinese with the Hong Kong authorities. It is reported that some Chinese, in order to avoid inspection, are traveling by small boat to the Eastern Embankment from the concession, but they are also being stopped by the Japanese, as the waterways are now patrolled by the Japanese. According to some foreigners in Shameen, the Japanese's strict inspections are the starting point for isolating the foreign concessions. However, Reuters has learned from the Japanese consulate and the Japanese military authorities that the Japanese have no such intention. At the same time, rumors that Chinese employees of British businesses and British homes have been threatened, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Reuter, 2nd)

### Four Banks Form Committee to Control Remittances

(Chongqing) According to sources close to the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China are now establishing a domestic remittance control committee under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance to restrict the flow of legal tender from areas controlled by the National Government to the coastal areas. However, remittances required for the purchase of goods within the scope of import restriction regulations are still permitted. It is reported that the committee will begin work next week. All remittances from the interior to the coastal areas, including funds to Shanghai, must be reviewed by the committee. Remittances required for the purchase of goods must comply with the import restriction regulations. In other words, remittances are only allowed for goods that are essential for people's livelihoods. The procedure is that when remitting funds, the remitter must first state the purpose and use of the remittance. The committee will then investigate the seller in the coastal area to confirm the statement, and then the remittance will be approved. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Floods in Disaster Area Between Beiping and Tianjin

### Organization of the British, French and Soviet Front Against German Dissension; Soviet Union Explains Reason for Negotiation Stagnation; Definition of Aggression Should Not Leave Room for Loopholes; Germany Plans to Lure the Soviet Union to Neutrality, But Its Plan is Difficult to Achieve

(London) Regarding the progress of the negotiations for a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, a correspondent for the News Chronicle stationed in Berlin recently wired stating, "According to reliable sources, German leader Hitler and his entourage are currently considering a plan. The content of this plan involves Germany guaranteeing the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union guarantees neutrality in future wars, as a condition of exchange. The German side attaches great importance to the possibility of breaking apart the Soviet Union from Britain and France. If this plan succeeds, the wavering members of the British Conservative Party, who do not want to act too hastily, will certainly use all their strength to advocate for immediate, strong action. On the other hand, if the Soviet Union agrees to remain neutral, the current crisis between Germany and Poland will break out immediately, and Germany will certainly take sudden action. Conversely, if the Soviet Union refuses to accept this German plan, Hitler will not abandon the various demands he has made to Poland, but will seek other ways to achieve his goals," (Havas, 2nd)

(Moscow) According to reports, British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in Parliament on July 31 that the British government has strived to quickly eliminate various distinctive differences between Britain and the Soviet Union, and the main issue is whether we should infringe on the independence of the Baltic states. Butler said, "I agree that we should not do so, and the main reason for the delay in negotiations lies in formal differences." TASS is hereby ordered to declare that if Butler indeed said this, it is a misrepresentation of the Soviet government's attitude. The actual difference does not lie in the question of whether to infringe on the independence of the Baltic states, as both sides have agreed to guarantee this independence. Rather, it lies in the definition of "indirect aggression," which should not leave loopholes for aggressors attempting to harm the independence of the Baltic states. The British definition leaves such loopholes, which is one of the reasons for the delay in negotiations. (TASS, 1st)

(London) Regarding the negotiations between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British military delegation will depart for Moscow on the 5th or 6th of this month. (Havas, 2nd)

(Paris) General Dumonck, commander of the garrison of Lille, has been ordered to lead a military delegation to Moscow to hold talks with representatives of the staff officers of Britain and the Soviet Union. He was recently received by Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier. The content of the talks was not disclosed. Afterwards, General Dumonck also participated in an important technical meeting to discuss the procedures for the Moscow talks. (Havas, 1st)

(London) An official announced that the size and scope of the British military delegation sent to Moscow are even greater than what Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday. The representatives are scheduled to gather here tomorrow and hold a meeting before departure, chaired by Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. They will then travel to Paris on the 3rd or 4th of this month to meet with members of the French military delegation before heading to Moscow. Soviet officials are somewhat disappointed that there are no more prominent figures in the British military delegation. However, they are also pleased that the representatives are all technical experts who can conclude a concrete agreement with the Soviet staff officers regarding measures to prevent "indirect aggression," and it is hoped that practical terms can be established. However, it is stated that the military and political agreements of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must be established simultaneously. Individuals in the British government state that the definition of "indirect aggression" recently proposed by Soviet People's Commissar Molotov is still too rigid. Britain and France are about to propose a counter-proposal that takes into account various forms of indirect aggression, similar to Germany's treatment of Bohemia and Moravia as protectorates, while still respecting the independence of the Baltic states. (Havas, 1st)

### Britain Abandons Appeasement Policy, Relying Solely on Facts for Advancement and Retreat

(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden wrote to the people of his constituency, saying, "The policy of appeasement has been deeply buried. The government is now engaged in a policy of establishing a peace front to resist continued acts of aggression. In the coming weeks, there will undoubtedly be a series of rumors, some optimistic and some pessimistic. Others will assure us that there is no crisis of war and will threaten us with the dangers we will encounter if we do not act as they instruct. However, this kind of strategy is not liked by the British people. We will no longer trust promises and guarantees, but will rely solely on facts for advancement and retreat. The responsibility of British politicians today is to make the rulers and people of Germany and Italy recognize our unwavering determination. If we can do this and make others understand the true nature of the British people, war will not occur." (Reuters, 2nd)

### Germany Plots and Plans to Seize Danzig; Troops Concentrated and Awaiting Orders; Plans to be Implemented Step by Step

Danzig: Germany has already practiced troop drills in the suburbs of the city, completing the first step in its plan to reclaim Danzig. It is reported that the Germans are now trying to gain economic control of Danzig. It is generally believed that their primary goal is to remove the Polish customs inspectors on the border between Danzig and East Prussia and allow German goods to enter freely. The Danzig newspapers controlled by the National Socialist Party are currently making this demand. The first Jewish concentration camp in Danzig has been opened in the border area, employing hundreds of Jews in the camp to build barracks, paying them low wages, providing ample food, and treating them relatively well. (Reuters, 2nd)

(London) Polish sources here claim that there are currently 15,000 troops in the Free City of Danzig, of which 8,000 have recently infiltrated the city from Germany. In addition, Germany has concentrated 400,000 troops in Bohemia and Moravia. All of this indicates that the Danzig issue is about to become tense. Furthermore, news from Berlin states that the garrison of the German western "Siegfried" Line is already at full strength, which suggests that relations between Poland and Germany are likely to become strained.

### 150,000 Italian Army Troops Conduct Exercises in the Po River Basin; Mountain Warfare Targets France as the Hypothetical Enemy; Simultaneously, German Air Force Studies in the Northwest

(Rome) The Italian army began large-scale exercises in the Po River basin at midnight today. The participating forces include several corps of mechanized and "armored" units, as well as thirty battalions of Fascist Party militia, totaling 150,000 troops. General Bastico, a mountain youth officer (who participated in the civil war in Spain), is in command. Italian Undersecretary of the Army Pariani, Air Force Chief Valerio, Chief of the General Staff Badoglio, and Governor of Italian Libya Balbo are serving as judges. German Chief of the General Staff Halder, Hungarian Chief of the General Staff Werth, and a Spanish military delegation have also come to observe. Several days prior to the exercise, Italian army authorities had taken various military measures in the Po River basin, and troops were stationed at all important strongholds. Heavy trucks, artillery units, and infantry and cavalry units were constantly on the move. This exercise focuses on defending against an attack from France, assuming that the enemy is attacking Turin from the Alps and, after breaking through the Italian defense lines at Mont Cenis and Little St Bernard Pass, is invading Piedmont. The Italian army will immediately rush to the scene, fight the "enemy" on a 70-kilometer front, drive them back, and pursue them westward across the Alps. The exercise will then conclude. According to military experts here, the Italian mechanized forces only showed their prowess briefly during the Spanish Civil War, and the number of troops participating at that time was not enough to accurately determine their effectiveness. Therefore, a large number of mechanized units have been mobilized in this exercise to test their operation and deployment to the front lines as if joining a battle. (Havas, 1st)

(Berlin) The German Air Force is conducting large-scale exercises in the northwest near Oldenburg, which will continue until the 5th of this month. The theme of the exercise assumes that a western country, i.e., the "Blue" country, is at war with the "Red" country, which is located east of the Elbe River. Between them is a "Green" country that maintains neutrality and is respected by both belligerents. To the north is a "Yellow" country whose neutral status has been violated by the "Red" country. The "Blue" country's air force then flies over the airspace of the "Yellow" country and engages in fierce aerial combat with the "Red" country's air force. Regarding the results of this aerial combat, the official here recently issued a communique stating, "The anti-aircraft artillery was extremely effective during the exercise, and the barrier network formed by reconnaissance aircraft was also very effective."

### British Admiralty Announces Expansion of Shipbuilding Program; Adding 180 Ships of Various Sizes; Estimated Cost of £11 Million

(London) Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty Shakespeare stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Labour MP Ammon that the government has decided to greatly increase the 1939 naval shipbuilding program, which will include 107 net-laying vessels for minesweeping and anti-submarine defense, of which 20 will be specially built for this purpose. The other 87 will be purchased as old ships or modified. The estimated cost of this increase is £11 million. Shakespeare continued, "Our shipbuilding program is subject to the events of the program announced earlier this year, as departing from this program would violate naval limitation treaties." Shakespeare also said that in addition to the aforementioned minesweepers, it is also proposed to build 56 whaling ship-type warships for patrol and anti-submarine defense, as well as 10 more minesweepers, 6 barrage defense ships, and 1 cable ship. Therefore, the total number of new ships in the above plan is 180, and a floating dock that can accommodate small ships of up to 5,000 tons has already been purchased. In addition, there are plans in progress, but details cannot be announced at this time, but they will be announced as soon as possible. The funds for this increase in shipbuilding will be allocated from the supplementary budget for the second half of this year. (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Fleet Visits Turkey; Receives Enthusiastic Welcome

Istanbul: A squadron of British ships, led by Admiral Cunningham's flagship "Warspite," arrived here today and anchored outside the port of the Bosphorus. The flagship was guarded by four destroyers. Almost the entire Turkish fleet, led by Admiral Okan, sailed from Izmit and welcomed the British fleet outside the Princes' Islands, escorting the fleet to its anchorage. The authorities are also preparing a grand formal welcome, which will last until Sunday, including Admiral Cunningham flying to the Turkish capital Ankara to attend a formal banquet and meet with the Turkish president. The Turkish public is extremely pleased with the British fleet's visit, and newspapers are welcoming the "British friends" with enthusiastic articles. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

### Conflicts on the Romanian-Hungarian Border; Navigation Negotiations Stalled

Bucharest: It is reported that the Romanian government has decided to sever trade relations with Hungary because of two clashes between Romanian and Hungarian patrols on the banks of the Tisza River, which divides the Romanian and Ruthenian borders, on the evening of Sunday. The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations, which had been underway for months of difficult preparations, had just resumed in Sinaia a few days ago, but have now been postponed indefinitely. According to a Romanian announcement, this conflict was caused by a Hungarian barge that violated the agreement and tried to enter Romanian territory by force. The border guards tried to stop it, but the barge did not listen, so they opened fire. The barge, with the help of the Hungarian water patrol, also returned fire. The gunfire continued throughout the night, and the number of casualties is still unknown. According to Hungarian news, the Romanian side used rifles and machine guns to fire at the Hungarian guards in the Deakso area and on a bridge over the Tisza River. The Hungarian side also returned fire, which stopped at 7:00 this morning. It is reported that one Hungarian soldier was injured. Currently, the gun muzzles on the Romanian side are all pointing towards Deakso. It is reported that the seriousness of the two conflicts on Monday night is unprecedented. Since Hungary occupied Ruthenia, the navigation of rafts has been temporarily suspended pending the conclusion of a new navigation agreement between Romania and Hungary to replace the old Romanian-Czech agreement. However, many residents of Ruthenia make a living by selling wood, so rafts often attempt to pass through the area at night, leading to frequent incidents recently. It is claimed that Hungary has proposed appointing a joint military commission to determine the cause of this shooting in order to restore normal relations in the area. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Roosevelt's New Deal Suffers Major Setback; Economic Recovery Bill Shelved in the House of Representatives

(Washington) The government had previously submitted a bill requesting Congress to allow it to spend $3 billion to promote domestic economic recovery. The Senate amended and passed this bill yesterday, reducing the amount of funds to $1,615,000,000, and immediately transferred it to the House of Representatives for discussion. The House of Representatives recently decided by a majority of 193 votes to 166 votes to temporarily not include this bill on the agenda for this session. Political figures commented that the government has suffered a major setback. (Havas, 1st)

### Recent Traffic Conditions in Guilin; The Li River is Rising and Boat Travel is Very Convenient; Guangzhou Bay is an Important Gateway to Guilin

Guilin Correspondence: Since the Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui Railway opened to traffic last year, officials from both the north and the south, as well as merchants, have gathered in Guilin. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the central government established the Southwest Headquarters in Guilin, which, together with Kunming and Chongqing, formed a three-legged situation. As a result, Guilin has become the center of military and political affairs. Those traveling to Chongqing mostly use Guilin as a hub. However, after the destruction of the roads along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, it has become difficult to travel from Guangdong to Guilin by car. Fortunately, the main provincial roads have not been destroyed, and the main lines connecting Longzhou, Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Pingle are still operating as usual. However, there is overcrowding of passengers and goods, a shortage of vehicles, and high prices. Traveling on these main roads is not something that ordinary people can afford. The only thing that sustains the traffic in Guilin is the Guilin River, also known as the Li River, and commonly known as the Fu River. It originates on the border of Hunan, flows through Quanzhou, Guilin, Yangshuo, and Pingle, and winds down to Wuzhou, where it merges with the big river. The upper reaches of the Li River are shallow and have many shoals, making it extremely difficult for ships to navigate. Ordinary transportation of goods and passengers is mostly done by civilian boats. However, every year during the spring and summer, the Li River rises, usually from April to September. During these six months, electric ferries can travel directly from Wuzhou to Pingle. Those traveling from Wuzhou to Guilin can take an electric ferry to Pingle and then transfer to a civilian boat or a bus on the Ping-Gui Highway to reach Guilin. This is relatively more convenient than other routes. Since the beginning of summer, Guilin Province has experienced continuous heavy rain, and the western rivers have risen sharply. Ships on all rivers are able to travel smoothly. Recently, electric ferries such as Donghu, Lihang, Guangli, and Yongantai have been operating between Wuzhou and Pingle. The departure times from Wuzhou and Pingle are both at 8:00 p.m. every day. Ordinary seat passengers pay 10 yuan in national currency per person, with a 20% discount. If Guilin currency is paid, it is converted to 16 yuan. Berth tickets are charged at the original price plus a 30% surcharge, which is twice as expensive as usual. It takes two days to travel from Wuzhou to Pingle by ferry. After arriving in Pingle, it takes three or four hours by bus on the Ping-Gui Highway to reach Guilin. Calculating the total time for the water and land journey from Wuzhou to Guilin, it takes at most three days to arrive, which is more economical and saves time compared to traveling from Guixian or Nanning, making it more convenient. Since the Pearl River waterway was blockaded by the Japanese army, those traveling from Guangdong to Guilin cannot travel directly up the Pearl River and must detour. They can either take a ferry from Macau through Kaiping and then turn into Zhaoqing and go up to Wuzhou, or take the route through Guangzhou Bay, passing through Suixi and Lianjiang and entering Yulin Guixian. Those traveling light with fewer luggage often take the Kaiping route, but there is a risk of encountering harassment from Japanese and puppet troops when crossing the ferry at Luzhou, but it is fast. Those with heavy luggage and many items mostly take the Guangzhou Bay route, because the roads in Guangzhou Bay are safe, and there is a Guangdong-Guangxi joint transportation station where porters can be hired to transport heavy goods and luggage. It is easier to gather them there compared to other places. Recently, most of the ordinary goods transferred from Hong Kong to Guilin are transported through Yulin via Guangzhou Bay. In effect, Guangzhou Bay has become a commercial port for Guilin Province.

### Japanese Confiscate Jiangyin Power Plant; Managed by the Central China Company

Jiangyin Correspondence: The North Gate Waihua Ming Electric Light Company's plant and machinery were not damaged when the war broke out the year before last. The power plant's organization was originally funded by Wu Tinglu and others, with each share worth 100 yuan. It is now being forcibly managed by the "Central China Electric Steam Company" organized by the Japanese. The Japanese special task force in Suzhou has notified that all holders of Hua Ming Power Plant stock certificates, in their capacity as shareholders, should contact and register with the Jiangyin puppet county government before the end of the month to discuss cooperation. Shareholders who are in other cities can be given an extension of five days until August 5. If they exceed the deadline, it will be considered abandonment, and the ownership of the power plant will be confiscated by the Japanese.

### Xinsheng Tragically Bombed

More Than 40 Students Killed; More Than 100 Residents Killed

Jiaxing Correspondence: Since the fall of Jiaxing, Xinsheng County, which belongs to Jiaxing County, has been repeatedly harassed by the Japanese army. At 3:00 p.m. on the 28th of this month, the town was attacked by two Japanese planes from Jiaxing. They circled and reconnoitered over the city before dropping more than 30 large and small bombs. A certain elementary school was bombed and destroyed. At that time, the school was in session, so all of the more than 40 students were killed. More than 100 male and female residents were also killed. Countless houses were destroyed. The reason for the bombing of the town was that on the evening of the 27th and the morning of the 28th, a large number of Chinese troops traveled by boat from Jiaxing to a certain place via Xinsheng. The traitors learned of this and secretly reported it to the Japanese. The Japanese army dispatched planes after receiving the report, resulting in the unprecedented tragedy.

### Wuxi "Puppet Government" Issues County Resident Certificates; Cumbersome Procedures Cause People to Avoid

Wuxi Correspondence: The Wuxi puppet "county government" has recently been urged by the Japanese army's special task force to issue so-called county resident certificates, following the example of Jiangyin and Wujin. The effect of the certificate is the same as a pass. Those who obtain a county resident certificate can travel to various ports without having to obtain a pass. However, the procedures for obtaining the certificate are quite difficult. Those who want to obtain the certificate must be investigated by the local "Baojia chief" and deemed to be good citizens with legitimate occupations. They must also be reviewed, and someone must be sent to secretly investigate. Then, the "Baojia chief" must be responsible for guaranteeing them before the certificate can be issued. It is said that the implementation is imminent. Those who do not obtain the certificate will not be allowed to reside there. Residents in the city are mostly outraged upon hearing the news. Also, because it is difficult to obtain a certificate, and there are many unemployed people, some have fled to the countryside, viewing residing in the city as a danger.

### Civilians Massacred at Henglin Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

Japanese Troops Unable to Find Chinese Troops; Innocent Farmers Suffer

Wujin Correspondence: The Nanjing-Shanghai train run by the Japanese army was ambushed by the troops of Zhang Shaohua and the Dadao troops of Gao Kangjiaren near Henglin Station the day before yesterday. The Japanese military cars at the front suffered heavy damage, and many people were killed. The next day, a large number of Japanese troops arrived from Nanjing and Shanghai and searched the nearby villages for traces of Chinese troops, but the Chinese troops had long since disappeared. The Japanese troops arrested about two or three hundred innocent farmers from each village, pierced a hole in the palm of their hands with a bayonet, threaded a thick lead wire through the hole, and ordered them to be taken to Nanjing. Later, a Japanese major considered that there were too many people and that they were too cumbersome, so he stabbed about 100 people to death with a bayonet at Henglin Station. It was truly a tragic sight.

### A Record of Travel in the Southwest

— Wei Ran

(1) From Hong Kong to Haiphong

Since the highways of Guangzhou Bay and Beihai have been destroyed one after another, followed by the Wen-Shan lines, which are sometimes open and sometimes closed and not very smooth, the transportation route to the southwestern provinces is now only one: the route through Haiphong. There are two ways to get to Haiphong from Shanghai. One is to first obtain a transit visa in Shanghai and take the Jardine or Taikoo direct Shanghai-Haiphong steamer. The former takes ten days, and the latter takes half a month. The other is to go to Hong Kong to apply for a visa and then take the Hong Kong-Haiphong steamer. In terms of cost, the former is cheaper, but the opposite is true in terms of time, because it sometimes takes more than a month to apply for a visa in Shanghai, but at most a week in Hong Kong.

The procedure for applying for a transit visa in Hong Kong is very simple. Upon arrival, you can immediately go to the visa officer's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong (upstairs in the Banque de l'Indochine) to obtain an application form to fill out. It must be guaranteed by someone with a fixed job in Hong Kong. After paying HK$6 and submitting three photos, you can pick up the visa in two days. However, you must sign for it in person. Then, you can apply for the French consulate's endorsement. According to their regulations, applications are only accepted from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. If you miss the deadline, you cannot make an exception. Therefore, after obtaining the visa, you must immediately go to the consulate to purchase an endorsement application form (HK$0.10 per form). It must be guaranteed by a store, and then signed and guaranteed by a bank that has business with that store. Only then will the procedure be complete. When submitting the application, attach one photo and an application fee of HK$1.00. If there are no unexpected obstacles, it should take about a week to complete. The shipping companies from Hong Kong to Haiphong are Jardine, Taikoo, and French Post. Each company has a ship sailing every three days. Among them, the Jardine ships have the largest tonnage (over 3,000 tons), and the French Post ships have the smallest tonnage (over 1,000 tons). The facilities are roughly the same. There is a significant difference in time. For example, Taikoo takes more than five days because it also stops at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. Jardine goes directly and takes 48 hours. The return trip stops at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai and takes three days. French Post goes directly and claims to take 40 hours, but in reality, it also takes two days. However, all ships mainly focus on cargo transport, and the departure dates are not very accurate. Some even delay for three or four days.

(2) The Haiphong Customs

Speaking of the Haiphong customs, travelers passing through Annam consider it to be a very headache. We have heard several terrible rumors in Shanghai and Hong Kong, such as passengers being locked in a dark room for several hours upon arrival, having every piece of luggage turned upside down, and being fined one dollar for a single match. This made us feel extremely uneasy when we stepped onto the Haiphong pier. However, after going through the inspection procedures, we felt that except for the arrogance of those in charge, it was not as bad as the rumors said. However, prior preparation is very important, especially if you do not have acquaintances in Haiphong to meet you. Otherwise, even if you do not suffer the aforementioned bizarre torments, small losses are inevitable. (To be continued)

### Ministry of Education Promotes Frontier Education: Southwest Education Inspection Team Departs

(Chongqing, 2nd) In order to actively promote frontier education, the Ministry of Education plans to organize southwest, northwest, Kang-Tibetan, and Xinjiang frontier education inspection teams to go to various frontier provinces for inspection, so as to provide reference for improving frontier education. This year, the Southwest Frontier Education Inspection Team will be organized to inspect the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. In addition to education, attention will also be paid to local society and natural science. Taking advantage of the inspection, the team will also promote the War of Resistance and the New Life Movement to the frontier compatriots, in order to awaken them. The team is now organized and held its first team meeting on the 22nd of last month, attended and guided by Gu and Zhang, the two heads of the team. All the team members have gathered in Chongqing yesterday. Minister Chen gave a speech, detailing the importance of the team's mission and the points to be noted during the inspection. The entire team members (divided into three groups: education, society, and nature) took the Jianxia ship to Yibin today, passing through Zhaotong to Kunming, and then went to work in various places in groups. After the work in Yunnan Province is completed, they will then be inspected along the way from Bose in groups, concentrated in Guilin, and transferred to various places in Guizhou for inspection. The estimated inspection period is half a year.

### Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Continued 3)

Insufficient Recruitment by Schools Does Not Prove Quality: Several Aspects Should Be Noted When Choosing Departments

Standards for Departments: The general principles for choosing departments and schools, which should be discussed and studied, have been mentioned above. These principles are not without value, but none can be used as absolute standards. Everyone's situation is different, and absolute standards cannot be listed. Now, let's first propose several more reliable viewpoints to discuss how to choose departments, and then discuss how to choose schools in the next section. When choosing departments, I think there are several aspects that should be noted for reference:

(1) Personal Talents: The talents endowed by nature are originally different for each person. This is what psychology calls "individual differences." Even if some psychologists do not recognize that people are born with differences, and say that all differences are due to acquired learning, even if it is acquired learning, these differences must be very clear by the age of high school graduation. The most subtle aspect of personality is intelligence. People who are called smart are different: some are full of imagination, some are full of mechanics, some are agile, some are slow, some have sharp intuition, and some believe only after verification. Those with intelligence biased towards imagination are better suited to engage in literature and philosophy; those with intelligence biased towards mechanics are better suited to engage in engineering and machinery; those with quick intelligence are better suited to be politicians and diplomats; those whose intelligence is based on verification and decisive after understanding are better suited to be scientists, historians, doctors, and teachers. The knowledge required for each subject is sometimes interconnected. For example, being a teacher is connected to literature, history, and philosophy; being a doctor is connected to science and engineering; studying business is connected to economics and politics; being a lawyer is connected to the talents required for studying history. However, some subjects cannot be learned without special talent. For example, when learning painting, the ability to distinguish colors must be particularly strong, and one must be able to distinguish subtle color layers; when learning music, the ability to hear sounds must be particularly strong, and one must be able to distinguish extremely subtle sound waves. Although people who study literature do not have to have special talents like painting and music, they must have particularly strong imagination to hope to engage in literary creation. Therefore, students who are good at Chinese writing in middle school cannot be sure that they are suitable for studying literature. Those whose articles are often full of fantasy can study literature; those who focus on reasoning and emphasis on argumentation are suitable to be historians or politicians. In middle school, those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry cannot be sure that they are suitable for entering the science college. Those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry and focus on theory are suitable for entering the science college; those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry and focus on application are suitable for entering the engineering college or medical college.

### Fine Collection of Western Paintings: Exhibition Opened Yesterday, Many Chinese and Western People Visited

The Fine Collection of Western Paintings Exhibition, prepared by the Shanghai Youth Art Society for four months, opened yesterday (the 3rd) on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road. It displays 598 fine oil paintings from Western European countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, England, the United States, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and other countries such as Sweden, Norway, Poland, and Hungary. They are systematically arranged and numbered in order, including the masterpieces of major artists from the Renaissance to modern times. The exquisite art is touching and moving, and it is truly rare. In addition, there are more than one hundred famous works collected in Europe by Lin Kanghou, which add even more color. Yesterday, many Chinese and Western people and artists from all over Shanghai went to visit, and all believed that it was an unprecedented event in the country. In order to make it easier for visitors to understand at a glance, the Society specially published a "Catalog" and a "Collection of Famous Paintings in Europe" to compare with the exhibits, complementing each other and leaving nothing unread. It is also heard that the Society welcomes all groups in Shanghai to visit.

### School News

Classes are held for 35 hours per week. In the second enrollment of this year, more than 160 new students and transfer students were admitted. However, the level of the transfer students is mostly felt to be unsuitable, so there are still vacancies in the first, second, third, and fourth semesters. Enrollment will continue on August 20th, and only tuition and miscellaneous fees of 16 yuan will be charged.

Xinsheng Wireless Radio School: The Xinsheng Wireless Radio School in this city has achieved remarkable results and is enthusiastic about voluntary teaching.

Peizhen Primary and Secondary School, No. 875 Haige Road, at the end of Avenue Joffre, French Concession: Peizhen Primary and Secondary School was initiated by former faculty and staff of Nanyang University, and the environment is quiet. A junior high school will be added next semester.

Nantong Middle School, No. 266 Beijing Road, Zhongyi Building: Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Middle School has recently received many applications for enrollment. Fearing that the dormitory will not be sufficient to accommodate the boarding freshmen after admission in the future, it is currently looking for school buildings near the school to expand. Moreover, when recruiting on the 5th of this month, it will first inform the candidates that if they need to board, they must go to explain immediately after the admission is announced.

### President Chiang Discusses: China Can Resist Japan Independently, No Need for Foreign Supply in Military and Economic Affairs, Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Japanese Troops Withdraw from China

Haitong News Agency: General Manager Returns to Shanghai to Report Situation to Chiang

Mr. Mesi, General Manager of Haitong News Agency in the Far East, went to Chongqing and Hong Kong a month ago to inspect the affairs of the agency. He has recently returned to Shanghai. When Mr. Mesi was in Chongqing, he met with General Chiang Kai-shek, President Kong Xiangxi, and other government officials for private talks. On his way back, Mr. Mesi visited Kunming to see the local situation.

### China Can Resist Japan Independently

According to Mr. Mesi, Chairman Chiang received him individually and held a one-hour talk. Chiang stated to him that China is now almost completely able to resist Japan independently until an indefinite period without relying on foreign supplies in military and economic affairs. At the same time, there will be absolutely no peace before the Japanese troops withdraw from China. Any mediation proposal from a third country that deviates from this basis will be difficult for China to accept.

### Sino-German Relations Are Very Satisfactory

According to Mr. Mesi, Chiang's demeanor was solemn and his attitude was kind. He was extremely sensitive to the questions raised to him, and he paid attention to events in all aspects and raised some questions himself. Chiang paid close attention to Sino-German relations and believed that they were generally very satisfactory.

### Chinese People Are United

When Chiang discussed the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he firmly declared, "There are no communists in China. The so-called Communist Party now is by no means the Communist Party in Europe. The Chinese people have united to help the whole country resist Japan. As for Sino-Soviet cooperation, it is just a relationship between two friendly countries and does not mean that China is attached to Soviet Russia."

### Economic Self-Sufficiency

Chiang continued to discuss China's military and economic reserves. He told Mr. Mesi with extraordinary confidence that China has been able to resist Japan independently for an indefinite period without relying on foreign imports in military and economic affairs. In economic terms, China has largely become self-sufficient.

### Sichuan's Territory Is Equal to Germany's

The separation of Shanghai and Hong Kong is enough to improve China's position. Although China does not have certain items, it knows how to continue to move forward. At the same time, unnecessary items can be exempted from import. Today, the whole country has become an agricultural institution, not afraid of air strikes.

### Japanese Soldiers Withdraw from North Jiangxi Road Blockade Gap

However, Obstacles Are Still Added

Residents' Relocation Has Not Yet Ended

The stores and households and alleys along North Jiangxi Road, from the south end of the Waterworks Bridge to the east end of Old Bazi Road, were suddenly surrounded by Japanese wooden poles and barbed wire fences on the 29th of last month, and the situation suddenly became tense. The surrounded residents also moved to the Central District of the Concession one after another. However, since the previous day,

The number of Japanese soldiers at the blockade gap has been greatly reduced, so the situation is quite relaxed. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Datong News Agency went to patrol again. Except that there was still a Japanese soldier guarding the blockade gap at the Chongming Road intersection, the Japanese soldiers at the two blockade gaps at the Wenjianshi Road intersection and the Haining Road intersection

The sentry post has been withdrawn, and only a few Chinese police officers remain on the outside of the barbed wire. There are more than a dozen Japanese soldiers on the section of North Jiangxi Road from Old Bazi Road to Haining Road, adding barbed wire to the blockade, as if the previous blockades

It is still not thorough enough. The open-air epidemic prevention station on the east side of Haining Road on North Jiangxi Road is still injecting epidemic prevention needles for those who are willing to stay in the area. Judging from the above situation, the Japanese side will obviously take the newly erected barbed wire area as its jurisdiction. However, the situation has become peaceful and appeasing, but the relocation situation has not diminished slightly.

### Guangxi Issues 6% Public Bonds for 8 Million Yuan

Limited to Twelve Years

Business Tax as Foundation

In order to adjust the provincial treasury revenue and expenditure in 1939, the Guangxi Provincial Government issued 8 million yuan of 6% public bonds of Guangxi Province in 1939. The interest rate is set at 6% per annum, with a term of 12 years. From 1940 to April 30, 1951, all amounts will be repaid in full. The business tax revenue of the province is designated as the foundation. The Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department, the Guangxi Provincial Government, and the Finance Department will each send a representative, and the relevant bank will recommend a representative to form a foundation custody committee. Threat. In addition, the government is now actively developing various provinces. Taking Sichuan Province as an example, its territory is equal to that of Germany, and the possibility of its development is unlimited.

### Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Japanese Troops Withdraw Completely

Finally, Chiang mentioned the issue of peace and strongly stated that "there is no hope for peace as long as Japanese troops are on Chinese territory. The purpose of China's resistance today is to expel the Japanese army. Before this goal is achieved, the Chinese government will never consider any peace talks. As for mediation, if it is not based on the above-mentioned basis, it will never be accepted by China."

### American Commercial Counselor Arnold Cruises Southwest and Returns to Shanghai

Discovers That Chongqing Has High Morale

Praises Air-raid Shelters

According to the Continental Daily, Arnold, the American commercial counselor in China, returned to the United States and stayed there for more than a year. He came to China in May and toured the southwest. He stayed in Chongqing for a week and then went to Hong Kong. He returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) afternoon on the Coolidge Presidential Liner.

### Isolationist Trend Has Indeed Disappeared

According to the talk, American public opinion is now showing a certain form. The American people are now more concerned about the Far East events and understand that the United States' rights in the East must be respected. Although the United States insists on its feeling of "we don't want to fight," the American isolationist trend has indeed disappeared. People in general want to know more about the truth of world events than before.

### Chongqing's Morale Is Highly Commendable

Mr. Arnold then talked about the Far East, saying that he saw in Sichuan that China had moved its industries in the Yangtze River basin into Sichuan Province. Although there was war, the work of conducting industrial projects was very effective. He was most impressed by this. He discovered that Chongqing's morale was very high and praised the air-raid shelters and fire streets that had been built, saying that Chongqing would build even larger and better air-raid shelters, equipped with air conditioning, beautiful music stages, electric lights, and modern lead pipe equipment, which could be called nightclubs.

### Yunnan-Burma Highway Is Sufficient for Heavy Loads

When Mr. Arnold stayed in Chongqing, although he did not encounter air raids, he said that the previous Japanese bombing obviously caused very little damage. The residents were quite calm. On the whole, Chongqing City was progressing smoothly. When Mr. Arnold stayed in China's wartime capital, he met with Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao. Mr. Arnold said that China's work to facilitate transportation is moving forward with a state of effort to the end. The Yunnan-Burma Highway has proved to be an important "portal." The road is very good and carries at least 100 tons of goods every day. Although it is frustrated by rain, transportation is not hindered.

### Mr. Arnold Awarded Honorary Doctorate

After Mr. Arnold finished talking with the reporter, he bid farewell to Admiral Yarnell, the outgoing commander of the American Asian Fleet, and his wife, who had just arrived at the customs wharf. According to reports, Mr. Arnold left Shanghai for the United States in February last year for a long vacation. During his stay in the United States, Pomona University in California awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

### Qingpu Bus Turns Back

According to transportation sources, the bus that departed from Shanghai to Qingpu yesterday was blocked and turned back en route. It is said that there were battles in the Shanghai-Qingpu highway area, and the highway was damaged. Now, in order to avoid danger, the Shanghai-Qingpu bus has stopped sailing.

### The Eastern Battlefield: Chinese Troops Begin Movement Under Orders

Training Completed and Safely Arrived at Destination

Deployment Completed, Battle Imminent

Only Minor Skirmishes in Suburban Shanghai

The Eastern Battlefield Displays a Picture of Maneuver Warfare. Regarding the Chinese troops along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, they have been actively planned by the National Government and rigorously trained in new strategies. Their strength is formidable. Advance units have already crossed the Japanese army's警戒綫 and reached the suburbs of Shanghai. In the Pudong area, guerrilla forces are launching attacks with the assistance of regular troops, also underway. The situation is as follows:

Chinese Troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

The Chinese troops responsible for counterattacking Nanjing and Suzhou have been reorganized by the highest military authority of the Eastern Battlefield. They have been given new orders, and the troops originally stationed in counties along the line have been transferred in batches to ×× area to undergo rigorous training in various new tactics. After training, they are sent back to their original posts, and then transferred again for training. Over the past eight months, all county troops have completed their training. On average, each county has trained 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese soldiers. Among them, in addition to the original scattered regular troops, young students, local strong men, and farmers accounted for more than 60%. Now, the Chinese troops in various locations have received orders from the highest authority to begin moving along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, advancing deep into the Japanese defense zone. According to merchants who have just arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, the Chinese troops are well-disciplined, with men under 40 years old. They do not commit any offenses wherever they go, and the local people are overjoyed.

Crossing the警戒綫, Safely Arriving in Suburban Shanghai

The first batch of commando raiders, numbering 2,500, are known as the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Mei Ke-di, Zhu Shou-hua, and Ren Tian-shi serve as commanders, with Deng Ben-yin as the supreme commander. One route follows the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway through Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan, turning onto the highway to Qingpu, heading towards the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, approaching Hongqiao. Another route goes through Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading, reaching Baoshan, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Luodian. It is now known that these two commando teams have crossed the Japanese army's警戒綫 along the railway and highway, safely arriving at a gathering point in suburban Shanghai ×× area, and have established contact with the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Army in Songjiang, Minhang, and Pudong. The other day, they were also spotted near the Japanese Toyota spinning mill on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, and then withdrew.

Encounter Battles After Crossing the Highway

When this commando team crossed the Kunshan-Qingpu Highway, they encountered Japanese and puppet troops. Because the team encircled and attacked from multiple routes, launching surprise attacks, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties, and many firearms were seized. Since this battle, the Japanese have been very panicked, making extensive preparations, and firing indiscriminately along the highway, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. However, the team used diversionary tactics, using sparse gunfire to lure the Japanese army, while launching surprise attacks from multiple routes. The Japanese army was unable to cope. Therefore, the recent炮聲 in suburban Shanghai is true. According to general observations, the prelude to the counteroffensive on the Eastern Battlefield is expected to begin soon.

Pudong Warfare Becomes Active

The Pudong war has fully begun. The troops responsible for attacking the Datuan area are Gu Li-feng's and Yan Zeng's units. According to the planned schedule, they began their attack at midnight on the 26th, preparing for entry into the city at 5:00 AM on the 28th. It is reported that more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed. A certain officer of Gu's unit also discovered a gasoline ship docked in the river, and quickly used kerosene and firewood to set it on fire. In less than an hour, only the hull remained.

Nanhui's Entire Territory Also Launched

The attacking troops in 新场 are Gu Shou-xin's and Wu Zhen-hai's units. At the designated attack start time, they began their advance. All key points outside the city have now been occupied, and it is reported that Zhang Miao-gen's puppet troops have defected en masse. In the Nanhui area, Xu Cheng-de's and Huang Tie-ying's units, along with other locations, launched attacks simultaneously. Land and water transportation is completely destroyed. The Japanese are defending in the city. Zhoupu is the area of Li Wen-yuan's and Xi Geng-xin's units, which now use small artillery to attack the town every night. The Japanese army is holding firm. According to people from Zhalin, the炮聲 from the Zhalin city bridge was very clear this morning.

### The Grand Opening of the Second Branch of Heming Shoes and Hats Store

### Principal and Interest of the Reconstruction Public Bonds to Be Paid by the End of This Month

Fully in Accordance with Unified Methods, Shanghai Pays in Six Installments. 金長 Has Also Scheduled a Lottery for Principal Repayment

Regarding the internal debts guaranteed by customs duties, after the Ministry of Finance stopped paying principal and interest due to tax revenue being intercepted, the National Debt Fund Management Committee consulted with the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, and agreed to discount and pay the due principal and interest. Regarding the seventh installment of principal and interest of the Reconstruction Public Bonds, totaling 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9,894,000 yuan in interest, for a total of 11,594,000 yuan, the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications will pay starting August 31st. The method is the same as for the Unified Public Bonds, with Shanghai paying in six installments, paid by匯劃票. In addition, the 12th installment of principal repayment of the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds has been scheduled for a lottery in Shanghai on September 10th. The principal repayment totals 1,125,000 yuan, along with 400,781.25 yuan in interest, payable by the three banks of China, Central, and Communications on September 30th. The method is exactly the same as for the Unified Reconstruction.

### Rice Market in Chaos Again Yesterday; Rice Merchants Attempt to Raise Prices

70-80% Involved in Under-the-Table Transactions. However, Rice and Flour Reserves Are Very Sufficient

Yesterday's publicly traded price of rice reached the maximum price limit. At the same time, under-the-table trading among brokers was extremely rampant, with the highest price reaching around 22.50 yuan. It is estimated that among the city's 105 rice shops (excluding the few management committee members who are in charge of fair transactions and have the mission of enforcing price limits and stopped buying and selling), those involved in under-the-table transactions accounted for almost 70-80%. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who went to the market for investigation yesterday morning, the black market price rose sharply again by 60-70 cents. Moreover, although囤戶 saw the price increase, they were still hoarding their inventory, hoping for further gains, and were unwilling to sell. The chaotic state of the market has returned to the situation of the middle of last month.

Visiting the Authorities

Various rice-related organizations in this city will again dispatch representatives within days to report the situation of the Shanghai rice market to the工部局 of the Public and Shared Concession, and to discuss food regulation measures to maintain the food supply within the concession. It is reported that the authorities have conducted a detailed investigation of the food supply in Shanghai. In addition to the approximately 400,000 bags of rice stored in various warehouses and firms, there are also millions of bags of flour stored, so the Shanghai food supply is adequately prepared and there is no fear of shortage. However, it is hoped that rice merchants will find ways to疏運 sources of supply from the production areas to facilitate regulation.

Announcing Rice Reserves

The survey report on rice reserves in various warehouses, conducted by the Bean and Rice Trade Association, has been completed and will be released at 4:00 PM today. As for the two concession authorities' thorough investigation of rice reserves in various warehouses, it will also be announced. Whether the quantity is相差 with the Bean and Rice Industry's investigation remains to be seen after the announcement. If there are overflowing rice reserves that have not been included in the report, then the concealment will be居奇, and the authorities will take decisive action.

Rice Merchants' Attempts

Yesterday's market transactions, except for Baiyuan Dongshuang rice and other rice without price limits, which still had a few transactions, japonica rice transactions were almost non-existent. It is reported that they were all done privately outside the market, at a price漲 of three to five-six兀 higher than the限价. According to a reporter from Xinxin News Agency, the rise in rice prices is entirely due to speculative manipulation. A part of the rice merchants are angry but dare not speak out about the工部局's enforcement of price limits, and driven by profit, they privately engage in transactions, attempting to raise rice prices in order to achieve profit-making goals.

Association Notice

The Shanghai Rice Number Industry Association reiterates to all fellow colleagues: Respectfully, the price of rice in this city is rising endlessly. The best决白粳 in the market has exceeded the price limit, black market is rampant, and it is impossible to stop. According to reports from members, goods with price limits of 20 yuan and 16 yuan are impossible to purchase in the market. If you want to buy goods exceeding the price limit, it is illegal. If you don't buy, there is no goods in the market. The inventory in the store is limited and will soon be sold out, and they are requesting a proper solution. The current chaotic situation in the market is intensifying, and black market越价 has become an open secret, impossible to curb. If our colleagues are购进 over the limit, but the stores must comply with the price limit, then购进 over the limit is not only a sacrifice, but also an illegal act, and the situation is extremely difficult. Therefore, we reiterate to all fellow colleagues, do not buy rice and grain over the limit in the market. Sales must strictly abide by the price limit and must not exceed it in any way. This matter concerns the entire city's food supply, and the 租界常局 will have appropriate measures to deal with it. Our colleagues must remain calm and await a solution. This is our sincere prayer.

### Throwing Candy and Cakes, Requesting Donations for Relief, Situation Is Somewhat Suspicious

Yesterday, in the western part of this city in Shanghai, there were people who looked like workers, throwing a food bag into each household, containing candies, cakes, and other items, and attaching a printed letter stating that they were requesting two or three角 in donations to relieve the unemployed. After residents received these items, some inquired about the true motive of the letter throwers, but they were unable to answer and left without a word. It seemed that the workers throwing the letters were not aware of the reason for this action either.

### Coastal Shipping Seized; Nanyang Routes Expanded

Foreign Vessels Mostly Diverted to Siam Ports; Shipping Booming in Singapore and 小吕宋

The Nanhua shipping routes' ports are located in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Since the fall of Shantou, shipping has been greatly affected. Currently, in Guangdong Province, only Guangzhou Bay, Beihai, and Haikou are通, but transportation to the interior is extremely inconvenient. In Fujian Province, only Xiamen is accessible, and it is isolated from the interior. Although foreign vessels intend to test航 to Xinghua and Quanzhou, it is feared that they will not succeed. For example, on the 1st of last month, a certain British vessel loaded with goods from Shanghai to Xingquan, and to this day, more than a month later, there is still no news of its return to Shanghai. Whether the vessel's passengers and goods have been吾起卸 is currently unknown. Therefore, the issue of航 to Xingquan is difficult to achieve in the near future. The report in yesterday's newspaper that Taikoo's Jiangsu轮 was going to Xinghua and Quanzhou was a misreport. The seaports in Zhejiang Province are currently only Ningbo and 处. The vessels operating there are doing average business. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Haifu轮 is also planning to join the航, and is currently applying to the authorities.

Taikoo轮 Diverted to Shanghai-Siam Route

After the Nanhua shipping routes were affected by this, shipping companies suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the central商 Taikoo Company immediately sought alternative plans. In addition to increasing航 to Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong, it has recently opened the Shanghai-Siam route. In the past, the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou vessels had gone to Siam. Now there is a third vessel, the Guiyang号, scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Siam this Sunday (the 6th), via Shantou, Hong Kong, and Tule, Saigon, and then to Bangkok. The company also newly opened the Singapore route at the end of last month. The Qingyuan轮 departed from Shanghai on the 28th of last month, also湾航 to Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay. The second轮 going to Singapore has also been assigned, the Xinjiang轮, scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and directly to Singapore next Monday (the 8th).

Jardine and Other轮 Change航 Plans

Generally, foreign shipping vessels, after encountering threats along the coast of China, had to seek new outlets and develop towards Nanyang. The British firm Jardine Matheson & Co. is also in計割中. The British vessel Hague号, managed by Qia Cheng Shen行 on Avenue Edward VII, was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong yesterday, but due to the desire to develop towards Nanyang, it was changed to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 6th, directly放航 to Singapore, Penang, and Rangoon. The Norwegian vessel Landi号, managed by Tongyi Shipping Company on the Bund, is scheduled to放航 directly to Hong Kong on the 6th. Youlita号 is scheduled to go to Singapore and Penang via Hong Kong on the 8th. The Peter Paul号 of the American Fulaizi Company, managed by Hongyun Shipping Bureau, is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and 小吕宋 on the 6th.

Bleak Scene on the Beiyang Shipping Routes

Various foreign shipping companies are developing new航錢 to Nanyang one after another. As for the Beiyang shipping routes, they have all been seized by Japanese vessels. Recently, due to the change in water fees to港币, foreign vessel freight has been extremely weak. According to the shipping industry, this scene is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.

Resumption of航 to Wenzhou Reportedly Approved

Regarding the resumption of航 to Wenzhou, the current Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has approved it. However, Japanese warships are attempting to blockade and prevent the resumption of航, and have laid mines outside the瓯江 to blockade it. Now, the British company Yilong's Shenguang轮 attempted to航 to Wenzhou, but was prevented from entering by a Japanese warship outside Wenzhou. Thus, it was forced to return to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive back in Shanghai today. Rumors that it did not receive the approval of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander are inaccurate. The failure of this决 to resume航 to Wenzhou is entirely due to the obstruction of Japanese warships.

### Ministry Orders Strict Suppression of Private Money Remittances by All Customs Offices

Military Personnel and Civil Servants Should All Be Subject to Customs Inspection. The Ministry of Finance recently telegraphed all customs offices, saying: Regarding the tasks of customs offices to investigate and suppress the private remittance of gold, silver, and banknotes, and to inspect travelers carrying banknotes exceeding the limit, orders have been issued to all customs offices to handle them seriously. Now, it is further stipulated that all passengers passing through customs, regardless of military personnel, civil servants, or merchants, should be subject to customs inspection to emphasize功令 and prevent abuses. In addition to asking Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to order all troops, officers, and soldiers, military motorcade teams, and all机关所属 personnel to comply, and电 to all customs offices, you should be informed and earnestly implement inspections.

### Goods Withdrawn from Customs Warehouses in June

According to Customs Releases, Totaling Over 3 Million金

Customs released the list of goods withdrawn from customs warehouses in June this year: Group 1, 9金; Group 2, 21.441金; Group 3, 157金; Group 4, 4.928金; Group 6, 1.817金; Group 7, 3.615金; Group 8, 23.469金; Group 9, 247.575金; Group 10, 161.094金; Group 11, 5.958金; Group 12, 116.663金; Group 13, 18.017金; Group 14, 148金; Group 15, 16.085金; Group 16, 33金; Group 17, 5.819金; Group 18, 2.823金; Group 19, 123.707金; Group 20, 34.088金; Group 21, 15.779金; Group 22, 141.083金; Group 23, 775.902金; Group 24, 1,593.133金; Group 25, 49.324金; Group 26, 408金; Group 27, 140金; Group 28, 1.730金; Group 29, 402金; Group 30, 1.670金; Group 31, 830金; Group 32, 24.023金; totaling 3,391,980金.

### Rumor: Ministry of Finance to Implement Domestic Exchange Control

Limit Purchases to Daily Necessities to Prevent Legal Tender Outflow; Coastal Areas Will Implement, Shanghai More Cautious

Yesterday, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture to jointly form a domestic exchange management committee, intending to prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior and to统制 domestic exchange business, limiting it to the purchase of daily necessities. Shanghai will be particularly careful. Those who wish to remit money to coastal cities must apply to the committee in advance and must have proof from the merchant. It is said that this can be implemented next week. A reporter from Daguan News Agency inquired about the details of this matter from the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture yesterday. According to the spokespersons of each bank, the matter is purely the responsibility of the Chongqing head office, and the Shanghai branch has not heard anything about it so far. It is currently difficult to predict whether Shanghai branches will be ordered to handle this matter in the future. It was further learned from the financial sector that the central government's move to统制 domestic exchange should have been implemented after the Shanghai war, and the decision to implement it now is a very urgent need. The Chongqing head office in Sichuan is the most suitable 機關 for this matter. The Hong Kong branches have the most burdensome work. The Shanghai branch may not handle this matter at that time. However, the Shanghai area is by no means放纵 and unregulated. According to their expectation, the Shanghai office of the City Chamber of Commerce will be entrusted to take charge in the future. The各业公会 will issue certificates based on the applications of each manufacturer, and then purchase goods from coastal cities, on the one hand, to implement the central government's orders, and on the other hand, to prevent奸人 from taking legal tender outflow. As for the Chamber of Commerce's previous handling of applications from各业 for the purchase of foreign exchange from the four banks, work will continue as usual.

### 工部局警備委員會討論管理交通問題 (Continuation from Yesterday)

Suggestions to Discontinue Tram Service

The China Automobile Association continued to state that tramcars are already considered outdated. If they can be discontinued, tram stops can be removed, and the crowds on the streets can be dispersed. The danger in traffic can also be reduced. However, discontinuing tram service is difficult to achieve in the short term. Therefore, the plan to gradually replace tramcars with trolleybuses should be implemented as soon as possible. Last year, when the tram company considered reconstructing the tram tracks on the Bund and Nanjing Road, some people suggested replacing tramcars with trolleybuses. However, the company strongly opposed this plan. The reason it gave was that the residents of this port are crowded, and considering the living standards of half of them, tramcars are the most economical means of transportation. Moreover, each tramcar and trailer can carry 120 passengers and only requires one driver, making it unparalleled in economy. The conclusion reached by the Public Works Department Board of Directors at that time was that the bureau had no right to force the addition of trolleybuses until it acquired the tram company in 1940 according to the provisions of the tram operating franchise contract. The issue of acquisition was still too early to discuss. Therefore, it was decided that there was no need to discuss it. The Security Committee believes that there is still no room for discussion regarding the suggestion made by the China Automobile Association this time.

Adding Traffic Police Officers Postponed

The association also suggested that the authorities of the concession should add traffic police officers on motorcycles to intercept drivers who violate traffic regulations. The driver's license would be confiscated, and a fine would be paid to the police station for redemption afterward. However, the simple procedure of the police station collecting fines from drivers has not yet been implemented. The association is willing to assist the police station in implementing the proposed plan to the best of its ability. The association believes that traffic police officers should currently have the authority to order people who violate traffic regulations to stop on the side of the road and inform them of their mistakes. This method can be applied to old vehicles and drivers who deliberately drive slowly. The police department reported that the current police officers have heavy responsibilities. It will only be possible to add traffic police officers on bicycles when the environment permits. As for ordering drivers who violate regulations to hand over their permits, it has already been implemented. The police station already has the authority to order those who violate traffic regulations to stop. Slow-moving drivers are also dealt with at any time.

No Need to Establish a Special Traffic Department

The association also put forward a suggestion, saying that the authorities of the two concessions should jointly establish a special traffic department, with well-known car drivers, including members of the association, participating in it. These drivers would wear badges and carry printed forms to report any driver's carelessness or dangerous situations. Their reports should have the same authority as reports submitted by ordinary police officers and should be accepted by the police department. The police department believes that this suggestion is not advisable. The proposed organization of a special traffic department is not necessary. Any citizen can report violations of traffic regulations to the police station. If the report is accompanied by detailed records, the police station will pay attention to it and take necessary measures. The Security Committee also believes that the above suggestion is practically obstructive and there is no need to adopt it.

Problems with Parking of Heavy Trucks

The association also stated that trucks carrying heavy goods, such as timber and steel bars, often park on the sides of major roads during rush hours, such as trucks parked on Hankou Road unloading newspaper rolls for newspaper offices. The police station should pay attention to this. The police department reported that heavy goods are not allowed to be loaded or unloaded during rush hours. The license issued by the Public Works Department already contains explicit provisions. In the future, the police station will pay attention to the loading and unloading of other goods and the paper trucks mentioned by the association. The members of the Security Committee unanimously agreed that there is no need to take other measures.

Traffic Lights Are Properly Installed

Westerner Mr. Liddell said that the Public Works Department has disregarded the 29th suggestion put forward by the Traffic Committee between 1924 and 1946. The suggestion stated, "The Public Works Department should conduct extensive trials of various traffic control signals until the most suitable tool is found. Then all such tools should become standard for uniformity. The traffic control signals used in the Public Concession and the French Concession should be the same, if possible." The position, color, intensity, and height of all current traffic lights vary, and they are close to neon lights, making it difficult to drive vehicles. Regarding this, the police department stated that the standardization of traffic control lights is progressing slowly, but it is indeed close to the general standards adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States. What needs to be explained is that when deciding on the location of the traffic lights, it is not always possible to strictly adhere to a certain standard. The situation at each road intersection must be studied individually, and the current and future decorations should be taken into account. As for neon lights, if their installation location is less than 100 feet away from the traffic lights, they must apply to this office for review. This office will inspect the proposed installation location before the Public Works Department approves the installation. The police department continued that this office has contacted the Shanghai Electric Power Company and asked it to achieve the goal of standardization to the extent that it can be implemented, and asked it to estimate the cost of the renovation project. At that time, an opinion was raised that drivers have no major difficulty in paying attention to red and green lights. Based on the above reasons, the members of the Security Committee all believe that there is no need to take any other measures.

Short Posts on Platforms Are Not Dangerous

Mr. Liddell continued to express dissatisfaction with the short posts on both sides of the platform in the center of the road, saying that the Public Works Department's installation of various short posts is contrary to the 21st suggestion of the previous Traffic Committee, and claimed that many of these short posts are unreasonable or even dangerous. The ones erected at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Seymour Road were specifically pointed out by Mr. Liddell as having the above-mentioned shortcomings. The police department said that the Traffic Committee's suggestion only refers to the confusion between the electric poles in the middle of the road and the short posts on both sides of the pedestrian platform in the center of the road intersection. The 23rd suggestion of the previous Traffic Committee stated that on roads with sufficient width, platforms should be provided for pedestrians and installed at their important intersections. All current platforms are set up to implement this suggestion. The short posts referred to by Mr. Liddell are a necessary part of the platform, and Mr. Liddell emphasized the danger of these short posts, but none of the recent accidents caused by collisions with fixed objects are enough to prove his claims. The Security Committee expressed its agreement with the above.

All the above-mentioned opinions of the Security Committee have been approved by the Public Works Department Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 26th. (End of the Second Section) (End)

### 日人擬籌辦空防獎劵

### Japanese Plan to Launch Air Defense Lottery

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports, according to a Japanese newspaper, that several private Japanese investors, imitating the Chinese government's approach, may soon launch a "Chinese Air Defense Lottery" with 300 million tickets at one yuan each. Each drawing would offer prizes of up to one million yuan. The profits would be used to promote commercial aviation in China and to cover a portion of the military expenses of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Corps in China. Four of the six Japanese who initiated this plan are retired military officers, currently in discussions with the Asian Institute and other Japanese authorities. A similar plan to establish the Japanese Air Force with funds raised from lottery sales in Japan was opposed and canceled by the Japanese government on the grounds that such an enterprise would promote gambling.

### 日人不滿意『小蝴蝶』

### Japanese Dissatisfied with "Little Butterfly"

The *Continental Daily* reports that the Japanese Consulate Police Department protested to the Public Works Department yesterday (the 1st) through Akagi, the Assistant Chief Inspector of the Police Department, requesting a ban on the color cartoon "The Little Poor Butterfly" currently being shown at the Grand Theatre. The Japanese Consulate Police believe that the film harms Japan's national prestige. The film is produced by Columbia Pictures and has been shown three times a day since July 27. Newsreels, cartoons, and other supplementary films are apparently not included in the Public Works Department's inspection of feature films.

### 江湖術士妖言歛錢被逮「徐州知府」之子惑於三十萬財運方子英遇騙發覺

### Itinerant Taoist Priests Arrested for Extorting Money with Demonic Talk: Son of "Prefect of Xuzhou" Duped by 300,000 Fortune, Fang Ziying Discovers Fraud

Fang Ziying, a native of Ningbo (age 24), residing at 690 Sixth Lane, Rue Adoard, was passing by the entrance of the Dingsheng Hotel at No. 4, Lane 141, Fujian Road, on the morning of the 17th of last month when he was suddenly spotted by Lin Ziqi, a face reader from Zhenjiang who had a sign hanging in Room 19 of the hotel. Lin immediately stopped Fang and said, "Observing your yintang, it is clear that you will have great wealth." He insisted on inviting Fang to his room to discuss how Fang's fate was prosperous and that he would soon obtain great wealth, and arranged for Fang to come again in three days, promising to determine how to obtain the wealth. Fang was misled by his words and not only paid a face-reading fee of eight jiao, but also went again as agreed on the 20th. Lin suddenly claimed that his skills were shallow and introduced Xu Yeping, a native of Ningbo, to give Fang another reading. Xu performed a ritual, seeking divine guidance and burning talismans. Then, he produced a yellow paper and briefly circled it over incense. Zhusha characters appeared on the paper, stating that Fang was originally the son of the Prefect of Xuzhou who killed a civilian woman because he wanted to rape her but failed. Therefore, he currently had a fortune of 300,000 yuan, but it was blocked by vengeful spirits. He must resolve this grievance before the fortune could be obtained. Xu then instructed Fang to pay a fee of 30 yuan to resolve the grievance in three days. Fang had already fallen for their deception, so he delivered 30 yuan as instructed. Then, Xu Yeping said that the fortune of 300,000 yuan could indeed be obtained, but a daughter was needed to replace a son, and he must first seek the soul-summoning technique of the God of Wealth to summon the arrival of the fortune. However, 100 yuan must be paid for summoning the soul, and the money must be delivered on the 29th. At this time, Fang's mind was bewildered by the great fortune of 300,000 yuan, and seeing the characters actually appearing on the white paper, he believed it without doubt. On the 29th, he managed to raise 100 yuan and sent it. Xu further ordered Fang to pay another 80 yuan on the 31st, and the fortune would arrive immediately. Fang obeyed and paid the money. Unexpectedly, Xu claimed that the fortune had reached Xuzhou and would arrive in Shanghai soon, but a daughter was needed to replace a son. He needed to bring 600 yuan in legal tender tomorrow and offer it before the god, and the great fortune of 300,000 yuan would enter his hands, and the 600 yuan could also be returned at the same time. However, Fang did not have this large sum of money, so he borrowed it from his brother, Fang Ziheng. After Fang Ziheng inquired about the details and conducted an investigation, he learned that Lin Ziqi and Xu Yeping were all itinerant Taoist priests who specialized in using their eloquent tongues and flowery words to deceive women, children, and ignorant youths out of their money. The characters appearing on the white paper were merely a very common illusion. All that was needed was to write the characters on the paper with alum water, and the characters would appear after the paper was exposed to hot steam. Therefore, he wrapped a towel to make it look like 600 yuan in banknotes and ordered Fang Ziying to take it there. When Lin, Xu, and their accomplice Fan Yiming saw Fang coming, they pretended to seek divine guidance, worship Buddha, and burn talismans, intending to take advantage of the opportunity to replace Fang's bundle of paper. Unexpectedly, Fang Ziheng had already reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Chief Detective Zhu Shouling and detective Zhi Hong rushed to the scene and arrested Lin, Xu, and Fan. They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Zhu explained the process and filed a lawsuit according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law, requesting that they be severely punished as a warning to those who use demonic talk to deceive the public and extort money. Judge Sun Jiajie interrogated and confirmed the facts, and then sentenced Lin, Xu, and Fan to six months of penal servitude for jointly obtaining money through fraud, as a warning.

### 人生幸福和品格全繫於　生殖腺內分泌的豐足

### Life's Happiness and Character Depend Entirely on the Abundance of Sex Gland Endocrine Secretions

In the days before medicine was advanced, the creation of life's happiness and character was always attributed to the "eight characters" in destiny. From the moment a baby was born from the mother's womb, their lifetime of joy, suffering, intelligence, and foolishness was determined by the hour of their birth. Isn't this a completely absurd mistake? Because today, with the rapid development of physiology and the advancement of medicine, we deeply understand that the strength or weakness of the endocrine secretions in the body's sex glands manipulates our future and character. The endocrine secretions of the sex glands are truly the source of our lives. In underage men and women, the stimulation and regulation of these glands promote the development of height, weight, and chest circumference. After adulthood, in addition to a portion stored in the seminal vesicles, specifically for reproductive purposes to meet the needs of love, the rest is still irrigated throughout the body by blood circulation, with various functions such as regulating metabolism, nourishing nerves, promoting development, and regulating emotions and rationality. Therefore, a young man who keeps himself clean, preserves his virginity, and keeps his sex gland fluids abundant will surely have a handsome appearance, rich thoughts, quick actions, excellent character, and can surpass others in studying and learning, and his future will be immeasurable. Once he marries a healthy, beautiful, and affectionate woman, their love will inevitably be deep and lasting, and they will have sons and daughters, and the family will be happy. What a happy life! However, there are also some bad youths who commit self-ejaculation in the early stages of spring, or early marriage indulgence, and unrestrained debauchery. How can the truly valuable sex gland fluids not be exhausted if they are wasted like this? All kinds of symptoms, such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin semen, infertility, and neurasthenia, are endless. Such youths, even if they have become adults, are as childish as children all over, or they are already showing signs of aging even though their age has not increased. They will abandon their studies and learning halfway. In marital life, they will inevitably be dissatisfied with their wives. Imagine the wife's enthusiasm, but no one to consume it, how can it not make her resentful and angry, and the family will also have many problems? Therefore, they are passive, lazy, and have a poor character and reputation, and their future happiness is lost! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only remedy is to take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su," which is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. This agent is specifically for treating the above-mentioned symptoms, and its high quality and great efficacy are unmatched by other similar preparations. Therefore, after taking it, it can produce semen, nourish the kidneys, nourish the nerves, promote development, and regulate metabolism. Continuing to take it for half a month can fundamentally cure the above-mentioned symptoms. Regular use in all seasons can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the seminal valve and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the results will be faster!

遺精症雖然可怕，但尚是前期症，若由遺精而釀成了滑精漏精症，那才真正的危險之至！遺精症的來源，據醫學上的論斷，大都因自瀆縱欲民，氫性神經斷傷了，於是精關的管束即不能嚴密。在夜間酣眠神經呈休息態時，偶有美夢繚繞，性神經稍受刺激，精液即遺洩而出，雖或由夢中驚醒，但已無及！此時若服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」以增強精關之機能，則遺精即可痊愈，所最可惜者，多數人每以為遺精並不是病，旣不痛，又不癢關什麼緊呢？要知不痛不癢的毛病，是最厲害的毛病、遺精若遲延失治，因為精液繼績的遺失，性神經必日益衰弱，精關必日益鬆弛。因此在夜間即無夢境的刺激，精液每順流而出。一覺醒來，褲已污濕，這是多麼的惱恨呢！遺精進至此階段，即成滑精症。若再因循失治，那雖在白日因用腦力過度，或偶見女色，或在大小便時，均可使此物勃起，而有精液洩出，這就是最可怕的漏精症。我們的血肉之軀，體內的精液是有限的。今遺洩滑漏不止，怎能不枯竭？則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症更相繼併發。是以志氣消沉，精神萎靡，怕寒畏熱，萬事消極，在學校的學生，因不能專心一志，大有留級退學的危險！在商店工廠習業的青年，因不能集精會神，亦有不能勝任之虞！在男女之間，因體貌不揚，未婚者有陷於失戀的悲慘，已婚者於夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨，家庭每演出種種悲劇！

Spermatorrhea is frightening, but it is only a preliminary symptom. If spermatorrhea leads to spermatorrhea and leakage, that is truly extremely dangerous! According to medical judgment, the source of spermatorrhea is mostly due to masturbation and indulgence, which damages the nervous system. Then, the control of the sperm valve cannot be strict. When the nerves are resting at night, and there are occasional beautiful dreams, the sexual nerves are slightly stimulated, and the semen is discharged. Even if you wake up in shock from a dream, it is too late! At this time, taking the special medicine "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to enhance the function of the sperm valve can cure spermatorrhea. What is most regrettable is that most people think that spermatorrhea is not a disease. It doesn't hurt or itch, so what's the big deal? You should know that painless and itchless problems are the most severe problems. If spermatorrhea is delayed and not treated, the sexual nerves will inevitably weaken, and the sperm valve will inevitably relax due to the continuous loss of semen. Therefore, even without the stimulation of dreams at night, semen flows out smoothly. When you wake up, your pants are wet, how annoying is that! Spermatorrhea advances to this stage and becomes spermatorrhea. If you continue to delay treatment, even during the day, excessive use of brain power, or occasionally seeing women, or during urination and defecation, can cause the penis to erect and semen to be discharged. This is the most terrifying leakage. In our flesh and blood body, the semen in the body is limited. Now that the leakage is endless, how can it not be exhausted? Then, symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and infertility will occur one after another. Therefore, ambition is depressed, the spirit is sluggish, you fear the cold and heat, and everything is negative. Students at school are in danger of failing and dropping out because they cannot concentrate! Young people who study in shops and factories may not be able to cope because they cannot concentrate! Between men and women, due to unattractive appearance, unmarried people may fall into the tragedy of being dumped, and married people will inevitably not be happy in their married life, and will be hated by their wives, and families will often stage various tragedies!

所以遺精症必須及早作澈底治療.治法.據世界名醫及余經驗均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可聓固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，夢幻減少，遺精旣可於當夜立止。復振足了精神。如因遺精失治已有滑精漏精，或早婚縱欲使生殖腺液枯竭而有上述諸症者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼績服用半月以後，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症即可根本治愈。中老年人常服更可收延年益壽返老還童之效。

Therefore, spermatorrhea must be thoroughly treated as early as possible. The treatment method, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," which can consolidate the sperm valve, calm the nerves, make you sleep peacefully at night, reduce fantasies, and stop spermatorrhea that night. It also revitalizes the spirit. If spermatorrhea has been left untreated and has led to spermatorrhea and leakage, or early marriage indulgence has exhausted the sex gland fluids and caused the above-mentioned symptoms, then you must also take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it for half a month, it can also promote development and regulate metabolism, and the above-mentioned symptoms can be fundamentally cured. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body.

遺精患者楊長青君，江寧人，年二十六歲，兼有腦弱腎虧，余即囑服上述良藥，並施以電療注射，經一月的悉心治療，果回復了他美滿健康，日昨來函，盛謝再造之恩！

Mr. Yang Changqing, a spermatorrhea patient from Jiangning, is 26 years old and also has brain weakness and kidney deficiency. I immediately ordered him to take the above-mentioned good medicine and gave him electrotherapy injections. After a month of careful treatment, he indeed recovered his perfect health. He sent a letter yesterday, expressing his gratitude for the kindness of rebirth!

健美

### Physical Beauty

### 乳峯對女性幸福所關至大

### Breasts Are of Utmost Importance to Women's Happiness

— 美國醫學博士姚崇培
—American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

昨在邵君的一個宴會席上，聽到某百貨公司經理張君的一席談話，覺得很有意義，特為記之如左，他說：『獨脫姚：我自從在申報上看到人們健康知識所論的乳峯發育以後，除對你們做醫生的苦心孤詣，造福人羣，表示無限欽敬之外，而同時覺得女子乳峯，萎滬與高聳，其間的確大有關係，我對於醫道雖是門外漢，不懂什麼生殖腺，卵巢機能等等名詞。但在女性的姿態上看來，好像看到乳峯高聳的女性，不管她的面貌怎麼樣，總覺有一種說不出來的好感。反之，如乳峯萎滬，臀部瘦削的女子，那麼她的衣飾無論怎樣生得美麗，不知怎的，見了就會發生一種憎惡……』語至此，有一位會計師×君，就向著張君笑問道，『你這樣愛好健美，然則尊夫人的胸前雙峯，是否能夠合乎你的理想？』張君卽正色道：『說句忠實話，幸得戝內的乳峯發育尚佳，否則雖不至於壞了良心道德遺棄她，但難免不要在外面偷偷摸摸了！』

Yesterday at a banquet hosted by Mr. Shao, I heard a speech by Mr. Zhang, the manager of a department store, which I found very meaningful, so I recorded it as follows. He said: "Dr. Yao, since I saw the discussions on breast development in the *Shen Bao*'s Health Knowledge section, in addition to expressing my infinite admiration for your painstaking efforts as doctors to benefit the public, I also feel that there is indeed a great relationship between a woman's breasts, whether they are undeveloped or well-developed. Although I am a layman in medicine and do not understand terms such as sex glands and ovarian function, but looking at a woman's posture, it seems that when I see a woman with well-developed breasts, no matter what her face looks like, I always feel an indescribable sense of goodwill. On the other hand, if a woman has undeveloped breasts and thin hips, no matter how beautiful her clothes are, I don't know why, but seeing her will give rise to a kind of aversion..." At this point, an accountant, Mr. X, smiled and asked Mr. Zhang, "You are so fond of physical beauty, so are your wife's breasts able to meet your ideals?" Mr. Zhang immediately said seriously, "To tell you the truth, fortunately, my wife's breasts are well-developed, otherwise, although I would not be so unconscionable as to abandon her, I would inevitably have to sneak around outside!"

觀乎上述，足見乳峯對女性的幸福，所關至大。如不幸萎滬，應速求科學的彌補，據世界婦科名醫康德林及余經驗。均一致以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效，蓋此劑係由壯健動物之卵巢分泌及礦植物之補腦血成分，經科學方法配製而成。故功效偉大，藥性和平，不分寒暑，均可常服，若連服二月，不特可以萎滬的乳峯隆然高聳，同時且能調整月經，消滅子宮障碍，促進妊娠機能，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。

From the above, it can be seen that breasts are of utmost importance to a woman's happiness. If they are unfortunately undeveloped, you should seek scientific compensation as soon as possible. According to world-renowned gynecologist Dr. Condolin and my experience, it is unanimously agreed that taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhi Su" for women is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This agent is made by scientific methods from the ovarian secretions of strong animals and the brain-nourishing and blood-replenishing components of minerals and plants. Therefore, it has great efficacy, peaceful medicinal properties, and can be taken regularly regardless of the season. If you take it continuously for two months, not only can undeveloped breasts become well-developed, but it can also regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine disorders, promote pregnancy function, make your cheeks rosy, and maintain youth.

### 尿中忽然出血的淋病

### Gonorrhea with Sudden Bleeding in the Urine

在吾輩醫家日常時所遭遇之淋病症象中，有不少的病人，忽因尿中出血而莫名其驚恐。實則正亦不必作此大驚小怪，淋病而尿中出血，是淋毒性膀胱炎一症，恒所遇之也。而膀胱炎一症之成因，十之七八，由於行局部器械手術之結果，因爲不純練之手術，在行術時，淋菌往往自後尿道達於膀胱，因而侵蝕膀胱粘膜，遂發膀胱炎。此時之小便，全部溷濁，甚至有血尿流出，最重者爲膀胱內出血淸。又因血管破裂口大時，則其所出之血淸，瀦留膀胱，而使尿液全作赤色。幸此種現象亦不恒見。而以一般而倫，不過多在排尿時，因膀胱壁肌肉收縮的關係，而有少量之出血。至於膀胱中的出血情形，則多在尿後，以其淋菌多先侵犯膀胱頸部故也。此症之特徵爲下腹部，恥骨縫際感到刺痛，此刺痛在排尿時放散於陰莖之先端也。

Among the gonorrhea symptoms that we doctors encounter daily, many patients are inexplicably frightened by sudden bleeding in the urine. In fact, there is no need to make such a fuss. Gonorrhea with bleeding in the urine is a symptom of gonorrheal cystitis, which is often encountered. The cause of cystitis is, in seven or eight out of ten cases, the result of local instrument surgery. Because the surgery is not purely practiced, during the operation, gonococci often reach the bladder from the posterior urethra, thus eroding the bladder mucosa and causing cystitis. At this time, the urine is completely cloudy, and even bloody urine flows out. The most severe case is bleeding in the bladder. Also, when the rupture of the blood vessel is large, the serum that comes out of it accumulates in the bladder, causing the urine to turn completely red. Fortunately, this phenomenon is not always seen. In general, however, there is often a small amount of bleeding during urination due to the contraction of the muscles of the bladder wall. As for the bleeding in the bladder, it often occurs after urination, because gonococci often invade the bladder neck first. The characteristic of this symptom is a stabbing pain in the lower abdomen, at the edge of the pubic bone, and this stabbing pain radiates to the tip of the penis during urination.

治療此症，宜注意本症狀程度如何。宜於膀胱洗滌法者，有宜於温罨法者，有宜於服用利尿劑者，而最新化學療法，對此症尤有特殊之功效。但是對於治療此症時所用之手術，仍須敏捷熟練，否則若更破壞創口，猶火上添油，變本加厲，故尿中見血之淋病患者，切勿胡亂擇醫，和濫服市上成藥，宜求有經騐而肯負責之醫師治之。

To treat this symptom, you should pay attention to the severity of the symptom. Some should use the bladder lavage method, some should use the warm compress method, some should take diuretics, and the latest chemotherapy has a special effect on this symptom. However, the surgery used to treat this symptom must still be agile and skilled, otherwise, if the wound is further damaged, it will be like adding fuel to the fire, making the problem worse. Therefore, gonorrhea patients with blood in their urine must not choose a doctor rashly or take over-the-counter drugs indiscriminately. They should seek treatment from a doctor who is experienced and willing to take responsibility.

### Two People Fall to Their Deaths

Why Did a University Girl Take Her Own Life? A Hospital Patient Suddenly Has Suicidal Thoughts

Mr. Yu, a Ningbo native, 49 years old, residing at a certain address on Avenue See Ang (西愛咸斯路) in the French Concession, previously worked in the salt administration. Since the outbreak of war, he had been unemployed. His eldest daughter, 25 years old this year, had just graduated from Guanghua University. She was inherently stubborn and recently, due to some incident, suddenly had suicidal thoughts. One day at 12:30 PM, she jumped from the third-floor sun deck in her home, sustaining head injuries. She immediately lost consciousness. Her family discovered her and rushed her to Guangci Hospital, but she died at 8:30 PM that afternoon due to the severity of her injuries. The hospital reported it to the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate the cause of the suicide, pending a post-mortem examination. Additionally, Shen Jinsong, a young man from Shaoxing, 21 years old this year, residing at 1070 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), worked as a servant for a foreigner. For the past year, he had been suffering from intermittent mental disorders, which would flare up and then subside. On the 30th of last month, the illness relapsed, and his family sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where he was housed in a third-floor ward. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM one day, Shen's illness worsened, and he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Taking advantage of the nurse's inattention, he jumped out of the window, sustaining head injuries and dying instantly. The Shaoxing natives discovered it and informed the accounts room, which reported it to the French police. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the police reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the station. The autopsy confirmed that both deaths were caused by injuries sustained from falls. Yu's body was claimed by her father after signing a guarantee. Since no relatives of Shen Jinsong came forward, the authorities ordered the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to prepare the body for burial, pending identification by relatives.

### Rampant Cable Thieves - Receivers of Stolen Goods Apprehended

Recently, a group of thieves has been risking life and limb by scaling barbed wire fences into the Japanese military restricted area on Hongqiao Road to steal valuable electrical cables. These cables are quite expensive, made of pure copper, and installed by the Shanghai Power Company to provide electricity to residents and factories relocating to the Hongqiao area. After these thieves cut the cables, one end often falls to the ground, and countless passersby have been electrocuted to death due to carelessness. The French Police Department recently received a tip that Yin Jiayu (nickname "Little Nanjing"), a Nanjing native who runs the Hongtai Yuan Copper and Tin Shop at 314 Rue de Zikawei (姚主敎路), specializes in receiving these stolen goods. Plainclothes detectives were dispatched to the address and apprehended Yin on the spot, confiscating a large quantity of stolen goods, which were all taken to the police station. After investigation, the case will be transferred to the court today for prosecution.

### Car Accident - Woman Killed

Chen Qinsheng, a 51-year-old Cantonese native, owner of the Tian Ji Tang Chinese medicine shop at 1289 Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) in the British Concession, was returning to the shop from outside one day at 5:30 PM with his third wife, Ms. Li (49-year-old Cantonese native), hand in hand, walking from east to west in front of 647 Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) in the French Concession. In the middle of the road, a Ningbo native named Zhuo, residing on Rue Mgr. Favier (趙主敎路) in the French Concession, was driving his private car, license number 11918, in the same direction, speeding towards them from behind. Chen and Ms. Li were unable to avoid it and were knocked to the ground, suffering injuries to their chest and knees. The patrolmen arrived and took the driver of the car to the police station. The injured woman was rushed to Guangci Hospital but died before treatment could be administered. Her body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. After being released on bail by the police station, the car owner hired someone to negotiate with the victim's family, compensating them with 2,650 yuan. Meanwhile, he planned to request lenient treatment from the police station. Yesterday morning, the police reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who arrived at the station to examine the body. The investigating officer reported the details of the accident. The victim's husband, Chen Qinsheng, requested to claim the body for burial. After questioning the defendant about the accident, the prosecutor ruled that Chen Li's death was caused by being struck by a car. The body was released to Chen Qinsheng for burial, and the defendant was handed over to the police department for prosecution.

### Drug Dealers Apprehended in a Songjiang Hotel - Drugs and Other Items Confiscated

Ye Yusi, a Chinese detective chief of the Narcotics Department of the Public Security Bureau, and detectives Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian, learned that someone was secretly selling heroin and other drugs in Room 5 of the Songjiang Hotel at 7 Lane 446 Zhejiang Road. Several days ago, they instructed their associates to purchase half an ounce of drugs for 45 yuan. Yesterday, using marked banknotes worth 45 yuan, they purchased another half ounce, then immediately, along with Chinese detectives Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, rushed to make an arrest. They apprehended Zhang Xiangshun, a Ningbo native, in the room, and found the 45 yuan in banknotes that the police had provided in his pocket. Zhang confessed that he had purchased the drugs from Wang Yongqing (also known as Bingchen or Little Wang), a Ningbo native at 10 Lane 221 North Hai'an Road. They then went to arrest Wang, confiscating seven ounces of coffee essence, a hidden compartment, and two checkbooks from the China Reclamation Bank. It was found that from April 20 to July 31 of this year, Wang had made withdrawals from the Reclamation Bank totaling 17,496 yuan, with only 9 yuan and 98 cents remaining. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court for defense. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, filed charges under the narcotics control regulations, and requested a postponement of the trial, citing the need to apprehend accomplices Liu Zhuolong and Wang Kaiqiao. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.

### The "Anti-Smoking Bureau" -滥用濫發印花 Abusive Issuance of Stamps

After the establishment of the "Renovation Anti-Smoking Bureau" (維新戒烟總局), "Director" Zhu Yao (字旭初) immediately began to control the local opium shops in the counties and regions under his jurisdiction. Recently, he printed one million stamps, each priced at 1.8 yuan, and instructed the "branch bureaus" to order all local shops to purchase and affix them. This would increase revenue by 1.8 million yuan. In the future, if any un-stamped opium is discovered, it will be treated as contraband, and the license will be revoked as punishment. Therefore, the opium merchants in various places were extremely alarmed and have repeatedly gathered to discuss countermeasures. However, it is rumored that Wang Shao Cheng, the owner of the central opium shop, has received hints from Zhu and is helping to smooth things over. However, there is no goodwill towards Wang in various places, so it is feared that everyone will still go to extremes.

### Gatekeeper's Gun Stolen by Bandits

At Lane 154, Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai, a Chinese police gatekeeper was on duty. Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, three thugs suddenly appeared at the entrance of the lane, wielding weapons and surrounding the on-duty gatekeeper No. 2130, threatening him not to move. They immediately snatched the service pistol that the policeman was carrying and fled. The Chinese police officer was unable to catch up and quickly reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station for investigation and record.

### The Huangpu River Yesterday Morning - Tide Level Even Higher

Typhoon Turns Direction - Shanghai Can Avoid Being Hit

Since the day before yesterday, the Huangpu River has been experiencing a sudden high tide. Yesterday morning at 0:00, the tide level was even higher, measuring over 11 feet. The distance from the riverbank of the Bund was only a little over one foot. Areas such as Gansu Road and Jiangxi Road all had water rising from the sewers. It had not completely receded by 9:00 AM. Today around 2:00 PM, there will still be a high tide, and this high tide will not subside until the 5th of this month. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 2:00 PM yesterday, two new typhoons have formed near the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean. One has already reached east of Chichijima Island, a Japanese territory, and has exceeded the scope of the Pacific Ocean region, so the observatory is not paying attention to it. The second typhoon had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday, heading north-northeast or north-east. The center of the storm is within 60 nautical miles. Shanghai can avoid being hit.

### Fire at the Duchen Hotel on the Corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road - The Manager's Bedroom Destroyed

The Duchen Hotel, a magnificent building made of steel and concrete located on Jiangxi Road and Fourth Road, suddenly caught fire at 9:00 PM one day. Thick smoke filled the air. The Central District Fire Brigade arrived to put out the fire. It is said that the fire started under the bed in the bedroom of the hotel manager, Erlangi. At the time, Erlangi was not in the room, so the firemen had to force open the door. The room was slightly damaged.

### Toy Gun Borrowed From a Child Used in Bank Robbery - Arrested

Tricked into Buying Gold Jewelry, Then Brandished a Gun - Discovered It Was a Fake Gun, Shouted for Police, Apprehended

At the Lao Fengxiang Jewelry Store at 777 Xin Zha Road, around 4:00 PM one day, a customer went to select a gold bracelet and two gold rings. The store clerks Zhu Zhiyi and Wu Peizhang came forward to serve him, handing over the goods for inspection. Unexpectedly, the customer hid them in his pocket and suddenly took out a gun to threaten them, grabbed the stolen goods, turned around, and fled. The clerks realized that the customer was holding a fake gun, so they chased after him, shouting for the police. Police officers No. 1787 and No. 1394 arrived and helped to apprehend him, confiscating the fake gun and all the original stolen goods. He was taken to the Xin Zha Police Station, where Chinese detective Yang Xinzheng questioned him. According to his statement, his name is Chen Guang'an, a Shaoxing native, who previously worked as a clerk in a jewelry store. At 10:00 AM on the 1st of last month, he was given 152 yuan in legal tender by Chen Xu, a female relative residing at 32 Lane 49 North Zhejiang Road, to buy cigarette paper. He lost all the money at the Rongsheng Company Casino in West Shanghai and could not make it up. He had ill intentions. He suddenly remembered that a child named Hu Xiaohan, who lives in a barbershop at 841 Tiantong Road, usually plays with a fake gun that looks very realistic, so he went to borrow the fake gun from Hu yesterday and used it to rob the Lao Fengxiang. The detectives obtained the confession and immediately went to Chen Xu and Hu Xiaohan to verify the facts. It was confirmed to be true. They ordered Chen Guang'an to be detained and transferred to the Sixth Criminal Court of the First Special Court this morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation and filed charges of robbery. Zhu Zhiyi, a clerk at the Lao Fengxiang, submitted a case file to testify to the situation at the time. The defendant was questioned and confessed without denial. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered Chen to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing in seven days. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.

Another Fake Gun - Robbery Exposed

At 8:00 PM one day, two thieves broke into Yang Liu Chun Noodle Shop at 185 Zhejiang Road, intending to rob the gold rings worn by the shop owners, Shen Maosheng and Shen Yongqing, father and son. At that time, Shen and others realized that the gun held by one of the thieves was fake, so they shouted for the police. The thieves were afraid and fled. Xie Ahui, a passerby, apprehended one of the thieves, Chen Hailong, a Haimen native, and handed him over to Chinese detective Wang Shanqing, who took him to the Lao Zha Police Station. This morning, he was transferred to the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed charges of robbery in collusion. Because it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. After questioning by Judge Qian, he ordered him to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.

Gang of Bandits Caught in a Playground

Wang Jiaju, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Lao Zha Police Station, along with Chinese detectives Sun Dafa and Zhang Bingchun, apprehended three bandits, Zheng A-zhen, Wang A-yan, and Zhang Youliang, in the Grand Peking Opera Theater at the Xianshi Amusement Park. After their confession, a pistol and four bullets were confiscated from the Shenghongtai Wine Shop at 386 Zhejiang Road. It was found that the pistol belonged to the Dutch Bank on the Bund and was stolen by Zheng when he was employed there. This morning, they were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian believed that it was necessary to investigate whether the defendants had committed any crimes within the concession, so he requested a postponement of the trial. After questioning by Judge Qian, he approved a postponement of the hearing for one week.

### Salaries of Judges in Both Courts Restored to Original Level - Approved by the Ministry of Justice

According to the Huawen News Agency, all judges and prosecutors of the Shanghai First and Second Special District Local Courts and the Second and Third Branch Courts of the Higher Court, which belong to the Public Concession and the French Concession, jointly submitted a request to the Chongqing Judicial Administration Department to cancel the method of paying salaries at 70% of the pre-war level due to the rising prices of goods and the difficulties in life, and to restore the original pre-war salaries and pay them in full. According to news from the judicial community, the request has been approved by the Judicial Administration Department. However, the official order is still en route due to the inconvenient transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing, so it will take some time before it is issued to the court. All judges are said to be satisfied with the news. At the same time, the daily treatment of the court clerks and servants of the First Special District Court is very ordinary, with the highest monthly salary being only 20 yuan and the lowest being only 14 yuan. It is not enough to support a family, and even personal life will be insufficient, especially during this time of expensive rice and high wages. Therefore, the court also decided to present a request to the president of the First Special Court and the Second Branch Court of the Higher Court to request a salary increase.

### Coal Prices Expected to Fall - Due to Large Quantities of Hongji Coal Arriving in Shanghai

The price of coal in the city previously increased due to limited inventory, scarce sources, and high demand from factories and coal briquette factories. In late last month, prices rose step by step. Recently, large quantities of Hongji coal and Yanbai coal have been transported, totaling over 1,000 tons. At the same time, all factories have prepared enough coal, so the trading volume in the market yesterday was extremely light. According to industry insiders, since a large amount of coal has been transported to Shanghai, the market price has tended to fall back. Moreover, it is not the peak season for coal use, and a large number of orders from peers will be shipped soon, so the market price can be suppressed as a result.

### Rickshaw Owners Refuse to Report Rental Prices - Business Licenses Withheld

Because rickshaw merchants have repeatedly requested an increase in rickshaw rental prices, the Municipal Council ordered all rickshaw owners to fill out a survey form for lessees to investigate rental prices and current general conditions. All rickshaw owners were required to submit the forms by the end of July. Because 80 rickshaw owners did not fill out this form, the Municipal Council withheld the business licenses for this month from those who did not report when issuing them yesterday. They will only issue the licenses for business after the forms are filled out.

### Massage Girl Attempts Suicide by Poison

Zhang Meizhen, a 20-year-old massage girl from Hangzhou at the Meimei Massage Parlor on Ningbo Road, had an argument with an old client surnamed Jia last night around 11:00 PM. Afterwards, she secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. Her close friend Li Juan hired a car and rushed her to the Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Special Open-Air Music Program

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold two special open-air concerts at the French Park (French Association Grounds) from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM on the 3rd of this month and at the Zhaofeng Park from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Ernest Krasso, a famous Austrian baritone, will join in singing many famous songs. The program includes six items and is extremely exciting. Both music venues have added stalls, and seat prices will be slightly increased, with assigned seats costing between 1.1 yuan to 1.1 yuan per person. Audience members who do not occupy a seat will still be charged the usual fee of 0.2 yuan per person. If the performance at the French Park on Thursday is canceled due to rain, the tickets sold can be used at the Zhaofeng Park on Saturday or at the rescheduled performance at the French Park next Thursday.

### Letter

To the editor, I am writing to you after reading the news item "Contesting for Second Landlord Results in Female Teacher Winning the Lawsuit" published in your newspaper on July 24th. There are some discrepancies with the facts, which I would like to list as follows: (1) This case is not at all a contest for a second landlord. The three-trial judgment confirms that the house was leased to the person concerned by Mr. and Mrs. Yu Zhong'e. How can there be any contest? (2) Ms. Lu Manqing and I did not know each other before. How can it be said that we have a sisterly friendship, confusing hearsay? I would appreciate it if you could correct it. Sincerely, Cai Jinying, July 29th.

### Weather Report

Old News Re-Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (109)

### Soliciting Contributions

The accounts officer of the Shengping Theater in this port must solicit contributions during the seasons or at the end of the year. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, they prepared many red invitations with the names of the accounts officers written inside, and distributed them to various officials, wealthy households, merchants, and prostitutes inside and outside the city, nominally inviting them to watch the opera, but in reality, soliciting contributions. Whether they came to watch or not, they had to send one or two silver dollars. Therefore, the households were unwilling. When the patrol captain heard about this, he immediately ordered the patrolmen to take the person who delivered the invitations and many red invitations to the police station. The police station then questioned Li, a Ningbo native, the accounts officer of Shengping. Li said that this happened every year, and it was all done by the accounts officers. Even the members of the Mixed Court had them, but it was not the responsibility of the accounts officer. Therefore, the patrol captain found it difficult to believe this and transferred him to the public hall yesterday for questioning. Li's statement was roughly the same as before, but he did not say that the members of the committee also had invitations. Li also said, "I currently run two shops in Xiaodongmen and have no bad reputation. This is indeed done by the accounts officers, and there is no Li's name on the invitations." Zhang Gong said, "I know your actions very well, why are you still so pretentious? Now you are even involving me, it is really ridiculous!" He ordered Li to be temporarily detained and waited for the four accounts officers to be brought in for questioning before making a decision. The next day, the review was held. The accounts officers claimed, "We four had no knowledge of the theater issuing invitations." Zhang Gong questioned Li again, but Li still tried to deny it. Therefore, Zhang Gong recounted his previous bad deeds one by one and ordered him to provide a guarantee to close the case.

### Finance - International Air is Still Good - Gold Price Easily Depreciates

Yesterday's spot red market situation, because the international situation is increasingly favorable to our country, and the European situation is gradually tense, foreign exchange has become stronger in the near term, and people's minds have also turned tired. Most of the multiple transactions have been holding a small profit policy, which leads to easy depreciation. This is the opposite of the situation in the past two days. Although a certain money exchange shop only filled out hundreds of taels at the initial opening, the buyer only had one or twenty taels of appetite, resulting in a lack of maintenance. It once fell to a low of 3,565 yuan. Later, due to a slight softening of foreign exchange, it aroused the buying atmosphere. A certain silver building came to add code again, and the securities gang and a certain command also tracked absorption. In addition, a certain money exchange shop also stopped plugging and vigorously moved forward. As a result, the market once turned strong and reached a peak of 3,660 yuan. After entering, it was heard that the securities gang had realized profits by taking advantage of the high, and the silver building gang frequently came to fill out, and the market situation was heavy and tired. As a result, it closed at 3,600 yuan, which was 40 yuan weaker than the previous day. The transaction was still strong, with about 800 taels of scenery. Silver building jewelry gold was finally listed at a small five yuan, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

### Red Squeezed Down Forty Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was ten yuan lower because the foreign exchange reported hard and people's hearts were tired. A certain money exchange shop sold ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,630 yuan. After opening, the foreign exchange still gradually softened and hardened, and a certain money exchange shop continued to vigorously fill out more than a hundred taels. In addition, the buyer's appetite was not healthy, and only one or twenty taels were eaten. Therefore, it fell 65 yuan in sparse transactions. A certain money exchange shop sold another ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,565 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange shop had stopped plugging and was watching, and the silver building gang absorbed by taking advantage of the low, which led to the market situation upward. It soon returned to outside the 3,600 yuan mark. The silver building gang entered the money exchange shop for ten taels at a price of 3,615 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange suddenly stopped softening and tended to tighten, and the buying atmosphere was even stronger. The securities gang and a certain silver building competed to absorb, and a certain money exchange shop came to re-enter, and the market situation was even stronger. It soared another 45 yuan. A certain silver building entered the gold shop for fifty taels at a price of 3,660 yuan. After 11:30, the securities gang suddenly took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, and a certain silver number also came to fill out, and the market situation turned tired. It immediately shed 40 yuan. A certain money exchange shop sold twenty taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,620 yuan. Then a certain gold shop叉 entered a certain silver building for 40 taels at a price of 3,626 yuan. Later, the securities gang sold twenty taels to the money exchange shop, with 3,620 yuan as the mid-day closing price. It was heard that after the closing, there were sellers at 3,610 yuan but no entrants. The market situation in the afternoon was still tired. The opening was 20 yuan lower than the mid-day closing. The gold shop sold ten taels to the money exchange shop at a price of 3,600 yuan. At that time, the securities gang came to absorb slightly, and once returned high. The securities gang entered a certain silver number for fifty taels at a price of 3,612 yuan. Later, due to the frequent filling out by the silver building gang, it re-traveled downstream. The silver building gang sold thirty taels to the money exchange shop, with 3,600 yuan as the late closing price. As a result, it squeezed down 40 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day fluctuated by 95 yuan. The selling price of the current gold number's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher according to the red squeeze. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there is little news of transactions.

### Increased Sales Through Multiple Channels; Spot and Forward Exchange Rates Both Ease

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, due to reports that Britain, America, and France were actively discussing aid for Chinese legal tender, and rumors that the British side in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations refused to discuss the silver China had deposited in Tianjin, many became even more eager to sell. The Japanese bank and speculators competed to unload their holdings. Coupled with sluggish demand from non-specialists, the market trend strengthened. The British pound once eased to four pence per bull, and the US dollar once strengthened to 8.71875 yuan. Later, due to strong demand from the Bank of England and HSBC at 4.5 pence for the British pound, and foreign firms taking advantage of the low prices to buy, the situation turned soft. As a result, the British pound closed at .03125, and the US dollar strengthened to .0625. Because demand for forward contracts this month was even weaker, the situation was looser than in the spot market. The British pound strengthened to 4.25 pence, and the US dollar eased to 8.25 yuan. Later, New China Foreign Firm and the Japanese bank and others successively aggressively bought, leading to a slight rebound. Ultimately, the British pound still closed .1875 stronger, and the US dollar weakened .34375. Swap rates became tighter. Compared to the midday closing, the British pound difference was .21875, and the US dollar difference was .46875, yielding a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 5.3%. Arbitrageurs could only actually collect 3.125 US dollars, yielding a monthly interest rate of only 3.78%. Trading was brisk for half the day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be 30.0375 yuan for the bank's selling price.

### New China Firm's Purchases Stabilize Market

In the early morning, London's large-scale, recent fixing stabilized. The forward rate retreated .0625. The New York silver price was stagnant, and London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rates between British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies showed no change. The exchange rates between American, British, Shanghai, and French currencies were also unchanged. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4.375 pence for the British pound and 8.5625 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged for the British pound and .03125 stronger for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, the Japanese bank and Chinese speculators competed to sell, coupled with scarce settlement transactions from foreign firms, leading to a strengthening market trend. The Japanese bank and speculators successively offered the spot British pound to Foreign Bank China-Belgium and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 4.4375 and 4.6875 pence, and the spot US dollar at 8.625 and 8.6875 yuan. When HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was confirmed to remain minimal, a certain American bank offered spot British pounds to HSBC at a high of 4.5 pence, while the spot US dollar also eased to 8.71875 yuan. At that time, foreign banks were mutually trading this month's US dollar at a high of 8.25 yuan, and this month's British pound was easing to 4.25 pence. After 11:00 AM, New China Foreign Firm suddenly purchased this month's US dollar from an American bank at 8.0625 and 8.125 yuan. Subsequently, the Japanese bank also absorbed this month's British pound from foreign banks at 4.1875 and 4.15625 pence, which slightly stabilized the situation. Near noon, a certain foreign firm settled its account with Banque Franco-Chinoise for spot British pounds at 4.40625 pence. At the midday close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4.40625 pence for the British pound and 8.59375 yuan for the US dollar, and this month's British pound at 4.1875 pence and US dollar at 8.125 yuan. Compared to the previous day's spot rates, the British pound eased .03125, and the US dollar strengthened .0625. This month's British pound was cheaper by .1875, and the US dollar eased .34375. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall 7 yuan, to 120 yuan. The "Joint Note" in the unofficial market rose half a yuan, to 101.5 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Market Weak

Yesterday, foreign currencies (British and American gold pounds) weakened and declined due to the easing trend in the foreign exchange market and the weak supply and demand relationship. The demand for British and American gold notes was relatively scarce, and the market situation was weak. The supply of Hong Kong and Australian gold notes was slightly excessive, and they all declined. Only Italian notes saw strong demand and rose. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was quite strong, and the market was slightly flat, with the evening market at 1.057 yuan. Demand for Korean notes was sluggish and weak, with the evening market at 0.875 yuan. There were very few transactions in the guild. Xiangtai sold 2,000 French franc notes from Fuhexiang. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds fall by 2 yuan, British gold notes fall by 1.1 yuan, American gold notes fall by 0.2 yuan, Hong Kong notes fall by 0.04 yuan, and Australian gold notes fall by 0.5 yuan. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Neglected

In the securities unofficial market, yesterday's market suddenly surged due to some short covering. Category A bonds rose sharply by 1.9 yuan due to the upcoming lottery. However, because banks did not allow them to be used as collateral, many did not dare to trade them. Over-the-counter trading was the most lively. British and American sentiments towards China remained unchanged. The Tianjin incident unexpectedly affected the market, and people's minds were settled. Because the ex-dividend price and the cum-dividend price were already equal, many sold their holdings. The trend may stabilize for a while. When the market first opened yesterday, people still felt uncertain, and the prices were almost the same as the previous day. Subsequently, with strong demand, market prices gradually increased. Tongkang, Tongshun, Lianhe, and Lianyi successively bought to cover short positions and go long. Category A bonds were raised to over 5 yuan. The selling side was slightly weaker. Paper Songmao, Yuankang, and Yongkang supplied a lot. Other retail investors also sold. Market makers created hype, and there were rumors of a joint US-French-British effort to maintain legal tender, which was a bit too much. As a result, market prices rose another 1.25 to 1.9 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

Category A Unified Bond 5.50 54.00 5.50 Up 1.90

Category B Unified Bond 45.60 44.70 45.30 Up 1.65

Category C Unified Bond 43.00 41.95 43.10 Up 1.35

Category D Unified Bond 41.80 —— 41.80 Up 1.35

Category E Unified Bond 42.40 41.50 42.40 Up 1.25

Stock trading was only a small amount on the Chinese Securities Exchange, with a price of 28 yuan.

The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's market atmosphere was light and transactions were very scarce. The money supply seemed to be easing, and exchange rates and discounts have fallen. The spread between near and far foreign exchange rates has also changed slightly. This is optimistic for the stock market. If it can continue like this, stock prices should improve later. But at present, the market is still negligent.

London Far East companies' stock market prices on the 1st of this month (Monday) mostly fell. HSBC shares fell half a pound, with British registered shares at 74.5 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 76.5 pounds. Korean Coal Mine shares fell 3 pence, to 4 shillings and 6 pence. Kula Kelin Rubber shares fell 6 pence, remaining at 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.

London China Foreign Debt market prices on the 1st of this month (Monday) had slight fluctuations. The Reorganization Loan British issued bonds rose half a pound, with a price of 19 pounds. The Vickers Airplane Loan and Longhai Railway Bonds each fell 1 pound, with prices of 11 pounds each. The Beining Railway Bonds, after the dividend, had a new price of 43 pounds, down 1 pound from before. The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Yarn Higher Than Local Yarn; Speculators Even More Enthusiastic; Special Jincheng Creates New Prices

The yarn market initially rose and then fell back, resulting in a flat outcome. However, yarn destined to the south, and yarn that was physically missing, all still saw price increases. The upward trend was originally moderate, but unfortunately, the general public was stimulated by rumors and friends' enthusiasm, reorganized their forces, and came to buy again. Therefore, although foreign exchange was stable and cash was not frantically sought, the cotton yarn market alone saw an increase. Some believe that the factory does not release goods, so it is better to hoard cotton yarn. In addition, the price of Japanese yarn is higher than that of Chinese yarn, so buyers are very enthusiastic. The recent surge in yarn and cloth prices is the biggest factor. Special Jincheng 20s yarn has reached 690 yuan today because of eager purchases by the Hong Kong gang. This price can be said to have reached its peak.

Current yarn conditions: In the early morning, Guangbang Wanxing Company released yarn to absorb double-horse spot yarn, and the situation suddenly became tense. Dozens of bales were bought at a price of 596 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan over the previous day. Warehouse order prices initially opened at 577 yuan, then 580 yuan. After a short time, due to high prices and the emergence of more sellers, the market became crowded again. In less than a moment, it suddenly fell back. The warehouse order price was 572.5 yuan. Outer warehouse double-horse also fell to 588 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The closing was also flat. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,970 bales were traded, mostly among peers. The prices of double-horse remained flat, while special Jincheng increased by 15 yuan. Niche yarns also increased by 5 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 80 bales of Jincheng 20s yarn at a price of 690 yuan, and 200 bales of special Jincheng 10s yarn at a price of 640 yuan. Today, 19 cotton yarns were shipped to Yantai, 155 were shipped to Tianjin, 20 were shipped to Xiamen, 30 were shipped to Hong Kong, 60 were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 30 were shipped to Beihai. The amounts purchased by each gang are listed separately below:

Hong Kong 830 Peers 955

(Tianjin) 150 Inland 35

Total 1,970

There are two reasons for the recent surge in the Japanese yarn market: (1) According to the market, the export of local products in the north is booming. To avoid losses, merchants are converting their funds into Japanese yarn and cloth and transporting them back to their hometowns. (2) It is also said that a certain banknote will be used next month. The idea of hoarding goods among merchants is becoming more enthusiastic. Therefore, the trade of Japanese yarn and cotton cloth in the north has greatly progressed.

### Japanese Factories Lack Raw Materials; Indian Cotton Continues to Be Traded

The domestic cotton trade is still at a standstill, but the Indian cotton business continues unabated. The amount of transactions between traders has been huge for consecutive days. However, most of these transactions are transferred to Japanese factories for use, and Japanese foreign firms and Japanese factories have purchased 600 pieces today, which shows that the factory's stock of cotton is insufficient and needs to be supplemented at any time.

Howard & Sons 117.00 Toyota Factory enters 400 pieces. Cash sent to the factory.

Pengjiapu 120.00 Nisshin Bank enters 200 pieces. Again, warehouse delivery.

Again 130.00 Yezhong enters 200 pieces. Again, again.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, the trade is gradually booming due to the recent reduction in the discount rate and the easing of money supply. However, the transactions are limited to the hands of the same industry, because their selling prices are about 20 yuan cheaper per picul than the foreign firm's prices. The Japanese factories are more in demand, because their stocks are low.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, initially fell 3 to 8 points due to the liquidation of long positions among peers and selling. Later, cotton-producing areas reported bad weather, and there were no new purchases. According to people in the industry, several large Chinese yarn factories have sufficient reserves of raw materials, enough to supply six or seven months, and can spin for at least three or four months. There is no problem with work. However, new yarn factories have relatively weak raw material reserves. The supply from northern Jiangsu is not strong, with 120 bales of Tong cotton arriving. Today, 40 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong, and 290 pieces of machine cotton were shipped to Ningbo. Here is the current state of cotton. The market price rose due to the enthusiasm of buyers, and then rose again due to government reports of reduced warehouse reserves, increased spot transactions in the south, and good telegrams from Liverpool. As a result, the closing price rose 8 points compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and the forecast was flat. Egypt rose more than 10 pounds.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans and Sesame Cocoons Shipped to South China

Today (the 3rd), 20 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, and 830 bags were shipped to Hong Kong. Another 20 bags of sesame were also shipped to Xiamen.

### Grain: Rice Becomes a Rare Commodity; Rice Merchants Refuse to Show Samples

Dujian Rice: Yesterday, the amount of rice from the river arriving at port was 12 shipments of Songjiang and Nangang early and late rice. There were more than 2,000 bundles of round steamed buns. There were rumors in the market that it would be difficult to continue shipments from the river after this batch. Rice merchants hope that the source will be interrupted from time to time so that they can hoard and speculate. The opening of Wuhu was obstructed by some party and has not been implemented. After the first batch of Dongxin rice arrived in Shanghai, the second batch was also hindered on the way and has not yet arrived. It is said that there are more than 200,000 bags in Shanghai warehouses, of which only 40,000 bags are of japonica rice and 5,000 bags are of glutinous rice. The rest are all pointed rice. Since the market situation turned positive yesterday, guest merchants and hoarders have been hoarding and speculating again. The high-priced goods of both thick and thin japonica are not being sampled, and the general stock is scarce. The sales market in this street is very lively. In the city, Wuxi old yellow japonica rice is selling for 20 yuan, Zhouzhuang japonica rice is selling for 20 yuan, and Jue Wuhu pointed rice is selling for 16 yuan, and Po pointed rice is selling for 15.8 yuan, variable yuan is 22 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice is 22.5 yuan, with a transaction volume of more than 2,700 shi. Off-market transactions are not included in this number, and off-market bidding has risen again. However, because the municipal council stationed staff to supervise the market is very strict, the actions are furtive and there is no way to report the truth. However, it is heard that the off-market transaction price has reached 23 yuan for japonica rice and 18 yuan for high pointed rice. The rise in rice prices is due to the rice merchants and some parties exploiting each other, one manipulating and hoarding, and the other extorting a lot, wanting to make the lives of Shanghai people noble and unable to live here for a long time, which shows the poisonousness of their hearts.

Ke Xian: The move to open up the producing area has not yet been officially confirmed, and the goods side is afraid that opening up will be hopeless, so they continue to hold on. However, the store stock is very dry, and the market appetite is greedy. When off-market japonica rice is too expensive, they are more interested in the low-priced Ke Xian. However, high Xian rice such as Nanjing Xian has been bid up to 19 yuan, and high Wuhu Xian rice is 18.5 yuan, which is far from the limited price, so the price of 16 yuan is only decorated with hot old Jue rice. Even Po rice has reached 16 yuan, up another half yuan to 67 corners from the previous market.

Yang Rice: Yesterday, because of the soaring prices of various rice, the new Saigon rice caught the attention of stores and retailers. 500 bags were sold, with a price of 25.7 yuan, which is about 7 corners higher than the price at the beginning of the week.

### Wheat Released for Purchase; Flour Remains Stable

Flour: Yesterday's trade in spot flour was particularly lively. Because there are various sales channels, and the factory's raw material costs are high, and rice prices are rising sharply, although flour prices have reached 5 yuan, they are still relatively cheap. Therefore, they are still restricting large ticket customers' hoarding needs. The price of goods returned to the market has also increased. Yesterday, both domestic and foreign customers were absorbing, and the total transaction volume continued to be nearly 40,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour factory is consistently 5 yuan in cash. The selling price of returned goods still has differences. Today, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei.

Wheat: Yesterday, new wheat arrived one after another. Both the Shanghai-Ningbo and Tianjin-Pukou lines had shipments. There were also a lot of goods in storage. After the factory officially purchased, the trade was brisk and prosperous. Fuxin Factory added 1,500 bags. However, the market valued the purchase. Hoarders also purchased 2,000 bags of high and medium wheat. Because the market had both supply and demand, the price was loosened by a few cents. Kunshan wheat opened at 6.9 to 6.8 yuan, Danyang Daqiao opened at 6.8 yuan, and Qishuyan opened at 6.6 yuan. Nanjing Caishiji wheat opened at 6.6 to 6.36 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth and Fine Materials, Selling Prices All Rise by One Yuan; Sales of Various Cloths Soar

Domestic Cloth:

Yesterday, the rising trend of the cloth market intensified. Yihua's 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was continuously searched for by the Shandong gang, and spot goods were hoarded and speculated. Each piece was raised to 17.75 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to before. Yihua's Three Rabbits and Three Peaches and other fine twills also rose sharply by one yuan. The increase was due to soaring market prices in East Piece Goods, and wholesale stores and dyeing factories in this street had purchases. Other brands of white goods and dyed cloths also increased prices, with many differences. In the afternoon, the cash discount rate rose sharply, and the price of goods began to fall back slightly. The current sales in this street are the strongest. More than 400 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, serge, broadcloth, flannel, and silk crepe were traded. The Yong Gang purchased 100 boxes of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yue Gang purchased 780 boxes of fine twill, serge, and colored twill. The Shandong Gang purchased 40-50 bales of 16-pound coarse cloth. The Kingdom of Siam purchased thousands of pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, printed flannel. Wholesale to Jiangsu and Zhejiang interior increased.

East Piece Goods:

In the morning market, the selling price rose again due to the continued purchase of fine cloth and fine twill by the Tianjin gang. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 16.9 yuan per piece. The forward price for the next month soared to 17.1 yuan. Later, due to the excessive increase and the high cash discount, the market appetite in this street turned back and gradually softened. As a result, the Dragon Head fine cloth was 16.6 yuan, which was still an increase of 40 cents per piece compared to the previous day's market. A total of 500 pieces were traded throughout the day purchased by the North Gang. Only 1-200 pieces were actually sold in this street. The market price of Sijunzi serge and Zhigong serge has been raised to 49 cents per yard.

Export:

Today (the 3rd), 30 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai, 70 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 40 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 7 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 20 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay.

### Concerns about Customs Gold in the Broadcloth and Wool Market

The selling price of broadcloth and wool has risen since the foreign exchange rate began to plunge, without exception. However, according to the current exchange rate, it is not possible to make a profit. Unexpectedly, new and strange news has come out from the foreign side recently, saying that the customs gold is about to change. (1) The current customs gold of 2.39 yuan will soon be doubled to 4.78 yuan. (2) It is said that taxes must be paid in "Huaxing" banknotes, and even using legal currency to buy "Huaxing" counterfeit banknotes will require a discount of 230 cents per yuan. If the first statement becomes a reality, the cost of broadcloth and wool will increase by one cent. The second statement, which aims to maintain the legal tender of all friendly countries, will not be destroyed.

### Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk Sales to America are Promising

In the local silk market, because the exchange rate has improved, the market price of products has been relatively reduced. White factory products are selling for around 2,500 yuan to foreign firms, but no one is selling. Seven- or eight-tenth white factory products are still selling for 3,120 yuan, with an estimated 30 dans traded. Yin Zhuang white earth silk rose 20 yuan, with an estimated 15 dans traded. The entire silk market feels quite hesitant, because the current silk price is supported by foreign exchange, so no one knows how long the silk price can maintain its high price. But on the other hand, the road for transporting cocoons from the mainland is still as closed as before. After the cancellation of foreign American and Japanese merchants, Chinese silk sales to America are bound to increase, so these two points seem to be optimistic for the silk price. Therefore, general cautious manufacturers only sell spot goods, and are reluctant to accept forward accounts. Therefore, although silk prices are high recently, transactions have not become lively.

### Imperturbability

— Yu

Hearing bad news, we naturally frown and grit our teeth; similarly, hearing good news, we cannot help but nod and smile knowingly. Humans are emotional animals, and it is natural to express such emotions when affected by hateful or joyful fluctuations.

However, I believe that we casually express these emotions in ordinary times. In this extraordinary era, in this great era of resolutely resisting the war to build the nation, it is not appropriate, and it is not enough.

From the beginning, we have known the arduousness of our responsibilities, and we have long made up our minds to achieve our goals regardless of how the environment changes, with unwavering perseverance. Then, no matter how bad or good the external news is, we really have no reason to be emotional except for paying close attention and taking it as a reference. Moreover, hateful emotional expressions often lead to frustration, while joyful emotional expressions often lead to slackness. It is an inevitable result to be frustrated and demoralized, and to be lax and mentally scattered. We absolutely don't need it!

Imperturbability is what our predecessors called "not being moved by external things." This is a skill that all great figures of the past and present must cultivate. Of course, we people of the present may not all be great figures, but we are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the chosen people of heaven, and we dare not belittle ourselves. We are the citizens of a great country, and at this critical juncture of life and death, we must all remain unmoved.

We are by no means cold and heartless. In fact, our emotions are entirely entrusted to our country and nation, and have already exceeded the scope of ordinary emotions. Assuming that we are still unable to avoid frowning because of hatred and smiling because of joy, we must redouble our efforts outside of these smiles and frowns to fully express our emotions.

Before this complete expression of our emotions has been achieved, we can only remain unmoved. Although sometimes they are unfavorable to us, they do not seem to help us, but are mostly for their own benefit and not because of any resentment towards us. Similarly, except for ourselves, although they sometimes benefit us and seem to help us, they are often for their own benefit and not necessarily out of love for us. Then, why should we hate and rejoice because of them!

"Even if Mount Tai collapses in front of you, your expression does not change; even if a deer appears to your left, your eyes do not blink." We want this kind of imperturbability, and only look at the goal and run straight forward! Otherwise, bad or good news will continue to come, and we can only be emotionally impulsive. What else can we do?

### Local News

— Ding Di

A small letter, twelve lines on old-fashioned red-grid paper. I almost cannot believe that it describes a young man's lament, a regrettable fate. He is not a decadent person, and that is not what should have happened. He is young, his future filled with light, flowers, and strength. He has talent, ambition, and youth.

Yet, he has ruined himself... I focused my eyes on the hurried handwriting.

"...I tell you, the air here is filled with a haze. Everyone seems to be stumbling in the clouds, walking with weak limbs, spending their days in a languid and affected manner, practically incapable of tying a chicken. Fortunately, everything is so convenient, there are no concerns whatsoever. Therefore, everyone loves this kind of enjoyment. White rice feeds their bellies, and black bread feeds their spirits. Without this indulgence, it is as if their entire body withers..."

However, doesn't it wither them even with their indulgence? I remember so many yellowish faces. They are still withered.

The letter continues:

"If you see Yun now, I'm afraid you won't recognize him. His mother weeps for him. Her well-intentioned pleas only result in her son's wild beatings. She can no longer live at home. Her son cannot support her. He has devoted his entire ambition, life, happiness, and loyalty to his addiction.

I truly cannot help but feel a bit melancholic. On my hometown's soil, a decision imprinted my fleeing footprints. It was early summer then, filled with turbulence and unrest. All the terrible fates were not yet fully arranged. Although I had seen many painful impressions, I had sneered at those demons and monsters, I had wanted to use my frail hands to twist away the threatening iron chains. Deceit silenced people, and coldness made them shiver. I experienced a lot. But the black terror was not yet this thick. The low-pressure air could not let through a trace of clear breathing, but at that time there was no fog, a black fog, a corrupt and suffocating breath.

A month later, an old woman with white hair and faltering steps came to my place. She was Yun's mother. She told me she came to Shanghai to live with her daughter and son-in-law. We talked about the recent situation in our hometown.

"The hometown now is not like it used to be. There are countless addicts. Everywhere you see signs that say 'Selling Smoking', and when people see these signs, they go inside to lie down and enjoy. It only becomes respectable at night. On the streets and alleys, lamps are lit up one by one, all of them are their advertisements..."

"Lamps, one by one." An extremely moving image hung before my eyes. I lamented, and I was also saddened.

"There are probably a hundred or more in the whole city, and dozens of retail shops outside. Probably at least thirty or forty shops." Hearing this, I could not help but stand up and shout hysterically. "A hundred or so shops, thirty or forty shops, how many people's fates have they buried! How many people standing on the shore are sinking into the sea, and those who have already sunk are falling deeper and deeper:"

An evil breath floated around my nose. I seemed to have already seen my hometown five hundred miles away.

The old woman showed me the bitten arm, saying that it was bitten by her son's teeth. Because she was trying to sell her jewelry to support his habit, and when she didn't agree, he used force.

"Sir, you also know that my son is not such a scoundrel, but fate has brought him to this point, what can be done... I, this old suffering soul, cannot rely on my son in this life... I cannot rely on my son... only in the next life... only..."

I stared blankly, watching her walk away crying.

That night, I had a dream. I used angry arms to kill those who willingly degenerate. The reality disappointed me. Is Yun the only one who has degenerated? No. There are countless young people tearing at their own flesh and blood, degenerating. I cannot kill them all. And there is also a big wolf supporting them, and when I try to kill them, the wolf steps forward. It bares its fangs, claws, and howls fiercely. There are many young people like Yun. The dark air envelops them, and an empty person loses the rudder of their center. However, is this only the sin of the degenerated? Besides this, there is an even greater culprit. This spreading mist, suffocating breath, the jackals that lead people to do evil.

"The air here is filled with a haze."

How many young people's fates are buried in the haze. And what else but the spirit of the elementary school teacher? Facing this shocking hometown news, I should be worried, and angry.

"Old Zhang, watch me! What will you do?"

### Throwing Old Dreams into the Shadows

— Shi Ji

In the night,

I held the heavy

Splendid old dreams,

And walked towards the wilderness.

In the wilderness, there is a storm,

(How can there be stars there?!)

Hidden in the middle,

Those skeletons open their mouths wide

And grin,

In front of me,

Black hands reach out and wave,

Can I bear the heavy burden of the dream?

Now,

The old dream has been thrown into the shadows.

In the wilderness,

Although there is still

Storm,

The skeletons' grin...

But I feel as light as a swallow!

In the distance,

Aren't there sparse stars shining?

### Chaplin's New Film "The Dictator" to be Released in Autumn

— New Shadow

Recently, news has come from Hollywood: that Sherif Silverstone, an important figure at United Artists, has indicated that the famous producer and star Charlie Chaplin's new film "The Dictator" will be released early this autumn. Chaplin is scheduled to spend a month shooting "The Dictator" into a film, and the story has already been written.

Chaplin himself will, as planned, play two roles. According to what Chaplin has indicated, the film's layout and story will of course involve dictators, but the most important goal is still to bring laughter to the audience. To apply the typical elements of comedy to the current political situation.

He believes that people generally find those who are overly solemn and have the highest power ultimately become the target of laughter. In "The Dictator," Chaplin himself, in addition to writing the story, serving as producer and director, also acts. So he has to take on several roles, and according to his own statement, this film will not only be the first time he speaks on screen, but its success will also surpass all the films he has directed before.

Sherif Silverstone further indicated that with a talent like Chaplin, who has a remarkable track record, to make this film, "The Dictator" will undoubtedly be United Artists' only blockbuster of 1939. Once filming is completed, it will be simultaneously released in cities around the world that welcome humorous works of film.

### On the Play "Xiangmei Temple"

— Xiao Cang

The play "Xiangmei Temple" tells the story of Huang Chao's rebellion and the temple monk Liaokong's escape, which ultimately leads to his death. Although the characters in the play are comedic and villainous roles that work well together, in reality, the comedic role is much more important than the villainous role, because the villainous role in this play only emphasizes lines, posture, and demeanor. However, the role of Huang Chao must achieve a magnificent presence and a well-organized posture, with an imposing and unparalleled aura, to be considered top-notch. This is why Qian Jinfu's reputation is so outstanding. The role of Liaokong, entirely in rhyming dialogue, must be delivered with each word forceful and not floating, and the physical movements are even more complex and strenuous. The circling steps are very beautiful, and the most difficult part is the before-mentioned forward and backward leaning steps before entering the stage when escaping without a plan. Wang Changlin can perform this scene with lightness and grace, and even in his later years, he was not inferior, truly a masterpiece. In the previous scene of adding lamp oil and offering incense, Changlin's physical techniques and eyes are all excellent. This play was highly treasured by Wang in the old capital, and it was not often performed in theaters. It was only performed with Qian Jinfu at private gatherings where the host specifically requested it. Changlin almost never went south, but he did perform it many times. In fact, his first performance of "Xiangmei Temple" at sea was before 1921 (probably around 1918 or 1919), at a private gathering at the Shanghai residence of Mr. Tao Xiquan from Wujin, who was invited to Shanghai by the host and was highly praised by the guests. I still remember that in that private gathering, Yu Shuyan and Yang Baozhong also performed. Liaokong's costume includes a monk's hat, green monk's robe, and a comedic painted face, without much that is distinctive. However, for the role of Huang Chao, Qian Jinfu's costume in the previous scene consists of a blue pleated robe and a sword, while in the later scene, he wears a grass king helmet with feathers, a tail hanging behind (i.e., fox tail), a yellow python robe, and yellow armor. The facial makeup is an oil-red three-tile face with a gold coin shape painted on the forehead, and the eyebrows are similar to Wu Qi in "Xiangjianghui." Today's villainous roles all follow Jinfu's style, but in fact, the early Huang Chao's attire consisted of a large red leaf turban and a red velvet ball fringe.

The collaboration of Wang Changlin and Qian Jinfu in this play was naturally a famous and unparalleled performance. Before Changlin, there were many famous comedic actors, such as Ju Gan San, Luo Baishou, and Zhao Xianfang, but none of them were known for "Xiangmei Temple." The only one who excelled in this play and was outstanding in the opera world was Yang Mingyu. Mingyu was Yang San, the foremost comedic actor of Suzhou opera, skilled in Kunqu opera, and his singing, recitation, acting, and movements were all wonderful. After Yang San, there was a lack of successors, so there was a saying at the time, "After Yang San's death, there is no Kunqu comedic actor." When he performed "Xiangmei Temple," it was always performed on New Year's Lantern Festival night, which is also a story of the opera world. When Wang Changlin came to the first stage of Dangui with Yu Shuyan, I don't know who was paired with him as Huang Chao. When Yan Jupeng, Wang Yaoqing, and Wang Youqing came to the old common stage, Jiang Shao Kui was Huang Chao paired with Changlin in this play, which I heard personally. Changlin and Hao Shoushen also performed it in Shanghai. A few years ago, I saw a comedic actor perform this in the Great World Beijing Opera Troupe. Now, Liu Binkun of Golden Age is also known for this play.

In the early years, "Xiangmei Temple" was listed in the first three plays on the program. After Wang Changlin and Qian Jinfu rose to prominence in the opera world and their performance of this play became unmatched for a time, it was hailed by opera listeners as an unparalleled performance. The play was made famous by the performers, but how could Wang and Qian's skills be surpassed by later generations?

The Difference Between Inviting Performers Then and Now

Based on the various facts mentioned above, it can be seen that Xuzhou has always been a gathering place for famous performers. Therefore, Mr. Su Shaoqing and I have been familiar with many historical anecdotes of the opera world since childhood. Among them, the matter of inviting performers is particularly interesting. I will briefly describe it as follows.

In the past, no matter how famous a performer was, there was no concept of preparing their own private costumes. Except for some slightly famous older male roles, martial male roles, female roles, and comedic female roles who occasionally prepared their own beards, boots, gauze, hairnets, knives, spears, head wraps, beaded flowers, and small wooden boards for standing on tiptoe (i.e., embroidered shoes), all other costumes were temporarily borrowed from the costume boxes managed by the backstage staff. Therefore, it was extremely convenient for performers to travel and join different troupes. There was absolutely no trouble like today's famous performers carrying dozens of boxes when they leave Beijing. Precisely because it was so convenient to come and go, various strange stories of famous performers eloping often occurred. For example, the theater owners in several large ports near Xuzhou would inquire about which local theater had the best business and which performers were attracting the audience. Theater owners in Henan, such as Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, and in Anhui, such as Suzhou and Bengbu, would secretly send people with large sums of money to secretly carry out their work of hiring performers (formerly called "hooking performers"). The person sent not only had to be brave and knowledgeable, with sharp wit, but also had to be a tough guy who was not afraid of being beaten with sticks or stabbed with knives, so that he could fulfill his mission and return triumphantly.

At that time, transportation was inconvenient and the population was sparse. Even in famous towns, there were only four or five inns. Moreover, the innkeepers were usually familiar with the mule cart drivers. The innkeepers knew eight or nine things about the merchants who came from which direction, what kind of cart they were riding in, and what kind of business they were doing as soon as the mule cart entered the inn. At the same time, the theater owners often interacted with the innkeepers, taking care of each other and becoming close-knit. If the person who came to hire the performer was not careful and revealed their intentions, they would suffer a great loss immediately, and they could be beaten to a pulp, lose all their money, and return home with serious injuries in a disheveled state.
