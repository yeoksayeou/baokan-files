The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Japanese warships in disarray. By about 4 p.m., there was no trace of the Japanese in Swatow. Currently, Chinese military and political officials are comforting displaced people and engaging in various relief efforts. The Japanese decision to disturb Swatow seemed to be an attempt to plunder grain during the Chinese harvest season.

(21st Associated Press dispatch)

After these two important military strategic locations were occupied by Chinese troops, the Japanese army's retreat 10 miles east of Dongcun was cut off, and there is a high possibility that they will be completely annihilated by the Chinese side. Currently, the Chinese troops in the two locations are continuing to advance east and northeast of Zhongcun and Dongcun, successively recovering five Japanese strongholds and killing 400 Japanese soldiers.

Editorial

### The Crossroads of International Affairs

There are some aspects of the overall international situation that are worth summarizing.

Looking at international phenomena, there are two main focal points: the Far East and Europe. In the Far East, the Sino-Japanese war has lasted for two years, with neither side able to gain the upper hand. The increasingly strained relations between Britain and Japan have led to negotiations in Tokyo. These major issues have far-reaching implications. In addition, the Soviet-Japanese conflict in Nomonhan has lasted for more than two months, and the dispute over fines for the Sakhalin oil fields may also escalate. France and Japan have outstanding issues regarding the New Southern Islands, and Britain, the United States, France, and Japan have conflicts over Gulangyu. In terms of their nature, these are not minor issues. In Europe, the issue of the Free City of Danzig, with Germany and Poland as the main players, has broad ramifications. The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, ostensibly for peace and mutual assistance, are actually tied to the vagaries of fortune. It is not merely a matter of whether an agreement can be reached. These major issues have captured the world's attention. We have repeatedly discussed these issues separately, and now we offer a general overview.

When it comes to any international dispute, it would be reckless to predict its future outcome. Those who see creating accomplished facts as a wise strategy, believing that seizing reality is the way to go, are actually numerous in their attempts to reverse those facts. Many declare their firm opposition to recognizing facts as definite. Therefore, even so-called accomplished facts are not the final outcome, as the dispute remains unresolved. It is like water freezing into ice, but ice is not the end. As for the dynamic developments within these transformations, like waves or tides, they take on countless forms, and it is impossible to know where they will lead, let alone predict the final outcome. Those that have not yet surfaced and are brewing, those that have not yet materialized and are being discussed, are even less predictable than water and ice. Like fleeting clouds, there is no inevitable path. Because of this, the international future is unpredictable. Although people may express their loves and hates and try to discern right from wrong, this is not enough to control the future. For example, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Sino-Japanese War can coexist in the world. The United States bestows justice on China while selling steel to Japan in bulk. Britain and the Soviet Union are indignant at Germany's aggression but cannot agree on a common definition of aggression. What else can be known?

To understand each unknowable element, one can analyze it in detail and identify the reasons for both sides. However, because both sides exist, contradictions arise. For example, Britain is extremely hesitant in its dealings with Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union because the intertwined complexities of interests and urgency make it difficult to commit to a single course. As a result, it is extremely wealthy, yet its military spending in this year's budget exceeds that of previous years. It is conservative, yet it has had to implement conscription and provide guarantees to the Baltic states. These measures are inherently contradictory. Moreover, what it proclaims is even more contradictory: that it has supreme power to decide everything, and that it will overcome everything through peace. But its actions are to fight for what it believes in and to concede for the sake of peace. If Britain acts in this way, how can other countries not be hesitant? In that case, how can international issues involving more than two countries not be turbulent and unpredictable?

However, the result of having both sides and standing contradictions will not always remain at an impasse. For example, after the September 18th Incident, China was at an impasse for a long time. However, with the July 7th Incident, it had no choice but to choose resistance as the only way to save the nation. Before the July 7th Incident, who could have predicted that war was inevitable? What is most unpredictable about the overall international situation is the stage of lingering at a crossroads. Except for the Sino-Japanese War, all existing international issues are in the stage of lingering and, therefore, in the stage of being unable to predict their outcome. Once a path is chosen, even if it is off by a hair's breadth, the consequences will be enormous. However, its direction can be predicted. For example, Germany's attitude toward Danzig is at a crossroads. We cannot know whether it will use force. If it does use force, then we can predict that war is inevitable. As for Britain's negotiations in Tokyo, we cannot know whether it will adhere to the end and consistently implement its proclaimed Far East policy. If it hesitates and retreats, then the Far East will enter a period of darkness and prolonged chaos, and peace and light will be unlikely. Even if the British Isles are preserved, Great Britain will perish. The alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is also uncertain. If the three countries cannot agree and effectively stop aggression, then even if Germany is wary of Britain and France and delays its plans for Danzig, it will inevitably launch an attack elsewhere. Therefore, when it comes to the overall international situation, and to all those lingering at a crossroads, rather than predicting their outcome now, we should study the consequences of their choices. Recently, some have leaned towards pessimism regarding the Far East and the general international situation. There is indeed a lack of basis for optimism, but it is too early to be pessimistic.

### Basic Points Established in the Third Round of British-Japanese Talks; Ambassador Craig Cables London for Instructions; The United States and France Informed of the Contents of the Talks at All Times

(Tokyo) It is reported that Craig and Arita, after their third round of talks today, have agreed on a basic point. If both governments can agree on this point, then both sides will continue to discuss the issue of North China. Craig has cabled this point to London for instructions, and the Japanese cabinet will also convene a special cabinet meeting tomorrow to discuss it. If both governments have no objections, then a public statement will be issued. It is reported that the point established by Craig and Arita is that the British government recognizes the existence of a state of war in China. Although the wording is slightly different from what the Japanese side originally proposed, it is willing to accept it. It is reported that the Japanese side has become more optimistic about this and believes that Britain will soon consider its "new rule" in China. Furthermore, Arita requested that the British government order British customs officials in China to cooperate with the Japanese army in order to maintain order in China. Craig believed that this would give the impression that Britain was submitting to Japan. Therefore, Arita changed it to requesting that the British side cooperate with the Japanese army in China. It is also reported that the United States had inquired about Washington's intentions, hoping to participate in the negotiations on the Tianjin issue. However, as Washington's response to Britain's request was extremely cold, it was abandoned. However, the diplomatic representatives of France and the United States still maintain close contact with Craig, so both countries have obtained full and detailed information on the progress and contents of the talks. (21st Associated Press dispatch)

(London) It is reported that the British government sent new instructions to its ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, last night, and is now informing French and American diplomatic representatives of the progress of the talks at all times. According to semi-official Japanese sources, as general issues have been resolved today, both sides are preparing to discuss individual issues. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### Public Statement Issued

(Tokyo) Well-informed Japanese sources now believe that the crisis in the British-Japanese talks has passed after the Japanese Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador met this morning. Arita and Craigie seem to share the same impression. Craigie is currently reporting the results of today's talks to his government for instructions. However, the Japanese side believes that the British government will not issue instructions that would change Craigie's attitude during today's talks. Today's talks began at 11 a.m. and adjourned at 12:03 p.m. It was decided to reconvene tomorrow. A public statement was issued after the talks, containing the phrase "some progress has been made towards an agreement." Arita went to see Prime Minister Hiranuma at his residence at 1 p.m., reportedly to discuss the results of the recent talks. Reports from official sources that Arita and Craigie have reached an agreement on the general issues behind the Tianjin incident have not been confirmed. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### Focus of the Issue

According to the opinions of Japanese observers, the focus of the issue is whether Britain can abandon its pro-Chiang policy and recognize the existence of an undeclared state of war in the Far East, and whether it will wait for Japan to adopt a plan to deal with the new situation. This morning, before the start of today's talks between Arita and Craigie, the Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that when a foreign reporter asked whether there had been any progress in the two resolutions made by the British and Japanese diplomats, the spokesman replied that it was difficult to say whether there had been any progress. Arita and Craigie had exchanged views frankly, and both sides now understood the other's position. As for Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement in the House of Commons that Britain would not allow its foreign policy to be dictated by other countries, Japan had no intention of dominating the British government's foreign policy. However, the situation in the Far East was changing rapidly, and there had been great changes. No one can deny this. Therefore, what Japan hopes for is that everyone can automatically recognize this change. When a foreign reporter asked whether Britain had not maintained neutrality in the Chinese incident, the spokesman replied that the leaders of the British government had publicly admitted that Britain had been assisting the Chiang regime. (21st Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan, the government sent new instructions to Ambassador Craigie tonight, instructing him to hold a third "preliminary" talk with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. People here hope that the results of this talk will satisfy both sides. The discussion will be limited to the Tianjin incident, and other issues such as financial matters and Britain's general policy in the Far East will not be involved. According to well-informed sources, although the reports recently submitted by Ambassador Craigie are not entirely optimistic, it is hoped that the opinions of the two countries will converge when the talks are concluded. Once the agenda is set, both sides will issue a joint declaration to determine the date and scope of the formal negotiations. (20th Havas dispatch)

(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese side will not be able to accept the amendments listed in the memorandum submitted by British Ambassador Sir Craigie to Foreign Minister Arita on Wednesday afternoon. It is said that this decision was agreed upon at a joint meeting of officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry held on Thursday afternoon after Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma. Today's "Asahi Shimbun" criticized the memorandum, saying that it actually rejected the various demands made by Foreign Minister Arita in the memorandum submitted to the British Ambassador on Wednesday morning. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that the joint meeting of the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry had agreed that Japan would advance towards its original goal. If Britain does not change its current attitude, it would not hesitate to sacrifice the British-Japanese meeting. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### The Times of London Says Concessions Have Limits

(London) London has not yet received confirmation of reports from Japanese sources that British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita have reached an agreement on the background of the Tianjin incident. Although the Japanese side said that the Tokyo talks had made progress, Reuters learned that various circles related to the Far East were gradually feeling disappointed. The responsible parties believe that Japanese newspapers, mostly under the influence of extremist forces, are now employing various strategies known to propagandists, not only to put the British government but also the Japanese government in a difficult position. Therefore, Japanese newspaper rumors cannot be taken lightly. Even the Japanese official field's statements on the British-Japanese talks and the Japanese government's attitude have not endorsed the newspapers' rumors. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times recently stated that the British government is now willing to provide guarantees for the neutrality of Tianjin and is prepared to inquire whether it is possible to establish a status quo in the current special period without harming the interests of Britain or its other allies in Asia and elsewhere. Beyond this, the British government cannot go. The News Chronicle stated that Japan itself should not fight a war in the first place, and to refer to its invasion lasting more than two years as an incident is self-contradictory. Now it is heard that Japan is demanding that Britain recognize the state of war in China, which is indeed a contradiction. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### Tokyo Newspaper's Anti-British Propaganda Uses All Possible Threats

(Tokyo) According to the "Kokumin Shimbun," a mouthpiece of the military, Japan is now promoting the idea of immediately joining a military alliance against Britain with Italy and Germany, with Britain and the United States as its ideal enemies. The understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union in Europe will in fact extend to the Far East. The Japanese government and people are extremely angry about the Soviet Union's "illegal" activities on the border and the air raids on various cities in "Manchukuo." Anti-British movements throughout Japan are now putting strong pressure on the Japanese government to immediately join the anti-British alliance with Italy and Germany. The "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" stated that the Sino-Japanese War has now reached a stage where Japan will not only fight against China but also against Britain and the Soviet Union. (21st Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita continued their talks at 11 a.m. today. At the same time, the threatening campaigns of various newspapers continued unabated. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that if the Japanese side accepts the British counter-proposal, it is unacceptable. The British-Japanese negotiations have allowed the destruction of the meaning of Japan's holy war in China. Japan should maintain its attitude and force Britain to accept Japan's demands until Britain yields. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the indefinite suspension and breakdown of the talks between the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister will depend entirely on Britain's attitude today. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that the best way for Britain to avoid complete loss of face is to abandon its "Kerr-style" erroneous ideas. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### Britain's Far East Policy Is Contradictory; China Is Deeply Concerned; The Munich Policy Is Likely to Be Emphasized Today; Hope Britain Will Be Cautious and Avoid Falling Into the Trap

(Chongqing) The Chinese side is deeply disturbed by the news from Tokyo this afternoon that British Ambassador Craigie has already made concessions on certain points and that the negotiations have made progress. At the same time, there are reports from London that the negotiations on British credit loans to China are nearing completion. People from all walks of life in China are asking whether Britain is once again adopting the policy it previously applied to Czechoslovakia, that is, providing loans to China on the one hand and sacrificing China's territorial and administrative integrity on the other. (21st Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Chinese government and people are now paying the closest attention to the British-Japanese talks being held in Tokyo. Although official sources have not yet issued any comments, the Chinese attitude has been clearly reflected in today's newspaper editorials, hoping that the British people with far-sighted political vision will not succumb to Japan's exaggeration and intimidation. The newspapers stated that even if China's expectations are disappointed, China can still maintain a calm attitude towards Britain and further believe that Britain can still maintain a neutral attitude towards the conflict in the Far East. The newspapers emphasized that Britain's consistent Far East policy is based on treaty relations, such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations. They also mentioned that the League of Nations passed a resolution on October 16 of last year, stipulating that member states should not take actions that would weaken China's resistance and should individually provide assistance to China. Moreover, for the sake of Britain's own interests, it is necessary to adopt a tough attitude to protect those interests. Japan has been extremely insulting to Britain. Britain must be extra cautious to avoid falling into its trap. (21st Haitong dispatch)

### Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada Warns Japan: If the Anti-British Movement Does Not Cease, Prepare to Take Retaliatory Measures

Milton, Canada. Colonel Tru, leader of the Conservative Party, stated today that if Japan continues its anti-British stance, he advocates expelling all Japanese residents from Canada. The reason we allow these Japanese people to reside here is solely due to the friendly relationship between Britain and Japan. However, if Japan closes its doors to friendship with Britain, then we will, of course, treat them in the same way they treat us. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

### Li Liejun's Speech in Yunnan

(Kunming) After arriving in the province, National Government Committee member Li Liejun made the following statement to reporters: "Due to suffering from a stroke for the past two or three years, I have been traveling to various places in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou for treatment. Inquiries from all sides have been constant. Recently, I have been able to walk with assistance. Last month, I made a special trip to Chongqing to thank Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the central government friends for their kind concern. Due to climate conditions, the doctors advised me to recuperate in Yunnan. I am also grateful for Chairman Long Yun's telegram invitation, and I appreciate his kindness. Therefore, I came to Kunming from Guiyang. Recalling the two campaigns of the National Protection War and the Constitutional Protection Movement, more than twenty years have passed in an instant. I have many old friends here and am eager to meet them. Yunnan is an important rear base. The war of resistance and national reconstruction must be given equal consideration. The people's spirit is vigorous and gratifying, which shows that the political leadership of this province is effective. I am determined to express my gratitude to Chairman Long Yun, the heads of the provincial committees and departments, and the elders of Yunnan Province for welcoming me from afar. I am ashamed to accept this. The troops welcoming and protecting me are full of energy. The progress of the military and administration in this province can be seen from this. I plan to choose a place here with a climate suitable for my illness and stay for some time." (Dispatch of the 20th)

### Hitler Reconsiders Solution to Danzig, Says He Will Adopt a Strong and Peaceful Method, Hoping Poland Will Resolve on an Equal Footing

(Berlin) According to well-informed political sources, Führer Hitler, who is currently on vacation in the Bavarian Alps, is now considering a firm and peaceful solution to the Danzig issue. However, the German side is determined not to compromise. Officials are now focusing on firmness and peace. It is said that Germany's military preparations are a natural precaution but do not recognize war as a just solution. A spokesperson told Reuters today, "Hitler is very determined to obtain Danzig and will not give up an inch, but he also very much hopes to obtain it without war." Today's hope is whether Poland can agree to a peaceful resolution on an equal basis, so that the damage to its prestige is minimized. The National Socialist Party believes that there are two possible developments in the Danzig situation: 1. After Britain and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement, it will become a cog in the automatic guarantee system, and as a result, Britain will have no freedom of action and will put pressure on Poland not to start a war. 2. If the Anglo-Soviet agreement cannot succeed, then Britain cannot provide effective assistance to Poland and will advise Warsaw to make concessions for its own benefit. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

(Berlin) News here today said that Prime Minister Hitler plans to meet with senior leaders of the National Socialist Party next week in Berchtesgaden to reconsider the Danzig situation. Hitler's new procedure for resolving the Danzig issue is commonly referred to as the "Hitler Plan." Its purpose is to resolve disputes peacefully. According to this plan, the Danzig issue should be resolved separately from the Polish Corridor issue. Prime Minister Hitler is now in Berchtesgaden with his close advisors, reconsidering the Danzig issue. The National Socialist Party claims that senior cabinet members plan to meet next week in order to make a final decision. General observation is that the Danzig situation has not actually changed. Military preparations are still continuing, but the Hitler Plan proves that all parties related to the Danzig issue are considering resolving disputes through compromise. Germany's attitude is trending towards reconciliation. The German press's calm attitude towards the shooting of Polish customs officials on the Danzig border is a good example. The German press is showing extreme restraint, a stark contrast to the reaction of the German press when Germany was about to take aggressive action in the past. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

(Berlin) Foreign observers here claim that although German party and government leaders continue to claim that the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor should be merged into Germany, they are also confused about how this will be realized. In addition, the German government recently received a report from Warsaw, stating that if Poland takes any action against the city of Danzig, then Poland will definitely resist, regardless of whether other countries provide assistance. Moreover, the determination of Britain and France to resist aggression is different from the situation in Czechoslovakia in September last year. All of these points are known to Germany. Therefore, it only hopes that the Polish government can make suggestions to Germany so that both sides can negotiate. At this moment, residents of Berlin are somewhat anxious because the government has decided to hold a real air defense exercise here this month. However, important government officials are making every effort to remain calm. Führer Hitler is still in his villa in Berchtesgaden. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is currently in Salzburg, Austria, spending his vacation. Air Minister Goering plans to visit Hamburg on Wednesday. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(Berlin) Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, although the German government claims to be confident that it will be resolved peacefully in accordance with Germany's wishes, this is not the case among the people. In recent days, there have been many rumors in Berlin, and residents are anxious, all believing that the European situation may become tense again in early August, reaching a serious stage. In addition, the government has decided to hold an air defense exercise in the city this month. In terms of public opinion, recalling that a similar exercise was also held in August last year, and then the Czech incident soon became tense, they are deeply afraid that this year's situation will be the same, and they are becoming more and more anxious. In addition, there are various rumors, such as dozens of cars and trucks in the capital will be requisitioned by the government for use on August 6, first, and the vacations of officers of the army, navy, and air force have been uniformly canceled, second. All of these rumors cannot be confirmed. At this moment, the German government is continuously spreading its determination at home and abroad, while also comforting its own public opinion, saying that if war between Germany and Poland does break out, it will not expand. Even if Britain and France want to help Poland, they will not be able to reach them. In addition, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been delayed without any success. Both Britain and the Soviet Union have encountered difficulties with Japan in the Far East. Germany's military strength is far stronger than Poland's. All of these are beneficial to Germany. However, German public opinion does not seem to be moved by this kind of argument. Most people still waver between optimism and pessimism. The optimistic faction's view is quite naive, believing that Führer Hitler has won without fighting many times in the past, and this time it will be the same. The pessimistic faction says that since the annexation of Czechoslovakia, the European situation has undergone major changes. The process of expanding armaments in Britain and France has been accelerated, first, and the attitude of Poland and Turkey has changed, second. Various small countries in Europe should be wary of Germany's ambitions and are secretly hostile to Germany, third. Among the two factions, the pessimists are more numerous. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Poland Determined to Defend Danzig with Force, Chief of the Army Speaks, Explaining Attitude Towards the Free City

Warsaw. After General Smigly-Rydz, Chief of the Army, spoke to reporters from Britain and the United States yesterday, explaining Poland's attitude towards the Free City of Danzig, the local newspapers have now commented on it, saying that Poland is prepared to fight for the Free City of Danzig. The Polish Express said, "In 1932, when an accident occurred on the Westerplatte peninsula outside the port of Danzig (the Polish authorities received a report that unscrupulous elements in Danzig were preparing to take action on the peninsula), our former Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, sent the navy and army to Danzig to deter them. It is hoped that the German authorities will learn from this, so that the Polish government authorities do not need to imitate Piłsudski's actions." In addition, the full text of General Smigly-Rydz's speech has been broadcast throughout the country, with a semi-official commentary attached: "Those who hope to use strategies to separate the city of Danzig from Poland without war should listen to General Smigly-Rydz's speech." In addition, Britain and France have also declared that they will act in concert with Poland on the Danzig issue. Therefore, will there be millions of soldiers in Europe wrapped in horsehide on various battlefields? This is really up to a single thought of the German authorities. It is up to Germany to choose and adopt it." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Warsaw. Regarding the case of a Polish border soldier being shot and killed by a customs officer from the Free City of Danzig, both sides are now trying to reduce its seriousness. Responsible persons here claim that the Polish government will take appropriate measures after the results of the investigation are clear. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Anglo-Polish Loan to Be Established Soon

(London) A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters has learned that the Anglo-Polish negotiations have made significant progress today, and an agreement is expected to be reached soon. It includes two parts: (1) An £8 million loan to Poland, to be used exclusively for purchasing ordnance and munitions from Britain. (2) Another £5 million loan in cash, to be used freely by the Polish government in other countries, but with a few reservations. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Warsaw. After completing his visit to Warsaw, General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces of the United Kingdom, returned home by special plane today. In fact, the destination is currently kept secret. Before leaving, he addressed the foreign troops under his command during the Great War in Polish. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

(London) The Export Credit Guarantee Bill (advocating that the credit loan amount be increased from £10 million to £60 million), after being passed for the second time in the House of Commons on the 14th of this month, was recently submitted to the House of Lords for discussion today. The opposition Labour Party member, Lord Strabolgi, inquired about the financial negotiations between Britain and Poland, saying, "Poland is our ally, and we must strengthen its military equipment to resist aggression and control. We will purchase military equipment from the United States. I have no objection to this method. It would be unwise if Poland could purchase military equipment elsewhere and we did not provide assistance." In short, our various munitions factories are receiving government orders and have no spare capacity to work for Poland. In the financial negotiations between Britain and Poland, the government must not adopt a tough attitude. Sir Thomas Inskip immediately replied on behalf of the government, "Since Britain has guaranteed Poland's independence, it is eager to provide full assistance to the country and strengthen its national defense. However, at a certain time, what we can do is also limited. If we now lend a large amount of money to Poland so that it can purchase military equipment from other countries, there are also difficulties. All of this is understood by your members. This is also understood by the government authorities, who are actively negotiating with the Polish delegation. Although the details are not convenient to submit for discussion, the government authorities have decided to satisfy Poland's other various requirements as much as possible. This is what I dare to guarantee to your members." According to reports, regarding the financial negotiations between the two countries, the British authorities required that all loans to Poland should be used to purchase military equipment in Britain, while Poland wanted to use a part of the loans to purchase military equipment in the United States, and the talks were therefore once deadlocked. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Severe Drought in Japan Affects Wartime Industry, Lack of Hydropower Supply, Hopeless Autumn Harvest, Worry About People's Food, National Finances Fall into More Difficult Situation

(Nanjing) According to foreign and Chinese business news, Japan is currently experiencing the most severe drought in six years, resulting in a precarious rice harvest in large areas and a shortage of hydropower production. The government now attaches importance to this situation, but will not start large-scale relief until after the autumn harvest. At the same time, if the shortage of hydropower is not stopped, it may have a serious impact on the government's wartime industrial expansion program. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

(Moscow) The "Red Star" recently published an article titled "Japan's War Expenses," which stated, "Japan's financial position has always been unstable because its foreign trade has long been surpassed by others, and its gold reserves are also limited. Since the occupation of Manchuria and the start of the war of aggression against China, its situation has deteriorated further. The huge amount of government bonds issued continuously over the years has reached a total of 175 billion yen by the end of 1938, exhausting its financial resources. The enormous war expenses further show the weakening of its financial foundation. The two-year war has resulted in Japan's economic and financial situation being prolonged. Japan will find it increasingly difficult to raise funds for the war of aggression against China, and this war was launched by the Japanese militarists themselves." (TASS dispatch, 20th)

### Romanian-German Agricultural Agreement Signed

Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The Romanian-German agricultural agreement was recently formally signed by the Romanian Minister of Economy, Beuyuk, and the representative of the German Ministry of Agriculture, to supplement the economic treaty signed by both sides on April 1. The terms of this agreement have been revised to the economic treaty to avoid Germany's permanent control of Romania's agriculture. The full text of the agreement will be published on the 23rd of this month, including a protocol and several annexes. The protocol is based on the following three principles: (1) Romania's crops and dairy products should be improved in terms of both quality and quantity. (2) Romania's current agricultural system should be reorganized. (3) When Romanian agricultural products are sold to Germany in large quantities, the price must be stable, and Germany must pay a part in advance to the farmers to maintain the normality of the export quantity. The annexes are related to the following items: (1) The raising and sale of livestock. (2) The planting of oilseeds. (3) The planting of grapes and winemaking. (4) The sowing of grains. (5) The production of eggs and dairy products. In addition, it is stipulated that (1) Germany should sell a large number of machines needed for the dairy and distillation industries to Romania. (2) The agricultural companies that can be jointly established by Germany and Romania should be purely private enterprises and not regarded as state-run companies. If disputes occur within the companies, the Romanians may take back the companies and run them themselves. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### The United States Buys Foreign Silver, Further Suppressing Prices, $0.435 Per Ounce

(Washington) US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters yesterday that the government will continue to purchase foreign silver. According to daily regulations, after the price of silver was reduced to $0.435 per ounce, the amount of silver purchased by the Treasury Department decreased sharply. Yesterday's price was $0.435 per ounce. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Europe Releases Air of Easing Situation, French Foreign Minister Meets with Papal Envoy, US Ambassador to Britain Goes to France for Vacation

(London) The Financial Times reported that "Helander, a counselor of the German Ministry of Economy, is currently here to participate in the whale conference and is taking the opportunity to discuss business issues with the British government authorities. The goal is to use business issues as a basis to try to ease the international situation to a certain extent, with a rigid exchange condition attached. That is, if Germany obtains some form of international assistance economically, it should restore its military industry to a peaceful foundation. In other words, the country agrees to reduce its armaments to a certain extent. However, given the current situation, it would be too optimistic to expect this to develop immediately, but exploratory work is in progress." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet's meeting with the Vatican envoy Valeri yesterday has attracted general attention. It is believed to be related to the possibility of the Roman Catholic Church taking on the role of mediating the international situation. The Vatican envoy is paying close attention to France's attitude towards this attempt. Valeri's visit to Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday was almost for this purpose. It is expected that the Roman Catholic envoys stationed in various European countries will also visit the diplomatic authorities of those countries in the near future. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)

(London) US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy flew from here to Paris today. It is reported that Kennedy will spend a six-week vacation with his family in southern France. Political figures therefore believe that there may be no major political changes this summer. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)

### US-China Legislation Amendment Shelved; France Urges Britain to Further Concede to the Soviet Union; The Three-Nation Mutual Assistance Agreement Should Be Established Soon; Britain Sends New Instructions to its Ambassador to the Soviet Union

(London) Regarding the issue of the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, the British government, after exchanging views with the French authorities yesterday, will issue new instructions to Sir Seeds, its ambassador to the Soviet Union, today. It is heard that the content will continue to make concessions in the hope of satisfying the Soviet Union. According to reports, the Soviet government recently put forward two demands: (1) to define indirect aggression; (2) the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union should conclude a military agreement before establishing a political agreement. Regarding the first item, although it is inconvenient for the United Kingdom to obviously change its attitude, regarding the second item, the United Kingdom originally advocated a political agreement first, followed by a military agreement. It is now heard that both agreements should be established at the same time. In this way, the most important point of the Soviet Union has been satisfied, and concessions can be made on the issue of indirect aggression, so that the current negotiations can be successfully concluded. (Havas, 21st)

(Paris) Well-informed sources in France claim that the French government has decided today that the United Kingdom and France must continue to make concessions to the Soviet Union in order to achieve the early completion of the anti-aggression public interest. It is generally believed that the failure of the US neutrality law amendment issue has made the current tense situation even more serious. Therefore, it is believed that France will urge Britain to accept the Soviet Union's opinion that it must automatically provide assistance when the Baltic countries are subjected to indirect aggression. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) Regarding the matter of the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Kaosh, had talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax, Official Butler, Official Jadgan and British government foreign affairs adviser Wang Xitai at the Foreign Office today, so that the United Kingdom and France could agree on the same instructions and send them to their respective ambassadors to the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, the governments of the United Kingdom and France will continue to exchange views tomorrow, so the ambassadors may not meet with Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov again until next week. (Havas, 20th)

(London) This morning, the local newspapers reported that France is putting pressure on Britain, urging the British government to make further concessions to the Soviet Union, so as to end the tripartite treaty negotiations between Britain, France and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. The "Daily Telegraph", which has close ties with the British Foreign Office, commented, "We believe that it is unwise for the British government to seek closer alignment with the Soviet Union in terms of opinion. The new instructions being drafted must be sent to Moscow only after the United Kingdom and France have expressed their agreement on the concessions." (Haitong, 21st)

### Soviet Naval Power Strengthened; More Than Four Times Greater Than Before; Sufficient to Protect the East, West, and North Coastlines; Baltic Fleet Completes Exercises

(Moscow) Naval Construction People's Committee Chairman Devosian recently issued a report on the Soviet Union's shipbuilding achievements, stating that the Soviet government built a total of 480 warships with 858,000 tons in the two five-year plans, which is more than four times the number and three times the tonnage of those built by the Tsarist Russian government in the ten years before World War I. With the powerful submarine fleet, it is able to protect the coastline in the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the North Sea, and the Far East with ease. (Havas, 21st)

(Moscow) The exercises of the Soviet Baltic Fleet have been completed. A total of 50 warships participated. Soviet Naval General Staff Council member Zidano and Navy Committee Chairman Kuzrotrov Navy Lieutenant General inspected the fleet together on the flagship. The exercise fleet departed on July 14, bypassed Gotland Island on the night of the 16th, and returned to the Krogstad base, arriving at the port on the 17th. The total distance was more than 1,000 miles. Navy Committee Chairman Kuznetsov reviewed the results and said that the political training, morale, and military training of the Red Navy soldiers and commanders were extremely superb. (Tass, 20th)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Chinese Civilians; Information Received by the League of Nations; I Will Announce it; British Labor MP Questions the Government

(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, Labor MP Henderson raised the following questions regarding the bombing of civilians by Japanese planes in China: (1) Has the British government investigated any government with diplomatic representatives stationed in China and obtained detailed information on the bombing of civilians by Japanese planes? (2) Has this information been submitted to the League of Nations Council in accordance with the resolution passed by the Council in May 1939? (3) Will the British representative to the League of Nations Council be asked to announce it immediately? Foreign Secretary Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax had not yet received a report from the League of Nations Secretariat on this matter. Halifax and other government representatives on the Council agreed to publish all reports received by the Council, but only on the condition that the government providing the report does not object. (Reuters, 20th)

### Soviet-Japanese Dispute; Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Says it Has Reached the Point of Being Unbearable

(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated at a press conference here today that the dispute between the Japanese oil concession on North Sakhalin Island and the local Soviet court continues to develop. This situation is intolerable. The naval spokesperson yesterday pointed out that the Soviet government deliberately adopted a policy of starving the Japanese people in North Sakhalin Island. He also said that this is true, because the Japanese people in the area are indeed feeling a severe shortage of food. (Reuters, 21st)

### Former Japanese Army Minister Terauchi Departs for Germany to Attend the National Socialist Party Congress

(Tokyo) Former Army Minister Terauchi and Military Councilor Bei Daikaku departed from Kobe today for Nuremberg to attend the National Socialist Party Congress, which will open in September. Among those accompanying them is the president of Tokyo Gas Company, representing the Japanese financial community. According to reports, Terauchi and Daikaku were both personally invited by Hitler to participate. (Reuters, 20th)

### US Anti-Aggression Committee Chairman Strongly Advocates Sanctions Against Japan; Members of Congress Still Divided Over the Munitions Embargo Against China

(Washington) The chairman of the American Committee for Non-Aggression Against Japan, Green, stated in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that if the supply of munitions and their raw materials to Japan is prohibited, even if Japan's economy collapses as a result, Japan will not resort to force against the United States. This can be seen from the fact that Japan has been repeatedly attacked by the Soviet Union but has not yet caused a war between the two countries. Furthermore, supplying munitions and raw materials to Japan is tantamount to treating the Nine-Power Treaty as a child's play. According to reports, Green made this statement during the committee's discussion of various proposals to prohibit the supply of munitions and raw materials to Japan. After exchanging views, the members agreed that the Secretary of State must first explain whether it is feasible to prohibit the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan before discussing which proposals are good and which are not. Some members also believe that even if Hull believes it is feasible, the members of the committee may not be willing to take actions that offend Japan. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom did not clearly express his views on this point. According to him, the prohibition of cotton exports to Japan is opposed by some members, so he advocated not including cotton. According to a letter from Columbia University President Butler to Bloom, he firmly supports President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act, because this Neutrality Act not only conforms to the interests of the United States, but also prevents another world war. Moreover, if a world war unfortunately breaks out, the United States will inevitably be drawn into the vortex of war and will not be spared. Therefore, the current actions of the United States must be able to do its best to prevent the outbreak of a world war. According to reports, Butler recently returned to the country after inspecting Europe. (Associated Press, 20th)

(New York) Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg submitted a proposal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, advocating that the United States government should convene another meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to examine whether Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty and whether it is still being violated. This matter was recently commented on by the Republican New Yorker Forum, which stated, "Japan will definitely refuse to participate, and there is no hope that its current Far East policy will change. Therefore, holding an international meeting at this time may not be of much benefit. For the present plan, why doesn't our country list the facts of Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty to show evidence? If Japan cannot immediately prove that it is willing to fulfill the treaty and show its ability to fulfill it, then our country believes that it is no longer necessary to maintain diplomatic relations with that country." (Havas, 21st)

### US-China Legislation Shelved; Congress to Adjourn Early

(Washington) Since the Neutrality Act cannot be discussed, the House and Senate have accelerated their efforts to adjourn Congress early. According to Senator Barkley, Congress should adjourn on the 29th, but because of the Republican Party's fierce opposition to the government's plan, it will not be able to adjourn until after August 5. According to Republican Senator McLeni, the government's loan plan will prevent the development of private capital investment and will bring various enterprises under government management. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Mussolini Reforms Sicily

(Rome) All the evening editions here carried headlines in very conspicuous type, stating that Premier Mussolini has decided to reform the agricultural system of Sicily and find ways to improve its arable land. A ten-year plan has been drawn up to develop both the currently cultivated and uncultivated wasteland. The expenses required will be mostly borne by the government, but private investment can be accepted in the future. The major landowners on the island will be forced to adopt new farming methods and improve the treatment of tenant farmers. If they refuse to comply, the government will confiscate their land. According to reports, the island's largest landowners are nobles, and the main agricultural products are wheat and wine. (Havas, 20th)

(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech to the fascist leaders of Sicily at the Venice Palace yesterday, announcing the government's plan to divide Sicilian real estate into small farms, saying, "After the implementation of this plan, it will have great significance for Italy's economy, and it is also an important development in Italian history. According to the plan, which was proposed on June 20, 1938, after the implementation of small farms, the existing production can be doubled. The implementation of this plan will begin today." The audience cheered in approval. The Minister of Agriculture then gave a speech, saying, "Sicily has 1,250,000 acres of land. It is planned to divide it into 20,000 small farms within ten years. The government will allocate 1,000,000,000 lira as expenses, of which 400,000,000 lira will be used for the construction of roads, water plants, and public entertainment, and the remaining 600,000,000 lira will be used for the construction of farmhouses. The first phase of farmhouse construction will be 2,000 units. Mussolini will preside over the groundbreaking ceremony on October 18 next year." (Haitong, 21st)

### Palestine Problem; British MPs Impeach the Government; Saying its Policy is Unfair; The Motion for Impeachment is Ultimately Rejected

(London) The debate on the Palestine problem began with a speech by Labor MP Williams. Williams pointed out that the government's approach is not allowed by law and not tolerated by morality. McDonald and others cannot forcibly implement such an unjust and untrustworthy policy. It is too late to persuade the Arab and Jewish peoples to cooperate as they did in the past. A kind of federal system may be possible. This will eliminate the Arab people's fear of being controlled and allow the Jewish people to continue to obtain their opportunities. Conservative Wilson then spoke, saying that the problem cannot be solved unless it is firmly remembered that Palestine is only the southern part of Syria. Now a Syrian federation should be formed with one Jewish state and one Christian state, and three Arab states, or they should cooperate under the joint supervision of Britain and France, and be controlled by the League of Nations. Opposition Liberal MP Mand also pointed out that McDonald's policy cannot satisfy anyone in Palestine. McDonald should consider submitting the government's policy to the international community for permanent legal decision. Conservative Cooper said that Britain's policy is absolutely fair in its treatment of both sides, and one evidence of its failure is that illegal immigrants have been successful, while legal immigrants have been prevented. Now a more powerful and more practical method is urgently needed. If two friends come to ask for help, the first thing to decide is which friend needs more help. The Arab people have enjoyed greater prosperity since the war, and their freedom has been unprecedented for centuries. The Jewish people are still wandering and displaced, and they all urgently need assistance. After the members finished speaking, McDonald gave a speech, reiterating the policy of the White Paper, saying that what is enough to destroy the hope of peace in Palestine is almost nothing more than implementing this policy today, changing another policy tomorrow, procrastinating and achieving nothing. Cooper's policy only makes the Arab people of the world hate the Jewish people, and cannot produce peace. There is currently no policy that will immediately bring peace to Palestine, but the policy set by the government can become the basis for the Arab and Jewish people to finally seek peace together. McDonald then refuted the opposition party's claim that the government had failed to fulfill its promises to the Jewish people, and ignored the fate of Jewish refugees in Central Europe, etc., and said that if illegal immigration is not prohibited, the Arab people will doubt the sincerity of the government in implementing its policies. If this causes a change, the victims will not only be the Jewish people. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) During the afternoon meeting of the House of Commons today to discuss the colonial budget, members of the opposition parties and Conservative MP Tev Cooper criticized the government's policy in Palestine and the recently published White Paper on the Palestine problem. Their words included, "I am truly afraid that the credibility and prestige of Britain in Palestine for the Jewish and Arab people will gradually decline to an unprecedented level. The government's recent decision that Jewish people must not immigrate to Palestine for six months from October 1 of this year is enough to prove the failure of the government's policy. Today, the situation of the Jewish people is more tragic than that of the Arab people. Therefore, it is necessary to take Palestine as a place for the Jewish people to live and establish an autonomous state. Opposition Labor MP Williams then spoke, saying that Britain's policy in Palestine has failed. Now, at a time when the international refugee relief issue is the most difficult, it is inappropriate to prohibit Jewish people from immigrating to Palestine. Even the League of Nations Mandate Commission has not been able to agree with the policy pointed out in the British White Paper. It is strange that the Commission's report has not been published for a long time. For the present plan, the League of Nations Council should discuss the British White Paper after the British Parliament has discussed this report. In short, the British government should not take into account the views of the radical factions of the Arab people and ignore the claims of the moderate factions. Jewish and Arab people should work together to form a federation. Finally, Colonial Secretary McDonald replied that the White Paper has been voted on and passed by Congress. The opposition Labor Party immediately proposed a motion that the colonial budget should be reduced by ten pounds to show its opposition, but it was ultimately rejected by the House of Commons by a vote of 188 to 119. (Havas, 20th)

(Jerusalem) Many landmine incidents occurred in various parts of Palestine yesterday. Someone buried a landmine under the tracks of the Lane railway line. The train passed by the area and exploded on the spot. Fortunately, there were no serious losses. Near Hasidim, a policeman accidentally triggered a landmine and was seriously injured. The police authorities then sent personnel to search the area and found an unexploded landmine, so they dug it out and took it away. After hearing the news, the British garrison authorities searched Jewish residences in Tikva, Aviv, Lehovose, and other places to hunt down the murderer. (Haitong, 21st)

### France and Turkey Negotiate Smoothly; Guarantee Cooperation to Resist Aggression; British Fleet to Visit Turkey Next Month

(Ankara) The head of the French military delegation, Huajingge, began military talks with the Turkish authorities on Monday. The talks have been progressing very smoothly until last night, and both sides have guaranteed the most effective and fully armed cooperation once the Balkans or the Near East are invaded. In addition, the two sides also discussed the issue of unified command. The talks between the two sides will not end before the end of next week. (Associated Press, 21st)

He will present a report on the results of his gravity measurements in the Philippine Islands and other research work. (Havas, 20th)

### Results of Munitions Exports to Japan; The United States Suffers Huge Losses; Totaling US$2.5 Billion; Harlan Advocates Stopping the Export of War Materials to Japan

The Millard's Review reported that Harlan, chairman of the United States Committee for Famine and Flood Relief in China, recently sent out letters stating that in the past five years, American manufacturers sold various goods to Japan, totaling US$114.6 million, of which at least US$600 million were materials used for war purposes. There are now several results: (1) Making Japan a militaristic power, capable of occupying Manchuria, North China, the Yangtze River Basin, Chinese seaports, and inland cities in the past five years. At the same time, Japan has indeed occupied or destroyed all American investments in China, including church schools, churches, universities, and hospitals worth 50 million yuan, and commercial investments of 250 million yuan. (2) Making the Chinese buy 100 million yuan less of American goods every year in the past five years, and it may be the same in the next five years. Then, the commercial losses of the United States in ten years will total 1 billion yuan. (3) Selling war materials to Japan makes it stronger, and the United States feels in danger and has to spend more than 1.2 billion yuan to strengthen the defenses of the Pacific coast, because the dangerous enemy of the United States in the Pacific is Japan. Therefore, the industrial losses are 300 million yuan, the trade losses are 1 billion yuan, and the Pacific coast defense is 1.2 billion yuan. The total is 2.5 billion yuan. This number is four times the income of the American people from selling war materials to Japan. Not only that, but the fourth result, or the greatest of all human importance, is that humanity suffers greatly as a result. The aggressor Japan, who destroys treaties, has lost 300,000 to 400,000 people due to injuries and diseases, but the injured and sick Chinese have exceeded one million. The old, weak, women and children who have died due to hunger, cold, disease, or the bombing, burning, rape, looting, massacre, and other atrocities that came with the Japanese army are even more unknown. American private individuals may have donated 2 million yuan to relieve the suffering of the Chinese people, but it is not enough to cope with the damage and suffering caused by 600 million yuan of war materials. We hope that the US government will provide some relief to the people who are now suffering from terrible massacres and lend 100 million yuan, or it will work. If we sell war materials to Japan, and Japan wins, we will suffer even greater losses. After the war ends, Japanese soldiers will return to industrial life. If Japan can establish its dream empire, even if it realizes a small part of it, it will make demands on its neighbors (including the United States), and it will not be easy for the United States to reject Japanese goods. Therefore, if Japan can obtain raw materials and workers who work more than ten hours a day and earn 25 cents, how can American laborers who need two to ten yuan a day compete with them? If China wins, then China will definitely be revived for many years to come, and will make extensive use of its own resources for the benefit of its own people. What are the remedies now? (1) Stop exporting war materials to Japan. (2) Make other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty do the same. (3) Lend China funds sufficient to take care of hospitals and refugees. (4) Stop exporting new machinery to any country where wages are far lower than the American standard. Although these remedies are not easy to implement, they are all important and feasible.

### 15 Japanese Planes Fly Over Northern Jiangsu; Dropping More Than Ten Bombs in Yiling

According to a Yang Zhou dispatch, at 10:00 AM on the 16th, five Japanese fighter planes, four reconnaissance planes, and six bomber planes flew in from the southwest, gathered over the fairy maiden above Ba Shu, circled several times, and dropped many kinds of leaflets. Then two Japanese bomber planes and one fighter plane flew east to bomb Ma Qiao and Yiling. The remaining twelve Japanese planes turned to fly southwest. The Japanese planes bombing Yiling dropped more than ten bombs in the town, landing behind Dongyue Yong's body, in Xiaoche West Street, and at the Ma Jiaxiang Bathhouse. A total of more than six civilian houses were destroyed and 30 to 40 civilians were killed or injured. It was also heard that the building behind the pawnshop in the town was completely destroyed. After the bombing, the three Japanese planes flew west immediately. It is generally speculated that the batch of Japanese planes flew from Nanjing. The intention was to raid and bomb various parts of northern Jiangsu, but because the air was bad on the morning of the day, most of the Japanese planes flew back to their base. Only three planes flew close to Yang Xian and wantonly dropped bombs over the undefended town of Yiling.

### Hua Nan Hua Xi Military Western Front Completes Scorched Earth Policy; All Roads Destroyed Except the Route from Lin to Gong; Cai Tingkai Inspects Coastal Front

Guangxi Correspondence: The South China battlefield, with Guangdong Province as its center, has been reorganized through the efforts of the highest military authorities of the Chinese side and is broadly divided into eastern, western, and northern fronts. The eastern front starts from Huizhou, extends along the coast of Lufeng and Haifeng to Chaozhou and Shantou, and ends at the Fujian border. The western front starts from Jiangmen and Xinhui, extends along the main and tributary streams of the West River, upstream to Sanshui and Zhaoqing, and ends at Wuzhou in Guangxi Province. For the convenience of military communication between Guangdong and Guangxi, the authorities have also incorporated the counties of Liangyang, Gaolei, Qinlian in southern Guangdong into the western front command. The northern front starts from Zengcheng, Conghua, Huaxian, and Qingyuan north of Guangzhou, extends along the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, and ends at Shaoguan and Lechang. The top commanders of these fronts are Wu Qiwai, Xiang Hanping in the east, Yu Hanmou, Ye Zhao in the north, and Xia Wei, Cai Tingkai in the west. On the western front, the scorched earth policy has been implemented for ten months. As a result of the Southwest Military Affairs Council meeting, the area has been divided into garrison areas and security areas. The counties of Gaolei, Qinlian along the coast of southern Guangdong are designated as garrison areas, while Wuzhou in eastern Guangxi and Yulin and Nanning in southern Guangxi are designated as security areas. The southern Guangdong garrison area extends from the Leizhou Peninsula, along Anpu Estuary, Beihai, to the coast of Fangcheng and Dongxing, a total length of more than a thousand li. Since receiving the order to carry out the

scorched earth campaign, all cities and villages within 100 kilometers of the coast must comply with the scorched earth regulations: (1) evacuate the population, (2) relocate grain and materials, (3) thoroughly destroy roads, (4) demolish all village bunkers and obstacles hindering guerrilla movements. The garrison headquarters is responsible for the above scorched earth work and supervises the county heads along the coast to handle it. After receiving the order, the county heads are responsible for assigning the tasks to the district and township offices for implementation in sections. Recently, the garrison headquarters reported to the western front's highest command that the coastal scorched earth work had been

completed in stages by the end of June and that the highest command had dispatched work teams to the counties in the south to inspect them in sections. It was concluded that the county heads had handled the scorched earth work properly and that it was sufficient to meet the needs of military preparations. As for the counties within the security area, the priority is to destroy roads. In cities and villages within thirty li on both sides of the road, the amount of grain and materials stored must not exceed two months' supply. As for metals such as copper, iron, tin, and all minerals, they must be moved to places more than thirty li away from the road to avoid temporary loss of control. The current Rongcang Highway (Cangwu to Rongxian), Rongyu Highway (Rongxian to Yulin), Yubo Highway (Yulin to Bobai), Wubo Highway (Pingfu Wulinxu to Bobai), and Nanning Highway (Gongxian Nanxiangxu to Nanning) have mostly been

destroyed and converted into paddy fields for rice cultivation. According to a spokesperson for the Guangxi provincial government, it is estimated that this year's autumn harvest will yield an additional 300,000 to 500,000 dan of grain after the above-mentioned sections of the roads are destroyed and converted into paddy fields, which can be said to be a gain from a loss. However, the Yulin Highway is still kept open for traffic and has not been completely destroyed. This road is the only transportation line in the southern Guangxi garrison area. It is reported that after ten months of personnel adjustments, replenishment of military supplies, new army training, and guerrilla coordination, the strength of the Anti-Japanese War in the entire South China theater has been greatly enhanced and can be deployed at any time. General Cai Tingkai, Deputy Commander of the Western Front, departed from Guangxi last week to inspect Xinyi, Kaiping, Zhanjiang, Enping, Yangjiang, and Gaozhou. His itinerary is expected to include inspections along the coast of Gaolei. After completing the patrols of Gaolei, he will then proceed to Hepu and Fangcheng. The purpose of General Cai's inspection is to inspect the entire coastal front and personally instruct the commanders of each garrison area in appropriate strategies in preparation for a major counter-offensive.

### Ministry of Education Holds University Curriculum Conference; Core Courses for Twenty-One Departments Determined; Normal School Curriculum Conference to be Held Soon

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) Recently, the Ministry of Education invited representatives from various universities and scientists to hold a university curriculum conference and passed the subject lists for each department. Details are recorded below.

Except for medical subjects, which were stipulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education in the 27th year of the Republic, the curricula of other colleges have always been determined by the schools themselves. Since the subjects set up by each school are inconsistent, it is inevitable that the students' levels are uneven. After Minister Chen took office, he actively promoted the reorganization of university curricula in order to improve the level of university education. In March of last year, he solicited the opinions of university teachers and drafted an ideal subject list. Later, experts were asked to refer to the situations of various schools to draft a list of required and elective subjects for each department and a list of common required subjects for each college. They were sent to experts in the same department for review. In September of last year, the first university curriculum conference was held and the list of common required subjects for each college and department was passed and promulgated for trial implementation in various schools. The list of required and elective subjects for each department, after being reviewed by several experts in the same department, was redistributed to various universities for detailed discussion and comment by the professors of the department. Experts were then asked to organize the opinions and formulate another draft, and finally the university curriculum conference was convened to make a decision. The curricula of the engineering and agricultural departments were previously discussed at the production conferences convened by the Executive Yuan when the deans of the engineering and agricultural colleges of various universities came to Chongqing. From June 26th to 29th, a curriculum conference for the colleges of arts, law, science, and business was held at the Ministry of Education. More than sixty people attended, including Luo Jialun, Wang Xinggong, Wu Nanxuan, Ye Wenlong, Chen Shi, Ma Yinchu, Yang Gongda, Chen Zhimai, Wu Wenzao, Sun Guangyuan, Ma Xifan, Lou Guanglai, Hu Huanyong, Zhu Guangqian, Wu Chu, Yuan Hanqing, Wei Xueren, and Shou Jingwei. Zhang Daofan and Gu Yuxiu were successively appointed as chairmen by the Ministry of Education to jointly determine the required subjects for twenty-one departments of each college. Minister Chen also hosted a luncheon for the attending experts on the last day to express his gratitude. The list of required and elective subjects will be promulgated soon. It is also heard that a curriculum conference for normal colleges will also be held soon. (July 12th)

### The Stabilization Fund Will Be Maintained: Foreign Exchange Seems to Have Reached a New Level; Foreign Exchange Shrank Sharply Again Yesterday, Gold Prices Soared; Government Bonds Fell, Discounts Recovered and Rose Again; The Foreign Exchange Shrinking Trend Seems to Be Returning to Calm

Shanghai's black market foreign exchange and gold black market, etc., have experienced drastic changes due to speculation by speculators. Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate shrank sharply again. The foreign exchange, gold, and securities markets were extremely chaotic. Exchange discounts soared accordingly. Then it was reported that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would be maintained. Therefore, the market situation calmed down slightly. However, the fundamentals of the legal currency itself remain sound. Details are as follows:

Restricting Supply of Foreign Exchange Leads to Sharp Shrinkage

After the black market foreign exchange shrank sharply due to daily absorption, the HSBC exchange rate shrank again yesterday morning. The British exchange rate was four pence, and the US exchange rate was 7.75 yuan. The restrictions on over-the-counter sales were very strict, creating a state of having prices but no market. It was then heard that the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would maintain it. At the same time, HSBC still provided for legitimate needs, so people's minds were slightly relieved. According to a New Life News reporter who inquired from banking circles, the restricted supply of foreign exchange in the black market and the suppression of exchange rates are aimed at preventing a certain party from arbitrage buying foreign exchange. However, the foreign exchange in Tianjin continued to shrink with the black market foreign exchange prices in Shanghai. Therefore, arbitrage buyers can still obtain substantial profits, so it is necessary to suppress the black market exchange rate in Shanghai again. According to a New News Agency reporter who inquired from banking circles yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee had a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, ordering HSBC and other banks to maintain the British exchange rate above four pence. Therefore, there is no fear of a sharp shrinkage, only a fear of unstable exchange rates, which has resulted in a turnaround.

The Gold Black Market is Extremely Chaotic

The gold black market, due to the vigorous absorption by the Northern Gang and the intensified manipulation by speculators, created the highest peak of 3,955 yuan at the close of the previous day. Yesterday, the black market gathering place delayed the opening time because the settlement procedures for the transactions made the day before had not yet been completed, taking into account the interests of the industry. At that time, a new record of 4,600 yuan was created. When it opened at 10:30, it was 4,100 yuan. Then, due to the emergence of large investors, it fell back to 3,750 yuan. The closing price at 12:00 noon was 3,860 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the gold price continued to fall, and the closing price was 3,565 yuan. As for the silver shop's listed price, Datong Bank was 400 yuan in the morning and lowered to 360 yuan in the afternoon. The situation in the black market yesterday was extremely chaotic.

Securities Prices Fell Again Yesterday

After the securities black market plummeted due to speculators flocking to the market to switch to foreign exchange and gold, the unified bonds fell again at the opening yesterday morning. At the close, Category A bonds were 49 yuan, down 3.8 yuan; Category B bonds were 41.5 yuan, down 2.9 yuan; Category C bonds were 40.09 yuan, down 2.15 yuan; Category D bonds were 40.03 yuan, down 1.7 yuan; Category E bonds were 40.05 yuan, down 1.85 yuan. As for the seventh installment of the unified government bonds due at the end of July, the Ministry of Finance decided to stop repaying principal and interest in accordance with the notice of January 15. However, the four banks of the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank have agreed to discount and lend in order to stabilize the market. However, it is stipulated that Chongqing will fully discount and lend, while Shanghai and other ports will discount and lend in six installments.

Villains Conspire to Create Abnormalities

A New Life News reporter inquired from financial circles yesterday that after the implementation of China's legal currency policy, it has remained stable since the Anti-Japanese War. No problems have occurred within the areas directly controlled by the government. However, there are so-called black markets in special areas such as Shanghai. The crux of the matter is that the government's power is temporarily insufficient, villains are at work, and speculators are fueling the flames, resulting in the abnormal situation in Shanghai today. However, due to the sound foundation of the legal currency itself, it can still maintain a stable state even in the midst of storms. This is the result of the effectiveness of the Chinese government's legal currency policy.

Exchange Discounts are Endless

The Shanghai market's legal currency position, after the promulgation of the measures to stabilize finance in August 1937, the remedy is the chips that cannot be cashed in for exchange, followed by the mortgage exchange implemented from July 4 this year. Due to the need for legal currency, coupled with the speculation of speculators, there is the emergence of exchange discounts. When the new exchange was first produced, the exchange discount fell together, and there was a possibility of elimination. However, in recent days, due to the sharp shrinkage of black market foreign exchange, the exchange discount has suddenly tended to rise. The discount rate on the previous day was as high as 200 yuan. Yesterday, the highest was 260 yuan, and then it fell back to 215 yuan.

Changes in Foreign and Domestic Exchange Rates

The statutory foreign exchange in Shanghai has always been stabilized by the government at one shilling and two and a half pence. The fluctuation in the black market has dropped from eight pence to six pence, and is now falling to around four pence. For domestic exchange, Shanghai needs more than 130 yuan in legal currency to buy 100 yuan of Shanghai remittance in Tianjin. For Shanghai to Chongqing, Sichuan banks can take 100 yuan of legal currency in Chongqing by paying around 90 yuan of legal currency in Shanghai. The results show that the Shanghai market has a surplus in the capital flow to Tianjin and Chongqing, and both Tianjin and Chongqing need a large amount of funds to move to Shanghai.

Continued Collection of North China Banknotes

Recently, due to the manipulation of Shanghai and Tianjin capital movements by villains, the fact that banknotes with North China place names have been discontinued in Shanghai has occurred. This move was originally intended to prevent villains from transporting banknotes with place names from other places to Shanghai for profit, such as arbitrage buying foreign exchange and purchasing gold. A decision was also made in March last year. Now the situation is becoming more serious. Fortunately, the Shanghai branches of China Bank and Communications Bank are exchanging as much as possible for small amounts, and are still continuing to collect them. They have also telegraphed the collection and the situation of rejection in Shanghai to the Chongqing head office for instructions, but have not yet received instructions from the head office.

Capital Escapes with Shanghai as its Base

The reason for the current situation created by the legal currency in Shanghai is that the Shanghai foreign exchange black market and capital operation, Chinese and foreign banking circles have failed to cooperate to thoroughly manage it. Due to the laissez-faire of the foreign exchange black market, schemers to arbitrage foreign exchange and speculators can take advantage of it. Foreign exchange can still be obtained, so imports have increased greatly, and capital escapes, with Shanghai as its base. Speculation and investment not allowed by the national wartime financial policy have followed. If the Chinese and foreign banking circles in Shanghai have a strict organization and management, capital flight and villains will definitely not cause the current situation.

The Suspension of Various Industries Affects Foreign Goods

Due to the recent sharp decline in foreign exchange in the city, the appetite for ordering foreign goods has changed drastically. Even notices have been issued to stop ordering altogether. According to people in the industrial and commercial sectors, foreign banks have been meticulous in maintaining the credit of our country's legal currency. However, during the recent period of sharp contraction in foreign exchange rates, there should be exchange rates, but they are still supplying Japanese absorption as much as possible. In other words, the goods of European and Western countries will be affected by this foreign exchange and will tend to stagnate. During this period, Chinese manufacturers have to be cautious to avoid affecting their business.

### Japanese Land and Sea Invasion; Haimen is in Chaos

According to news from transportation circles yesterday, at about 8:00 yesterday morning, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of Haimen by land and sea, launching a fierce battle. Several Japanese boats, fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers, landed at Niuhong Port under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, more than 200 Japanese soldiers arrived from Nantong and invaded Haimen by land. Chinese troops were deployed to meet the attack, and the battle has not yet ended. Currently, the Shanghai-Beisha flights still end at Qinglong Port, as the situation in the upper port is still unstable.

### Prices Rise Again; All Transactions are in Cash; Legal Currency Positions are Short, Discounts Soar; There are No Transactions in Top-Quality Rice

The Shanghai financial market has been greatly affected by the sharp decline in foreign exchange in recent days, and drastic changes have occurred. Speculators, ignoring everything, are frantically absorbing foreign exchange and buying gold, which has made the demand for legal currency even greater. The discount on exchange bills has soared to 200 yuan. Therefore, all prices have risen. The investigation is as follows: (1)

The selling price of cash is frequently rising. Twenty gold double horse brands have risen to 538 yuan. (2) The current cotton price has also risen to more than 100 yuan. (3) Rice prices have been stimulated by the financial turmoil and continue to rise, and have all approached the price limit. Yesterday, the market transaction was due to the publication of the rice inventory survey by the association, which was 300,481 bags, a decrease of 44,421 bags compared to last week. Therefore, hoarders took the opportunity to absorb them, and transactions on this street gradually became active. Due to the limitation of the market by the concession authorities,

there are no transactions in top-quality rice. However, the prices of all goods have risen to the highest limit. However, in order to prevent secret trading in the market, the concession authorities decided to follow the established method. If the buying and selling parties exceed the price limit, they will not be recognized as valid, and they will be allowed to report the facts to the police at any time for investigation. (4) Flour must be picked up in cash, and the price per bag is 4.65 yuan. (5) The silk price is 660 yuan for Hang silk. (6) On the 17th of this month, the foreign exchange shrank sharply from 6.5625 pence to 4 pence.

The difference between the five days is as high as 65%. The hardware industry calculated that the cost of goods arriving at the port was too far from the market price. The members of the industry have sent letters to the association requesting that the market price be reconvened for deliberation as a guideline. It is heard that the hardware industry association also believes that the agreed price has exceeded one month, and it is necessary to reconvene the deliberation. It has been decided to convene a meeting today to increase the selling price. (7) Other commodities such as newly arrived miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, sugar, and northern goods have all increased in price. However, there is a universal phenomenon that all transactions must be settled in legal currency, and the shortage of legal currency in the market and the soaring discounts have resulted in a sharp reduction in various transactions compared to before.

### A Hundred U.S. Military Personnel Board a Ship and Return to the U.S.; Their Service in the Far East is Complete; They Departed Yesterday on a Transport Ship

The Zi Lin Daily reported that the U.S. Navy transport ship Henderson, which has been docked in Shanghai for ten days, is scheduled to depart today (the 21st) at 12:30 p.m., taking the route of Hong Kong, Manila, Guam, and Honolulu to return to the U.S. Hundreds of U.S. Marines and sailors who have completed their service in the Far East are also saying goodbye to the East and returning home on the ship. Some of them are eager to return home to see their relatives and friends whom they have not seen for more than two years.

### Changtai Civil Movement Director Hu Sheng Martyred by Drowning

Hu Sheng (Zhenkang), the current consultant of the Taicang County Government and director and military judge of the Advanced Civil Movement Training Class of the Jiangnan People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army of Changshu County, was giving a speech to soldiers and civilians in Saining Town outside the East Gate of Changshu this month when he was suddenly attacked by more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops from Changshu urban area and Hupu, who attacked in separate ways. Hu jumped into the river to swim, but suddenly saw a fellow soldier who was not good at swimming about to drown. He struggled to rescue him, but was unfortunately discovered by the Japanese and puppet troops and shot more than ten times before drowning in the pond. In order to comfort the orphans and encourage future generations, the authorities decided to allocate funds for compensation. At the same time, friends and relatives are also raising funds to provide relief.

### Admiral Yarnell Fetes the Hottel Family; Chief of Staff Carroll Invited to Attend; Inauguration Ceremony Scheduled for Next Week

Since the arrival of Rear Admiral Hottel, the new commander of the Asiatic Fleet, in Shanghai, he has been busy with social engagements. U.S. Navy personnel in Shanghai, from Yarnell down, have visited Hottel's residence on the thirteenth floor of Albert Road to pay their respects. Admiral Yarnell and Rear Admiral Hottel were originally close friends, and their reunion this time was especially joyful. Admiral Yarnell hosted a banquet on the flagship "Augusta" on the afternoon of the 20th to entertain Rear Admiral Hottel and his wife and daughter. Rear Admiral Hottel's chief of staff, Carroll, was also invited to attend. It is heard that the new commander's inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held on the flagship Augusta on the 25th of this month. Admiral Yarnell will also return home after the handover, and his return date is the first of next month.

### After the Implementation of the Prohibition of Import of Goods, International Trade Turns Around; The Overall Import Surplus Figure Can Also be Reduced; Efforts Must be Made to Balance International Payments

The Ministry of Finance has promulgated the measures to prohibit the import of goods during the extraordinary period. The General Superintendent of Customs has ordered all customs offices to comply with them. However, the ports in the occupied areas of Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qiongzhou, and the ports in North China of Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Jiaozhou, Weihaiwei, and Longkou have not been implemented due to special local circumstances. A New Life News reporter learned from the customs office yesterday that after the implementation of the measures to prohibit the import of goods, China's trade deficit can be reversed and the overall import surplus figure can also be reduced, so as to balance international payments. The prohibited goods are recorded as follows:

### Bandits Loot Zhucui

At about 10 p.m. the night before last, more than 100 bandits armed with rifles, Mauser pistols, revolvers, and grenades swarmed into Zhucui Town in western Shanghai. Sentries were posted at the west market to maintain strict guard. Because the weather was hot, there were still pedestrians entering and leaving. The bandits were not allowed to pass. They began to loot. All the shops in the central market street, west main street, Xiaojingtan south street were looted. Only the pawnshops in the east market main street were spared. The biggest loss was the Changfa South Goods Store in Miaoqiao West, which was robbed of more than 1,000 yuan. The owner, Gan Jialin, was almost trapped, but fortunately he was agile and escaped. Wanxinxiang Foreign Goods Store, run by Hou Ruiren, was looted of high-end clothing, along with cash, totaling 700 to 800 yuan. Other stores such as Rentai Clothing Store and a dim sum shop opened by Zhu also suffered losses of 200 to 300 yuan. As for the small shops and residents on the main street, none were spared. The total loss is estimated to be more than 5,000 yuan. The looting lasted for several hours before the bandits fired their guns, lined up, and left to the south. The next day, the New Fourth Army arrived in the suburbs and immediately sent a team to track and arrest them after hearing the news.

It is heard that the reason for the increased issuance is that the "Reformed Government" has changed to using the "banknote" to pay salaries.

### Japanese Anti-British Sentiment in Qingdao Becoming More Overt; Foreign Ships Going to Qingdao Must Undergo Passenger Inspection; Instigating White Russian Emigrants to Make Trouble for the British

The Continental News reported that a foreigner who had lived in Qingdao for a long time recently came to Shanghai from North China. Yesterday (the 20th), he said that White Russians who arrived in Qingdao on British ships were subjected to detailed interrogation by White Russian "passport inspectors" commissioned by the Japanese. At the same time, the Japanese had mobilized White Russian emigrants in Qingdao to obstruct British interests and fight against communism. The inspectors were Japanese, selected from members of the "North China White Russian Anti-Communist Federation." They boarded foreign ships arriving in Qingdao from various ports in North and South China to conduct inspections, except for

Japanese ships. Earlier this month, the Japanese launched the Federation to convene a members' meeting and sign an oath stating that they were willing to serve in the military on the "Western Front of the Orient." However, the Jewish members of the Federation caused an unexpected and fierce debate. They clearly refused to take up arms to fight against communism on the Western Front, as this would be tantamount to fighting for the Germans. After a long stalemate, the Japanese, who launched the Federation, agreed to

delete the "Western Front" item from the oath signed by the Jewish members before an agreement could be reached. White Russians who refused to participate in anti-communist and anti-British activities often met with misfortune. A major White Russian businessman was ordered to be expelled from the country by the Federation for not participating in the military service meeting, signing the oath, and participating in anti-British demonstrations. Except for Japanese ships, foreign shipping is now

facing increasing difficulties. Earlier this month, two British ships and one French ship were prevented by the Japanese from entering Qingdao. After lengthy consultations between the British and French authorities and the Japanese, they were allowed to enter the port on the official "guarantee of their good intentions." Around the same time, 55 Chinese passengers on a British ship arriving in Qingdao were not allowed to disembark. Another British ship sailing from Shanghai, carrying

36 Chinese passengers, sailed back to its original port because the passengers were not allowed to disembark. A British trading company attempted to resolve its dock difficulties in Qingdao, so it sent a passenger ferry. A few days later, it was ordered to stop running. On July 4, an anti-British movement was held. Two Chinese coolies posted slogans on the walls of the British Consulate and were arrested by the British Consulate authorities. They were immediately handed over to the Japanese Consulate. The arrest of the two coolies clearly provoked retaliation. Two days later, two Chinese employees of the British Consulate were also arrested by the Japanese police. When they left Qingdao last week, the two employees were still being detained. Japanese plainclothes police and detectives often patrolled in front of the British Consulate,

questioning people entering and leaving the consulate. From a general point of view, the Chinese people were not affected by the anti-British demonstrations. However, if they were threatened that they would be detained and fined if they traded with the British, it seemed that they would stop dealing with the British.

### Japanese Troops in Yueqing Waters Harassed and Suffered Damage; Landed Unsuccessfully Day Before Yesterday; Japanese Warships Bombed Taizhou

It was learned from the shipping industry yesterday afternoon that (1) The Japanese army claimed to invade Wenzhou and landed on Yuhuan Island outside the port of Wenzhou several times, attempting to gain a foothold. They were met with strong resistance from the Chinese army and failed to succeed. At about 8:00 on the morning of the 20th, five Japanese warships arrived in the waters of Yueqing again and opened fire on the shore. They launched several speedboats, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers, attempting to land. The Chinese army immediately met the attack, and the Japanese army's attempt failed to succeed. Currently, more than ten ships are docked in the waters around Wenzhou, Yueqing, and Yuhuan, and they seem to have further attempts. The Chinese army is stepping up its guard and is waiting in battle. (2) Three Japanese warships are docked in the waters of Taizhou. At 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, they fired more than ten shells at the Chinese army's position. At the same time, two Japanese seaplanes circled and scouted in the sky. However, the Chinese military authorities had already made strict deployments along the coast of Hezhou, and the Japanese army's attempt would be difficult to succeed. (3) Three Japanese warships were docked in the waters of Zhenhai Ligang and the waters of Qiliyu, and they left on the afternoon of the 20th. Although the situation on the coast of eastern Zhejiang is tense, the situation is still peaceful. (3) It is now known that a Japanese aircraft carrier is docked in the waters of Maqin Island, which belongs to Dinghai County, carrying five aircraft. There are also three transport ships nearby, but there has been no change. Although Japanese warships appear in the waters of Zhenhai Ligang, the coastal areas of Ning belong are now very safe.

### Pacific Ocean: Hurricanes Arising in Succession; Two New Hurricanes Form; Strong Wind Force, Undetermined Path

According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 2:00 PM yesterday, two new hurricanes have formed south of the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The first hurricane has reached 120 degrees east longitude and 24 degrees north latitude, heading west or west-northwest. The wind force covers a range of 60 nautical miles and has now advanced to the Taiwan Strait with great speed. The second hurricane is at 132 degrees east longitude and 12 degrees north latitude, heading northwest. The wind force covers a range of 120 nautical miles, twice as strong as the first. Its path is unclear, and it is difficult to determine whether it will affect Shanghai.

Landfall Hurricane: Remaining Power Not Yet Exhausted

The hurricane that made landfall in Hangzhou Bay, after passing through the western part of Shanghai, has blown towards Nanjing and Wuhu. Its wind force has gradually decreased and will soon dissipate. However, the remaining power of the wind's wings still has a force that lingered in the suburbs of Shanghai yesterday, wreaking havoc all day long. It is currently the high tide season in the Huangpu River, and the waves are surging, causing the river water to rise sharply, almost level with the shore. Therefore, the ditches in various places cannot discharge water, and the tide flows back. By evening, many low-lying roads were flooded ankle-deep.

Various Shipping Lines: Many Still Suspended

Since the hurricane swept through Shanghai, although the black ball hanging at the Jianghai Customs has been removed, lifting the navigation warning, the remaining power of the hurricane is still blowing in the suburbs of Shanghai and along the coast of the Yangtze River. The wind force outside Wusongkou is very strong. Therefore, except for ships with larger tonnage traveling to the North and South Oceans, which resumed exports yesterday, many of the shipping lines traveling to the Yangtze River line, Beisha line, and other places are still suspended.

Pudong Early Rice: Already Affected

The early rice in various villages of Pudong and Chuannan will be harvested at the beginning of next month. Due to the suitable climate, the ears of rice are quite abundant, and the harvest is expected to be similar to last year. Unexpectedly, it has recently been affected by two hurricanes. The grains are still not fully formed. After this wind disaster, the rice stalks are broken. The farmland along the coast is the most severely affected. The rice stalks and ears are submerged in the soil. In addition, the continuous rain makes it impossible to remedy the situation. When it comes to the harvest season, it will inevitably be defective. However, the damage in areas farther from the embankment is relatively light.

Dr. Tang Yuhan Returns to China

Mr. Tang Yuhan, after graduating from Aurora University, was sent to Belgium at public expense due to his outstanding academic performance. He entered the Catholic University of Leuven to specialize in X-rays and pain management. He has now been awarded a Doctorate of Medicine from the University of Leuven. He served as a resident physician at Leuven Hospital for three years. He also served as an assistant in the X-ray and radium department and is a member of the Belgian Brussels X-ray Society. He has traveled to Germany and France for on-site inspections and investigated medical organizations in Sweden and Denmark. He researched cancer treatment methods at the Royal Hospital in London. Tang is the first Chinese to receive a doctorate from that university. Tang has a book, "Fundamentals of X-ray Therapy," which is a significant contribution to the medical field. It is reported that he took the French ship Xiafei and returned to Shanghai last night. He will use his profound knowledge and rich experience to work at the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Institute, serving patients.

### Tangwan Suffers Terrible Disaster

According to villagers who fled through the path yesterday, Tangwan Town in Peixi, 12 miles from Minhang, suffered a terrible disaster on Tuesday. A guerrilla team went to patrol, and the Japanese Navy on the river suddenly became alarmed. They sent a team to search, but the guerrilla team had already left. The Japanese army then set fire on a large scale. In an instant, fires broke out everywhere, and the people fled. The fire burned for several hours, causing considerable losses. The Japanese then retreated to their warships.

### Chen Jintao Did Not Die of Illness; He Actually Died of Poisoning; Chen Came to Shanghai for Treatment After Poisoning, But It Was Ineffective; Two Counselors from the Japanese Consulate Also Died of Poisoning

The Continental News reports that, according to news from Nanjing, Chen Jintao, manager of "Huaxing Bank," actually died of poisoning, not of illness. On June 10, the Japanese Consulate General in Nanjing held a "poisonous gathering" to welcome Shimizu, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Twenty people, including important members of the Japanese military and the consulate of the "Reformed Government," were all

poisoned by drinking. Chen Jintao was also among them. At that time, the Japanese military doctor wanted to treat him, but Chen refused treatment and specifically requested an airplane to come to Shanghai to allow his own doctor to treat him. After this delay, he died in Shanghai two days later. The person who poisoned the wine was a restaurant waiter who had been employed by the Japanese consulate for many years. Before the act, he urged his

family to leave for a safe place first, and then stayed to observe the results of his actions. Afterwards, he was tortured and forced to confess, but he did not reveal his accomplices, nor did he disclose any information about who instigated the poisoning. The Japanese authorities have investigated around Nanjing and found that the poison may be a type of Western hyoscyamus. The Japanese police in Nanjing are still interrogating this case. In addition to Chen, two counselors from the Japanese consulate were also poisoned and died.

### Taikoo Ship Passengers: Procedures for Going to Siam; Zhangjiakou Arrives in Shanghai; Sets Sail South Today

The British Taikoo Steamship Company, due to special circumstances, suspended the Shantou-Siam route. Now, a new Shanghai-Siam route, including Hong Kong and Saigon, has been opened. It was initially decided that the Suzhou would sail on the 11th of this month, and it is expected to arrive in Siam within days. Secondly, the company transferred the

Zhangjiakou, which previously operated on the Shantou-Siam route, to Shanghai to sail. The ship arrived in port on the 18th (previously) and is now docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 2:00 PM today, via Hong Kong and Saigon, to Bangkok, Siam, and also to Tu Le in Vietnam, which is located between Haiphong and Saigon and has a train that can

directly reach Kunming, so cargo transportation to the interior will be more convenient in the future via Tu Le. As for passengers going to Siam, there are still various procedures to follow. Here are the details: Taikoo Company announced the following for passengers going to Siam (i.e., Thailand): All passengers via Siam must meet the following conditions before boarding the ship: (1) Approval from the Siamese Consul (Siamese Consul in Shanghai); (2)

Medical Certificate: All passengers must have a medical certificate for smallpox vaccination and preventive injection (the time of which must not exceed six months); (3) Landing Deposit: All passengers, except those holding permits from the Siamese authorities to re-enter the country, must pay

250 Baht in Siamese silver coins (approximately 1,370 yuan in legal tender at yesterday's market price); (4) Medical Examination: All passengers must undergo an eye examination. Those with trachoma will not be allowed to land. Those going to Siam must pay attention to the above items.

Strange News in the Gale: Woman Picked Up and Injured

On the morning of the day before yesterday, during a wind and rainstorm, a middle-aged woman was walking in front of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road when she was suddenly picked up off the ground by a hurricane and then fell, causing her to be injured. She was sent to the hospital for treatment but was in a coma due to a concussion, so her name is unknown.

### Outdoor Cool Evening; Suddenly Shot and Killed; The Deceased Was Chen Shucai; The Murderer Escaped; After the Incident, the Puppet Police Guarded the Body

A shooting occurred on Binlang Road in Delongfang, Labosheng Road, West Shanghai, at around 10:20 last night. The victim was Chen Shucai, 30 years old, from Anhui Province, residing at No. 405, Tonghe Lane, Labosheng Road. Last night, he had gone to a friend's house at No. 14, Delongfang, Binlang Road, to play cards. After finishing, it was around 10 o'clock in the evening, so he was sitting outside to cool off. Unexpectedly, three or four men suddenly rushed into the alley and, without asking why, took out their guns and opened fire on him. Chen Shucai was caught off guard and was shot in a vital spot, falling to the ground and dying. The murderers, seeing their goal achieved, turned around and left the alley, escaping without a trace. At the same time, Zhang Ziyang (39 years old), also from Anhui Province and residing at No. 24, Delongfang, was also injured in the right foot by a stray bullet. After receiving the news, the Putuo Road Police Department immediately dispatched detectives and ambulances to investigate and rescue. They saw that the body of the murdered man had already been guarded by people sent by the puppet "Police Department," who were trying to transport it away. Therefore, they sent the wounded person to the Red Cross Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The details are still difficult to speculate, but it is known that the deceased was previously the owner of a certain cloth factory.

### Yesterday Morning, North Chengdu Road: Detectives Engaged in Fierce Battle with Bandits; Dozens of Shots Fired on Both Sides, Situation Tense; One Bandit Shot and Captured, Two Bandits Killed

Yesterday morning at 7:50, Chinese and Western patrolmen from the Xinkai Police Station were ordered to patrol their respective sections. When they checked near No. 998, Chengdu Road (i.e., Slaughterhouse Lane), five bandits, each hiding a pistol and Mauser pistol, were intending to take action. Upon seeing the patrolmen, they became fearful and quickly fled in all directions

into the alley and dispersed.

Upon seeing this, the patrolmen knew they were bandits. In addition to chasing after them, they blew police whistles to summon a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to come and help pursue the bandits. Two of the bandits fled into Slaughterhouse Lane and saw that the gate of No. 5 (the landlord was named Wen) was not closed, so they fled into the bedroom of Zhou Huijia, a cotton merchant who was renting the room. Then, they climbed onto the roof and opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. At that time,

gunfire erupted.

It was as dense as linked beads, with dozens of shots fired. At that time, one bandit, named Gu Changsheng, was killed in front of the main entrance of No. 5, and a Mauser pistol was seized. Another bandit, named Wang Genchao, was severely wounded in the chest and back and fell at the back door of No. 5. A pedestrian, Liu Guangtai, was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet. The remaining three bandits, two bandits

escaped

One bandit fled north. Because he was being chased by detectives, when he fled to Xinqiao Bridge, he saw the river in front and the detectives chasing behind, so he jumped into the Suzhou River in desperation and still opened fire to resist arrest. At that time, detectives and Japanese soldiers stationed on the north side of the bridge all opened fire into the river. After a long time, the bandit was not seen floating up, so it is assumed that he had already

died from the gunshot wounds.

Afterwards, an ambulance arrived and took the deceased to the mortuary for examination. The wounded bandit, Wang Genchao, was sent to the police hospital, and Liu Guangtai was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It was also heard that a symbol of "Member of the West Shanghai Detective Team of the Dadao Municipal Government" was found on the body of the deceased and the bandits. Zhou Huijia, the tenant of No. 5, was also taken to the police station by detectives for investigation.

### Public Bus Causes Accident: Runs Over Four People

### Japanese Authorities, Together with the French Police Department, Conducted a Search in the French Concession; Searched Everywhere, But Found Nothing

Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, the Japanese authorities sent personnel to the Public Police Department to request the dispatch of detectives to assist in searching the Xiafei Market at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Hualong Road. The French Police Department dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address and search house by house. As a result, no contraband or dangerous goods were found, nor was anyone arrested. Afterwards, the Japanese side again requested to search the residents in the area of Beile Road and Wangzhi Road, but the result was also negative.

Another report states that yesterday, the Japanese side again went to the French Concession and, together with the French Police Department, departed to search the following locations at about 4:00 AM: (1) Xiafei Commercial Market, next to the Paris Theater at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Hualong Road; (2) Residents upstairs of the Oriental Automobile Company at the intersection of Beile Road and Ximen Road; (3) Longgong Hotel on Kaizi'er Road in Baxianqiao, a certain number on Wangzhi Road, but nothing was found in any of the above places, nor were there any arrests (Shewen News).

### College Student Falls in Love with Dance Hostess; Wife Sues for Separation; Defendant Absent from Yesterday's Hearing, Judgment Reserved

Gao Jingfu from Zhejiang, who once studied at Fudan University, is the young owner of the Tongyi Yarn Store in this city, residing at No. 620, Labosheng Road. Four years ago, Gao married Wang Siying (25 years old this year), a woman from Zhenhai, through a matchmaker. Gao had received a middle school education, and because the couple was well-matched in age and learning after marriage, the affection between them was quite harmonious at first. Later, Gao became involved in dance halls and formed an inextricable bond with the dance hostess Xiaomi, which led to marital discord. On February 20 of this year, Gao borrowed 1,900 yuan of Wang's private savings on the pretext of investment failure and squandered it. On March 25, Gao took Wang's wedding ring and gold bracelet (valued at 2,000 yuan) to pawn on the pretext of breaking up with the dance hostess Xiaomi, but he never broke up with the dance hostess Xiaomi, causing the couple's relationship to become increasingly estranged. In her distress, Wang had no choice but to hire lawyer Wang Xintang to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a judgment to separate from her husband and ordering her husband to return the loan of 1,900 yuan and the gold jewelry. If the original gold jewelry cannot be returned, she requested a judgment to compensate the price of the jewelry in the amount of 2,000 yuan in national currency. According to the lawsuit, the court was convened yesterday by judge Li Liang, who opened Civil Court 7 to summon the defendant Gao Jingfu. The plaintiff Wang Siying and her attorney Wang Xintang arrived in court to state the circumstances of the request for separation and requested to be allowed to argue the case ex parte. The court verified the statements and, because the defendant Gao Jingfu had been legally summoned but failed to appear in court, the plaintiff was allowed to conclude the ex parte hearing in accordance with the law, and a date was set for judgment.

### Accidental Discharge of Firearm; Wounds Colleague

Wang Jinfu, a 26-year-old Guangdong native and employee of the Guohua Bank on Beijing Road, was about to go out on business at a little after 5:00 PM yesterday when his colleague, Gu Qingtang, intended to accompany him. While tidying up, he casually took out a pistol from a drawer in the writing desk. Due to mistakenly touching the firing button, a bullet came out of the barrel with a bang and hit Wang's right abdomen, penetrating his left abdomen. He fell to the ground bleeding profusely. Someone reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to rush to the scene and called an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital. After the doctor performed surgery, Wang requested to be transferred to the Shanghai West Dagong Hospital for treatment. Gu Qingtang later took people to the police station for investigation.

### Patrol Detectives: Seize Firearm

### Youth Induces and Abducts Young Girl: Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

He and Wu Zhongbin's daughter Gendi, from Changshu and residing at No. 16 in the same lane, were similar in age and saw each other every day, so he had the idea of inducing her into adultery. On May 12 and June 22 of this year, Zhang repeatedly induced Wu Gendi to go out and stay overnight at the Huxi Hotel on Kade Road. Recently, Wu Zhongbin discovered it and hired lawyer Liu Yan to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhang Yinzhang of disrupting the family. The case has been investigated and clarified by judge Sun Penghuan. Yesterday, Zhang Yinzhang was sentenced to six months imprisonment for inducing an underage girl, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Dance Hostess Clashes with Dance Guest; Assaults Dance Hall Owner; Dance Guest Slapped in the Face by Dance Hostess; Gathers Crowd to Retaliate Against Dance Hall Owner

The Ivendell Dance Hall on Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West, had a dance hostess named Yinghua Ajiu the night before. At the time, there was a Zhang, a dance guest, who previously had some form of conflict with Ajiu. Meeting each other again made the situation tense. Zhang and Ajiu started arguing before they had sat down for very long. Xu Zhonglin, another dance guest, seeing what was happening, went up to mediate. But because of the words he said, Ajiu felt he was favoring Zhang, in her indignation she slapped Xu in the face. Because of this, the situation became chaotic, the conflict only subsiding after the intervention of others. Xu felt unwilling and, the next night, he gathered eight or nine companions and returned to the hall. He told Chen, the owner of the hall, that if Ajiu came again tonight, he would exact revenge for the slap the previous night. Chen, because Xu's behavior would affect the hall's business, rebuked Xu. The two argued, Xu then took out a pistol and threatened Chen, ordering his companions to surround Chen and assault him. Chen was injured, and Xu and his companions took the opportunity to flee. Afterwards, the hall reported the incident to the puppet police station in charge, requesting that the perpetrators be apprehended and brought to justice.

### Trafficking Agency "Security Company"; Escort of Goods Arrested; Admits Under Oath to Being Hired to Escort Opium; Accused of Attempted Murder, Transporting Opium, Etc.

The "Security Company," an opium trafficking agency in West Shanghai, was established with joint investment by Yan Zhaosheng (i.e., Yan Laosi) and others. Every day, when opium was transported in and out, armed guards were dispatched to escort it. On the night of the 11th of this month at 10:30 PM, Zhang Xigen, from Pudong, a guard of the company, was carrying firearms loaded with live ammunition. Together with his companions, he was passing Kang Nuo Road and Jisi Fei'er Road. Cui Jinchuan, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station in charge, was leading his officers to search along the road. Zhang unexpectedly tried to resist arrest with his gun and was subdued. Apart from those who fled, Zhang Genquan and Chen Wanlin from Shaoxing were detained. The next day, they were sent to the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained

for investigation.

Yesterday morning, judge Jiang Shuzi opened court and ordered the three defendants to be brought before the court for interrogation. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station first recounted the confessions of the defendants at the police station, saying that Zhang Xigen had admitted that he was a bodyguard for the Security Company, escorting opium with a monthly salary of 36 yuan. The pistol and seven live rounds he carried were issued by his employer, Yan Laosi. Zhang Genquan was his brother and was also recommended by him to the Security Company as a guard. Zhang Genquan's confession of the names of the shareholders of the Security Company was the same as Zhang Xigen's, which proved that the second defendant

was indeed an accomplice.

However, Chen Wanlin only admitted that he happened to be passing by the area at the time and was arrested along with them. He did not know the two Zhangs. Then, the written confessions of Zhang and others were presented to the court. Judge Jiang verified the confession and interrogated Zhang Xigen about it. He admitted without hesitation that he was hired by the Security Company to carry firearms to escort opium in gangs. He only said that there were four accomplices that night, three of whom had escaped. Zhang Genquan's confession in court was mostly inconsistent with the confession he gave to the police station and also differed from the defense prepared by his defense lawyer. After

repeated questioning

in court, he began to confess that he and Xigen were brothers of the same clan. He worked as a boatman. His brother, Zhang Youdao, was hired by the Baosheng Company in Caojiadu (the company also operated both opium and gambling). That night, he went to visit his brother but did not find him. He met Xigen on the way back and was arrested together with him. Chen Wanlin still refused to admit anything. Then, the debate began. First, lawyer Li, based on Zhang Xigen's confession, believed that in addition to the crime of attempted murder, he had also committed

the crime of illegally carrying

military firearms and transporting opium, requesting that he be punished according to the law and that the guns and bullets be confiscated. Zhang Genquan was indeed an accomplice of Xigen and should also be punished by law. Only Chen's crime was lighter. Then, the lawyers for each defendant, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Fang Junjie, and Jia Yi, successively presented their closing arguments. The court ordered Zhang and others to be remanded to custody pending sentencing next Wednesday.

Unexpectedly, Wu's abdomen was too close to the Western-style sawmill, and he was cut in the abdomen by the machine's sharp blade, severing his intestines and bleeding profusely. He fell to the ground unconscious. Afterwards, he was sent to the hospital for treatment and is in critical condition.

Transportation and Transit Weekly

### Taking the Route Through Ningbo to the Mainland

— Jing

Due to the current situation, the various seaports in eastern Zhejiang, such as Wenzhou and Zhenhai, are sometimes open and sometimes closed, making import and export navigation very difficult. However, for travelers from Shanghai who wish to reach the mainland economically and quickly, taking this route is the most convenient. According to recent news from the shipping industry, the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is still suspended, while the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been restored. Therefore, the route from Shanghai through Ningbo to the mainland is briefly described below:

Shanghai to Ningbo The Mofu vessel of the German merchant firm Reithoffer and the Deping vessel of the Sino-Italian Company sail from Shanghai to Ningbo separately. Those who wish to purchase tickets can take two photographs to the aforementioned companies to obtain a boarding bond. After filling it out, it must be stamped with the official seal of a reputable local firm before purchasing tickets from the company with the bond. Ticket prices are 20 national currency for a large dining room seat, 8 yuan for an officer's cabin, 6 yuan for a room cabin, and 3.5 yuan for a steerage cabin. However, due to the limited number of passengers and crowding, purchasing tickets is extremely difficult. The aforementioned vessels only go from the Shanghai wharf to the Zhenhai County wharf. Passengers must pay for their own transfer from Zhenhai County to Ningbo via a small steamship. Regarding passengers' luggage, only suitcases, bedding, and baskets are allowed; other items will not be accepted. Upon arrival at Zhenhai Port, except for small carry-on items, luggage must be handed over to the steamship luggage room to be transported to Ningbo or Zhenhai, with a fee of 5 jiao in national currency per item. The steamship authority will issue a luggage ticket, which can be used to claim the luggage in Ningbo or Zhenhai.

Ningbo to Jinhua From Ningbo, one can take a small steamship to Hengzhang, then transfer to a public bus via Xinchang, Shengxian, and Changle to reach Jinhua. The entire journey can be completed in one day, with a combined ticket price of approximately 11 yuan and 7 jiao in national currency.

Jinhua to Yingtan The passenger train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is still running daily as usual, but only to Yingtan as the final destination, which takes approximately nine hours. The third-class ticket price is approximately 5.8 yuan in national currency, and the second-class is double that.

Yingtan to Ji'an In the past, the highway route went through Linchuan to reach Ji'an. However, because Linchuan is close to the front line, the highway has been damaged. The Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau is actively adjusting the Yingning (Yingtan to Ningdu) and Ningji (Ningdu to Ji'an) express buses, which have been implemented since July 1st. The direct bus from Yingtan to Ningdu takes one day (passing through Jinxi, Nancheng, and Guangchang), and the bus from Ningdu to Ji'an also takes only one day (passing through Xingguo and Taihe without going around Ganzhou). The total distance is approximately 500 kilometers, with a ticket price of approximately 30 yuan in national currency. The journey from Yingtan to Ji'an, which originally took four days, has now been shortened to two days, which is very convenient for travelers.

Ji'an to Hengyang Joint transportation from Ji'an to Hengyang has been implemented since June 1st, which only takes one day. The entire journey is 405 kilometers, with a ticket price of approximately 23 yuan in national currency. From Hengyang, one can take the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to Guilin, and then travel to various provinces in the southwest. As for those who plan to travel to Fujian Province via eastern Zhejiang, they can take a public bus to Nancheng after arriving in Yingtan, with a ticket price of approximately 20 yuan. From Nancheng to Yanping in Fujian Province, the distance is 341 kilometers, and joint tickets are available for public buses, with a ticket price of 15 yuan, 4 jiao, and 2 fen.

### Recent Northwest Transportation

— Huan

Currently, the two major starting points for northwest transportation are Xi'an and Lanzhou. First, the transportation situation starting from Xi'an is described below:

Railway The Longhai Railway departing from Xi'an can be divided into eastern and western sections: Due to the war, the eastern section only temporarily reaches Huayin, which is 114 kilometers and takes 5 hours. The ordinary third-class ticket price is 2.2 yuan in national currency. The western section reaches Baoji, which is 173 kilometers and takes 6 hours. The ordinary third-class ticket price is 3.25 yuan in national currency. Second-class tickets are double the above price, and first-class tickets are double again. Passengers taking the special express train must pay an express surcharge, which is calculated at 1.5 jiao per person for third class, 3 jiao per person for second class, and 6 jiao per person for first class per 100 kilometers (any distance less than 100 kilometers is also calculated as 100 kilometers). Berth ticket prices are 3.5 yuan for an upper berth and 4.5 yuan for a lower berth in first class; 2.5 yuan for an upper berth and 3 yuan for a lower berth in second class; 1 yuan for an upper berth, 1.2 yuan for a middle berth, and 1.5 yuan for a lower berth in third class per night. Highway (1) Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway Directly from Xi'an to Lanzhou, the total length is 699.8 kilometers, and the journey takes 4 days. Stops along the way include Xianyang County, Pingliang, and Huajialing. The China Travel Service has hostels in Pingliang and Huajialing to provide food and accommodation for passengers, and the facilities are very clean. Ticket prices are 6.7 yuan from Xi'an to Xianyang County, 13.55 yuan to Pingliang, 23.5 yuan to Huajialing, and 32.5 yuan to Lanzhou. Each passenger is limited to 25 kilograms of luggage. If this amount is exceeded, a transportation fee of 6 li per kilometer will be charged for every 5 kilograms (or less than 5 kilograms). (2) Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway The main line from Xi'an to Chengdu, Sichuan. As mentioned above, you can take a train from Xi'an to Baoji, and then take a public bus from Baoji to Hanzhong, which is 248.8 kilometers and takes 2 days. You can stay for meals and accommodation in Shuangshipu or Fengtai. The bus ticket price is 11.25 yuan in national currency. From Hanzhong to Ningqiang, the length is 126.7 kilometers, which can be reached on the same day, and the ticket price is 5.75 yuan. From Ningqiang to Guangyuan, a border county in Sichuan, is only 85 kilometers. From Guangyuan to Chengdu, the length is approximately 355 kilometers. After reorganization by the Road Bureau, the passenger bus between Chengdu and Guangyuan has been open to traffic since July 1st. The ticket price is approximately 20 yuan per person, and the food and accommodation conditions along the way are not yet known in detail.

Aviation The ticket price from Xi'an to Chongqing is 270 yuan, and the flight time is 3 hours; the ticket price to Chengdu is also 270 yuan, and the flight time is 3 hours; the ticket price to Lanzhou is 200 yuan, and the flight time is 2.5 hours.

The situation of various highways starting from Lanzhou can also be roughly described:

The highways starting from Lanzhou are divided into the Gansu-Qinghai Road, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road, and the Lanzhou-Qin'an Road. The Gansu-Qinghai Road is from Lanzhou to Xining, Qinghai, with a total length of 312 kilometers, passing through Yongdeng and Xiangtang. The ticket price is 14.05 yuan in national currency. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway is the only transportation artery in northwestern Gansu Province, with a total length of 1,260 kilometers, passing through Yongdeng, Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Anxi to reach Xingxingxia, which is adjacent to Xinjiang. The ticket price is 56.7 yuan in national currency. The Lanzhou-Qin'an Highway runs from Lanzhou through Dingxi, Huajialing, and Qin'an to reach Tianshui (Qin Prefecture), with a total length of 342.3 kilometers. The ticket price is 15.45 yuan in national currency. The amount of luggage allowed per passenger and the method of charging for exceeding luggage on all of the above roads are the same as those on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway.

### Procedures for Studying in the United States (3)

— Xing

Journey to America

I. Life on Board It takes at least ten days to reach San Francisco or Seattle from Shanghai. During this period, the life one can enjoy on board is determined by one's physical condition. If you are prone to seasickness, it is not surprising that you will lie down all the way from the west coast of the Pacific to the east coast. If you are not prone to seasickness, you can eat, drink, and be merry. Frankly, the Pacific is actually very calm, sometimes almost like a mirror. When the ship leaves Yokohama, there is usually some turbulence, but one should not be scared by this initial show of force. After passing this difficult stage, you can sail smoothly all the way to the other shore. You can rent a deck chair when you board the ship. When you feel bored sitting in your room, you can go to the deck to bask in the sun or enjoy the sea view. There are various sports on the ship, such as swimming, [deck tennis], table tennis, [shuffleboard], and movies, entertainment, and social gatherings every few days, all of which are free. There are also various forms of gambling, guessing distances, horse racing, and playing poker, which are best avoided. You can eat as much as you want, but unfortunately, the preserved fish and old meat are not very fresh. In addition to the three main meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, there is also beef tea on the deck in the morning and snacks and coffee in the afternoon. You can order as many kinds of food as you want during meals, two soups, and the same meat. You can eat one after another, as long as you can eat it, and it is not considered impolite. When there are more domestic passengers, you can also ask the cook to make a few "Tang meals." Don't move too fast on the ship, and don't make too much noise. You should always think of your country's reputation. If an indecent incident occurs before you even reach America, it will give people a bad impression. Especially on the ship, all the passengers feel bored. If you create some news, it will cause a lot of discussion and create a slow-moving storm, which is not good for you or others.

II. Sightseeing in Honolulu Honolulu, also known as Hawaii, is a paradise in the Pacific. It is spring all year round and has exotic flowers, trees, fish, and beautiful mountains and rivers. If the ship you are on also stops at the island, you should visit it. The overseas Chinese in Honolulu are very patriotic. The Chinese Students' Association, an organization of overseas students, hosts Chinese students traveling to America every year for sightseeing and visits. If you are not traveling with a large group of students to America, you can hire a car to visit. Waikiki Beach, the aquarium, the native village, and the Hula dance are some of the famous places.

III. Tipping the Ship's Staff It is best to tip the ship's staff in US dollars. One or two dollars does not seem too little. Second-class passengers should tip the dining room boy about three US dollars, the cabin boy four dollars, the bathroom attendant one dollar, and the shoe shiner five jiao. First-class passengers should tip more, and third-class passengers can tip less. You can discuss with the students at the same table (the dining table seats are assigned and cannot be changed, so those at the same table when boarding will be together until landing) and pay together to avoid showing differences. Those in the same cabin can do the same.

IV. Entry Before the ship arrives at the shore, each passenger must fill out a declaration form. The simplest way is to fill in that it is all personal effects, worth a certain amount. However, the quantity and value of luxury goods such as tea (limited to five pounds), cigarettes (300 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 3 pounds of tobacco), silk, and jewelry must be declared.

Business News

### Financial News: Rumors of Hong Kong Support; Forex Market Gradually Stabilizes; British Gold Once Reaches Four Pence; US Dollar Once Reaches 7.75 Yuan; Closing Market Gradually Eases

Yesterday's forex market situation: HSBC's listed price, announced at 9:30 AM, compared to the 9:50 AM listing price of the previous day, showed a sharp drop of 75 for British gold and a significant fall of 1.5 yuan for the US dollar, hitting a new record low of four pence and 7.05 yuan, respectively. Other currencies also experienced similar sharp declines. The black market for British and American currencies initially saw brisk activity but gradually stabilized, with the market trend appearing more optimistic. Initially, banks were eager to sell, causing British gold to drop another 0.25 and the US dollar to soften by 0.375. Subsequently, favorable interventions by the Bank of England (on behalf of Tianjin interests) and Japanese and foreign banks led to a temporary tightening of the market, with British gold reaching an unprecedented high of four pence and the US dollar reaching 7.75 yuan. Later, rumors circulated that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Committee had been ordered to continue providing maximum support at four pence for British gold and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar. Banks became keen to sell, and rumors that a major domestic financial figure would provide support dispelled the pessimistic atmosphere. Consequently, many bulls tended to unload, and the Hong Kong side also intervened, causing the price to ease back to 4.375 pence for British gold and 8.5 yuan for the US dollar at the close. After the close, due to continued selling by speculators and various banks, the price hardened again to 4.5 pence for British gold and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous day's close, the US dollar reversed and eased by 0.125, while futures trading remained illiquid. Swap transactions dwindled. Trading remained active today. Hong Kong banks still did not engage in opening transactions.

Achieving Balance for Tianjin Market

Based on recent forex market observations, the Shanghai and Tianjin exchange rates are competing. In early July, the Tianjin exchange rate for British gold gradually fell from over five pence to four pence, and the US dollar fell from 9.9375 yuan to 7.75 yuan, leading to the dramatic fluctuations in the Shanghai exchange rate on July 18. British gold fell from 6.5 pence to 5 pence, and the US dollar fell from 12.625 yuan to 9.75 yuan. This was necessary to prevent arbitrage. The previous day, the Tianjin exchange rate for British gold had crossed the 4.10 pence mark, while the Shanghai exchange rate was 3.75 pence, causing the Shanghai exchange rate to tighten further. Based on this, if the Tianjin exchange rate falls further, the Shanghai market will likely tighten accordingly to achieve balance. Yesterday, the Shanghai exchange rate for British gold was 4 pence, while the Tianjin exchange rate was 3 pence. If there is no further tightening, perhaps it can stabilize at this level, as the exchange rate around 4 pence already has supply, or perhaps it is the new level after the third round of tightening.

HSBC's Intervention Dampens Buying Fever

Early this morning, London's major exchange rates were quoted as 0.0625 for near-term and up 0.125 for long-term. New York silver prices remained unchanged. London gold continued to appreciate by half a penny. The exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars was down by a cent, down 615 against Shanghai, and flat against France. The US dollar was down 0.125 against the British pound, down 1 yuan against Shanghai, and unchanged against France. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened this morning with spot selling prices of 4.25 pence for British gold and 8.25 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.25 tighter for British gold and 0.375 softer for the US dollar compared to last night's close. After the opening, there was widespread panic, and the market was chaotic. The Bank of England, benefiting from Tianjin interests, aggressively absorbed the currency. At the same time, speculative merchants stirred up trouble, and certain parties and foreign firms also competed to purchase. Moreover, outside players such as HSBC showed little interest in supplying, leading to a continued softening of the market. Favorable interventions by the Bank of England, Japanese banks, and foreign firms led to the absorption of currency, while outside players such as HSBC and Mercantile showed spot British gold falling from 4.125 pence to 4 pence. Subsequently, favorable interventions led to the absorption of spot US dollars by fellow banks at only 7.875 yuan. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed prices were announced, with British gold falling by 0.75 compared to the previous day's mid-morning price, and the US dollar also plummeting by 1.5 yuan. Other currencies also experienced significant declines. The announcement that the silver equalization tax would remain waived further unsettled the market. With the buying fever continuing, the market continued to soften. Favorable interventions once again led to the absorption of spot US dollars by Hua Bi at only 7.75 yuan. Subsequently, foreign firms and Japanese banks also settled their accounts, with HSBC and American banks also buying spot US dollars at only 7.75 yuan. Around 10:30 AM, rumors suddenly spread in the market that Hong Kong had telegraphed from Chongqing, instructing the Bank of England and HSBC to provide maximum support at a price of four pence for British gold and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar. HSBC released a considerable amount of currency at these prices, which slightly stabilized the market and dampened the buying fever, leading to a more stable situation. Hua Bi, an outside player, absorbed spot US dollars from fellow banks, hardening the price from 8 yuan to 8.125 yuan. Near noon, Western merchants such as Sassoon and foreign firms successively absorbed spot British gold from outside players such as HSBC at 4.125 pence and also bought spot US dollars at 8.0625 yuan. At noon, the bank's spot selling prices were still 4.125 pence for British gold and 8.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.125 tighter for British gold and 0.1875 softer for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.

Later, Chinese Merchants Also Sold

Later, sales increased, and the buying power of foreign firms weakened. In addition, a sudden release from Hong Kong caused the market to continue to ease. Hong Kong Telecom and outside players successively released currency to favorable intervention by the Bank of England (on behalf of Tianjin interests) and foreign firms, with spot British gold easing from 4.25 pence to 3.4375. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telecom and speculators successively released currency to certain banks and foreign firms, with spot US dollars hardening from 8.125 yuan to 9 yuan. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4.375 pence for spot British gold and 8.5 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, British gold was 0.125 tighter and the US dollar was 0.125 softer compared to the previous day's evening close. It was rumored that speculators still intended to sell after the close, and the US dollar had hardened to 8.75 yuan, while British gold had eased to 4.5 pence.

### Gold Market Becomes Top-Heavy and Weak-Bottomed; Opening Price Reaches 4600 Yuan; Closing Price Falls to 3565 Yuan

Yesterday's cash gold spot market situation was top-heavy and weak-bottomed, unlike the previous day's soaring prices. Early this morning, due to unsettled previous-day transactions, trading within the market was suspended, leading to considerable discussion outside the market. Prices were wildly inflated to an alarming high of 4600 yuan. Some gold bugs rushed to buy at this price, gleefully congratulating themselves. However, contrary to expectations, prices plummeted. The sudden news of forex support from Hong Kong caused the official opening price to be only 4100 yuan. The profit-taking by Qian Dui firms led to a sharp drop of 350 yuan, falling to 3750 yuan. Subsequently, although Hong Kong speculators re-entered the market, there were ample sellers. At the noon close, the price was 3860 yuan. In the afternoon, the domestic forex market continued to ease, and rumors spread that a major domestic financial figure would re-enter the market. Foreign news reported that British-Japanese negotiations had decisively broken down, causing a shift in sentiment. More bulls exited the market, and those holding gold outside the industry, seeing the market reversal, quickly sold. Buyers hesitated to move forward. Before the late close, the price even fell to 3500 yuan. However, the late close rebounded to 3565 yuan, resulting in a decline of 390 yuan. Thus, the fever of the past few days was extinguished yesterday. Trading remained active, with around 3000 taels traded for the entire day. Jewelry gold also fell sharply by 40 yuan. Customs gold remained unchanged. Pure Chinese and British gold continued to rise.

Cash Gold Soars and Plummets, Ultimately Falling by 390 Yuan

Jewelry Gold Reduced by 40 Yuan; Fine Silver Relisted at 2.8 Yuan

The initial selling prices of silver jewelry were unchanged. However, at 11:30 AM, the price fell by 10 yuan (at the same time, the selling price of fine silver was raised by 0.3 yuan per tael to 2.8 yuan). At 2:35 PM in the afternoon, the price plummeted by another 30 yuan. There were no further changes. In total, the price fell by 40 yuan. Da Tong Hang revised its price to 360 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang revised its price to 358 yuan. There were no fixed prices for buying in.

Pure Gold Rises Again by Half a Penny; Central Customs Gold Remains Unchanged

London, 20th: British pure gold rose again by half a penny per ounce due to the continued weakness of the British pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence. As a result, the China cash buying price of the central bank also continued to rise to 1212.6 yuan. The listed price of Customs gold remained unchanged at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 0.3 yuan to 1207.9 yuan.

From this morning, the mood was still excited, but because the previous day's transactions had not been settled, the industry agreed that trading could not continue in the market. However, due to the contraction of both the official and black-market foreign exchange rates, trading outside the market saw securities firms mutually trading hundreds of taels, with prices reaching alarming levels of 4500 yuan and 4600 yuan. At this time, buyers were still congratulating themselves on their success. Around 10:30 AM, news suddenly broke that the Bank of England HSBC had been ordered by our Ministry of Finance to intervene and maintain foreign exchange rates, which gradually stabilized the black market for foreign exchange. As a result, people became nervous, and sellers swarmed in, pushing the opening price down to 4100 yuan. Silver firms then engaged in mutual trading of 50 taels, but this was still an increase of 145 yuan compared to the previous day. Although one silver firm absorbed currency on behalf of Hong Kong interests, the Qian Dui firms tended to sell, leading to a temporary oversupply and a drop of 350 yuan. When the Qian Dui firms engaged in mutual trading of 50 taels at a price of 3750 yuan, it was rumored that the US dollar exchange rate had fallen back to within the 8 yuan range, leading to a renewed buying spree. One silver firm in particular showed strong buying interest on behalf of Hong Kong speculators, causing the price to soar by 200 yuan. One silver firm acquired 50 taels from a Qian Dui firm at a price of 3950 yuan. At that time, a sudden surge of over 200 taels from securities firms curbed the rising trend, causing it to fall back to 3850 yuan. The securities firms then sold 50 taels to Qian Dui firms. Soon, as a silver firm resumed buying, and another firm also started to absorb currency, the underlying trend turned upward. One silver firm acquired 50 taels from fellow firms at a price of 3920 yuan. Near noon, securities firms returned to sell, pushing the price down again by 70 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to Qian Dui firms at a price of 3850 yuan. At noon, a gold firm sold 20 taels to Qian Dui firms at a price of 3860 yuan. At noon, due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, the market weakened, opening 40 yuan lower. Qian Dui firms engaged in mutual trading of 50 taels at a price of 3820 yuan. After the opening, the selling trend intensified, with gold firms and securities firms aggressively selling, leading to a lack of buyers and a further drop of 320 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to Qian Dui firms at a price of 3500 yuan, the lowest price of the day. At this time, Qian Dui firms took advantage of the low prices to aggressively buy, leading to a rebound of 180 yuan. Qian Dui firms acquired 50 taels from silver firms at a price of 3680 yuan. Subsequently, silver firms came to compete again to sell, pushing the price down by 110 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to Qian Dui firms at a price of 3570 yuan. At that time, one gold firm acquired over 100 taels on behalf of speculators, causing a sudden rise of 30 yuan. One gold firm acquired 50 taels from silver firms at a price of 3600 yuan. After entering, a broker, on behalf of northern interests, liquidated their holdings, and small investors with profits to be made also came to settle their accounts. Although one gold firm aggressively absorbed 300 taels, the supply of inventory still felt excessive, causing the price to fall by 35 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to one gold firm at a price of 3565 yuan, the late closing price. As a result, the price fell back by 390 yuan compared to the previous day. This was the reversal of three days of rising prices, with a range of 600 yuan throughout the day. The cash firm's spot gold price was 10 yuan higher than the cash market price, while the current standard gold price was around 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were some transactions.

### Shanghai in Panic Yesterday

Yesterday's situation saw panic among the general public reach an extreme. This situation, in addition to Yin Dang's absorption, speculation, and manipulation, became more widespread. The majority were small-scale brokers with capital of several thousand or hundreds of yuan, or they pooled resources to buy gold, gold pounds, and foreign currencies. From morning to dusk, various silver firms and small money shops experienced extraordinarily bustling business, with prices rising, and buying becoming more aggressive. There were also disputes at silver shops over prices being lowered by tens of yuan when people tried to sell. This kind of situation was unprecedented in Shanghai's history. Consequently, the discount rate soared to over 200 yuan, and certain banks saw more cash withdrawals. A situation also arose in the market where banks began refusing to accept banknotes from places outside of North China, while others continued to accept them. However, most banks had already stopped accepting banknotes from Wuhan. Although prices of all goods rose to unspeakable levels, business at various stores was relatively sluggish. However, there were still some people who, fearing further price increases, took the opportunity to buy in. If there is no hope of lower prices, businesses in all sectors will be severely hit in the second half of the year. It is even possible that the sight of no empty houses on the streets this year will be replaced by a scene reminiscent of the aftermath of the "January 28th" Incident by this time next year.

### Highest Discount Rate: 260 Yuan; Rebounds Slightly by 50 Yuan

Yesterday's exchange clearing house discount rate soared at one point and then gradually fell. The rate per thousand yuan exceeded 200 yuan, reaching a high of 360 yuan in the morning (meaning that exchange drafts were being discounted at only 84% of their face value). Later, it was heard that foreign exchange rates had eased and the buying fever had subsided, and cash gold had fallen sharply. With fewer needs for cash, the rate fell back, retreating to 215 yuan by noon and even lower to 210 yuan in the afternoon, but still 20 yuan higher than the previous day. The interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained stable, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoted at 1.6% per month.

### Securities: Wealthy Shift Focus; Use Capital on Foreign Stocks; Domestic Bonds Plunge, Then Secretly Rise in Afternoon; Foreign Bonds Fall by Up to 5 Pounds

The secret trading of securities yesterday saw no reduction in the market decline, although the panic was slightly lessened. The object remains the abandonment of public bonds in favor of gold. Wealthy families share this same mentality, with large numbers doing so. The continuous contraction of foreign exchange rates is bound to cause some cracks in the financial sector, making people even more anxious. Only the demand for spot currency means that those holding public bonds are few and far between, and investors are becoming increasingly scarce. Market prices fell by another two or three yuan. In the afternoon, due to a slight rise in foreign exchange rates and a decline in gold prices, public bonds suddenly rose by three or four yuan. The many short coverings were evident. This kind of reaction was intentional. With market prices suddenly improving, the atmosphere also gradually improved, and the future may see a period of stability. Yesterday morning's trading saw the market price still easing after the opening price and the selling of No. 64 shares. Subsequently, the selling of shares from companies such as Baochang, Yizhong, and Tongkang intensified, leading to another decline. Although Lianyi, Lianhe, Hongkang, Hengfu, and others showed some buying interest, they were unable to reverse the downward trend. Closing prices fell by another 1.7 to 3.8 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of Song Ziwen's appointment as minister led to hopes for the financial sector, and secret trading rebounded by three or four yuan. The total number of shares traded was 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in official trading in the morning and 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in secret trading in the afternoon. A simplified table is listed below.

In stock trading, 40 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of 55.5 yuan per share.

Yesterday's stock market at the General Industry Association focused on rubber stocks. There were many buyers of various stocks, and prices soared, reaching new highs for the year. However, the increase seemed inconsistent. Notable stocks such as British Cha Wah, Xue Na Wang, Galendan, and Di Bang all rose uniformly, while others were neglected. Stocks such as Botu Annan and Kangsha Lait were followed by a reaction after the rise, causing stock prices to fall slightly. However, the value of Singapore silver dollars, which were originally exchanged for national currency at a rate of one to two, can now be worth as much as seven yuan, which will inevitably affect the increase in the value of rubber stocks, and future interest payments will also increase similarly.

Although industrial stocks did not experience the same surge, they were also slightly firmer. Kai Ping shares continued to rise but could not sustain the gains and fell slightly. Yih Ho shares progressed slightly, with a closing price of 18.9 yuan. Tram shares showed some firmness, and trading was also quite active. The buying price at the close was 42.75 yuan.

The London Stock Exchange's listed prices for Far East companies on Thursday, the 20th of this month, showed that all shares were stable, and prices did not change.

The London listed prices for Chinese foreign debt on Thursday, the 20th of this month, showed that the prices of upper-tier bonds fell by another 5 pounds. Sino-French US dollar bonds (with stamps) fell by 5 pounds, with a price of 32 pounds. British and German continuation bonds (issued by Britain) and Rehabilitation Bonds (issued by Britain) each fell by 2 pounds, with prices of 38 pounds and 28 pounds, respectively. Clisp fell by 2.5 pounds, with a price of 19 pounds. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds also fell by 2 pounds, with a price of 12 pounds. There were no other changes. According to the London market, 2,000 pounds of Rehabilitation Bonds (issued by Britain) were sold at a price of 29 pounds, one pound higher than the market price. Another 2,500 pounds of Sino-French US dollar bonds (equivalent to 12,500 US dollars) were sold at the parallel market price of 32 pounds. Also, 2,000 pounds of Rehabilitation Bonds (issued by France) were purchased at a price of 24 pounds, 8 pounds lower than the listed price for British bonds.

### Cotton Yarn: Manic Cotton Yarn Surge; Both Coarse and Fine Yarn Up 30 to 40 Yuan; Double Horse Once Nears 600 Yuan

Regarding the current yarn market situation, as the market opened this morning, due to the unified major changes in the exchange and gold market in the afternoon of the previous day, a group of scalpers had already gathered in the market, waiting for the opening price, which immediately skyrocketed and jumped by 20 to 30 yuan. The price of a single package of 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was 555 yuan. Shepherd brand also rose by 20 yuan, with a price of 435 yuan. However, no one sold spot Double Horse yarn, and the clamor for buying shook the sky. The opening price for spot Double Horse yarn was 580 yuan. At this time, the market was chaotic and disorganized. In an instant, the spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 595 yuan, the package price was 579 yuan, and the Shepherd brand price was 455 yuan. Before long, bulls exited the market, and the price suddenly fell by 10 yuan. As the market closed, it was heard that foreign exchange rates had eased and gold prices had also fallen, causing the selling price of each yarn to fall again by 6-7 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1495 bales were traded. Market prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 40 yuan, Shepherd brand rose by 21 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by over 30 yuan. Today, 10 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 100 bales were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 200 bales were shipped to Beihai, 900 bales were shipped to Hong Kong, 90 bales were shipped to Yantai, and 190 bales were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each guild is listed below:

Fellow guild: 830; Inland: 15; Previous day's transactions: 565; Hong Kong: 650; Total: 1495.

Japanese Yarn Market: Stimulated by foreign exchange rates, the market opened soaring by 15-16 yuan. Following the news of unfavorable developments and the increase in the cash premium, as well as being constrained, the price of 20-count Moon Harp yarn once reached 431 yuan, but the closing price fell back to 426 yuan.

### Food: Price Controlled, No Room for Increase; Medium and Low Grades of Indica and Japonica Fill the Market; Foreign Rice Again Subject to Hoarding; Rice Merchants Hope for Higher Prices

Domestic Rice: As the market opened yesterday morning, there was an attempt to aggressively buy in the market, and stores also added embellishments, causing the situation to immediately become chaotic, and it was difficult to distinguish between good and bad quality. General customers and vendors struggled to hold on, and high-quality goods had disappeared, and mid- and high-grade goods were also in short supply. What was being traded in the market were nothing more than medium- and low-grade stale goods, taking advantage of this good opportunity to release them all at once. In reality, due to the price controls, there was no room for price increases, so this was the only way to profit. If the price were to continue to rise in this way, it would seem to break the price controls, so rice merchants declared that they would reimpose price limits soon. However, with foreign exchange rates rising, there is currently no need for foreign rice, and there is even less need for Du Rice. Why are rice merchants raising prices so much? It is because the prices of all goods are rising, and rice merchants are envious, which is somewhat believable. As for the goods being offered, if Changxi Jue Japonica has already opened at over 20 yuan, thick and thin Japonica are also at the price limit. Only Huang Su's price has opened at 19.7-19.8 yuan. There is a shortage of Du Yang Jiantou and Jiantu rice, and the rising trend is evident, with increases of 4-5 jiao.

Bian Yuan also increased by 2-3 jiao. About 1000 bales of Jiangsong No. 2 and Che Lun Baozi rice arrived in the lower reaches of the river. The total number of transactions in the city was over 45,000 bales.

Customer-Grade Indica Rice: There were again inquiries from inland areas yesterday. The lowest price for Indica rice was in the shops of this street, and there was a shift in absorption. Moreover, the origin was not smooth, and the city's stock was sharply reduced. The market price rose by 2-3 jiao due to the competition from various parties. The mid-grade machine-milled Indica rice has also reached the 16 yuan price limit. High-quality Indica rice is mostly hidden and not displayed, so yesterday's transactions were all for medium-grade machine-milled Indica rice and coarse rice. The total number of transactions in the city was over 4,000 bales.

Foreign Rice: Affected by the rising foreign exchange rates and customer-grade Indica rice, the suppliers are hoarding goods and unwilling to sell cheaply. Old Saigon rice rose immediately by 2 jiao, with a price of 22.7 yuan. The newly arrived New Saigon rice is being sold for 23 yuan. The pure round-grain rice is particularly sought after.

### Construction Materials: Hardware Up Over 30%; Foreign Pine Up About 40%

Since the dramatic changes in foreign exchange rates on Tuesday and the continued shrinkage on Thursday, the prices of imported goods among construction materials have all risen. For example, ordinary steel bars have risen from 320 yuan to 400 yuan per ton, foreign nails have risen from 20 yuan to 26 yuan per barrel, and foreign pine has risen from 210 yuan to 300 yuan per thousand feet. However, the merchants who hoard goods are still waiting and holding out, unwilling to sell. Their intention is nothing more than two points: the first is to continue to expect prices to rise and wait for a good price, and the second is to keep the goods in order to protect capital. Therefore, the market is chaotic, and there are very few transactions. The prices of Jian Song fir wood have also risen, due to the blockade of the Minjiang River, which makes it difficult to obtain supplies. Shanghai's inventory is not large. Originally, it was suppressed by foreign pine and could not rise smoothly. Now, it has this opportunity to take advantage of the situation and loot.

### Coal: Coal Prices Soar - Up 20 Yuan per Ton in One Week

Fuel prices have been affected by this foreign exchange market, rising sharply in two or three days, with prices rising by over 10 yuan per ton (daily news not published due to space constraints). The market atmosphere is drunken and confused, not knowing what to do. Yesterday, due to the advance of the shilling to 4 pence, the price of Yanbai coal rose by another 20%, with Hongji Yanbai coal priced at 78 yuan per ton, Xiaozitou at 76 yuan, Indian Yan Coal at 70 yuan, and Hokkaido coal at 58 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The above prices are still discounted prices for fellow traders, cash transactions, and goods in the warehouse, without issuing warehouse receipts.

### Blow to Refugees in the Storm

— Xin Meng

The mat shelters' roofs were torn off, leaving no tiles above;

The muddy ground was filled with water, leaving no space to stand below.

Not long after the first hurricane, the second hurricane mercilessly advanced towards the "isolated island." Although this storm was smaller than the first, it was like adding frost to snow. The blow suffered by the city dwellers was no less severe than the first hurricane; perhaps it was even more severe.

The wind was so fierce, and the rain was so torrential, that in just one night, it changed the entire city's appearance. Regardless of rich or poor, seeing such wind and rain, they would hesitate and dare not step out of their doors. Street vendors could no longer do outdoor business; beggars could not get a single stamp in the wind and rain; after nightfall, wandering friends and owners of pigeonhole-like houses could no longer find a dry place to lie down. Everything symbolized the wind's cruelty and the rain's tyranny. However, the suffering of the people could not compare to that of the refugees in the shelters!

As everyone knows, most of the refugee shelters in the concessions have now been moved to remote areas, with shelters made of reed mats and mud walls. Even the better houses have had their roofs torn off and walls collapsed under the battering of the storm, let alone reed mat shelters? Of course, they could not escape unscathed. Moreover, the areas where refugee shelters are concentrated are mostly low-lying, so not only were the roofs torn off, but there was also accumulated water below! The suffering of the refugees from the wind and rain is imaginable. It is said that there are currently 30,000 refugees in various shelters in Shanghai. The previous hurricane destroyed more than 50% of the reed mat shelters in the two shelters on Xiai Xiansi Road and Dunxin Road. This great tragedy severely impacted the lives of 18,000 refugees. These refugees gathered together and spent a miserable windy and rainy night under the remaining reed shelters.

The refugee shelter on Dunxin Road had six reed mat shelters destroyed in the previous hurricane. It cost 90,000 yuan to build the reed mat shelters in this shelter, which houses 12,000 refugees. According to the contractors, these reed mat shelters could last for three years, so they were definitely not shoddily built. However, after one storm, not only were the roofs torn off, but even two feet of the mud walls were washed away by the rain. If repairs are made to restore the original condition, it would naturally cost a lot of money. Furthermore, in addition to the damage to the shelters, the water and electricity in the shelter were completely cut off.

The shelter on Xiai Xiansi Road has 4,000 refugees, and the previous hurricane also overturned many reed mat shelters. What is particularly serious is that the terrain there is very low, and the accumulated water is six inches high. All the refugees not only had no roofs over their heads, but also had water below them, walking back and forth with their feet immersed in the water. The situation was even more miserable and embarrassing!

Therefore, after the first hurricane, the International Relief Committee published a notice in the newspaper, appealing to all sectors of society to donate an equal amount of money to quickly repair these refugee shelters. Who knew that only a week later, just as the repair work was about to begin, the second hurricane blew into this city of Shanghai, making the refugees suffer the pain of wind and rain again. Please extend your final helping hand once more, so that they can have a place to live and engage in various productive work.

### Electric Wave Fire Net

— Ru Hua

"Arrest Bulldog Druninoud"

Produced by Paramount Pictures, shown at the Da Guangming Theater

In the past, I rarely watched "Lion Dog" movies. They were probably like "Charlie Chan" and "Saint Hero," which could be made into long series.

In this movie, "Electric Wave Fire Net," John Howard plays the famous detective Drummond. It is not a bad choice to cast him in this role, given his physique and acting skills, but the script is really badly written. First, the story is illogical: on the eve of the outbreak of World War, some people were indeed fascinated by the invention of the "death ray," but the experimental results were still far from reality, so this "mysterious electric light radiation machine" is even more of a fantasy by the playwright. Second, the scene divisions are confusing, and the relationships between several main characters are developed divergently. Third, the director's technique is weak. Apart from introducing Drummond's appearance and the opening scene of Kennett's murder, which still captured the suffocating climax of a detective film, the rest of the time he was just trying to introduce the story, making the main characters appear and disappear.

After Drummond's friend Alger and male servant Denny were caught by the spy, Arnold Fossen, and tied up with a rope net, the parrot brought the knife, etc. These gimmicks seem to still be stuck in the days of the "Black-Clad Thief" series from decades ago.

Since John Howard's Drummond was limited by the plot, he could not display his talents, and Xi Shuan Gong'er naturally had even less to do.

### Not Fake Stamps

— You Zhi

Yesterday, Mr. Tang Keming's article "Beware of Fake Stamps" mistakenly identified the newly issued five-cent Sun Yat-sen stamps as fake. This is a major error. Upon investigation, the first edition of the Sun Yat-sen stamps was the London version, and the second was the Beiping version. The London version also has a "misprint version," all named after the place of printing. The pattern and style are the same. The "misprint version" changes the single circle of the national emblem to a double circle. Careful distinction is required to distinguish the two versions. The newly issued Sun Yat-sen stamps are the third version, printed in Hong Kong, also known as the Hong Kong version. The reason for printing the Hong Kong version is that after the War of Resistance, the copper molds of the Beiping version, due to the special circumstances, were transported out of Beiping and were not detained or used by a certain party. Also, for the sake of caution, the Hong Kong version was issued to replace the Beiping version. The "Beiping version stamps will be used up and will not be reprinted." The color and pattern, as Mr. Tang said, "the color is a deeper green, the portrait of Sun Yat-sen facing upwards is larger, and there are more patterns in the root pillars on both sides." These stamps were already sold and used in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places in March of this year. Shanghai has a thicker stock of Beiping version stamps, so they are rarely seen outside. Since Mr. Tang obtained them and mistook them for rare, I hereby state the original facts to correct the mistake.

There were rumors in the market about the discovery of fake stamps. This reporter also tried to use new stamps (the so-called floral stamps) to make purchases and was rejected. Therefore, the talk of fake stamps is not a fabrication. Coincidentally, Mr. Tang Keming submitted a manuscript entitled "Beware of Fake Stamps" and attached a five-cent stamp, which was used as a basis for making a drawing and publishing it to avoid misuse by people in the market and unexpected losses. Unexpectedly, the stamp was a new stamp and not a fake stamp, which was beyond the editor's expectation. In short, this misunderstanding of the stamp was due to the editor's oversight in not consulting the post office, and the post office did not notify the public in advance, making it known to every household. However, due to the erroneous publication of Mr. Tang's article, we received many letters from readers questioning us, which is regrettable. The editor's oversight is indeed undeniable, but the claim that fake stamps were discovered in the market has been clarified to the world. Hereby, Mr. Youzhi's manuscript is published to make a correction. (Editor)

### Tianjin Prices

— Yi Liu

Since the British and French concessions in Tianjin were blockaded, transportation has been inconvenient, and prices have soared abnormally. The prices of various items listed in a letter from a friend in Tianjin are listed on the left, from which we can know the extent of the rise in other items.

Pork (with skin and bones): 1 yuan per catty

Gala head (i.e., Shanghai radish): 1 jiao per piece

Green vegetables: 4-5 jiao per catty

Cucumber sea strip: 1 jiao 5 fen

West Lake melon: 1 yuan 5 jiao per piece

Eggs: 1 jiao per piece

Cowpeas: 3 jiao 5 fen per catty

Sanitary ice: 35 pounds per yuan

Also, major restaurants are mostly in a semi-closed state. Only small restaurants sell as they buy, because the weather is hot and ice is not easily obtained.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Fireworks in Thousands of Homes, Rural Cooperation; Waves for Ten Thousand Miles, Overseas Flight

Therefore, every place has an organization that manages how much rice is eaten each year. The organization does not allow the local people to have insufficient food, nor does it allow them to have too much surplus. Therefore, those big households who hoarded rice, the rice weevils, have long disappeared. Why? In the past, some unscrupulous merchants often took advantage of disasters, profiting when people were in a dilemma and at their wits' end, just like "licking blood off a knife's edge." This is called "profiting from disasters." But these people who profited from disasters never had good results in the end. Those households hoarding rice, seeing some obstacles in Chinese transportation, thought that rice prices would always rise. They took advantage of the fact that rice prices had not risen enough and desperately bought up rice, hoarding it and refusing to sell it. They waited until rice prices soared or during the time of year when the old crop was used up and the new crop was not yet ready, they could make a fortune. But these kinds of merchants who profited by taking risks cannot exist in today's society. Because now, a clear account is kept of how much rice is exported and how much rice is imported in a place. There is no need to register the rice in storage or announce the prices. If someone hoards rice, they will be asked what their intentions are. How many people are in your household? Why do you want to store so much rice? If people don't have enough to eat, will you turn a blind eye, watch them go hungry, and keep the granary doors tightly closed without a shred of compassion? Your hide will be punished! Because since the war, the government has established a Ministry of Food and has arranged for national food transportation and storage, so each region has a Food Adjustment Committee. Even the smallest village has a food adjustment organization. Everyone knows that northern people are different. But some farmers cannot eat rice or wheat flour, but can only eat a kind of coarse grain, such as sweet potato flour, which sounds nice and looks good written down, but is really difficult for us to swallow. They think that rice and wheat flour are for the enjoyment of the blessed people in the world, and that they are sent down by God to grow that noble food exclusively for the blessed people. (161)

### A Record of Yan Jupeng's Two Sons - The Elder, Shaopeng, Studies the Art of the Beards, Following the Style of Ma Lianliang; The Younger, Xiaopeng, Studies Martial Arts Under Ding Yongli

— Aiping Room Host

Yan Jupeng's visit to Shanghai, with his excellent art, has been widely supported by public opinion. Jupeng has two sons, Shaopeng and Xiaopeng, who also came with their father. I met the two of them and inquired about everything in detail, and I am here to introduce them. Shaopeng specializes in the art of beards, as well as civil and martial old men. He follows the style of Ma Yunliang and is capable of performing "Hongmen Banquet," "Battle of Taiping," "Ganlu Temple," "Heroes' Gathering," "Battle of Wancheng," and "Celebrating Top Beads." He is an outstanding talent among the rising stars of the beard genre. He has performed with his father on stage and has been very popular with the audience. There are rumors that Shaopeng will reveal his art at the farewell commemoration. According to what he told me, this news is probably unreliable, because Shaopeng loses his voice every summer, so the talk of performing on stage is really just rumor.

Xiaopeng studies martial arts and is currently studying under the famous teacher Ding Yongli. Ding Yongli is the son of the old actor Ding Taosheng and is good at teaching martial arts dramas. He knows all the famous dramas of the Yang, Huang, and Shang schools. Sheng Qilin's art was also taught by Yongli. Xiaopeng is in his ranks and has the elegance of being a fellow student with Sheng Lin. Xiaopeng can perform dramas such as "Lin Chong's Night Flight," "Che Ping Mountain," "Wu Song," and "Changban Slope," all of which have unique features. In the future, he can be expected to enjoy a great meal among the martial arts students. Jupeng has these two sons, and his old age is enough to be gratifying.

### Silver Dream (Below)

— Xin Shi's pen

As spoken by Silver Star Miss Li Hong

A warning from movie fans

The movie life dreamed of during the movie fan period is not really that way at all. Really, this job is too hard. When I first arrived in Shanghai at that time, I was unfamiliar with the place and everything was new to me. The first time I ran to the photography field, it was like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, and I didn't know anything at all. I rashly ventured into this bold attempt, and when I think about it, I feel both amused and annoyed. But as things progressed, I couldn't "retreat before the battle," so I could only grit my teeth and do it. I was originally very familiar with the dialogue in the "First Love" script, but when I was filming under the watchful eyes of everyone, I was worried that I would say something wrong and be laughed at, and I wanted to be meticulous, but it was easier to make mistakes. Every day I felt very lonely waiting to film on the set, and I often thought silently: "This movie is not for me. After the first love is finished, I will decide to give up and not do it." After more than two months like a criminal, a few shots were not filmed well, and I slipped away to Hangzhou and returned to Nanjing. Later, someone from Yihua Company came to Beijing and invited me firmly, and gave me a lot of comfort and encouragement. Only then did I muster up the courage to come to Shanghai again—I thought: There must be many people who dream of a silver screen life like me, and this situation is just right to serve as a warning to them.

A topic of conversation

Not long after, the "August 13th" war broke out, and I once joined the Red Cross Rescue Team and was assigned to serve in Zhenjiang. It was not until the Shanghai-Songhu front was about to move west that I fled to Shanghai. After that, I re-entered the film industry in the autumn of last year. At the same time, I was admitted to the second grade of Guanghua University to study banking and accounting. Who knew that I couldn't read it and instead caused a lot of talk. It turned out that a movie actor is often easily watched by many male and female students. Everyone treats me with special kindness. Once there was an exam, because I was filming "Love in Blood and Tears" and it was difficult to take the exam, I had already completed the leave procedures. Unexpectedly, a classmate took it upon himself to take the exam in my name. The proctor happened to be the person I asked for leave from. He was surprised in class, "Li Hong has asked for leave, how could she come to the exam again?" and paid special attention to it. But that Li Hong was a male student. So, the truth was immediately revealed, and even I was innocently implicated and expelled. Afterwards, the teacher immediately understood the whole story and said that I would still be allowed to enter the school next semester. However, I was already very stimulated and only wanted to rely on my family to improve myself and no longer had the courage to do so.

My thoughts

Regarding my thoughts on film work: I feel that acting is getting harder and harder, and it is not easy to pursue excellence. It is even more frustrating that it is difficult to rehearse positive era works in the current environment. However, the future of the film industry is very promising. The most obvious thing is that the thinking of the general practitioners is different from the time when the "Red Lotus Temple" film was popular. The technical aspects have also improved greatly. Therefore, when the entire environment returns to its old appearance, the film industry will also embark on a rapid stage of development. I have already realized my silver dream of being obsessed with movie life. But its taste is very different from the sweetness and bitterness in my dreams. Now, mediocrely, my life is like a dream within a dream.

### The "Working Women's Club" Suspended the Performance of "Thunderstorm" for a Charity Sale of Goods

— Zi Yan

The "Working Women's Troupe" of the Chinese Working Women's Club originally decided to perform Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm" in this Shanghai amateur drama circle charity performance. The roles, etc., have also been decided. The only thing missing is the start of rehearsals. There is a reason for not starting rehearsals. In addition to participating in this charity performance, the "Working Women" are also holding a large-scale charity sale of goods with a target of 10,000 yuan. The "Working Women's Troupe" is only one of the departments of the "Working Women's Club" itself, while the charity sale of goods is the entire "Working Women's Club." In comparison, the charity sale of goods is naturally more important. Moreover, the charity sale of goods is organized by them, so in fact, they cannot but devote all their efforts to deal with the charity sale of goods.

The "Working Women's" charity sale of goods has gone through many difficulties, but they finally overcame them with perseverance and finally held it in their own clubhouse. "Women are inherently weak, but mothers are strong." The "Working Women's" spirit of perseverance and courage has washed away the traditional weaknesses of women and promoted the great motherhood of humanity and the continuation of the next generation of citizens!

But precisely because of this, there was no time to rehearse "Thunderstorm," and the date of the charity performance was getting closer and closer. Until recently, although the charity sale of goods has ended, it is too late to rush to rehearse "Thunderstorm." Moreover, the "Working Women" do not want to do things hastily and produce shoddy products, so in the face of desperation, they can only reluctantly give up, explain the difficulties to the charity performance preparation committee, and ask for understanding. This difficulty is of course accepted by the preparation committee. Then, the Amateur Drama Exchange Society will fill in this play and perform three one-act plays that the Shanghai Rice Association has performed: "Go," "Derelict Villa," and "Complete the Good Deed."

However, although the "Working Women" have decided not to perform "Thunderstorm," they will still participate in the performance. In addition to taking on the joint responsibilities of the front and backstage, they will also participate in "The True Story of Ah Q" in terms of acting, in order to fulfill their original intention. "The True Story of Ah Q" was originally a joint performance by the Jingwu, Gonghua, and Yiyou drama troupes. Now that the "Working Women" have been added, the momentum will naturally be even greater.

### The Grand Stage Will Still Perform Two Old Plays This Sunday

Since Mr. Li joined the Xinji Grand Stage, the lineup has become stronger, and the performance of old dramas every Sunday is a grand occasion unprecedented. Last Sunday, the performances of "Killing the Four Gates" and "The Three Unyielding Iron Roosters" were unanimously praised by the audience, who exclaimed that they were wonderful. It is said that the person in charge of the stage has received letters and phone calls from the outside world for days, requesting that the two good plays be performed again this Sunday. I learned that the owner of the jujube, Mr. Fan Hengde, decided to order the manager to discuss and rehearse again. It is said that the repertoire is more exciting than the last two times, and the following plays have been decided... Zhang Yipeng - "Wu Song Fights the Shop," the complete "Ningwu Pass," Li Zhonglin - "Phoenix Mountain," the complete "Purple Bamboo Forest." There are many other famous plays, and the grand occasion at that time can be imagined.

Dancing Country Sketches (32)

### Star Six Star Chronicle 5 - Ma Yuanyuan

Po Gong wrote in his poem, "What should life be like everywhere? It should be like a wild goose stepping on mud. The goose leaves its claw marks on the mud by chance, the wild goose flies, who calculates the east and west." My situation of running to the dance hall is also like this. If I must seek the traces, it would be like carving a boat to find the sword.

Yuanyuan is from Ningbo. Her original surname was not Ma. Because her current mother's current husband's surname is Ma, she vaguely started using the surname Ma. (123) I also asked her, "What was your surname before?" She said that she had heard her previous mother say that it was probably Zheng, otherwise it was Cheng, maybe she had the same surname as me. I felt a little funny and couldn't laugh, so I asked her again, "Did your previous mother treat you well?" She said, "She was my biological mother, why wouldn't she treat me well? She got up early to sweep the floor for me and buy snacks, cook for me at noon, and pat me to sleep at night. If I got angry, she would always comfort me with a smile." I said, "Why did you get angry for no reason?" She said, "The dance hall boss oppresses me, the guests bully me, and I would go back and get angry with my mother, and my mother would come to flatter me." I said, "Does your current mother treat you like this too?" She cried. I asked her, "Is it because your current mother is abusing you?" She said, "No, she treats me very well. It's just that I miss my biological mother. She unfortunately died last year. Because I am a dancer, I can't even wear mourning clothes. Her coffin is stored in a public hall. When I went to pay my respects some time ago, even the coffin was gone. I asked everyone in the hall and argued, and they told me to find it myself, but I never found it."

Her appearance is not very beautiful, but her figure is very slender, with the appearance of a willow's small waist. When dancing with guests, she often likes to tilt her head, probably to avoid face-to-face contact. Her dancing skills are not the best, but they are not bad. If there is something happy, she can't help but smile on her face. If things are not satisfactory, she will pout. She thinks she is an adult, but her temper is totally like a child. According to her, she used to work in the Moon Palace and was extremely popular. Junlai was ambushed by a Ningbo guest because he was drunk. It is a pity that her dead mother was still kept in the dark until her death. Later, she was scared that the Ningbo guest was a tea room boss, so she didn't want to be with him. It is said that in this war, the tea room boss died under a bomb. She said it at random, I recorded it at random, and readers might as well listen to it at random and laugh.

### Brawl at the Golden Osmanthus Theater

Yang San from Tianjin came to Shanghai several months ago. Because most of the actors in the Golden Osmanthus Theater were from Tianjin, he wanted to recommend someone to perform in the theater. However, the foreman declined on the grounds that the cast was full, so he gave up. Later, Yang San learned that the reason for the decline was that Xu Shifang from the troupe had obstructed it. Therefore, he harbored resentment and used a weapon to beat him on Shilu Road last month. On Tuesday, Yang San, carrying a sharp blade and inviting seven or eight companions, went to the Golden Osmanthus Theater again, intending to seek revenge. His companions were all ambushed outside the theater. Yang San went into the theater alone, and Xu Shifang happened to walk out from inside. They looked at each other and started fighting. At that time, the theatergoers were celebrating with drums and flags. Suddenly, they saw the bright light of knives at the theater entrance and the din of voices. They were all shocked. The timid ones ran away first. The theater stopped playing the gongs because it was already eleven or twelve o'clock. The patrol officers also knew about it and came to arrest them. Yang San's companions, seeing that the situation was not right, sneaked away. Therefore, only Yang San and Xu Shifang were caught. On Wednesday morning, the patrol officers took the two to the court. After clarifying the details, Yang San was paraded in a cangue for a month as a warning, and Xu Shifang was released on bail. Yang San's gang, hearing this news, were all angry. Learning that Xu Shifang had left the city and was hiding in his apartment on Shangyi Street, they immediately gathered more than twenty companions, each carrying a sharp blade, and went out to search for him. It was already one o'clock. There were already few pedestrians on the street, and these twenty-odd people, each dressed in short clothes and carrying a Huma sword, ran east and west, raising their arms and running all over the place near Chaoyang Building and Shilu Road. The two leaders held chain sticks, their momentum fierce. It is said that these twenty-odd people were all horse traders from Tianjin, like hungry tigers going out of the mountains and hungry eagles plundering the fields. However, the gates of Shangyi Street were closed, and there was nothing they could do. Foreign patrol officers followed them to see what was going on, but they did not dare to step forward to interrogate them.
