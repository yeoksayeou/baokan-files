### The Fukien Coastline: The Strongest Resistance Against Japan; Japan Threatens to Block the Min River Estuary, Orders Foreign Ships to Withdraw; Guangzhou's Japanese Consul Forcibly Takes Over the Swatow Customs Yesterday; Japan Dispatches the 5th New Army Division to China, a Nature of Defense Deployment

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese air force and artillery units have jointly bombed Shuijiang near Fuzhou for two days, but have still not been able to gain a foothold in Shuijiang. The Chinese troops along the Fujian coast are now putting up the strongest resistance against the Japanese army. The people of all cities, including Fuzhou, are extremely calm and show no signs of panic or disorder. Observers point out that it will not be easy for the Japanese army to land in Fuzhou after the arrival of Chinese reinforcements. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatches report that the Japanese side claims it will block the Min River estuary starting on the 6th, and orders foreign nationals and ships to withdraw from Fuzhou before that date. It is rumored that the Japanese will launch an attack with land and air forces at dawn on the 6th. Foreign nationals there are requesting that Nantai Island be designated as an international security zone. After several negotiations, Japan has agreed to respect this, but declares that it will not be responsible for stray bullets or fragments flying into the area. (Special dispatch, 5th afternoon) The Japanese side dispatched Guangzhou Consul Matsudaira, who forcibly took over the Chinese Swatow Customs at 3 PM on the 5th. (Special dispatch, 5th afternoon)

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman announced today that Japan has dispatched the 5th New Army Division to China. However, he believes that this new army is not a reinforcement for any large-scale offensive planned in China, and is probably only a defense deployment. The spokesman continued that since the Japanese army failed in its seven attacks on Zhongtiaoshan in southern Shanxi, it has twice invaded the mountain in a short period of time, but has been severely damaged and retreated each time. The spokesman finally mentioned the military actions in southern China, saying that the Chinese army has repeatedly attacked in the Xinhui and Jiangmen areas south of Guangzhou, and Chinese mobile units have attacked Japanese positions in various areas. (Reuters, 5th)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman, the Japanese army in China has increased to 40 divisions in the past month (but according to the Associated Press and other sources, it is only 36 divisions). The increased divisions total seven, but most of the increased forces are still concentrated along the railways, with two and a half divisions added to Shanxi and one division added to Hubei. The other divisions are merely replenishing losses. Therefore, except for Shanxi, where the Japanese army may launch another offensive against the guerrillas, they do not believe there will be any new offensives in other areas. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Chinese Army in Hubei: Successful Counteroffensive

(Chongqing) According to reports received here from Hubei, the Japanese army's attempt to cross the Han River eastwards to join forces with the Qianjiang Japanese army has completely failed. The Chinese army's counteroffensive has been very successful. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### Italian Volunteers Come to the Far East to Help Japan Fight

(Rome) According to reliable sources here, Italian volunteers who have returned from Spain are now being recruited by the Japanese to go to the Far East to help them fight against China. It is said that many Italian soldiers have already departed from the port of Naples in Italy by ship. (Reuters, 5th)

### President Kong Broadcasts to America on American Independence Day; Hopes for Economic Sanctions Against Japan; America Has the Power to Stop Japanese Aggression

(Chongqing) Yesterday was American Independence Day. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan of China, broadcast to America in English, saying, "I cannot help but express my regret at this time when the international situation is clouded with gloom and various principles contained in the American Declaration of Independence are threatened everywhere. However, your country's struggle for independence has given us unparalleled lessons. As we enter the third year of this Chinese war of national independence, we recall the spirit of your country's martyrs who fought bloody battles to win independence and lay the foundation for freedom and equality for future generations. We are deeply encouraged and excited. I sincerely hope that when peace descends upon the world and goodwill reaches the masses, we will see our two great sister nations across the Pacific rejoice in the steadfastness of their democracies in the world. Furthermore, the birth of the North American Republic is a cause for joy for all who love freedom. The American Declaration of Independence not only proclaimed the highest principles of human freedom and equality, but also created a great nation with lofty ideals, whose contributions to human progress and world peace are unmatched by any other country. Such as the elucidation of the Open Door Policy, the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other achievements in the international arena, all of which were led by your country. At the same time, since the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States has provided considerable assistance to China, such as purchasing Chinese silver and providing loans to China. Now, in our infinite pain and tragic resistance, your country extends infinite sympathy and spiritual assistance, and establishes various wartime relief service works and active cooperation actions for our people. We deeply know that your country's sympathy for China stems purely from the similarity of the ideals and the consistency of the interests of the two great nations. The United States has always loved China consistently, whether in trade, education, culture, politics, or international relations, the United States has always been a friend and teacher of China. Therefore, China's love for the United States is not accidental. However, at present, reason is replaced by barbaric force, and the sanctity of all treaties can be trampled upon by militarists. Kong continued, Japan may implement its policy of military terror against China, but it will never deter our will, and will never subdue the national soul of China, but will only strengthen our determination to resist. Our resistance has now reached two full years, and the myth of the invincibility of the Imperial Army has been exposed by us. From now on, we will continue to resist, regardless of the years, until Japan knows that our China cannot be conquered, and until China becomes an independent and free country. However, maintaining international law and justice is not a matter for one country alone. Furthermore, in order to protect the interests of one country, we must not be like ostriches, hiding our heads in the sand when we see disasters. Therefore, America's peace and security will ultimately be inextricably linked to the peace and security of the world. If we want to enjoy the happiness of peace, we must work for peace; if we want to ensure our own security, we must pay the price for security. Here, I would like those isolationists in your country to reflect: although Japan is a warlike country, it is also a country that cannot be self-sufficient in resources. In this war of aggression against China, its munitions raw materials and killing weapons are all obtained from other countries, especially the United States. This is Japan's weakness and also the greatest reason why the American people can stop the insatiable demands of this island nation. In short, the economic power of the American people is much greater than all the power of Japan. Therefore, if the United States can impose economic pressure on Japan at this time, Japan's clay feet will inevitably lead to failure. In short, the United States has the power to subdue Japan without war and stop Japan's policy of aggression. (Associated Press, 5th)

Editorial

### The Border Conflict Between Mongolia and "Manchukuo"

Since May, there have been constant reports of conflicts on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo," and Japan has even exaggerated the "great victory in air combat" in the international community. According to recent news, the conflict seems to be gradually escalating. The Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom officially published an official gazette in London yesterday, announcing the implementation of a "defensive" counterattack starting on July 1st; at the same time, Tokyo newspapers are also vigorously publicizing the tension in Japanese-Soviet relations; it is even said that due to the successive recall of the Soviet ambassador and charg√© d'affaires to Japan, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have been virtually severed, indicating that a Japanese-Soviet war may be imminent.

This border conflict between Mongolia and "Manchukuo" is exactly the same as the Zhanggufeng Incident last spring, and again originated from the so-called border crossing incident; but which side crossed the border first will become an unsolvable mystery. However, the cause of the conflict is one thing, and the evolution of the conflict into a formal war is another. Whoever wants to provoke can use the border crossing incident as an excuse: judging from the official gazette issued by the Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom, although it tries to attribute the responsibility for the border crossing to the Soviet-Mongolian army; it also claims that it has sent air force to bomb Outer Mongolian territory, and openly declares that it will take offensive measures on a regular basis.

Provocation is one thing, and whether the provoker has the ability and determination to fight is naturally another. A Japanese-Soviet war is indeed inevitable: Japan must eliminate Soviet power in the Far East to complete its continental policy: the Soviet Union also knows that to protect the integrity of its territory, it must correct Japan's attempt to dominate the Far East. In terms of the current situation, the military deployments of the two countries have reached a serious stage of tension; but this is only the superficial situation: in fact, Japan has no ability or determination to fight against the Soviet Union during the period of its invasion of China. Japan's war against China has now lasted two years, and it is exhausted and unable to stop; its domestic troops are not enough to be distributed on various battlefields in China, so how can it launch a large-scale attack on the Soviet Union? In terms of economy, although Japan has implemented the General Mobilization Law, it still cannot afford the cost of invading China, so how can it raise financial resources that are greater than the cost of invading China? As for Japan's determination to launch a war against the Soviet Union: if Japan really wanted to fight the Soviet Union to the death, then the military and economic power that Japan maintained a year ago was far superior to the current one, and it would not have bowed its knees in the middle of the Zhanggufeng Incident a year ago. Another very obvious point is that Japan does not want this conflict to occur on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, but on the Mongolian-"Manchukuo" border, which is to try to avoid a head-on conflict with the Soviet Union.

Japan does not have the ability and determination to fight against the Soviet Union, and this creation of the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict has the effect of "killing two birds with one stone." One is for domestic political purposes: since Japan's war against China, from the Konoe Cabinet to the Hiranuma Cabinet, the Japanese warlords have always considered them weak and incompetent: especially for the exclusion of European and American forces in China, they have not been able to take decisive measures, and they have refused to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy, which has greatly disappointed them. They attempt to use the expansion of the scope of operations as an excuse to organize a military cabinet dominated by pure military personnel in order to fulfill their dreams of aggression. The recent rumors that a cabinet crisis is about to occur in Japan are probably a sign of this effect.

The other effect is to cope with the international situation and take a feigned attack in diplomacy; its greatest purpose is to destroy the establishment of the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and to respond to Germany's recent posture toward Danzig in Europe. The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have gradually approached completion. If the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, regardless of whether it involves the Far East issue, they will inevitably have more opportunities and power to pay attention to the Far East due to the stability of the European situation. In order to avoid being interfered with, Japan is using the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict to publicize the weakness of the Soviet military, so that Britain and France will shake their determination to unite with the Soviet Union. Japan has previously publicized that the Japanese Air Force has shot down dozens or even hundreds of Soviet aircraft in multiple battles with a small number of aircraft. Who dares to believe this lightly! Recently, Japan has insisted on publishing the details of the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict in London's official gazette, which clearly exposes its true intentions. As for Japan's deliberately creating a tense situation in the Far East in response to Germany, this is a consistent policy of Eurasian fascism; they attempt to divert the British and French forces' aid to Poland due to the serious situation in the Far East, which is of course another act of echoing Germany from afar.

Those who are clever in the world often end up outsmarting themselves. Japan's Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict will make Britain, France, and the Soviet Union feel the same pressure and quickly promote the establishment of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement. Recently, Paris and London have revealed optimistic news about the negotiations. Furthermore, due to Japan's actions in response to Germany, it is enough to make Britain, France, and the Soviet Union realize that the world's security has no regional boundaries. The Far East is certainly no exception!

### Japanese Political Parties Resolve to Urge the Government to Take a Strong Stance on the Tokyo-British Negotiations; Must Make Britain Accept the Conditions Proposed by the Tianjin Japanese Authorities; Sugiyama Claims That Restrictions on Transportation in Tianjin Will Not Be Relaxed in the Slightest

(Tokyo) It is reported that various political parties and public organizations are holding meetings one after another to pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a strong attitude towards the Tokyo-British conference to resolve the Tianjin Incident. The Masses Party followed in the footsteps of the Minseito Party and the Seiyukai Party and held an emergency board meeting this morning. It is reported that a resolution has been passed stating that the British aid to the Chinese Chiang Kai-shek regime is a serious obstacle in the construction of the new order in East Asia, and urging the government to implement the four conditions that the Tianjin Japanese authorities have submitted to the British authorities to resolve the Tianjin Incident. It is also reported that this resolution has been copied and sent to Prime Minister Hiranuma and the three ministers of the Navy, Army, and Foreign Affairs. The Tokyo City Council and various prefectural councils also passed resolutions this afternoon, strongly requesting the government to force Britain to obey public opinion, abandon its pro-Chiang policy, so as to eliminate the source of disputes in the Tokyo negotiations, and copied the resolution and presented it to five major cabinet members and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tianjin) General Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese army in North China, arrived here from Peiping yesterday to personally investigate the Tianjin situation, and returned to Peiping this morning. According to Japanese newspapers, General Sugiyama strongly urged the British concession authorities to abandon their pro-Chiang attitude and cooperate with Japan to create a new order in Asia. After inspecting the Japanese inspection stations at the entrances and exits of the British and French concessions, Sugiyama met with reporters yesterday afternoon. When asked about his feelings after personally inspecting, Sugiyama said that the Japanese soldiers were performing their duties of isolating the British and French concessions earnestly and calmly, and the Chinese and Japanese residents of Tianjin gave solid support to the Japanese military authorities, which he was very pleased with. When reporters asked about his opinions on the Tokyo-British talks, Sugiyama replied that no matter how the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo proceed, the restrictions on transportation in Tianjin will not be relaxed in the slightest. The isolation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is implemented under the guidance of the Japanese army in North China. The Japanese army is determined to achieve its goals and will not heed any interference until Britain changes its pro-Chiang attitude and policy of protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tianjin) When reporters questioned the Japanese spokesperson today about the Japanese rumor that British Consul-General Jameson in Tianjin had recently obtained the planned plans of the Chinese guerrillas fighting in the Tianjin area, the spokesperson promised to reply tomorrow. According to Consul-General Jameson, he had already asked Reuters yesterday to deny this statement, which he described as absurd nonsense. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tokyo) Nagai, the leader of the Minseito Party, delivered a speech at a rally against Britain, believing that the main condition for the British-Japanese negotiations should be to require Britain to immediately end its support for the Chinese Nationalist government. Nagai criticized the Far East policy adopted by Britain since the Opium War in very harsh terms, and demanded that the entire Japanese people unanimously regard Britain as an enemy, and that the Japanese people should hate Britain unless Britain changes its attitude. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Craigie Explains the Scope of Negotiations

(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, who was ordered to conduct British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, solemnly stated to reporters today that the negotiations held in Tokyo this time will be limited to local issues caused by the Tianjin Incident. Since both Britain and Japan have expressed goodwill, the prospects for the negotiations can be viewed optimistically. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craigie told 15 foreign reporters at the embassy today that there is a firm understanding that the British-Japanese negotiations, which will begin soon, will deal with local issues related to the current situation in Tianjin. This dispute can only be resolved through negotiations, and not by force. The official opening date of the talks has not yet been determined. The Japanese military representative in Tianjin was unable to return home by plane due to bad weather and had to take a train and ship to get here, so the opening date of the meeting has been delayed. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler spoke about the situation in Tianjin, saying that there was no new situation to report. "Before the end of the negotiations in Tokyo, there will be no discussion of the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case in Tianjin. I have already stated this." (Havas News Agency, 5th)

British MPs Advocate a Strong Stance

(London) Last night, the 1912 Club, composed of members of parliament from various parties in the Lower House, held a meeting. Mr. Tom Peifel, a former China correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, and Mr. Kirkbride Lake, who represented the British government's Export Credit Guarantee Department in China in 1936, delivered speeches on the current situation in China. Both men have a wealth of knowledge about Chinese affairs. He said that the Tianjin Incident was only a kind of testing effect. If Britain shows any surrender to Japan on this matter, it will terminate the possibility of cooperation with the United States in the Far East or Europe in the long term, because the United States' willingness to stand on the same side as Britain in the Far East and Europe will depend on whether Britain is prepared to take a firm stand. Kirkbride said that the Japanese warlords have failed to end this undeclared war and present it to their countrymen as a trophy, which has made Japanese business, finance, and civilians feel disappointed. He believes that this war in China is purely a military rebellion. This undeclared war will end with an undeclared peace. At that time, Britain will feel that it is not easy to preserve its efforts to trade with China and will see it become even more serious. The way Britain is organized will have to change, and Britain's entire attitude towards the policies of the Japanese military authorities should also be firm. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) When the House of Commons met today, a member asked whether Britain would continue to provide assistance to Chinese legal tender. Financial Secretary Simon replied immediately, "For the sake of Britain's own interests, and for the sake of the interests of other countries that have economic and financial relations with China, the stability of Chinese legal tender is valued by the government. I see no reason to change this view." Opposition Labour MP Bergen raised a question, "When the government previously proposed the Chinese Currency Stabilization Act, it advocated maintaining the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. Now that the exchange rate of legal tender has fallen by 25 percent, does the government still maintain it?" Financial Secretary Simon replied that the stability of Chinese legal tender is of paramount importance, which I have already said, but it is not appropriate to describe what measures we will take in the future. Bergen then followed up with a question, "Is the government continuing to maintain the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender? Is the Financial Secretary prepared to allocate sufficient resources for this?" The Financial Secretary replied, "The government has taken this action through legislative procedures. What we will do in the future is not convenient to announce at this time." (Havas News Agency, 5th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times commented today on the British-Japanese negotiations that will be held in Tokyo, saying that Japanese newspapers and soldiers are still repeatedly exaggerating methods to make the British support Japanese currency in North China and acquiesce to Japanese aggression. If Japan proposes the above points, the Tokyo conference may not make much progress. The British government is now prepared to guarantee Japan the neutrality of the British concession in Tianjin and the immediate extradition of the four suspects if they are proven guilty. In addition, other local incidents will be discussed, but beyond this limit, the British government does not intend to proceed. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tianjin) According to the Japanese spokesperson's announcement to reporters this morning, the second mate of the Taikoo Yangxing Yuezhou ship, British national Griffith, who was arrested on Sunday evening, will be released today. The reason for his arrest was that he used insulting language to Japanese soldiers. However, when I went to Taikoo Yangxing this morning to inquire, Griffith had not yet returned to the ship. A reporter asked what the Japanese intended by tightening restrictions on the transportation of milk into the British concession. The spokesperson replied that according to the officer in charge of the search office, there is no other way to inspect items that have not been allowed to be transported in except to inspect the containers in which they are packed. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tianjin) The Japanese side has not yet released Griffith, the second mate of the Taikoo Yangxing Yuezhou ship. The British side will try again tomorrow to urge the Japanese side to release him. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tianjin) US Consul in Tianjin Gottway lodged a protest with Japanese Consul Tashiro today, listing various inconveniences suffered by Americans. Tashiro has agreed to do his best to reduce the troubles of American residents, and said that the Japanese side now has a type of cargo transportation license, which Americans can obtain from the Japanese side if they want to transport goods in and out of the concession. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Chongqing Newspapers to Be Published Separately Starting Next Month

(Chongqing) It is reported that the newspapers here will be published separately starting on August 1. According to the fact that local newspapers have been jointly publishing a daily newspaper since the Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing on May 3 and 4. (Reuters, 5th)

### Continued Air Battles on the Outer Mongolian Border: Information Released by Tokyo

(Tokyo) This question was received today from a Japanese report: Yesterday, when the Japanese army attempted to expel the Soviet army from the border of "Manchukuo," Soviet Outer Mongolian aircraft clashed with Japanese "Manchukuo" aircraft in the skies of the Outer Mongolian border twice. According to the Japanese side, as a result of the air battle, 64 Soviet aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese report did not mention how many Japanese aircraft were lost. It is said that the first air battle took place in the western section of the border yesterday afternoon. A team of Soviet bombers flew close to the Japanese aviation base and dropped dozens of bombs aimlessly. Japanese fighter planes then took off to intercept them, shooting down 14 Soviet aircraft. Before dusk, 90 Soviet aircraft were said to have crossed the border to an area 40 miles east of Lake Baikal. An hour-long air battle there resulted in the loss of 50 Soviet aircraft. The Japanese report also said that since last week, the number of Soviet aircraft in Outer Mongolia has increased. (Associated Press, 5th)

(Tokyo) According to the communique here, since May 20, an average of as many as eight Soviet-Mongolian aircraft have been shot down by the Japanese side. From May 20 to July 4, a total of 365 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft have been shot down, of which 283 were shot down before June 27. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Philippine Democratic Collective Congress Passes Resolution Condemning Japan, Launches Boycott Movement, and Sends Respectful Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek

(Manila) The Democratic Collective Security Congress was held at the Manila Theater last night and passed a resolution to condemn Japan's aggression against China and urge all parties to boycott Japanese goods. The Congress also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of China, outlining the Congress's plans. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to President Roosevelt and Sir Samuel, president of the International Peace Movement Association. The telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated, "The Congress unanimously expresses its most enthusiastic respect to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is determined to provide economic assistance to the united front of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese fascist aggression, and will launch a movement to boycott Japanese goods." The telegram to President Roosevelt stated, "The Philippine Democratic Collective Security Congress expresses its utmost admiration for your public leadership in the movement for democracy and collective security, but the Congress believes that the most important thing is still to boycott Japanese goods and prohibit the supply of armaments to aggressors." The telegram to Sir Samuel stated, "The Philippine Democratic Collective Security Congress condemns all forms of aggression worldwide." The Congress also passed a resolution to urge all democratic countries of the world to implement a boycott of Japanese goods as soon as possible. In addition to Christian Filipinos and Muslim Filipinos, hundreds of thousands of people participated in the Congress. The Congress also received many congratulatory messages from Chinese military and political figures, such as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, Chief of the Political Department of the General Headquarters Chen Cheng, and Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council Zhang Qun. (May 5, Associated Press)

(Manila) The Philippine Republic Association, which advocates for an indefinite postponement of Philippine independence, is intensifying its work. It recently has 3,000 members. Due to the tense situation in the Far East, the association's members have become more active. However, due to limited funds, the number of personnel sent to the provinces for publicity is small. According to the association's main personnel, US-Philippine cooperation is the only effective tool to safeguard the Philippines against foreign aggression. (May 5, Associated Press)

The Japanese Consul's Frustration

(Manila) The Japanese Consul in Manila, Kihara, expressed his dissatisfaction today with the boycott of Japanese goods and anti-Japanese resolutions passed at the Democratic Collective Security Congress held at the Manila Theater last night. He believes that it "greatly hinders the existing good relations between Japan and the Philippines, and this resolution is completely contrary to the neutral policy announced by the Philippine President. I do not understand why non-Philippine people support this resolution that contradicts the government's policy." The Mayor of Manila, Posadas, has handed several copies of the Congress's resolution to the City Prosecutor's Office to study whether the resolution violates the Mayor's permit and the status of the Philippines, and then decide whether to initiate public prosecution. According to the Police Department, various anti-Japanese slogans were found on the walls of the Manila Theater. (May 5, Associated Press)

### Chongqing Newspaper Editorial on Financial Plan

(Chongqing) This morning's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily enthusiastically endorsed the new financial plan promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, stating that the three orders issued by the Ministry of Finance regarding the prohibition of luxury goods imports and the control of foreign exchange for exports and imports are all crucial wartime measures. The purpose of this plan is to encourage production and exports, eliminate extravagance, and maintain the foreign exchange market. It hopes that friendly countries will provide China with what it needs more and what it does not need less. (May 5, Reuters)

### Soviet Union Proposes Counter-Proposal to France; Advocates Expanding the Three-Nation Agreement to Five Nations; Expresses Willingness to Accept Guarantees for the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg; But Conditioned on Turkey and Poland Giving the Soviet Union the Same Guarantees

(London) Soviet sources here stated today that the final conclusion of the three-way anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is in sight. (May 5, Reuters)

(Moscow) Responsible parties here have expressed disagreement with overseas reports that the three-way anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has essentially been completed and will soon be signed. Although there is reason to believe that the negotiations have made progress, there is no sign of a resolution to the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. Informed sources generally believe that the recent response from the Soviet Foreign Minister contains several counter-proposals that require further discussion. (May 5, Reuters)

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government submitted a response to the suggestions from Britain and France on the 3rd of this month, the content of which is no less than expanding the scope of the mutual assistance agreement to include Poland and Turkey, becoming a five-nation agreement. The Soviet Union is also willing to accept the guarantee of independence for the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, but only on the condition that Poland and Turkey provide the same guarantee to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet government also proposes that the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented if a country guaranteed by any of the related countries is subjected to aggression or suffers a "threat of aggression." According to informed sources here, the British government will provide a response to the Soviet Union within 48 hours. (May 5, Havas)

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the latest Soviet counter-proposal has two key points. One is that the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented when any country guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression or suffers a threat of aggression. A certain party here recently provided an explanation of the so-called "threat of aggression," believing that Germany used threats against Austria and Czechoslovakia in the past. Although there were no signs of aggression, the actual aggression was undeniable. This type of strategy is well-known to the world, and resolving this point should not be difficult. The second key point is that Poland and Turkey should provide guarantees to the Soviet Union. It is hoped that Turkey will accept this, but Poland may explicitly express disagreement. Therefore, consultations with Poland must take place before a response can be given to the Soviet Union. (May 15, Havas)

(Moscow) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side's response to the new suggestions from Britain and France was personally delivered by Foreign Minister Molotov to the British and French ambassadors yesterday. According to informed sources here, the Soviet government proposed certain counter-proposals in its response, but they were not of a mandatory nature, so negotiations should continue. The focus of the discussion at this point is the following two points: one is the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic coastal countries by Britain and France, and the other is the issue of providing guarantees to Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands by the Soviet Union. Regarding the first point, the Soviet side believes that since mutual assistance measures should be automatically and unconditionally implemented when any country guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression, the same should apply when the guaranteed countries are subjected to a threat of aggression. Regarding the second point, the Soviet side reportedly stated that since the country does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Switzerland and the Netherlands, the discussion of guarantees may be difficult to implement. (May 4, Havas)

(London) A member of the British House of Commons today requested Prime Minister Chamberlain to make a statement regarding the negotiations with the Soviet Union. Chamberlain replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax had received the Soviet response yesterday and was currently considering it with the French government. (May 5, Reuters)

### British Newspaper Commentary

(London) The diplomatic correspondents of various newspapers here commented today on the negotiations for the three-way pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, all stating that there are still many difficulties in the negotiations regarding the expansion of guarantees. Britain has accepted the Soviet request to guarantee the three Baltic countries, but attached the condition that the Soviet Union guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Times stated in its editorial today that it is not appropriate to force any country to join the guarantee system against its will. Since the three major guarantor countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have declared their readiness to undertake mutual assistance obligations, they should immediately sign a mutual assistance treaty. At the same time, Britain and France may use their diplomatic skills to persuade the Baltic countries, for their own best interests, to conclude alliances with the three non-aggressor countries. (May 5, Reuters)

(London) According to the views of some diplomatic correspondents in London, although Britain has agreed to the Soviet request to guarantee Finland, Latvia, and Estonia against aggression, the Soviet Union refuses to guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. This is the latest obstacle to the Moscow negotiations. The Daily Express reported that the British dispatched a note to the Soviet Union last time, stating that Britain could guarantee the Soviet Union's back door neighbors, but the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, in addition to applying to the six countries that Britain and France have already guaranteed, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal, must also extend to the Netherlands and Switzerland. The News Chronicle stated that Britain's argument is that if guarantees are given to countries on one side of the German border, then guarantees must also be given to countries on the other side of the border. Therefore, new obstacles have arisen in the negotiations. The Daily Mail also made this statement, adding that the government is gradually feeling that the Soviet Union intends to delay the negotiations, with the aim of undermining Prime Minister Chamberlain's position. If this is indeed the case, then the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, will make some clear statements. Supporters of the government had eagerly hoped for the early establishment of a British-French-Soviet pact, but now they are becoming tired of this repeated and seemingly endless delay. Some members of the House of Commons now say that this pact could have been issued.

### British Secretary of War and French Foreign Minister Give Speeches; Demonstrating the Resolve of Cooperation Between the Two Countries; Confidence in the Immense Strength of Combined Military Power; Willing to Deal with Provocateurs

(Paris) The Anglo-French Friendship Association held its annual banquet tonight. Those present included British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and many dignitaries from both countries. Secretary of War Hore-Belisha gave a speech at the banquet, first recounting the process of the establishment of the Anglo-French Entente, stating that it was initiated by the late British King Edward VII and the late French President Loubet. "At that time, Edward VII once said that the closer the relationship between Britain and France, the deeper their understanding and friendship, and the more solid the fortress of civilization will be. Looking back now, this statement was indeed prescient. Although our two countries were deeply fraternal during the European War, they were not completely close to each other. When encountering recently occurring events, although the goals of Britain and France were the same in the past, the paths they took were different. France was committed to the creation of an alliance system, while Britain opposed the organization of such a system. In fact, France's policy was based on past experiences to prepare for future needs. After the incidents that have occurred, it can be seen that France's learning from the past is something that we must agree with. Moreover, in the midst of all difficulties, France sought to revive its political finances, never abandoning its freedom and rights, and ultimately succeeded. This is what we admire most. In addition, due to the changes in the world situation, Britain and France, based on a common spirit, have established the same policies and understanding. The two countries are now entering a new historical period together, and the people of both countries are especially able to abide by discipline, endure sacrifices, and face it with great wisdom and courage. Because the goals and policies of the two countries have now converged, the depth and binding force of the Entente are also unprecedented. Moreover, our two countries are now being provoked, the nature of which need not be elaborated. In short, when necessary, we must resolutely and decisively deal with it together. This point should be made known to the world. I still remember that when General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of the French National Defense, recently visited Britain, he visited the parade of our country's army. On the 14th of this month (that is, the French National Day), Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army, will also come to visit the parade of the French army. At that time, there will also be British army units participating. Between Britain and France, there is no longer any military secret. All kinds of intelligence, knowledge, and experience are exchanged as much as possible. In short, the friendship between comrades is as one in life and death." Secretary of War Hore-Belisha then praised the strength of the French army, saying that its training is well-established and unmatched throughout the world. As for the British army, the number of regular troops and auxiliary members can be increased to one million by July 1940 and will continue to increase. Regarding the air force, judging from the current production status of Britain and France, it is certain that they can maintain the most modern and highest quality air force. In addition to this, the two countries also possess valuable assets in spirit, that is, our belief in living standards and human values can also constitute a weapon, which is stronger than steel. In short, our strength is strong and we must always be united."

Foreign Minister Bonnet then stood up and gave a reply, stating briefly that the Anglo-French Entente is very close and there is absolutely no gap for anyone to suspect. The two great nations of Britain and France have been united, and the two great empires have also been cooperating closely. All the interests they possess and the truths they all recognize as obvious and undeniable must be jointly maintained. Britain and France have vast territories and large populations, and their governments have a duty to the independence and dignity of the nations. They must not allow any country or group of countries to carry out their plan to control Europe. In addition, they must jointly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining world peace, so that no nation will live in fear every day, fearing that its borders will be invaded. Regarding this point, we now use our entire strength to back it up, and we are willing to clearly state this purpose. In short, Britain and France are now working together to enhance peace and enable everyone to have security. That's all." He then mentioned the implementation of the conscription system in Britain and concluded by saying, "After Britain and France join forces, what can they do? Or it may not be fully understood by the world. It is important to know that the purpose of our cooperation is to maintain the security of all countries. Knowing that there must be many thorns ahead, but with the deep friendship and strong strength of Britain and France, we are confident that we will be able to overcome it." (May 4, Havas)

### British and French Conduct Military Talks

(Paris) British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha is currently visiting Paris and held a meeting with French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin yesterday, which lasted for a long time. The content of the talks will be officially announced by the government. According to informed sources here, the discussion content is a general nature problem. (May 5, Haitong)

### British King to Visit Brussels This Autumn; The Time Is Late October

(London) Buckingham Palace formally announced that the King and Queen of England have gladly accepted the invitation of the King of Belgium to visit Brussels from October 24th to the 27th of the same month. This is in response to the Belgian King's visit to London in November 1937. (May 5, Reuters)

### The Question of Returning Germany's Former Colonies; British Undersecretary Declares; Denies Four-Power Talks

(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Undersecretary Butler issued a declaration, stating briefly that it has been rumored that the governments of Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan have exchanged views on the issue of returning Germany's former colonies. In fact, there is no such thing. Regarding this issue, French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet successively issued declarations on January 26th and February 7th of this year, expressing their attitudes. The Belgian Prime Minister issued a statement on November 3rd of last year. Only the Japanese government has not been heard to make any statement recently. (May 5, Havas)

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Visits Berlin; Has Important Significance Regarding Politics and Economy

(Berlin) Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov arrived here at 2:30 PM today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and most of the dignitaries were at the station to welcome him. (May 5, Havas)

Sofia: The visit of Prime Minister Koseivanov to Germany has been commented on by various newspapers, which said that the political significance of this trip is still limited, but it is of great significance in terms of economy. Government officials stated that Prime Minister Koseivanov will absolutely not accept restrictions in politics, nor will he sign any agreement, but he will discuss with the German authorities various issues related to the Balkan Peninsula. Generally, the German side will mention Bulgaria's territorial demands (the Dobruja region of Romania and the Thermaic Gulf region of Greece, both of which belonged to Bulgaria before the European War). However, Germany's ambition in the Balkan Peninsula is to control it freely, especially Bulgaria. Therefore, it may not be eager to satisfy Bulgaria's territorial demands. This is also known to the Bulgarian government, so it also takes a restrained attitude towards Germany. In addition, when Prime Minister Koseivanov returns to his country from Berlin, he will pass through the capital of Yugoslavia and will stay for a short time, which shows the close relationship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. (May 5, Havas)

(Paris) Political figures here are commenting on the fact that Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov will visit Italy after visiting Germany, saying that the German and Italian authorities will definitely use all kinds of methods to lure Bulgaria into joining the Berlin-Rome Axis. At this time, the newspapers of these countries have already begun to publicize, in addition to exaggerating the close relations between Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, they are also promoting Bulgaria's territorial demands (the Dobruja region of Romania and the Thermaic Gulf region of Greece, which belonged to Bulgaria before the European War) to an even greater extent than Bulgaria's own wishes. The goal of this propaganda campaign is to resist any initiative from Britain and France in the Balkan Peninsula. As for Bulgaria, although the Balkan Entente countries have repeatedly invited it to participate in the Entente group, the country has not agreed to join because Romania and Greece have refused to accept Bulgaria's territorial demands. Therefore, the propaganda of Germany and Italy is naturally sweet to Bulgaria's ears. Especially after Italy's continuous increase of troops in Albania, the Bulgarian authorities may think that its security is more guaranteed after joining the Berlin-Rome Axis. This did not make France feel uneasy, because the attitude of the Bulgarian authorities has always been mild and cautious. It has a sincere and trustworthy relationship with Yugoslavia and Greece, and has good relations with Romania, so it may not be moved by the propaganda campaign and suddenly change its attitude. In addition, after Prime Minister Koseivanov visits Germany and Italy, the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Mohanov, will travel to London and Paris in a short period of time. It can be seen that Bulgaria will maintain neutrality between the two major groups of democratic countries and autocratic countries, no different from Yugoslavia. (May 4, Havas)

### Difficulties in Forming New Dutch Cabinet; New Envoys to Britain and Switzerland

The Hague: After Dr. Colijn was ordered to form a new cabinet, difficulties have arisen because the Roman Catholic Party refused to join the cabinet. Colijn is scheduled to hold talks with representatives of various parties today in order to resolve the difficulties. Informed sources here believe that Colijn intends to form a so-called national government. (May 5, Haitong)

The Hague: It was announced here last night that the Dutch government has recently appointed Baron Van Tuyll van Serooskerken to be the Dutch Ambassador to Britain, succeeding Count Limburg Stirum. At the same time, Clemens, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been appointed as the Dutch Ambassador to Switzerland. (May 5, Haitong)

### Britain and France Consider Issuing Declaration; Warning Germany Against Actions Regarding Danzig; Urging Attention to Possible Serious Consequences; Polish Ambassador to Britain Returns to Warsaw to Report for Duty

(London) Informed sources here recently stated that after the British cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain will issue a statement in the House of Commons, issuing a clear warning to the German government, urging it to pay attention to the consequences of interfering in the issue of the Free City of Danzig. The wording of this statement is being exchanged between the British and French governments. According to reports, the cabinet members originally considered two approaches: (1) making representations to the German government; (2) issuing a public declaration, warning Germany. Most cabinet members immediately decided to adopt the second approach because the first approach had proven to be a failure during the Czech crisis last September. Foreign Secretary Halifax especially advocated this, believing that the situation has now eased slightly and that an opportunity should be seized to express something, rather than waiting for the situation to become tense again before doing so. (May 4, Havas)

Warsaw: Ambassador Raczy≈Ñski to Britain and Colonel Koc, the chief representative of the Polish financial delegation to London, recently returned to their country. They were both received by President Mo≈õcicki. It is generally expected that Britain will lend Poland a huge sum of 40 million pounds, half in cash and half in the form of armaments. In addition, it is reported that the Polish government will submit a note to the Senate of the Free City of Danzig next week, or even on the 15th of this month, protesting against the various military measures taken by the city recently. (May 4, Havas)

(London) The Polish ambassador to Britain returned to Warsaw by plane yesterday, carrying a document requesting the German side to immediately stop military activities in Danzig. It is reported that the document has been endorsed by the British government and will be delivered to the Danzig authorities today. The British and French governments have given absolute support to the document. According to the Polish side, the Polish government is carefully considering sending an ultimatum to the Danzig Nazi Party authorities, demanding that the Nazi Party stop military preparations in Danzig, on the grounds that this move violates the treaty (according to the treaty, Danzig has become a League of Nations-administered territory protected by Poland). The document will also demand the dissolution of the newly organized Danzig City Defense Force and the removal of the German artillery positions on the Danzig heights. The document will also threaten to enforce the demands by force. In other words, if the request is refused, the Polish side will send troops into Danzig. At the same time, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has returned to London from Berlin to meet with Chamberlain. In addition, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of economic assistance to Poland last night. (May 5, Associated Press)

### Danzig Militarization: External Tensions, Internal Constraints; Danzig Bank Suspends Foreign Debt Payments; Urgent Need for Funds for Military Measures

Warsaw:  The national tension in Poland due to Germany's intimidation and seizure of Danzig has eased somewhat today, as Poland has received repeated assurances of immediate aid from Britain and France, causing the postponement of the Nazi Party's planned coup in Danzig. According to unofficial sources, Polish officials are extremely concerned about the deployment of troops to Danzig to protect the Free City against "Polish intimidation." (Associated Press, 5th)

Danzig:  Nazi Party sources announced last night that Danzig is now making military preparations to "protect itself until German troops arrive from East Prussia" in the event of a European war. One thousand Danzig youths have been conscripted into "police" work. The Nazi Party government has issued an order requiring all residents to perform "important work for the state." Although the order has not yet been implemented, well-informed Nazi Party members claim that "if necessary to speed up defense preparations, we will need laws from books." They explained that defense projects include the construction of barracks and trenches along the Polish border. At the same time, the Danzig Bank has ordered the suspension of payments on principal and interest of Danzig's foreign debt until further notice, a move reportedly intended to maintain Danzig's foreign exchange reserves. (Associated Press, 5th)

Warsaw:  It has been learned that the Danzig Bank has suspended payments on foreign debt starting today (most bondholders are British and American). Foreign observers here claim that the purpose of this move is clearly to raise funds to cover the expenses of various military measures in the Free City of Danzig. In addition, it is reported that the Danzig Free City Advanced Vocational School has already started its vacation early, and all students will have their physical fitness checked by a screening committee in preparation for enlistment in the army. (Havas, 4th)

Warsaw:  Polish affiliated troops are now stationed near Konitz, a town near the German border in the Polish Corridor, where they have established a "summer camp" to provide military and political training. (Haitong, 5th)

Danzig City:  A German Lufthansa plane flying regularly between Berlin, Danzig City, and K√∂nigsberg was fired upon by Polish anti-aircraft artillery yesterday near Sopot on the Polish border, but fortunately it was not hit. (Haitong, 5th)

### Papal Concern: German-Polish Dispute; Desire for Mediation Not Abandoned

Vatican City:  Pope Pius XII, in view of the tense situation in Europe, intends to devote himself to diplomatic talks and has decided to postpone his trip to the Castel Gandolfo summer residence for two weeks. Pope Pius has not abandoned his desire to mediate the international crisis, especially regarding the German-Polish issue. Vatican officials here attach great importance to the lengthy talks that the Papal Nuncio to Poland had with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck before returning to his post. At the same time, the Polish government...

### Roosevelt Delivers Speech: Advocates Preventing War; Arms Embargo Provisions Only Increase the Status of Germany and Italy

Hyde Park, New York: President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters today, on "American Independence Day," advocated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee carefully study the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act. He said, "The goal of the government's foreign policy, in a nutshell, is to prevent war from breaking out in any part of the world. Therefore, any method that can avoid conflict is a good strategy for us. Secretary of State Hull recently spoke out, strongly advocating the repeal of the arms embargo provision of the Neutrality Act, and I strongly agree. For example, after the House of Representatives passed the Vorys Amendment yesterday, retaining the wartime arms embargo provision, the fascist and Nazi countries all expressed their delight. Judging from this, the House of Representatives' vote is actually unfavorable to the European situation and makes the crisis of war even more imminent, and it makes it even more difficult for our country to avoid getting caught up in the vortex of war." At this point in President Roosevelt's speech, a reporter asked whether the government wanted to use the Bloom bill (advocating the repeal of the wartime arms embargo provision) as the basis for Senate discussion. The President replied, "What we are focusing on now is the goal, not other trivial matters. In terms of the wording of the provisions, it may only be necessary to change a number or two to achieve our goal. I plan to confer with Secretary of State Hull tomorrow, but whether I will meet with leaders of all parties in Congress has not yet been decided. In addition, regarding the issue of extending the validity of my authority over currency and finance, I am currently maintaining contact with the Treasury Department. Today, I invited Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to a picnic together, but we did not formally discuss this. I am scheduled to return to Washington tonight before traveling to the Alaskan Peninsula, but I will stay in Hyde Park for a few days in the future." (Havas, 4th)

Hyde Park: According to sources close to President Roosevelt last night, the President is now even more concerned about the possibility of a European war and believes that the US House of Representatives' refusal to abolish the law banning the export of arms actually strengthens the position of Germany and Italy. Diplomatic reports from Europe received by the President have confirmed that Germany and Italy regard the House's move as a sign of the American people's lack of sympathy for the authorities' criticism of dictators. Well-informed sources claim that President Roosevelt believes that the United States will take a very noteworthy peace action, namely, notifying dictatorial countries that once war breaks out, democratic countries such as Britain and France can purchase arms from the United States. (Associated Press, 5th)

### US Treasury Clarifies Monetary Situation

(Washington) It has been learned that the US Treasury Department will issue a document clarifying the monetary situation today, a few hours before the Senate is scheduled to vote on the currency bill. It is widely believed that the document will include an overview of the policy of purchasing foreign silver, in support of the compromise currency bill passed by the House of Representatives on June 30 by a vote of 229 to 160. (Reuters, 5th)

### German Economic Minister Funk Visits Holland

The Hague: German Economic Minister and President of the German Reichsbank, Funk, arrived here today with his wife. Dr. Hosfeld, Secretary-General of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Zhen Linen, Director of Protocol, welcomed him at the Hague Central Station on behalf of the Dutch government. After arriving at the station, Funk first went to a hotel for a short rest, then visited Prime Minister Colijn and Economic Minister Steenbergen. Later, the German Embassy hosted a banquet to welcome Funk, and cabinet ministers and celebrities from all walks of life were invited. Funk will stay here for three days, and the Dutch government will treat him as an honored guest. (Haitong, 5th)

### Key Points of British Trademark Law Amendment: Country of Origin of Imported Goods Must Be Clearly Marked

(London) A bill to amend the current trademark law to ensure that imported goods are clearly marked with their country of origin was introduced in the House of Commons yesterday by Labour MP Edward. After lengthy discussion, it passed its first reading. According to Edward, the fact that goods from Germany, Japan and other countries are only marked with the word "Foreign" makes it impossible for the British to distinguish which country the goods come from when purchasing them. Before the bill was introduced, Labour MP Kirkwood spoke out, saying that it was urgently necessary to have imported goods marked with their country of manufacture, and cited several kinds of woollen clothing and toys imported from Japan as evidence. Secretary of Commerce Stanley replied that he had consulted with all relevant parties on whether to abolish the current practice of allowing imports to be arbitrarily marked with the word "Foreign" or "Empire" to indicate their origin, instead of clearly indicating their country of manufacture. As a result, opinions from all parties differed greatly. However, he and the Minister of Agriculture had decided after consultation that there were sufficient reasons in principle to abolish the arbitrary selection method of allowing the use of "Foreign" or "Empire" to mark the origin of goods, and were currently studying the practical difficulties that merchants here would encounter in changing the method, so as to avoid causing them losses and excessive inconvenience. Labour MP Johnston then stated in a supplementary question that some commercial firms have the same labels for both foreign and imperial products, and allow those who purchase the goods to decide whether to add the words "Foreign" or "Empire." He could provide a can of Japanese salmon as proof, on the label of which there was a blank space for adding the words "Foreign" or "Empire." The Secretary of Commerce would conduct an investigation after evidence was presented. (Reuters, 5th)

### Britain Imports Large Quantities of Japanese Tea: Report in the House of Commons by the Secretary of Commerce

(London) Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today that in the five months from January to May of this year, a total of 2.25 million pounds of Japanese tea were imported, accounting for about 1.5 percent of the total tea imported during the same period. He heard that cheaper Japanese tea was sold for six to seven pence per pound. He also knew that this kind of tea was mixed with imperial tea to be packaged into cheap tea. Stanley also said that he had no right to terminate the import of Japanese tea. Labour MP Swann asked Stanley if he knew that Japanese tea was mixed with Ceylon and Indian tea and sold as imperial tea. Stanley replied that if he received confirmation, he would investigate the matter, but according to his information, this was not the case, and according to the law, this would naturally not be allowed. Stanley replied to a further supplementary question that this kind of tea was not called British tea. (Reuters, 4th)

### Abnormal Phenomenon in British-American Trade: Impact of Reciprocal Trade Agreement; British Goods Shipped to the US Surge

(Washington Airmail) The British-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1 of this year. The initial four months of trade statistics for each country have now been published by the authorities here. It is clear that the export of American goods to Britain has decreased by $32,469,000 compared to the same period last year, while the import of British goods into the United States has increased by $2,004,000 compared to the same period last year, with woollen goods accounting for the largest share. During January to April of last year, a total of 1,876,958 yards of woollen goods were imported, with a value of $1,707,241. During the same period this year, it has increased to 3,803,298 yards, with a value of $2,873,189. American business circles, especially woollen and porcelain merchants, have protested to the State Department in view of this unfavorable situation. Commentators generally say that this abnormal situation is caused by repeated crises in Europe and should not be regarded as a normal situation in line with the British-American trade agreement. However, woollen merchants say that since the industry has suffered in the past, they are deeply concerned that this special situation may become permanent and that measures must be taken to remedy it.

### China Federation of Trade Unions Joins International Federation of Trade Unions

(Zurich, Switzerland) The Executive Committee of the International Federation of Trade Unions met here yesterday to discuss the issue of the China Federation of Trade Unions joining as a member, and immediately unanimously approved it. (The China Federation of Trade Unions has about 500,000 members, mostly workers in the railway, textile, and war industries, located in central China and various occupied areas). At the meeting, Secretary-General Schevenels of the Federation first presented a report on the progress of the consultations, followed by a speech by Chinese representative Zhu Xuefan, who briefly stated that Chinese workers are currently engaged in resistance to the war, and they are very grateful for the solidarity shown by the International Federation of Trade Unions. Chinese workers have wished to join the International Federation of Trade Unions for many years, and are now very pleased to have their wish fulfilled. This matter has important significance in spirit. After the China Federation of Trade Unions joins, the International Federation of Trade Unions will have as many as 24 affiliated trade union organizations. (Havas, 5th)

### Income of Japan's Two Major Financial Groups Increases: Thanks to the War

(Tokyo) The lives of the Japanese people have been greatly affected by the war, but according to statistics from the Tokyo Income Tax Collection Agency, the income of the two major financial groups, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, has increased greatly compared to the past. It is reported that the income tax collected by the Japanese government in Tokyo accounts for about 45 percent of the national total, of which 25 percent is paid by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Within the Tokyo area, the largest amount of tax is paid by Viscount Takakimi Mitsui, totaling 2,874,370 yen (the total amount of income tax in the area is about 200 million yen). According to Japanese newspapers, Viscount Mitsui's income is more than six times that of Prime Minister Kiichir≈ç Hiranuma. In addition, Yataro Iwasaki, Vice President of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha (and Director of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co. and Mitsubishi Bank), is the second-largest taxpayer in Tokyo, paying a total of 2,282,076 yen. Baron Koyata Iwasaki, President of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha (and Director of Mitsubishi Mining Co., Mitsubishi Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co.), ranks third in terms of income tax paid, totaling 1,874,037 yen. As for the other six wealthy people under the two major financial groups, they paid a total of 1.8 million yen in income tax. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Americans Relieve Chinese Refugees

(New York Airmail) Regarding American donations to relieve Chinese refugees, the China Relief Committee of the Churches here announced that the US government and private individuals have donated more than 5 million US dollars. As of the end of last year, about 15 million Chinese refugees have been relieved. The country's "relief agencies are not only limited to providing refugees with food and shelter, but also, under the leadership of the Chinese government, transport refugees to work in factories in the interior, so that they can support themselves." President FairField of the Committee is still appealing to all sectors of society to "contribute generously." (Havas, 5th)

### Americans Set Off Firecrackers on Independence Day

(Washington) According to the US Department of Commerce today, the American people set off Chinese firecrackers worth 500,000 US dollars to celebrate yesterday's American Independence Day. The department also said that although the Japanese invasion of China could affect China's foreign trade, it has nothing to do with the Chinese firecracker industry. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Germany Launches Large-Scale Scrap Iron Collection: Annual Need of 10 Million Tons

(Berlin) The Nazi Party and its affiliated organizations are scheduled to conduct a nationwide "Scrap Iron Collection Movement" in the next three months. Germany currently needs a total of 11 million tons of scrap iron annually, of which 90 percent is collected domestically. The purpose of launching the collection movement this time is to hope that all of it will be collected domestically and that imports of foreign iron will not be needed. Currently, the 10 percent of scrap iron that Germany is lacking is imported from the United States. (Haitong, 5th)

### Britain Seeks to Avoid British-Japanese War: Japanese Propaganda Regarding British-French Talks

Undersecretary of State Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had not yet heard of this propaganda, and that the member might provide the Foreign Secretary with any evidence he had obtained.

### Where Is Spain Going?

‚Äî Translated by Tianfeng, Original by Salvador De Madrlaga, Originally published on April 16, The Sunday Times, London

The author of this article is a well-known Spanish writer and diplomat, whose speculation on the future of his own country is of course more profound than that of foreigners. However, precisely because he is Spanish, he has to be very careful in his wording when writing articles for foreign newspapers discussing the political movements of his country. However, the analysis in this article is exceptionally clear, and its conclusions are also largely correct. ‚ÄîTranslator

The seizure of Albania, the guarantees given to Eastern European countries under the threat of the Axis powers, and the end of the Spanish Civil War have all changed the balance of power in Europe. But to what extent? This depends mostly on Spain's attitude when the next major war breaks out. To avoid errors caused by arbitrariness, emotion, propaganda, and wishes, we should best analyze it with facts.

The first fact is that among the three theoretically possible situations (i.e., joining the British and French side, neutrality, or joining the Axis powers ‚Äî Translator), only two are worth discussing: neutrality or standing on the side of the totalitarian powers. This is a conclusion derived from the following two observations: One is the attitude of certain powers towards Spain during the civil war; and the other is that even in the ideal situation of the last war, the Allied powers could not pull her to their side. Therefore, in analyzing the current situation, the factors unfavorable to joining the totalitarian powers can be regarded as favorable to maintaining neutrality.

Factors Unfavorable to Neutrality

First, the new regime's gratitude to Italy and Germany. This feeling cannot be underestimated, although contrary opinions have been published in London newspapers. Spanish history tells us that the Spanish are very rich in the spirit of "repayment," and this spirit will permeate her foreign policy.

Second, Spain has never suffered from being ruled by Italy, and she has only been ruled by Germany once. However, Britain's control of Gibraltar is the main driving force behind the division of the Spanish peninsula and the Spanish Empire. As for France, she rarely incites due to her relationship with Spain, as the history of Morocco can attest.

The third factor is the maximum power of the new regime (National Syndicalist Movement), which is friendly to Fascist and Nazi countries.

Fourth, the totalitarian powers' military offensive policy will make them demand political prices as a reward for their help during the civil war.

Fifth, the possible temptation of "booty," which can be obtained from the war against Britain and France. In particular, Gibraltar, no Spanish state, royalist, or anyone else believes that it was illegally annexed by Britain; as for Morocco, France is the enemy there.

Sixth, after the end of the civil war military operations, the well-trained victorious army has a desire to occupy. (This refers to the delayed withdrawal of German and Italian troops, most of which have now been withdrawn. ‚ÄîTranslator)

Factors Favorable to Neutrality

On the other hand, the first reason is the strong traditional spirit of neutrality, which arises from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgetting rid of illusions and skepticism. And this spirit has been strengthened and developed by the civil war, except for the most warlike and extreme nationalists.

Second, "peaceful coexistence with Britain" is almost an equally strong tradition. If London's steady policy remains unchanged, this tradition will undoubtedly encourage Spanish neutrality.

Third, there is a general sympathy for Western European countries. Although not limited, it cannot be suppressed, but it is a clear obstacle to the more distant German-Italian alliance.

Fourth, is the general Spanish lack of respect for the Italian language and Italians. Because Spanish and Italian are unusually similar, comparing one writing system to another sounds ridiculous. In addition, the Spanish have a tendency to view Italian affairs as theatrical activities. This factor sounds abstract, but like many unconscious forces, it is unusually important and should not be underestimated.

Fifth is that Spain feels that the help the National Army received during the civil war was not for Spain, but for other reasons. This feeling is bound to develop, because Italy is negotiating the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers like a kind of asset.

There are other reasons. One of them is that Britain and France are important customers in commerce; Spain's trade with Italy is unfavorable because Italy's production and consumption situation is similar to Spain; there are also obvious obstacles to maintaining satisfactory commerce with countries like Germany, because Germany is still struggling under the state of suffering damage.

In addition, there are geographical factors. It is difficult for Italy to form a connected front with Spain; as for Germany, it is simply impossible. Behind the Spanish nationalist movement, there are also the forces of free conservatives and royalist Catholics. They are of course unhappy with the anti-Catholic atmosphere of totalitarianism.

Another important point is the status of Portugal. Portugal is Spain's first friend and is destined to be an ally of Britain. Spain's non-aggression pact with Portugal is equivalent to Spain under the rule of the National Army promising to maintain neutrality to British-linked Portugal.

Finally, the people have deeply felt the pain of war. Every thoughtful Spaniard is convinced that only neutrality can achieve national unity and rebuild Spain.

Conclusion

The above are all facts. We cannot draw decisive conclusions from this, but a few general observations can be determined.

(1) Time helps neutrality. The sooner a major war breaks out, the more difficult it will be for Spain under the rule of the National Army to separate from its allies and maintain neutrality.

(2) The policies of Western European countries towards Spain also have a great relationship. This lies not only in the fact that there should be constructive and firm countermeasures against the Axis countries' disturbances, but also in giving Spain concrete assistance, so as to offset the help given by the Axis countries to the National Army.

(3) So far, all phenomena are unfavorable to neutrality, including the accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact and the delayed departure of Italian troops from Spain.

(4) If Spain were to move in unison with the Axis powers, she would always be a burden rather than a useful asset, whether in terms of strategy or political strategy.

### QingSong Japanese Troops Forcibly Conscript Laborers in Villages to Replenish Military Numbers

Qingpu Correspondence: The Japanese troops along the Qingpu-Shanghai and Qingpu-Songjiang routes have been repeatedly attacked. Although they have repeatedly requested assistance from the Japanese headquarters in Shanghai, they have not been granted it. Previously, Shimada, the captain of the Qingpu garrison, in order to strengthen his defense forces, ordered Japanese troops to join forces with puppet troops to forcibly conscript farmers from villages around the city to replenish their military numbers, in order to achieve their goal of using Chinese to control Chinese. In recent days, more than two hundred people have been forcibly taken away. It is also heard that the Japanese troops in Songjiang are also forcibly conscripting laborers, partly to replenish their military numbers and assist the Japanese troops stationed at various strongholds along the Shangsong Road, and the rest are forced to repair the QingSong Highway, which has been destroyed by guerrillas.

### Kunshan Qiantun Town Japanese Troops Lured and Twenty Killed

Kunshan Correspondence: Qiantun Town in Kunshan is the hometown of Gu Tinglin, a sage of the region. It is a hub of transportation and a prosperous commercial center. Since its fall, it has been in a state of chaos. Local thugs and ruffians have organized puppet maintenance societies. A unit of Japanese troops is also stationed in the town, but because of its weak military strength, it is frequently transferred. On June 28th, the Japanese troops stationed in the town were ordered to transfer elsewhere. After learning of this, the guerrillas sent a team member disguised as a farmer to the puppet district office, falsely claiming that seven or eight bandits in √ó village west of the town were robbing farmers of their property and requesting that the Japanese authorities be asked to send troops to suppress them. The puppet district chief, because the Japanese troops in the town had been transferred, reported this to the Japanese headquarters in Jiaozhi Town, which is adjacent to the town. After receiving the report, the headquarters immediately dispatched twenty Japanese troops to Qiantun. Unexpectedly, after arriving in the town, just as they were questioning the puppet district office, fifty or sixty guerrillas suddenly rushed in from outside and wiped out almost all the Japanese troops in the office. At this time, the puppet district chief was greatly alarmed and immediately opened the back door, so the surviving Japanese troops were able to escape and fled back to Jiaozhi in a panic, reporting the details to the Japanese commander. Upon hearing the report, the Japanese commander was furious and immediately sent a large number of Japanese troops, carrying three machine guns, to Qiantun. When they arrived in the town, the guerrillas had already disappeared. The Japanese troops took their anger out on the puppet district chief and wanted to execute him by shooting, but after repeated pleas for mercy, he was spared because of his meritorious service in opening the door and letting the Japanese troops escape.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Punishes Personnel Involved in the Qihai Incident Chen Caifu and Ding Jutang Removed from Posts, Zhang Yi and Sun Xinfu Also Dismissed but Retained

Xinghua Correspondence: In mid-June of this year, conflicts occurred between the units of Chen Caifu and Ding Jutang, stationed in the Haimen-Qidong area, and the units of Zhang Yi, Sun Xinfu, and Zhang Nengren. Yesterday, the provincial authorities issued an order to punish the responsible personnel involved in this incident, in order to serve as a warning. The details of the incident are as follows:

Cause of the Incident

In April of this year, Chen Caifu's unit was praised by the authorities for luring and killing Japanese troops. In addition to requesting the central government to commend him, Chen was also promoted to the rank of brigadier of the newly organized brigade to encourage him. However, Chen became arrogant and complacent, collecting civilian firearms everywhere to expand his strength. In early June, he forcibly incorporated the Nantong County Regular Army. The officers and soldiers of the various teams, unwilling to be oppressed by Chen, voluntarily left Chen's unit and withdrew to the vicinity of Juegang. Wu Chunke, the special commissioner of the Fourth District, telegraphed the above situation to the provincial government and Chief Commander Li. The authorities issued a telegram ordering a halt and ordered the county police brigade to be handed over to Director Wang of the Department of Civil Affairs for handling, and the regular brigade to be under the jurisdiction of the Nantong County Government, supervised and reorganized by Special Commissioner Wu, in order to maintain the local military and administrative system. As a result, Chen became dissatisfied with Wu and actively plotted revenge. At the same time, the Ao Ziming Regiment of the 5th Regular Brigade, stationed in the Haiqi area, was considered to hinder its strength development. Chen then colluded with Ding Jutang's unit to surround the Ao Regiment, claiming to confiscate their firearms. Later, Chief Commander Li rushed to the scene to reason and strictly forbade it, and the situation was temporarily calmed down.

Course of the Conflict

Seeing that the incident had been resolved, Chief Commander Li returned to his headquarters in the province, and the Ao Regiment also safely moved north. However, Chen and Ding's units were still unable to let go of the previous events. On June 11, Chen's unit divided into two routes and attacked Sanyu Town, Beixing Bridge, and Juegang. At the same time, leaflets jointly signed by Ding and Chen were found everywhere, claiming to sweep away the local government and expel officials at all levels. Ding Jutang's unit also forcibly confiscated the firearms of Cao Chiheng's Regular Brigade of Qidong County. Furthermore, because Zhou Ruqian, the secretary-general of the Qidong County Party Headquarters, was dissatisfied with their actions, he was illegally detained by them and has not been found to this day. Therefore, the sub-district commander Zhang Yi and deputy commander Sun Xinfu led the units of Zhang and Ao to jointly counterattack, and the conflict broke out. Although the authorities had previously received confidential reports from various parties about the various tyrannical acts of Chen and Ding's units, and the news that Chen had been appointed as a puppet army commander by Wang Jingwei, they still hoped to promote their awakening through peaceful means with a spirit of leniency and urgently telegraphed Zhang and Sun's units to make concessions and avoid conflict. However, the two sides had already come into contact, and it was too late to stop them, so there was no way to end the conflict. As a result of the conflict, Ding and Chen's units were completely resolved on the 13th and 14th. Ding and Chen left their units and went elsewhere. Now the local police affairs are being handled by Yan Xiuwu, the regimental commander of Ding's unit, and the magistrates of Haiqi counties.

Separate Punishments

The provincial authorities punished the personnel involved in this incident who were responsible for selling out the country. The telegram order is as follows: "After investigation, Chen Caifu, the brigadier of the newly organized brigade, forcibly incorporated the Nantong County Regular Army, refused to listen to the prohibition, caused disputes, and claimed to sweep away governments at all levels and expel local officials, and attacked north with troops. Ding Jutang, the commander of the Fourth Column, instigated from the middle, causing the incident, and forcibly confiscated the firearms of the Qidong County Regular Brigade and detained the secretary-general of the Qidong County Party Headquarters, all of which were arrogant and illegal. Since Zhang Yi, the deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Area and commander of the Third Sub-area, and Sun Xinfu, the deputy commander, led their troops to pursue and resolve the situation, the serial number of Chen Caifu's newly organized brigade is hereby revoked. Ding Jutang is to be dealt with by Chief Commander Li and reported for verification. His position as commander of the Fourth Column is to be replaced by his deputy commander Yan Xiuwu. However, Zhang Yi, Sun Xinfu, etc., failed to uphold the government's intention of leniency and correct the situation through peaceful means, and without orders, they rashly went deep into Qihai and resolved the situation by force, which is also inappropriate. The post of commander of Zhang Yi is hereby revoked, and the commander of the Third Sub-area is dismissed but retained. The post of deputy commander of Sun Xinfu is hereby revoked, and the brigade commander of the 5th Regular Brigade is dismissed but retained, in order to serve as a warning. The firearms confiscated by the various units are to be reported truthfully and await disposal. In addition to separate orders, you are to forward this to be observed. Han Deqin, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lusu War Zone and Acting Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government."

### Hangzhou Plainclothes Team Destroys Japanese Control of Silk and Silkworms and Burns Down Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant

Hangzhou Correspondence: The silkworm and silk industry in Hangzhou has been completely controlled by the "China Silk Company." All silk factories such as Weicheng, Hangzhou, and Hulin are operated by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Tu Pingzhi, the manager of the Puli Silkworm Farm outside Qingtai Gate, has been cooperating with the Japanese for half a year. The Chinese army has been trying to destroy it for a long time but has not had the opportunity. At around 10 o'clock the night before last, a plainclothes team mixed into the crowd and secretly went to the farm to set fire. The fire lasted for three hours. When the fire was at its height, more than 30 soldiers from the Hirose unit of the Japanese army rushed to the farm and arrested more than ten neighbors, forcibly accusing them of hiding guerrillas. However, the entire farm was burned down, with losses amounting to more than ten thousand yuan. The next night, the Yuanfeng Cocoon Firm, organized by the China Silk Company in Daguan, and the Guanyinqiao China Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant were also attacked by more than twenty plainclothes heroes, carrying wooden-cased guns and Mauser pistols. They rushed in. The puppet police guarding the factory resisted, and the plainclothes heroes killed several puppet policemen on the spot. A puppet patrol leader was captured alive and taken away. The storage warehouse was completely burned down by the plainclothes heroes, with significant losses. After the incident, the Japanese military police, together with the puppet police, launched a search and arrested three villagers, including Pan Xinghu, in Sandun Town, and took them to the puppet police station for strict interrogation.

### Details of the Fall of Dinghai Detestable Traitors Act as Internal Collaborators Japanese Troops Set Fire to Various Towns and Villages

Dinghai Correspondence: Dinghai County is the largest island in the Zhoushan Islands, located in the east of Zhejiang Province. It is separated from Chuanshan in Zhenhai by only a narrow stretch of water to the west, bordering Xiangshan to the southeast. Its eastern Qingbang and Miaozihu islands border Japan. It is an isolated overseas territory and a major producing area of China's fishing and salt industries, administering the four towns of Shenjiamen, Zaicheng, Daitou, and Dazhan, as well as the eighteen townships of Gaoxie, Baiquan, Yancang, and Gan*. The area is vast, with a total population of 420,000. The people are honest and simple, but the island fishermen are relatively tough. Since the new County Magistrate Su Benshan took office, he has led the political work team members to improve politics, recruit sea bandits, and strengthen self-defense forces. In the shortest period of time, Dinghai has shown progress. This time, the sudden landing of Japanese troops in Dinghai, the police team was caught off guard, and the Japanese firepower was fierce, so the outnumbered were no match for the enemy. In a few hours, the county seat was lost, which is extremely painful. The details of the process are recorded as follows:

Landing Situation

Dinghai is an important producing area of fisheries and salt, and the Japanese have long coveted it. However, in the past, because Dinghai had no major military value, and it was known that the Chinese side had considerable troops stationed there, it did not dare to occupy it. Recently, because the Japanese urgently wanted to attack Ningbo and Zhenhai, they occupied Dinghai as a base. On the one hand, after Daishan was occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese dare-to-die teams often crossed the sea to attack. The traitors in Daishan, etc., then flattered the Japanese, strongly stating the importance of Dinghai. In order to consolidate Daishan, it was necessary to occupy Dinghai County first. Therefore, the Japanese army seized Dinghai at around 3:00 a.m. on June 23. On the one hand, they landed at Luotou, Yancang, about ten li from the western corner of the city, and on the other hand, they landed near Tianluozhi, passing through Xiao Xi Gen from the west and entering the city from the east gate. At the same time, two Japanese warships were anchored in the Mazhi waters opposite Shenjiamen, and they also landed at Duntou, about five or six li west of Shenzhen, on the morning of the 23rd. On the one hand, small Japanese warships were used to bombard Gan* Township, about thirty li from the city, in the Xiushan waters north of the county seat, in order to disrupt the rear. On the one hand, two Japanese warships were anchored at Wu Kui Mountain in Chongtou, using artillery to bombard the city to cover the landing of Japanese soldiers. In total, the Japanese army landed at three locations and harassed at two locations. The number of troops on the three routes was about 1,000. Because they had traitors to guide them, they were familiar with the route. Moreover, when they landed, the traitors in the city set off firecrackers in the urban area as a signal. On the one hand, they used the "Great Japan" flag to hang over the four cities to confuse the military's morale. Therefore, the fall of Dinghai was actually due to the traitors.

Fierce Fighting Situation

When the Japanese army landed in Yancang, because they were all wearing grass-green uniforms and steel helmets, they looked exactly like the Chinese self-defense forces, so the residents were ignorant. Later, when they saw them sweeping with machine guns, they realized that they were Japanese soldiers. The First Battalion of the Sixth District National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force stationed at Xiaofeng Ridge heard the news and was led by Battalion Commander Jiang Shilin, Yang Kaizu, and Company Commander Song Shengji to fight bravely. After an hour of fierce fighting, they were forced to retreat safely due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire. The Japanese army then rushed into the west city. County Magistrate Su received the report and personally led his troops to street fighting in the city. The fierce fighting was the most intense in front of the North Gate Police Station. Later, the Chinese army retreated to the northern suburbs, where Zhang Fucheng, the battalion commander of the Dinghai County Self-Defense Force, led the Hunanese heroes to fight bravely. Battalion Commander Zhang had previously served as a major general and guerrilla commander in the Red Army and had rich combat experience. Therefore, he took the lead and fought bravely under heavy fire for several hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. As for the Shenjiamen area, after the Japanese soldiers landed at Duntou, they passed through Xichengtang and Baihu Mountain. The Shenzhen Self-Defense Force stationed there immediately launched a battle. Although the team was composed of gentry and elite, and all were obligated, their morale was no less than that of regular troops. Therefore, both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. At that time, the Chinese naval police force was also led by Captain Wang Pinyuan to resist, and they fought each other for several hours. Because they were outnumbered, they retreated to Dazhan Luomen, crossed the sea to Shipu, waited for reinforcements, and counterattacked. On the evening of the 23rd, County Magistrate Su, along with Ding Songsheng, the chief staff officer of the county headquarters, and Battalion Commander Zhang, planned a counterattack in Fanhe. On the one hand, they also mobilized the Xiushan Township Self-Defense Force. At that time, Li Xuefan, a prominent figure in the township, gathered the brave young men of the township and sent them to Sanjiang to defend against the enemy. At 12 o'clock in the evening, Battalion Commander Zhang led his troops across Fanhe Ridge again to counterattack the northern city. The Chinese side used hand grenades to bombard the Japanese positions. Seeing the Chinese army's night attack, the Japanese soldiers responded in a panic, using machine guns to sweep aimlessly. Later, because the city gate was solid and the firepower was fierce, the Chinese army returned to its original position safely. Seeing that the Chinese army often launched surprise attacks, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. Therefore, they built fortifications near the four cities and installed artillery positions to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking.

Martyrdom

When the Japanese army forcibly landed in Dinghai, the Chinese soldiers and civilians gave them a head-on blow. Many people heroically sacrificed themselves. According to reports, about seven or eight members of the 6th District Anti-Japanese Guard Team were killed or injured, and thirty or forty members of the County Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force were killed or injured. Battalion Adjutant Zhou Xinbao also died at the same time. Four or five trainees from the cadre training class died. Ye Menglin, the deputy captain of Weitou Town, was the eldest son of Ye Baochang, the head of Dasha Township. He was brave and good at fighting. This time, he unfortunately died in battle in the eastern suburbs. There was also Gao Liangcai, a member of the political work team, who was ordered by the county magistrate to inquire about the Japanese situation. When his bicycle reached the northern suburbs, he learned that the Japanese army had occupied the northern city. Therefore, the Japanese army shot Gao with machine guns, and he was wounded in his left arm by bullets, almost fainting. Later, he was carried to a rural hospital by the rescue team. It was also heard that many students of Zhoushan Middle School and members of the propaganda work team suffered because they did not have time to escape. On the civilian side, although they had been evacuated to the suburbs before the incident, only a few were able to do so, so about sixty or seventy people were killed or injured. It was heard that Xu Wencai, the owner of the Wu Kang rice shop on Beida Street, was shot and killed by the Japanese army when he returned to the store to get rice. Also, when the Chinese army retreated to Jintang Island to cross the sea to Yong, they encountered a Japanese warship and were bombarded and densely swept with heavy machine guns. As a result, about seventy members of the Independent Company of the Third District Self-Defense Force were sunk along with the ship. Luo, the captain of the Xiushan Township Self-Defense Force, and the team members Tong Xincai, Chen Quanzhang, and A Dong and others died heroically. Li Xuefan, a prominent figure in the township, generously donated money to comfort their families in order to appease the loyal souls, seeing that the team members were loyal and commendable. County Magistrate Su presented a request to Chairman Huang to provide condolences and issue commendations to the officers and soldiers who died in this battle.

Crossing the Sea to Seek Assistance

When the Japanese army attacked the city at dawn on the 23rd, County Magistrate Su led his troops to resist. Later, because he was isolated and without assistance, he retreated to the Changchun Ridge area of Xuhe at around 9:00 a.m. The city of Dinghai was completely lost at around 10:00 a.m. that day. The next morning, County Magistrate Su, seeing that he was outnumbered and without assistance, led his subordinates across Cengang, crossed the sea to Cezi Island, and then secretly crossed to Chuanshan, went to Yongzhuan Jin, and personally reported the incident to Chairman Huang and requested assistance to counterattack. Therefore, the Dinghai army has now safely withdrawn, leaving only a small number of self-defense corps in the countryside to maintain law and order. The most shameful thing is that Deputy Commander Luo Chidi, when the Japanese army bombarded the city, ignored the local area and first went to Zhoushan Middle School to accompany Fan Yawei, a female teacher of the school and a graduate of Beijing Women's Normal University, and fled to Xiaosha, and extorted more than 600 yuan locally before escaping across the sea. There was also Li Chongxian, the commander of the Independent Company of the Third District Self-Defense Force, who led his troops to Cezi Island and solicited thousands of yuan from the locals, ostensibly to replenish military pay, but in reality, to fill his own pockets. These officials who are greedy for life, afraid of death, extort, and extort, and cannot coexist with the city, should be severely punished.

Japanese Search

When the Japanese army occupied Dinghai, they distributed leaflets by plane, with extremely absurd wording. The leaflets were printed in color lead and were issued in two issues. As for the actions of the Japanese soldiers, they first set fire to the Dongyue Temple and the Puji Temple in the northern suburbs, and searched people's homes. When inspecting, they would tease women and forcibly occupy Wang Chuansun's residence under the Dayu Bridge in the East Gate as the Japanese headquarters, and Zhao's foreign house in the eastern suburbs as the naval headquarters. They also stationed troops in Pan Shanglin's house at Guanyin Bridge in the South Gate, forcibly occupied Zhoushan Primary and Secondary Schools, which were run by the American Baptist Church, stationed the commander-in-chief in Zhoushan Primary School in the North Gate, and stationed Japanese soldiers in Zhoushan Middle School in the West Gate. Every night, they would drag women to the commander's office and release them the next morning, sending some sashimi as a souvenir. They also recruited strong men to build fortifications. After the work, they would send rings or bracelets as a temptation. However, after the strong men were released, they would be taken away by the Japanese soldiers when they passed by other places. Hundreds of young people were captured and imprisoned in the Gan Dasheng Temple in the North Gate, without food or drink, and left to starve. More than 100 young women were imprisoned in the Dongguan Temple in the East Gate, with two meals a day, and arbitrarily ravaged. Recently, they have also put forward conditions to the puppet maintenance society, saying that (1) 40 strong men should be drawn from each guarantee to be used, and (2) about 600 Japanese soldiers should be stationed in Dinghai, and it should be guaranteed that not one should be missing. Therefore, the ugly groups are already very embarrassed. As for the Shenjiamen area, the atrocities of the Japanese are even more terrifying. They set fire to the County Chamber of Commerce, the Town Office, and the former residence of Mr. Liu Jiting, and burned down the Gongdun, Tianhou Palace, Dongyue Palace, People's Education Center, and Shen Police Station. For a time, the fire soared into the sky, the whole city was red, and the flames were flying, and it was extinguished after burning for more than a day. On the 24th, the Japanese army, guided by traitors, searched the villages. Dinghai has many high mountains and steep ridges, and guerrilla warfare can be launched, but because the army has completely withdrawn, even remote areas have the traces of the Japanese, and the traitors who work for the tigers are even bolder. They first went to Fanhe to search, and then went to Gaoxie to search. When they arrived at Baihe Temple, because it stored food such as agar and was also the township office, it was set on fire. Gaoxie is very close to Baiquan, but the Japanese soldiers searched to Shujia before returning to the city. Therefore, Rizquan, Gan*, Ma'ao, Beichan, Ziewei, and other townships have not yet been searched. On the 27th, they went over Changchun Ridge, Lancaoling, Xiaoshuling, Dashuling, and Xiaosha to search, checking house by house, and stationed troops in the Great Temple. They also ordered the township to hand over Yue Shuyou, the director of the Third District, Le Zhiyun, the head of the township, and the gentry Chen Ziping for use as puppets. However, the three had already escaped without a trace, so the Japanese were very disappointed. The next day, they went to Cengang to search, and then went to remote areas such as Zikuo, Wuqiu, Zhangci, and Dingzi to search. After the inspection, they took a boat to Daitou and returned to the city. The Japanese troops in Shenjiamen heard that they had recently searched Dazhan and other townships.

Puppet Lineup

Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, the shameless ruffians in the city have taken advantage of the fire to rob and flattered the Japanese, acting as accomplices. Now the puppetÊ≤ªÂÆâÁª¥ÊåÅ‰ºö has been organized, and the chairman is Ding Ziheng, the first county magistrate of Dinghai. The other important figures in the society are said to be Fang Dongyuan, the principal of Zhoushan Middle School, Chen Dehong, the pastor of Zhen God Church, the gentry Chen Er, the leader of the fundraising team Shen Kunquan, the director of the Food Company Hong Qiliang, and Dai Yuanzhang of Guoxi. However, it is said that Ding Ziheng was forced to take office because he was old and unable to escape. Chen Ermei and Shen Kunquan are wealthy gentry in the county, and they were forced to take office to protect their family property. As for Fang Tongyuan, he reluctantly served the enemy to preserve the property of Zhoushan Middle School. Pastor Chen stayed in Dinghai because he wanted to help the refugees and was forced to take office. The puppet chairmen are usually enthusiastic and upright people, and although they were forced to take puppet positions this time, they want to put the local area first and will not prey on the people. Now that security has been restored, residents can enter the city, but they must have a pass. It is heard that He Chuicang is the one who issues passes for the maintenance association in the North City, and a certain national doctor in the South City. Therefore, residents are now returning to the city one after another, living a tragic life under the iron hooves of the Japanese.

Xiushan is in Danger

Lanxiu Township, which belongs to the county, is a large island in the county and is located in the middle of Dinghai and Daishan. The current situation is critical. Most of the people in the township are doing business in Shanghai, transporting fish products and yellow sand to Shanghai for sale. Ships often travel between Xiushan and Shanghai. Recently, because Daishan and Dinghai have fallen one after another, the situation has suddenly turned critical. Moreover, the self-defense force of the township has been transferred to Dinghai to fight, and the defense is empty. Therefore, the township leader Tong Xinli often meets with Li Xuefan, Lin Liangkun, and political work team members Chen Nanchi, Jin Banghua, and Gui Weiyi and others to collect more than 100 civilian firearms, gather the young men of the township, and organize guerrillas to resist Japan and defend themselves. Every night, they set up sentry posts at Lishan Seaport and other places, and when they encountered a boat, they fired a gun and ordered them to lower the sails for strict inspection. Therefore, Xiushan now has a very strong self-defense force. Recently, it is said that the Daishan puppet maintenance society sent a letter to the Xiushan Township Office, inviting Township Head Tong to go to Daishan. The intention seems to be to occupy Xiushan by political means. If he does not go, the Japanese army will use force to attack Xiushan. When Tong received the news, he convened a joint guarantee meeting at the Suxuan Temple in Beipu to discuss how to deal with the situation. At that time, the people were very afraid of Japan and advised Tong to go to Daishan to negotiate, and bought white cloth from the cloth shop to make the sun flag, which was hung in front of the door. They also raised funds to make a large Japanese flag, which was hung in front of the coast as the main flag, in order to ensure peace. They also said, "The Japanese will come to play a show tomorrow, and we will all go to the pier to welcome them." These foolish people made such heartbreaking and crazy remarks, which is extremely regrettable. Tong and the young men of Haiao, Wu Tongcai, Li Jiafan, etc., immediately stopped them. Tong said enthusiastically at the meeting, "I will never go to Daishan and do something for the tiger. If the Japanese army invades, I will only lead the guerrillas and fight to the death. As for the houses and property in my family, I will not hesitate to have them burned by artillery fire. At this time, when the enemy is threatening us, as a person in charge of the local area, I only know how to be loyal and die in office, and to coexist and die with the hometown, and I can no longer care about my family." The feelings were tragic and moved the hearts of the people, who praised him endlessly. Now that Dinghai has fallen, the important producing area of fish and salt has been trampled on by others, and the 420,000 people are also in a dark hell. Although Dinghai, at the time of the Treaty of Nanjing, the United Kingdom said that Dinghai should not be invaded by any country, otherwise, it should be protected by the United Kingdom, but Dinghai has now fallen, and the United Kingdom is silent. Therefore, the local people should wake up quickly, do not rely on others, and should be self-reliant.

### The Chinese Army Besieges Yixing: Japanese Captain Wounded by Bullet

Changzhou Dispatch: For the past ten days, the Chinese army has counterattacked Yixing, creating a siege. The Japanese army requested reinforcements from Suzhou and Changzhou. However, the Japanese forces stationed in Suzhou and Changzhou were insufficient to spare any. They resorted to conscripting men from various counties and mixing them with puppet police. At the end of last month, they headed to Yicheng to fight against the Chinese army. The Chinese army, with its tens of thousands of troops and leveraging excellent terrain, still managed to repel the Japanese. Among the Japanese forces, the captain of the Changzhou Garrison, Honjo, was hit in a vital area and severely wounded. He has been sent to the Japanese military hospital in Suzhou for treatment. The Japanese army suffered widespread casualties and retreated towards Heqiao.

### The Two Concession Authorities Adopt Strict Precautions Again: Obstacles Prepared on Several Roads, Troops from Various Countries and Trade Corps to Patrol

According to the English-language *China Press*, the entrances of several police stations in the International Settlement have been closed since 6:00 PM yesterday (the 4th) until 6:00 AM this morning. This is part of the second anniversary precautions for the Sino-Japanese War currently being taken. The general arrangements for July 7th are the same as the precautions taken in recent months in anticipation of disturbances. Obstacles will be placed on several roads. Search teams will conduct inspections in certain locations. US Marines, British troops, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps White Russian detachment, and French troops will patrol the streets. The armored vehicle unit of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will also be dispatched for patrol. The remaining units of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will be fully armed and gather at assembly points, ready to move out upon notice. Special police will assist regular police as usual. Japanese Marines north of the Suzhou Creek have already implemented precautions and are conducting extensive searches of pedestrians.

Joint Precautions

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council, in commemoration of the "July 7th" Marco Polo Bridge Incident in North China, have ordered all police stations to step up precautions in advance to prevent trouble. The necessary precautionary measures to be implemented have been jointly agreed upon by the two authorities. In addition to the full mobilization of police and security personnel in their respective jurisdictions, all British, American, French, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai, as well as members of the Chinese detachment and White Russian detachment of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, etc., will be armed tonight to undertake security duties.

Prohibition of Assemblies

During the "July 7th" anniversary period, the authorities will strictly prevent all gatherings, parades, and speeches. They will also prohibit ordinary commercial banquets or meetings. Anyone found to be holding private gatherings will be severely punished. At the same time, the standing committees of the two concessions began yesterday morning to search roads, alleys, residences, shops, hotels, and public places in large buildings such as amusement parks, teahouses, and dance halls. Plainclothes detectives have been stationed there on a permanent basis to monitor movements and report any suspicious activity. All Chinese and Western detectives are dispatched early to inspect pedestrians on the roads. Armored vehicles on the French Concession side have been patrolling the roads since yesterday.

Blocking Roads

The procedures for blocking secondary roads at the junctions of the two concessions have been prepared and will be decided based on intelligence received tonight. However, the precautions in the Shanghai West extra-settlement roads area are even more thorough. During this "July 7th" memorial, residents are not allowed to cool off or sleep in the open along the roads, otherwise, they will be detained. The curfew time remains 12:30 AM and will not be moved forward.

Japanese Side Precautions

Tomorrow, "July 7th," marks the second anniversary of the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident. The authorities of the two concessions in this city are afraid of unfortunate events, so they have prohibited all gatherings for four or five days. Because the anniversaries of "July 7th," "August 13th," and "September 18th" are approaching, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai fear that patriotic individuals will take action during this period. In addition to intensifying the search of all water and land traffic and imposing blockades, since the day before yesterday, they have added obstacles such as barbed wire to various bridges in the Hongkou district, such as Sika Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Xin Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Lihong Bridge, Outer Hong Bridge, Oujia Road, etc., and increased guard posts. Armed Japanese soldiers and plainclothes puppet detectives are patrolling and searching various roads separately. They are being particularly strict in inspecting "passes." At the same time, puppet police squads are patrolling the Caojiadu area. Pudong and Nanshi have also stepped up precautions. The extent of their fear can be seen from this.

### Russian Workers at Lun Chang Factory Poisoned: Food Poisoning Suspected, Expected to Recover Soon

According to the *North China Daily News*, yesterday (the 4th), an official from the British Consulate told reporters that of the thirty Russians employed by Lun Chang Printing and Weaving Company some time ago to replace striking Chinese workers at the Lun Chang factory in Pudong, twenty had been poisoned. However, after Dr. ÂÖãËêäÂÖã examined all the poisoned workers, he discovered that they had suffered from food poisoning, and there was no suspicion of poisoning by evildoers. It is reported that twelve of the poisoned workers are in serious condition.

Serious Condition

However, according to information learned last night, none of them are in critical condition, and they are expected to recover soon. It is believed that they all ate together in the factory, or ate some poisonous food on Sunday. These Russians were hired after a serious strike by Chinese workers in the factory's power room and the injury of a British employee of the factory.

Result of the Strike

A team of British sailors landed, and was then relieved by British soldiers from the West Fokine Heights team. Subsequently, Japanese Marine soldiers from Pudong took over the defense. Today, the property is still defended by Japanese Marines.

### Foreign Ships Still Plan to Resume Navigation on Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Since traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Dinghai, and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes was successively disrupted, all foreign ships operating between Shanghai and Zhejiang have been completely suspended. All ships are docked in the Huangpu River, suffering considerable losses. According to reliable information obtained by a *Daguang News Agency* reporter from the shipping industry, foreign shipping companies such as Zhongyi, Taikoo, and Lihe are now meeting to discuss resuming the Shanghai-Ningbo route in order to maintain Shanghai-Ningbo traffic and shipping business. They will dispatch ships such as Deping, Moufu, and New Beijing to operate the route. When each ship arrives in Ningbo, it will anchor outside the Zhenhai estuary, and passengers and cargo will be transferred by barges. It is reported that they have telegraphed the Ningbo authorities requesting approval. If approval is granted, the ships will begin operating on a sequential schedule.

### British Gunboat Departs Shanghai Today: To Sail Below the Yangtze River Water Barrier for Relief

According to the English-language *China Press*, the British gunboat HMS Gnat is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow (the 6th) and sail below the Yangtze River water barrier to relieve the British warship HMS Mosquito. HMS Mosquito is scheduled to sail back to Shanghai.

### To Alleviate the Copper Coin Shortage Panic: Fractional Currency Notes to Be Issued, Ministry of Finance Requests Central Bank to Investigate and Consider the Needs of the Shanghai Market, Approve the Printing of One- and Five-Fen Fractional Currency Notes

Since copper coins disappeared from the city, although stamps have been temporarily used as substitutes, they are very inconvenient to accept. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believed that this was affecting the operations of various industries and the livelihoods of ordinary people. It previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt relief. According to a *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed again urging the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram stating that it will print fractional currency notes. The two telegrams are recorded below:

Chamber of Commerce Telegram

Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance, Chongqing: The disappearance of copper coins in the Shanghai market has made it difficult to make change. The temporary use of stamps as substitutes is only an expedient measure and is very inconvenient. We telegraphed on June [day omitted] requesting relief, but have not yet received a reply. The Shanghai market is anxiously awaiting. Please promptly find a solution, or immediately issue one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes to facilitate circulation. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows in support.

Ministry of Finance Telegram

Your telegram received. The Ministry has telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and consider the needs of the Shanghai market for the serious shortage of copper coins in Shanghai, approve the amount of one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes to be printed, and ordered their issuance. It is also finding ways to transport one-jiao and two-jiao fractional currency notes for relief. Informing you accordingly. Ministry of Finance, remittance from Chongqing, imprint.

### Foreign Exchange Only Provided for Essential Goods: Luxury Goods Banned from Import, Shift to Purchasing Essential Materials for the War of Resistance, Trade with Europe and America Not Affected, Strict Restrictions on Foreign Exchange in Shanghai's Black Market

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations on banning the import of luxury and non-essential goods, promoting the export of domestic goods, collecting the foreign exchange rate difference, and applying for foreign exchange for essential goods, the import of non-essential goods will inevitably decrease sharply, reducing the overall trade deficit and balancing international payments. However, this will not affect the overall trade of European and American countries with China. The supply of foreign exchange for essential goods will be provided without restriction by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The supply of foreign exchange in the black market will be strictly restricted to prevent it from becoming more rampant. The details are recorded below:

Bank of China and Bank of Communications Handling Applications for Sale

After the new regulations on applying for foreign exchange were announced, a *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter yesterday inquired separately at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. (1) The Central Bank continues to announce the legal price daily as before, but the handling of foreign exchange applications has been ordered to cease. From now on, the handling of foreign exchange applications for essential goods and the sale of foreign exchange for the export of domestic goods will be handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (2) The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have not yet received orders from the Ministry of Finance and the head office and will comply after receiving orders. They are unwilling to express any opinions before receiving orders. (3) According to sources at foreign banks, Shanghai is a special place, and the implementation of the import ban may have problems. It is reported that the Equalization Committee will strictly restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market.

Preventing Huge Amounts of Foreign Exchange from Leaking

Regarding luxury goods: (1) Cosmetics: A. Snow powder and snow cream, B. Tooth powder and toothpaste, C. Perfume and rouge, D. Various cosmetics and appliances; (2) Clothing: A. Lace, B. Real and imitation jewelry, C. Valuable wool products, D. Silk products; (3) Food and Beverages: A. Cigarettes and cigars, B. Tobacco leaves, C. Various alcoholic beverages, D. Soda, E. Various candies, F. Biscuits, G. Fresh and dried fruits, H. Sea cucumbers, I. Shark fins, J. Bird's nests. In addition, non-essential goods such as paper, bamboo, wood, wool goods, cotton goods, rattan ware, and stone products are estimated to be worth over 230 million national currency based on the import amount in 1938.

Difficult to Import Non-Essential Goods

The customs offices in the occupied areas are beyond the reach of the government's authority, resulting in an increase in the trade deficit and making it difficult to eliminate. Taking the Shanghai Jianghai Customs as an example, the trade deficit was 9,356,000 yuan in January this year, 5,529,000 yuan in February, 33,092,000 yuan in March, 24,737,000 yuan in April, and 38,671,000 yuan in May, setting a new record for the trade deficit after the war. The imported goods are mostly luxury and non-essential goods. From now on, the import of these luxury and non-essential goods will inevitably decrease.

Providing Foreign Exchange, Restricting the Black Market

A *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that although the Ministry of Finance's measures to prohibit the import of goods have been ordered to be implemented by the Customs, the implementation in the Shanghai Customs and other customs offices in the occupied areas is, in fact, difficult. These customs offices have been seized by the Japanese. If the tax revenue is intercepted and forced to change flags, although the government has issued a ban, it is still impossible to prevent them from being imported through the occupied customs offices. However, after the promulgation of the regulations on applying for foreign exchange, these prohibited goods will inevitably not be able to obtain foreign exchange. Therefore, it is expected that after the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications implement the listing of prices and supply foreign exchange for essential goods, HSBC may restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market.

Not Affecting Trade with Various Countries

The Chinese government will transfer the foreign exchange used to import non-essential and luxury goods to purchase essential materials for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, China is only changing the use of foreign exchange, and the various countries are only converting the goods they import. Therefore, the trade of various countries with China will not be affected in any way. It is reported that European and American countries have expressed full understanding of China's necessary measures. However, the import of Japanese goods into China will certainly suffer a great impact. Its position as number one will inevitably decline because it will be impossible for Japanese goods to buy foreign exchange in the black market in the future.

Paying for Imports, Receiving for Exports

The Central Bank's decision on foreign exchange rates has always been handled in accordance with the original policy, namely, one shilling and two and a half pence for British exchange and thirty US dollars for American exchange. However, the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is seven pence for British exchange and 13.625 yuan for American exchange. It is also stipulated that a foreign exchange difference must be paid for applying for foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, and a foreign exchange difference can be received for the sale of foreign exchange for the export of domestic goods in order to ensure uniformity and fairness. The so-called foreign exchange difference refers to the difference between the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and the legal price announced by the Central Bank.

### Detailed Measures Planned, Remittance Certificates to Be Issued, Evaluation Committee Members Hired Separately, Remittance Deposits Transferred by Three Banks

After the implementation of the new remittance system by the silver and money industry to regulate the Shanghai market, the remittances obtained by each bank and firm from the Bank Clearing House have been circulating in the market. The Clearing House announces the discount rate for remittances daily and hires experts to serve as evaluation committee members and establishes a preparation inspection committee. The details are recorded below:

Clearing House to Issue Remittance Certificates

After each bank and firm provides property as security and obtains interbank remittances from the Bank Clearing Committee, the Committee will issue remittance checkbooks, which each bank and firm will fill out and circulate in the market. However, it is stipulated that it shall not exceed 70% of the appraised value of the collateral. The total amount has been tentatively set at 50 million yuan. At the same time, in order to facilitate the acceptance and delivery of interbank remittances, the Committee will issue remittance certificates. Detailed measures have been planned and will be implemented after being submitted to the committee for approval. In addition, the types, amounts, and issuance regulations of the remittance certificates will be formulated.

Hiring Evaluators, Forming Inspection Committee

In order to assess the value of the collateral provided by each bank and firm, the Committee has decided to establish a real estate group, a securities and stock group, and a goods group evaluation committee. It has decided to hire experts to serve as members. It is reported that the real estate group will hire managers from China Business Corporation and Yeguang Real Estate Company, etc. The securities and stock group will hire tai-pans from Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms. The goods group will hire leaders from various industries. Regarding the Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, the Silver and Money Industry Association, and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have been requested to nominate one representative each to form the committee. It will be established as soon as the candidates are determined.

Announcing Interbank Remittance Discount Rate

A *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter learned from the Bank Clearing Committee yesterday that the Committee will announce the interbank remittance discount rate daily in accordance with Article 14 of the Interbank Remittance Acceptance Regulations. Yesterday, it was 2.5 jiao per thousand yuan per day. In addition, regarding the remittance deposits of each bank and firm in the Bank Clearing House and the Money Industry Clearinghouse, after the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications transferred the legal tender in twelve weeks, totaling approximately 22 million yuan, the first week's 1.8 million yuan has been settled by the three banks and handed over to the Clearinghouse of the Silver and Money Industries for inclusion in the current accounts of each bank and firm, which are allowed to be withdrawn by each bank and firm at any time.

### Turnover Tax in June Less Than One Million: Reason Being Declining Shipping, Favorable to Blocking Loopholes

According to customs sources, the turnover tax collected by Jianghai Customs sharply decreased in June, only two-thirds of that in March and April, and was less than one million yuan. The reasons are: (1) The Shanghai-Fujian coast was repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships and aircraft, and shipping declined. (2) The Shanghai-Dinghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou-Fuzhou money order routes were suspended due to military relations, and passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was in a state of stagnation. (3) The Japanese army landed in Shantou, and Shanghai-Shantou shipping was disrupted. (4) The Tianjin concession was blockaded, and passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Tianjin encountered difficulties. (5) Ports such as Beisha, Haimen, and Qidong were repeatedly harassed by Japanese motorboats, and some port routes were suspended, resulting in a sharp decline in passenger and cargo transportation. (6) The situation in the inner ports was unstable, the number of routes decreased, and passenger and cargo traffic was weak. (7) Inland river shipping did not improve.

### Polish Minister Contracts Appendicitis, Undergoes Surgery

According to the French-language *Journal de Shanghai* on the 5th, the Polish Minister to China, Witold Woyda, suddenly suffered from acute appendicitis yesterday and was admitted to the Country Hospital for surgery. It is reported that he is recovering well and will soon be able to recover.

### Foreign Ships Blocked from Entering Shantou: British Strongly Protest, British Navy Escorts But Japan Still Obstructs Entry, Yusheng and Other Ships Still Regularly Serve Bay and Shantou

The traffic between Shanghai and Shantou is maintained by the best efforts of British firms Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, and the ships on the Hong Kong-bound line serve Bay and Shantou regularly to facilitate the passenger and cargo traffic. They have merely been obstructed from time to time by the Japanese warships, so the British naval authorities have sent warships to provide protection, but ships are still obstructed from entry. All passengers and cargo bound for Shantou are transshipped from the ships by lighters at the port, a process involving a good deal of trouble. The British have made a strong protest to the Japanese again, asking the British ships to be allowed to sail directly into the harbor and berth at the docks, and not to be obstructed without reason. The Yusheng ship has sailed yesterday. The Qiongzhou and Hesheng ships are leaving on the 8th, and the Suzhou and Taiyuan ships, etc. are scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 11th, and all will still serve Bay and Shantou.

### Import and Export Trade Increases Sharply, Creating New Record Since the War: Trade Deficit in May over Ninety Million, Japan Still Number One in Imported Goods, Trade Deficit Increases in Shanghai and Tianjin Customs

The Customs has released the national foreign trade figures for May of the 18th year of the Republic: the value of imported foreign goods was 174,127,024 yuan in national currency; the value of exported domestic goods was 83,541,327 yuan in national currency; the total value of imported and exported goods was 257,668,351 yuan; and the trade deficit was 90,585,697 yuan, creating a new record in trade since the war.

### Ministry of Finance Consistently Maintains Creditworthiness: Securities in the Black Market Rebound, Uniformity Already in Place, Payment at the End of July, Recovery Fund and Long-Term Financial Bonds Have Been Regularly Drawn for Principal Repayment

Since the Chongqing telegram stated that the uniform government bonds guaranteed by tariffs had suspended payment of principal and interest, the uniform bonds in the Shanghai securities black market plummeted. Now, because the Ministry of Finance's policy of maintaining creditworthiness remains unchanged, and arrangements have been made for the repayment of principal and interest of the uniform government bonds due at the end of July, and because the Recovery Public Bonds and Long-Term Financial Bonds, which are also guaranteed by tariffs, have been regularly drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the uniform bonds in the securities black market have rebounded uniformly since the market opened the day before yesterday. Yesterday's closing prices were 58 yuan for Class A, 49.4 yuan for Class B, 48.05 yuan for Class C, 47.05 yuan for Class D, and 47.6 yuan for Class E, with gains ranging from 1.25 yuan to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Shanghai-Siam Navigation: Taikoo Shantou-Siam Ships Rerouted to Shanghai-Siam Route, From Shanghai to Hong Kong, Through Saigon, to Bangkok

After the fall of Shantou, the Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shantou, and Shantou-to-Southeast Asia routes were completely suspended. Although the Nan Hua class ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo still served Bay and Shantou as usual, they were still unable to enter, and there were no passengers or cargo, making the trips futile, only to look on from outside the harbor. As for the Japanese army's recent occupation of Shantou, according to merchants familiar with the industry,

it greatly hinders shipping. The reason is that since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has also become an important port for connecting the interior, and freight transportation is no less than before the war. The goods transported from Shanghai are mostly grains, cotton cloth, etc., of which cotton yarn accounts for 60-70%. Since Shantou was occupied, shipping has been suspended.

The outflow of goods has disappeared. Although Japanese ships can be used for transportation, the outflow of goods relies entirely on distribution in the interior. Now that Shantou is completely cut off from the interior, the goods transported there cannot be distributed, so no matter how much Japanese ships transport, it is useless. The British firm Taikoo formerly had a route from Shantou to Siam, but after the Japanese invasion of Shantou, it also

announced the suspension of navigation. It is now reported that the company has decided to reroute the Shantou-Siam ships to the Shanghai-Siam route, from Shanghai to Hong Kong, through Saigon, to Bangkok in Siam. The Suzhou ship has been dispatched and will depart from Shanghai on the morning of Tuesday (the 11th) for a trial voyage. The ship is currently coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong and is expected to arrive in port around the 8th. In the future, there will be one more route in the city, which will provide great convenience for passengers.

### Fundraising for Refugees: Sanitation Expenses

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Fundraising Committee for Sanitation Expenses held its fourth standing committee meeting yesterday. The chairman, Gu Keming, reported on the following matters: (1) Sanitation Promotion: For the sake of promoting health education, the YMCA has specifically designated this month, from the 10th to the 16th, as Sanitation Promotion Week. Doctors and experts will be invited to give lectures on health education in the YMCA gymnasium, starting at 7:00 PM each day, with one topic scheduled for each day, to facilitate fundraising and achieve practical results. (2) Ping Pong Tournament: The Jingwu Athletic Association is currently preparing to hold a ping pong tournament, inviting ping pong masters from Shanghai to serve the refugees. The proceeds from ticket sales will be used for sanitation expenses. (3) Chinese Music Broadcast: At the same time, the Hualian Tonglehui is also preparing a Chinese music broadcast. Famous musicians are being invited to participate, and the broadcast will take place on the 9th at the Xinxin Radio Station, from 12:00 noon to 2:00 AM (Note: That day is the opening of the New China Hotel, and the Xinxin Company is also willing to donate all tea proceeds from that day). (4) Charity Sale of Domestic Goods: The Bankers' Association is holding a charity sale of domestic goods at the Quangong Bank on Nanjing Road, divided into five groups: medicine, food, weaving, calligraphy and painting, and daily necessities. The target is 5,000 yuan. Since the opening, members of the association, directors and managers of various banks, and enthusiastic people from society have been actively buying, and the results have been quite good. Matters for discussion: (1) Zhang Shichuan was re-elected as a standing committee member, and Zhang Shankun, Shi Zhifu, Xi Xingwu, and Bian Yuying were added as standing committee members. (2) The period from the 12th to the 25th of this month was designated as Doctor's Fundraising Week. In addition to self-funded donations, attention should be paid to fundraising from patients. (3) A special supplement will be published in the Xinwen Bao on the 9th of this month.

### Datuan: Situation Unclear

Datuan Town in Nanhui is the center of the Pudong Guerrilla Force. Japanese forces have been besieging it for days. According to people from Pudong, the situation was very tense for the past two days. Land and water transportation has been cut off. Five Japanese planes flew to reconnoiter the area the day before yesterday and spotted two small motorboats parked on the coast. The 2nd and 8th detachments of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army, stationed nearby, have been contacted and have dispatched reinforcements in two routes to intercept the Japanese forces. Cutting off the Japanese forces has become a segment. The Japanese army is firmly defending Nanqiao. Gunfire and artillery fire from Su and Ri can be clearly heard in the Pudong area.

### British Parliamentary China Committee: Focuses on Interests in China; Tired of Government Replies; Believes Japan Should be Retaliated Against

According to the Zi Lin Daily, a London dispatch on June 10th stated that the reasons for the slow conclusion of the British-Soviet treaty are now fully understood. Only a few stubborn people still insist that "a hidden hand of anti-communist prejudice" continues to obstruct it. According to Moscow, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania must be guaranteed against aggression, regardless of whether they want this guarantee or not, because the Soviet Union cannot allow them to be invaded by Germany. However, these three Baltic states all want to avoid complications with their powerful neighbors.

Therefore, they announced that they do not want any country to provide guarantees. The Ding Jingle murder case has been published in large headlines by London newspapers, but no editorials have been written to criticize it. Official circles said, "This is indeed a very bad case." Even if Ding fired a shot in a panic (in this situation, his nervousness may have been quite unbearable), the extreme barbarity of the Japanese soldiers' attack and the fact that Ding was detained for fifteen hours after being injured before being sent to the Gongji Hospital cannot be excused simply because Ding fired a shot. The Parliamentary China Committee has now sent a very powerful delegation, including Sir Millen, Lord Moylean Aeribank, Sir Knox, and Sir Santman, scheduled to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Butler on Monday to inquire about the entire issue of British interests in China. Undoubtedly, the Ding Jingle case will be carefully addressed.

However,

Members of Parliament

in a sense, feel that there is nothing to choose between the cases. All cases prove that the Japanese are determined to harm and insult Britain as much as possible in any way they can. The only difference is the amount of evidence. As the questions in the House of Commons recently show, members are increasingly tired of hearing the government's repeated, unchanging replies that protests have been sent to the Japanese government. The general public increasingly feels that only some definite retaliation can achieve any remedy. Officials now seem to be moving toward this same conclusion, but everyone is afraid to be overly optimistic.

### Japanese Planes and Warships Repeatedly Bombard; Zhejiang and Fujian Coastal Defenses Strengthened; Bombs Fall Near Zhenhai Fortress; Twelve Japanese Planes Bomb Changmen

At around 9:00 AM on the 4th, six Japanese planes invaded Zhenhai and dropped more than thirty bombs, all falling in the wasteland near the fortress. Chinese losses were minimal. Two Japanese warships are currently anchored in the waters off Zhenhai Ligang, without any unusual movements. Local garrison troops are closely monitoring them. The situation in Ningbo and Zhenhai is peaceful as usual, and defenses have been strengthened.

Yesterday afternoon, sources in the shipping industry revealed that three Japanese warships arrived off the coast of Leqing on the morning of the 4th. At around 8:00 AM, they opened fire on the shore and launched several motorboats, full of armed Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. Local defense forces calmly responded, inflicting a head-on blow. The Japanese army failed to succeed. At the same time, three Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs in the area, causing minimal damage. Japanese planes have been quite active along the coast of Fujian Province in recent days. At around 9:00 AM on the 4th, twelve Japanese planes bombed the Changmen area of Fuzhou. The extent of the damage is unknown. More than twenty Japanese warships are currently anchored in the Minjiang estuary, and have not left. They occasionally launch motorboats to patrol and spy along the coast. The Chinese military authorities have deployed heavy troops along the coast early on.

### Dinghai Shops: Mostly Robbed

Since Dinghai was landed on by the Japanese army on the 23rd of last month, the residents of the city and suburbs have fled completely. The larger shops were mostly broken into by Japanese soldiers, who searched inside. Local hooligans entered and looted after the Japanese army left, so the losses were very heavy. Shops such as Nantai Fengtailong have not been spared.

### Coveting Fishing Rights: No Success

Fang Tongyuan, the principal of Zhoushan Middle School, and Chen Dehong, the pastor of the Christian Church, have been detained by the Japanese and are now being used to organize a puppet "organization" in the hope of gathering residents who have fled to the countryside. However, very few have returned. At the same time, the Japanese are trying to cooperate with Shenjiamen fish merchants to control the fishing industry, but have also had no success.

### Situation Inside the City: Still Extremely Chaotic

The Japanese army occupied the Wuhuailu mansion as its headquarters, and then occupied the Wu and Shao family houses on Beijie and the Pan Rongji building at No. 4 Guanyin Bridge as three branch headquarters. Military telephones were laid out in the four cities. The city gates were closed at night to avoid guerrilla attacks, in a rather desperate situation. At the same time, there was war outside the city at Qingling, Baihu Mountain, Dazhan, and other places.

### Xin Anli Starts Sailing to Dinghai

After Dinghai and Daishan, which belong to the Zhoushan Islands in eastern Zhejiang, were unfortunately occupied by the Japanese army, local self-defense groups and others retreated to the outskirts to continue the resistance. Order in Dinghai remains chaotic, and the war is still ongoing. However, after the Shanghai-Dinghai route was suspended, the Swiss merchant Ruifeng Shipping Company has now chartered the Xin Anli from the British merchant Laisi Shipping Company to operate the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also serving Daishan. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai for the first time at 4:00 PM today. However, the fares are extremely expensive, with third-class cabins costing eight yuan and staterooms costing twelve yuan. It is heard that Japanese permission has been obtained, but after landing in Dinghai or Daishan, passengers are forced to obtain a so-called "good citizen certificate" from the so-called "Maintenance Association," so people in Dinghai are paying close attention to this.

### Leaders of the Domestic Goods Industry: Pay Attention to Smuggled Goods; Smuggled Goods Flood the Market; Domestic Goods to Reduce Tax Rates

Shanghai is the hub of international commerce, and the prosperity of commerce can be imagined. In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, and commercial trade has also become increasingly prosperous. However, since the westward movement of the National Army, the environment has changed, and customs authority is insufficient, so smuggled goods have flooded the market. It is heard that leaders of the domestic goods industry in this city are paying close attention to these smuggled goods. They have all been carefully studying how to improve the quality of domestic goods, sell them in the market, and, to the extent possible, reduce prices to allow buyers to obtain cheap and high-quality domestic goods. It is also heard that the government is very concerned about the export of domestic goods, and may reduce export tax rates for domestic goods. Therefore, it is predicted that the domestic goods market will develop increasingly in the future.

### Japanese Troops Advance by Land and Sea; Intense Fighting in Northern Jiangsu; Japanese Attack Haimen; Chinese Troops Resist Valiantly; Yesterday Morning, Japanese Attempted Landing Near Taixing

The Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to land in Haimen and Qidong, but has been met with strong resistance from local troops and has failed to succeed. Haimen and Qidong are still under Chinese military control. However, Japanese motorboats continue to harass various ports from time to time, and their attempts have not been abandoned. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the Japanese army, hundreds of people,

Detour to Haimen

attacked the Chinese military positions in Haimen by detouring from Nantong on the morning of the 4th. The Chinese army immediately resisted, and fierce fighting broke out. The battle has not yet ended. Japanese motorboats are patrolling the various ports, seemingly attempting to attack Haimen by land and sea. The Chinese military authorities have made careful preparations. The port of Taixing, before the opening of the Yangtze River,

### Master of Ji Hua Tang: Yearns for Compatriots; Takes the Opportunity of the New Building's Completion; Urges Calligraphers to Help with Donations

Ji Hua Tang Pharmacy on Yunnan Road, founded by Mr. Yuan Xietang of Jiangdu, has been around for more than thirty years. All products are marked with the Yuan Manufacturing logo and use a rooster as the trademark, because the founder was born in the year of the rooster.

### Five-Story Mansion: Opening Highlights

The newly built five-story mansion held its opening ceremony on the 3rd of this month. All employees wore gold rooster badges on their chests to distinguish them. After signing in, guests were each given a folding fan made by the Sheng Sheng Company, one side with a lotus picking picture painted by Mr. Sun Xueni, and the other side printed with a picture of the pharmacy's new building. Yao Qing and He Song brothers, in memory of the hard work of their father in founding the company, specially set up the "Mr. Yuan Bietang Memorial Hall" on the third floor, with a portrait hanging in the middle and flowers placed underneath. There are eight wooden plaques with maxims on the side, including "Opium smoking is not allowed, it damages the spirit and wastes the career. A moment of pleasure will addict you and cause you lifelong suffering, and you will regret it too late." On the left hangs a picture of Han Kang selling medicine and a couplet presented by Mr. Lin Kanghou. The picture was painted by Xiaoyu, with a sentence inscribed by Xueni saying, "The Yao Qing and He Song brothers, inheriting their father's legacy, have expanded their doors and windows and made them beautiful. At the beginning of the completion, I wish them a limitless future." Dozens of national flags were hung high on the roof and fluttered in the wind, and more than a hundred pots of bonsai made by Mo Wuqi were displayed, small and exquisite, and worthy of appreciation.

### Calligraphy Donations: A New Approach

A table was specially set up on the fifth floor, with writing tools on it. An old man with a long beard sat upright behind it, with a sign posted next to it saying, "Please invite Mr. Yuan Xilian to write couplets to help with donations, five yuan per couplet. Paper and ink are donated by He Song. The proceeds will be sent to the Fundraising Committee for Sanitation Expenses of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. Guests who wish to have a couplet written, please provide the wording of the upper line so that the calligrapher can write on the spot." Only then did we know that this old man with a long beard was the Jiangnan beggar calligrapher (Mr. Yuan's alias) who was strong in character, not tempted by profit, and willing to live in the shelter to serve as a refugee. He said with a smile to the guests, "If you want to embed the two characters of your name in the couplet, you must commission a special one and pay double the fee to benefit the refugees." So the brothers Yan Bailin and Yan Zhongli paid an extra fee and asked him to write two special couplets. Because of the busyness of writing, they agreed to pick them up the next day. This kind of fundraising method can be called a new approach. In the future, when shops open, they can imitate it to help the refugees. It is worth promoting, so it is presented here to inform compatriots from all walks of life.

### First Special District Court Reinstates Second Branch Prison; Wang Shishan Appointed Warden

The First Special District Court in Shanghai, Jiangsu, originally had a female prison attached to it, officially named the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. After the establishment of the Beixinjing Prison, the female prisoners who were to be held there were transferred to Beixinjing Prison for execution of their sentences.

Unexpectedly, Zhuang Zhiliang recently announced to all tenants that the rent would be increased by another 35%. The tenants refused because Zhuang was greedy and insatiable and they could not afford it. However, Zhuang threatened to cut off the electricity. At 7:30 PM last Friday, Zhuang Quansheng, the owner of the Ranji Company (in room No. 202 of that address), argued reasonably with Zhuang Zhiliang, which angered him. He then suddenly pulled out a gun to threaten him. Zhuang Quansheng reported the incident to the General Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate and verify the facts before reporting back to the police chief for investigation.

### German Consulate Negotiates Northern Jiangsu Shipping; No Progress; Japanese Consulate Defers Responsibility to Navy; Nisshin Shipping Prepares for Trial Voyage

Although the Japanese attempt to control the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been met with fierce resistance from all parties, it has not been forgotten. The Hongyun Ship once joined the Northern Jiangsu Line to conduct a trial voyage to test the opinions of all parties. Unexpectedly, it was robbed by pirates in the Haihonggang waters and its machinery was damaged, so it has been suspended. The Hongyun Ship sailed to Shanghai to enter the dock for repairs. According to shipping industry sources, the Japanese army recently blockaded the Northern Jiangsu port, and foreign ships sailing to Jiangsu use Qinglong Port as the terminal. Everything is controlled by the Japanese army. The Nisshin Company is in the process of sending ships to join the Northern Jiangsu Line to compete. After the Nisshin Shipping vessels sail, the business of foreign merchant ships will be severely hit and it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the German companies have requested the German Consulate General to negotiate with the Japanese to restore navigation to the Northern Jiangsu port. It is said that the German Consul General has submitted a negotiation to the Japanese Consul, but Miura claimed that this matter is the responsibility of the Japanese naval authorities and will be handled after notifying the naval authorities. Therefore, no progress has been made. It is said that the German Consulate General will submit another negotiation in the coming days.

### Japanese Goods Shipped to Shanghai Accumulate; Japanese Merchants Accuse Customs of "Lack of Sincerity"

The Continental News reports that, according to relayed postal news from here, the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry accused the local customs authorities of "lack of sincerity" and has now decided to apply to the Tokyo government to take steps to "accelerate" the passage of Japanese goods through the local customs. It is not known what decision was reached at a special meeting held by the Ministry of Communications on Tuesday of last week after the application was submitted. Due to slow customs inspections, more than 10,000 tons of Japanese goods have been blocked in the warehouses of the Japan Mail Ship Company and other merchants in this city. The volume of goods shipped from Japan to Shanghai each month is 40,000 to 60,000 tons. The statement from the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry also stated that although Japan took over the customs soon after occupying Shanghai, most of the customs officers are still British and Chinese, some of whom are anti-Japanese and deliberately delay customs procedures for goods shipped out of Japan.

### Huashe Homespun is Approved for Free Transportation and Sale; Customs Releases Goods Without Certificates

### Beixinjing Ferry is Blockaded

Flights from the concession to Beixinjing were unable to depart on the 5th. It is reported that the Beixinjing ferry has been blockaded, and the Hongqiao Daxi Road, an important land route in western Shanghai, has also been placed under temporary martial law. The inspection of pedestrians and vehicles is very strict, hindering pedestrians and creating difficulties for those traveling to the Shanghai West Concession. A small Japanese fire ship with armed Japanese soldiers has been patrolling the Beixinjing inner river area for days, inspecting the ships traveling back and forth.

### Northeastern Zhejiang Jiangsu Shipping is Blocked; Affects Source of Fresh Eggs; Shanghai Egg Factories Reduce Production to Maintain Operations

The source of eggs in the city has always been adjusted by shipping them from various ports in Eastern Zhejiang and Northern Jiangsu to Shanghai. The Zhejiang Provincial Government once prohibited the export of eggs, and the egg factories in Shanghai reduced production. After the egg merchants requested to continue exporting, the source gradually became smooth, and the factories resumed production one after another. However, recently, the ports in Eastern Zhejiang have prohibited navigation, the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely cut off, and there have been wars in various ports in Northern Jiangsu, resulting in an almost complete disappearance of the source. The egg factories have to reduce production again to maintain operations, and the price of chicken and duck eggs in the market has also risen.

### Shanghai Postmaster Plans Postal Delivery in Guerrilla Areas; Seven Locations to be Restored First; Heavy Packages Still Difficult to Send

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Kunming Postal Administration appointed Zha Peilin, the director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, to preside over postal services in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. After the National Army moved west, the war zones in the above three provinces expanded, and postal deliveries were also suspended one after another. It is learned that Mr. Zha, in order to facilitate the delivery of letters to the people, spared no effort to plan the restoration of postal delivery in the guerrilla areas. He contacted the postal administrations of various provinces back and forth. However, because water and land transportation have not returned to normal, it is still difficult to accept heavy packages. It is reported that the locations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui that have already restored postal delivery include Minhang and Liuhe in the Shanghai area, Weinan, Lianyungang, and Xugou in the Jiangsu area, Tangqi in the Zhejiang area, and Congyang Town in the Anhui area.

### Two Students Missing

The boys Wang Peizeng, 14 years old, from Nantong, and Zhang Mingwei, 16 years old, from Wuxi, reside at No. 4690, Robert Road, Shanghai West, and No. 30, Lane 1061, Pinlang Road, respectively. Both are junior high school students at a certain middle school. Although young, they have a keen sense of patriotism and often expressed the desire to join the army at home. The two students suddenly left home the other morning under the pretext of going to school, but did not return at night. Their parents searched everywhere but could not find them. They inquired at the school and learned that they had not been to school that day. Their parents are very afraid that these young people will be fooled by others, so they have printed flyers and asked people from all walks of life to pay attention to the two boys. If anyone sees them, please send them to their homes. A small reward will be offered so that their families can be reunited.

It is reported that nothing was found.

### Charcoal Prices Rise Slightly; Due to Interruption of Shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou; But Goods Have Arrived from Other Places

The charcoal fuel needed daily in this city has always come from Eastern Zhejiang, concentrated in Wenzhou and transshipped to Shanghai. Since the Japanese side declared that it would take military action against Wenzhou and prohibited foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou has been cut off, and the source of charcoal has disappeared, resulting in soaring prices. The price per [unit of measure] has increased by two to three yuan. However, the city has sufficient inventory, and goods have also been transported from other places, so there should be no shortage.

### Japanese Plan to Seize Salt Tax in Punan: Troops Sent to Coastal Areas for On-the-Spot Tax Collection; Japanese Troops Ambushed in Luhui and Suffered Losses

Punan News: The coastal areas of Punan's Song, Feng, Jin, and Nan counties are all salt-producing regions, with annual tax revenues reaching over a million. Since the area fell, merchants have disappeared and salt factories have stopped production. To maintain the livelihoods of the salt workers, the guerrillas allowed local people to raise funds and continue operations. On one hand, they used the original tax amount to fund military expenses, which has been quite effective for two years. Since occupying Pinghu, Zhangyan, Tinglin, Nanjiao, and other coastal areas, the Japanese have aimed solely at seizing the coastal salt tax. However, due to the activity of the guerrillas, they dared not try. Now, as the hot season approaches, the peak salt production period, the Japanese, seeing great profit, cannot wait. Last month, they first transferred over a thousand newly trained puppet tax police from Nanjing as a follow-up to occupying the producing areas. Unexpectedly, a portion of the puppet tax police stationed in Nanjiao revolted first. Many of those in Zhangyan also abandoned their weapons and fled. Seeing their plans about to fail, the Japanese, disregarding everything, sent two large detachments from Hangzhou on the 2nd of this month, heading to Jinshanwei via Zhujing. They also transferred three hundred puppet police from Songjiang to occupy Ruanxiang and Zhalin. On one hand, they transferred a small naval detachment from Shanghai, Zhoupu, and other places to attack Qicangdun, Ping'an, Qianjiaqiao, and other places, attempting to completely seize the Punan salt region. Therefore, in recent days, the coastal areas have been very chaotic. The Zhalin area was originally within the Japanese sphere of influence, and the guerrillas had automatically withdrawn. However, the salt workers were unwilling to obey and had mostly destroyed their salt stoves and drying fields. The guerrillas had also long blocked the salt transport canals, making both production and transport difficult for the Japanese, and it may take three to four months to recover.

After the revolt of the puppet police in Nanjiao, the Japanese mobilized a large force to attack, in addition to seizing the coastal salt tax, and continued to implement their "mopping-up" plan (the Japanese had already launched two large-scale invasions against the guerrillas in Punan). Therefore, along the Punan area, there were dense formations of troops searching in various directions. On the 2nd of this month, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers landed from Zhangang and attacked Lujiahui, which is defended by the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. The detachment knew that a direct confrontation would be difficult to win, so they divided their machine gun teams and ambushed them at the vital water and land crossings that the Japanese troops would have to pass through, using the reeds on both banks as cover. They also set up heavy artillery behind the Chen family tomb. On one hand, they used the old, weak, and disabled soldiers to lure the enemy along the road. The Japanese, unaware of the trap, charged forward, and the ambushers attacked from both sides. Shells flew densely, killing more than fifty people on the spot and capturing many military supplies. The Japanese troops retreated in panic and were attacked by the Provincial Security Team near Zhangang, almost leaving no one unscathed. Such surprising and victorious tactics are the usual skills of the Loyal and Righteous Army in Peinan, and this is not the first time they have won.

The self-defense corps organized by the governments of Shanghai, Jiading, and other ten counties under the district supervisory commissioner has been approved by the provincial government and uniformly organized into the District Provincial Security Brigade. The five counties in southeastern Pudong each formed a brigade, led by their respective county magistrates. Coastal areas not under the jurisdiction of the Loyal and Righteous Army were incorporated by the Shanghai-Songhu Military Commissioner as supplementary troops for the regular army. It is now known that the coastal defense areas in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been ordered by the War Zone Commander to be under the command of the military commissioner. The district's military affairs are considered the most important. Therefore, the military commissioner convened a meeting in a certain place to give instructions and charged the district supervisory commissioner with concurrent responsibility for handling the matter. It is heard that the commissioner has established a Provincial Security District Command in a certain place and personally supervised the battle near Jinshanwei, eighteen away, the day before yesterday. The Japanese troops, newly transferred from Hangzhou, numbered more than five hundred. Some were conscripted locally and forced to the front lines. Because they did not obey orders, they were machine-gunned from behind by the Japanese, resulting in more than half of them being killed or wounded, which was extremely cruel. More than twenty people, including Zhang Gonghu, who were responsible for the right-wing assault, were far away and killed the Japanese instructor, leading their troops to defect to the Chinese side. According to them, in the occupied areas, the puppet government forcibly conscripted people into the army under the pretext of recruiting police. They were trained in Hangzhou for two months and then driven to fight.

### Various Businesses on North Shansi Road Request the Prohibition of Street Vendors

Various businesses on North Shansi Road believe that the increasing number of street vendors on the road is seriously hindering traffic, sanitation, and business operations. They have listed six reasons and requested the Shanghai Municipal Council's 36th District Branch to forward them to the Public Works Department for adoption, moving the street vendors into the vegetable markets. The reasons cited by the businesses are as follows: (1) Regarding traffic: The road is a major transportation artery, and setting up stalls along the road will inevitably hinder traffic and affect road administration, which contradicts the Municipal Council's safety campaign. (2) Regarding sanitation: The shops along the road all face the road. If the road surface is unclean, it will easily attract flies, and the foul odor inhaled will easily cause illness. Therefore, setting up stalls along the road not only hinders traffic but also affects sanitation. (3) Regarding the supply of vegetables: The so-called North Hongkou district, with an area of less than one square mile, already has three vegetable markets (Burton Road, Edinburgh Road, North Fukien Road). Business is usually very slow. Although the population has recently increased sharply, the overall area is small, and the vegetable markets are still one-third empty. The Burton Road vegetable market can still accommodate 60 stalls, Edinburgh Road can accommodate 30 stalls, and North Fukien Road can accommodate 120 stalls. This situation shows that although the population has increased, the increase in demand is not significant. (4) Regarding the livelihood of street vendors: Street vendors are mostly coolies and should be given relief. The Public Works Department should use its power to accommodate them as much as possible in various vegetable markets. This would not only relieve the street vendors but also rectify road administration. It is also necessary to investigate the business of each vegetable market to determine the elements of supply and demand. This is the way to guarantee the permanent livelihood of the street vendors. (5) Regarding the legal issue of licenses: The street vendors along the road mostly have shoulder-carrying licenses, which only allow hawking and not setting up stalls. If an exception is made to allow them to set up stalls, can it be guaranteed that there will be no imitators? It is feared that once implemented, Nanking Road will also become a peddler's street. If they are given licenses to set up stalls, then nearly ten thousand peddlers in the city will have to change their licenses. Therefore, the precedent cannot be broken. The only good solution is to have them move into the vegetable markets. (6) Regarding hindering the business of others: The shops along North Shansi Road are all tax-paying citizens and should be protected by the Municipal Council. In this hot summer, they can only rely on the relatively cool mornings to do business. Now, obstructing traffic and hindering business at this time will cause significant losses.

### Taiwan Incident

It is reported that Taiwanese aborigines massacred Ryukyu refugees, and Japan dispatched over seven hundred troops to Taiwan for negotiations. Upon hearing this news, China also dispatched an imperial envoy to the interior tribes to investigate the situation. The aborigines surrounded and cheered, claiming that the Japanese were abusive and that they were willing to be the vanguard. When asked about the refugee case, they claimed that there was no killing. Because the refugees were willing to work as servants, the imperial commissioner ordered them to be handed over and successively released more than twenty refugees, who were now properly cared for as witnesses. Then, he proclaimed the emperor's virtue, saying that he would order protection in the future. The aborigines cried bitterly, like young children clinging to their loving parents. The imperial commissioner consoled them and rewarded them with red silk and other items. After returning to the camp, various tribes submitted petitions, willing to be converted to civilization, establish officials, and pay taxes, totaling about two hundred and fifty tribes. They presented household registration books, totaling more than one million four hundred thousand people. Among them, dozens of tribes requested to be granted surnames, and requested the establishment of control, the distribution of weapons, and the appointment of officials to lead them to fight to the death with the Japanese. The imperial commissioner instructed them to prepare first and wait for deployment. All the tribal chiefs jumped and sang for joy! They all said that they did not expect to see the majesty of the imperial commissioner again today and to be able to serve the Holy Dynasty. When the Japanese troops arrived in Taiwan, the first time they entered the mountains, they suddenly encountered an aboriginal woman over fifty years old, who commanded more than two hundred soldiers to surround and capture her from all sides, but they still failed to catch her. On the way back, they encountered a sick aboriginal girl, only eleven or twelve years old, and sang triumphantly to present her as a captive, holding a grand banquet. They praised the aborigines for having magic, which could change unpredictably.

### Light Punishment for Picking Flowers

The public garden in Hongkou does not prohibit people from visiting, but prohibits picking flowers. Because famous flowers and exotic grasses, with their vibrant colors, would be gone in a moment if they could be picked. But offenders are almost daily. The constable, tired of it, reported to the French consul yesterday, intending to increase the punishment, placing a cangue on the garden gate for a day, so that people would know to fear it. Sima Chen believed that picking flowers was a minor matter and should not be severely punished. The only option was to draw a picture of a cangue, indicating that violators would be treated accordingly.

### Overview of the Adjustment and Establishment of National Higher Education Colleges and Departments: Adjustment of Colleges and Departments in More Than Thirty Schools: Unified Training of Middle School Teachers

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) Since the relocation of national colleges and universities above the junior college level to the rear during the war, there are now ninety-five schools (excluding several newly established schools). The distribution is as previously reported. The establishment of colleges and departments in colleges and universities above the junior college level (including universities, independent colleges, and junior colleges) has lacked a certain standard in the past. In the same location, there are many duplications in the colleges and departments of various schools. Some of them also have overly simple equipment or lack a central goal and are not suitable for social needs. After the outbreak of the war, the situation has become even worse than before as most schools have relocated to the interior. The Ministry of Education is therefore merging duplicates, appropriately abolishing rudimentary ones, and adding specific regulations to those lacking a central goal. According to this adjustment of colleges and departments, there are more than thirty schools. In order to train teachers, the normal college system has been established. The education colleges and departments of private universities and colleges in various provinces that have achieved excellent results will determine their teaching scope and specifically train vocational and social teachers. The rest will be ordered to stop enrolling new students and gradually close down in order to unify the training of teachers in secondary schools across the country. At present, there are eighty-eight types of colleges and departments in colleges and universities above the junior college level, with five hundred and nineteen departments; and forty-five types of junior colleges and vocational schools, with seventy-seven courses. Among them, colleges and departments of arts and sciences are the most numerous (thirty-seven colleges, one hundred and fourteen departments in arts; thirty-four colleges, one hundred and eight departments in science), followed by law, medicine, and engineering (twenty-two colleges, ninety-six departments in law; twenty-one colleges, no departments divided in medicine; eighteen colleges, eighty departments in engineering). Education, commerce, and agriculture are the least numerous (twelve colleges, forty-seven departments in education and normal; fourteen colleges, thirty-five departments in commerce; ten colleges, thirty-nine departments in agriculture). There are more engineering and medical courses in junior colleges (both fifteen courses), followed by normal, arts, and commerce (thirteen courses in both normal and arts, eleven courses in commerce), and agriculture is the least numerous (ten courses). This situation still needs to be adjusted. The statistics of colleges, departments, and courses in the twenty-seventh year are listed below.

### Finance - Discount Rates Continue to Rise - Gold Market Difficult to Activate

Yesterday, the spot market for raw gold saw relatively flat price fluctuations, hovering around 2,560 yuan throughout the day. The general trend was first up and then down. Although cash shops initially sold off frequently, the Huainan gang's appetite remained strong, and retail investors also bought in well, keeping the market relatively firm. Later, due to the discount rate for remittances rising further to over 100 yuan, buyers' interest waned sharply. In addition, securities firms, a certain bank, and cash shops competed to sell off, and the market outlook immediately turned weak. At one point, it fell to a low of 2,514 yuan before rebounding to 2,560 yuan at the close. The overall result was a slight decline. Transactions were mostly scattered and few, with only about 600 taels traded throughout the day. Gold jewelry shops remained inactive, and overseas group gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Raw Gold Unchanged Since Morning

Since the morning, the cash shops were eager to buy each bar (ten taels), but a certain gold shop was acting as an agent for the Huainan gang, and retail investors also had an appetite for raw gold, so the market was stable. The morning opening was two yuan higher than the previous day. A certain cash shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange shop at a price of 2,562 yuan. Subsequently, another cash shop sold fifty taels to a certain gold shop (acting as an agent for the Huainan gang) at the same price. Soon after, another cash shop sold twenty taels to a fellow merchant at a price of 63 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop (acting as an agent for speculators) suddenly began to sell off, and the market weakened slightly, briefly dropping three yuan. A base gold shop sold fifty taels to a fellow merchant (the buyer was acting as an agent for the Huainan gang) at a price of 60 yuan. At this time, the Huainan gang's buying interest remained strong, and retail investors' buying power increased, so the underlying trend turned upward. Silverware shops bought thirty taels from a certain bank at a price of 61 yuan. Subsequently, cash shops did business with each other for fifty taels at a price of 62 yuan. After this, there were fewer sellers, and under the momentary buying spree, it rose five yuan again. A certain bank bought forty taels from a cash shop, and a securities firm bought ten taels from a money exchange shop, both at a price of 67 yuan. At that time, a certain bank suddenly stopped buying and started selling off, and general buyers avoided the market as the discount rate for remittances had risen to over 100 yuan, so buying interest suddenly waned, and the market price fell back down. A certain bank sold thirty taels to a silverware shop at a price of 65 yuan. A cash shop sold ten taels to a certain broker at a price of 63 yuan. At that time, securities firms also started a selling spree, and as buyers watched and did not advance, the downtrend became severe, dropping six yuan. An entire army of firms sold ten taels to gold shops at a price of 57 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 56 yuan. Later, a certain bank sold thirty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 55 yuan. At the fifth hour, securities firms sold ten taels to gold shops again. 56 yuan was the closing price for the morning. The afternoon opening remained weak, opening two yuan lower. Gold shops sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 54 yuan. Later, cash shops sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 55 yuan. After this, the market became calm and sluggish. Around three o'clock, it suddenly turned firm, soaring five yuan. Silverware shops did business with each other for fifty taels. 2,560 yuan was the closing price for the evening. As a result, there was no change from the previous day. The price of the cash shops' own-brand gold sold for 2,570 yuan and was bought back for 2,555 yuan. The current standard gold is priced about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there was little activity.

Jewelry Remains at Original Price

The price of jewelry gold per tael did not change because the raw gold market was fluctuating. Da Tonghang was still priced at 259 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was priced at 257 yuan, with a buying price of 251 yuan.

Central Pure Gold Unchanged

According to a London telegram on the 4th, English pure gold was priced at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pence per ounce, so the Central Bank's buying and selling price of Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained stagnant at 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Futures Had a Lot of Selling - Swap Spreads Seen Narrowing Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. In the gray market, the situation was that foreign firms were not closing out many accounts, and foreign exchange firms were quite willing to sell off, especially US dollars, causing an underlying trend. Because foreign firms were settling US dollars with a slightly firmer tone, there was still little change along the way. In the July futures market, the Chinese banks' selling interest suddenly increased sharply. Coupled with the fact that foreign banks' appetite was not good, and sales were particularly high, both British and US exchange rates rose firmly. Therefore, swap spreads were gradually narrowing. At the fifth hour, the spot rate swapped for July was 1.875 for British gold and 3.4375 for US dollars, which is equivalent to a foreign exchange firm's monthly interest rate of about three points, while arbitrageurs actually only made one and a half points (all calculated for 26 days). In half-day trading, the futures market was still strong, and the spot market was relatively quiet. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, foreign exchange firms' selling interest was also high, so it also increased by 1.125.

In the early morning, the London long-term rate contracted by 3.125 in the near term, and the long-term rate continued to fall by 0.0625. The New York silver price was closed. The London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rate against the US dollar did not change, and the exchange rate against Shanghai fell by 1.125. The exchange rate between the US dollar and other foreign currencies was closed, with no market. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's morning opening, the spot selling price of British exchange was 6 pence 5625, and the spot selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 75, both of which were unchanged from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms first settled HSBC's spot British gold at 6 pence 5625, and then foreign firms bought and settled China-Belgium Bank's spot US exchange at 12 yuan 78125. In the process, the British exchange rate was flat, while the US exchange rate was firm. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they remained unchanged, and when the silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After this, Chinese banks frequently and fiercely sold off July futures. Coupled with the fact that foreign banks' appetite was sluggish and selling interest was good, the market trend was loose. It is estimated that the Chinese banks and the foreign China-Belgium-Dutch bank sold British gold for July from 6 pence 3475 to 6 pence 375, and also sold US exchange for the same month, from 12 yuan 375 loose to 12 yuan 40625. At that time, foreign banks also did business with each other for July US exchange, at 12 yuan 4375. Near the fifth hour, it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate also firmed, with the current spot selling price at 40 yuan 25. By the afternoon closing, the bank's spot selling price of British exchange was 6 pence 5625, and the spot selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 78125. The selling price of British gold for July was 6 pence 375, and the selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 4375. Compared with last night's closing, the spot British exchange was flat and the US exchange was down 0.03125, the swap was down 0.0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was up 1.125 according to the bank's selling price. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### US Dollar Draft - Further Drop of Five and a Half Points

Yesterday, English pure gold was unchanged, and the English-US exchange rate was closed for the holiday, with no market. Foreign exchange firms in the local area had strong demand for closing accounts, and foreign banks provided ample supply. The market was flat for English exchange and loose for US exchange. The English exchange rate remained at 6 pence 5625, and the US exchange rate was 12 yuan 78125, continuing to fall by 0.03125 from the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. When raw gold opened, customers had strong buying interest, doing business at 2,562 yuan. After that, demand was even stronger, and the market was quite bullish, rising to a high price of 67 yuan. Many people took advantage of the high price to sell off, and money exchange shops were also eager to sell, causing the market to turn weak. In the afternoon, it was 56 yuan. At the afternoon opening, gold shops and customers took advantage of the low price to buy in. The evening closing was 2,560 yuan, with no change from the previous day. There was little supply and demand for foreign currencies English and US gold pounds, and the market was sluggish. Transactions in English and US gold were very active. English gold drafts did not change, and US gold drafts fell due to the loose exchange rate. Demand for drafts from Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Netherlands increased, and current prices rose slightly. Supply of drafts from France, Canada, and the Philippines was relatively abundant, and continued to decline. Demand for Japanese gold drafts was scarce, and the market price eased slightly to 9 jiao 9 fen 4 li. Korean drafts were very weak at 8 jiao 7 fen 5 li. Association transactions were not active. Xiang Kang sold 50 pounds of English gold drafts to Tongyuan, and Houji sold 30 pounds of English gold drafts to Changtai, and also sold 50 pounds of English gold drafts to Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices saw US dollar drafts drop by 5 fen 5 li, Hong Kong drafts rise by 5 li, French franc drafts drop by 7 hao and a half, Singapore drafts and Dutch drafts each rise by 5 fen, and Canadian drafts and Philippine drafts each drop by 5 fen. All other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rates Once Rose Sharply - Gradually Fell Back in the Afternoon

Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts first rose and then fell slightly. At one point, it broke through the 100 yuan mark. In the morning, it rose from around 95 yuan per thousand to a high of 105 yuan. In the afternoon, the use of cash decreased sharply, and it immediately fell back to 95 yuan, which was still 2 yuan and a half higher than the previous day. The money industry association's interbank interest rate did not change, and was listed at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon, it is said.

### English-Indian Silver Seen Declining Again

According to a London telegram on the 4th, a small number of speculators sold off in the silver market, and there was a lack of maintenance. The market was still flat after the closing. India bought in the near term at the listed price. The short-term long rate contracted by 3.125, and the long-term rate continued to fall by 0.0625. The New York silver price was closed. Also, according to a Mumbai silver telegram, the Indian silver market was weak again. Both the spot price and the July price fell by 8 anna, while the August price fell by a small 5 anna. A total of seven contracts were traded.

### Securities - Government Bonds Rise Again

The gray market for securities saw a gradual recovery yesterday, and the trends of various bonds showed signs of revival. Some people thought that they would tend to fluctuate, but this was a superficial view. The interest payments were suddenly injured by rumors and had unexpected changes, causing the price market to plummet by more than ten yuan, and then later rebounding by several yuan. If it is said that these interest payments will not be paid, then a drop of ten or eight yuan would not be too much. If it is said that the interest payments will not be interrupted, then although the rebound cannot immediately reach the highest price of June 13, it will not be much different. However, although it is known that something will not be interrupted, the holder of the bill is still uneasy before the authorities announce it. However, as the deadline approaches, the truth will be revealed, so it is not easy to fluctuate. Sure enough, yesterday a certain major bank received a telegram from Chongqing that the seventh interest payment will be paid as scheduled, but the remittance will be changed to bank drafts. This has already happened before, enough to quell the desire to kill. Therefore, yesterday's market continued to rise by about two yuan. The gray market was particularly firm in the afternoon. The most lively trading was the market buying to help a certain financial group, Lianhe, cover short positions. Tiansheng and Dexue also bought in considerably, and retail investors' appetite was also quite strong. Some of the sellers were new multi-gainers selling off, and some were slightly seeking cash for economic reasons, but the number was still very limited. No. 20 and No. 35 sold off more, and Yongkang and Hengxue only sold a few. The total number of transactions was about 400,000 yuan. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 1 yuan 1 jiao to 2 yuan 2 jiao. A simple table is listed below. The market will close at noon due to the heat, and will resume after the autumn cools down.

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Price
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 58.00 | 56.00 | 58.00 | Up 2.20
Unified B | 49.45 | 48.10 | 49.40 | Up 1.80

The stock market was still sluggish yesterday, but there was slightly more demand, and sellers were holding back. Jardine stocks made slight progress, and other stocks were stable. The stock market is waiting to see how the external situation develops, especially the current development of the European political situation, which seems to be related to the stock markets of exchanges around the world. Economic and financial issues are currently being put aside temporarily, pending further changes in the political situation.

The listed prices of British companies' Far East stocks in London on the 4th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable. Only the Kailan Mining stock rose by three pence, with a price of 18 shillings.

Kailan Mining 18.0 Up 0.03

The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts in London on the 4th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable, and the market prices remained unchanged. There were physical goods for sale in the UK, including ¬£2,000 of post-war British bonds and ¬£2,000 of French bonds with stamps, with a selling price of ¬£31 and a half, priced ¬£1 and a half lower than British bonds. There were also ¬£2,000 of Belgian bonds with stamps, with a selling price of ¬£29, priced ¬£4 lower than British bonds. There were also ¬£2,000 of German bonds with stamps, with a selling price of ¬£27 and a half, priced ¬£5 and a half lower than British bonds.

### Temporary Suspension of China-Belgium Debt Interest

The 6% Sino-Belgium US Dollar Bonds, secured by customs duties, held their 23rd drawing on June 1st at the China-Belgium Bank headquarters. The winning numbers, etc., were detailed in this newspaper a few days ago. The principal and interest due on July 1st totaled US$236,767. Following the statement made by the Chongqing Ministry of Finance spokesman to the Reuters reporter on June 30 that interest and principal payments on the Post-War Reconstruction Gold Bonds due on July 1st would be suspended and that interest and principal payments on bonds secured by customs surplus would also be temporarily suspended, it became questionable whether the interest and principal payments on the Sino-Belgium bonds would be paid on schedule. The reporter inquired at the China-Belgium Bank, the agency responsible for paying the interest and principal, yesterday and was told that the funds had not yet been allocated, so payments would be temporarily suspended.

### Cotton Yarn   Yarn Pledges Expire, Settlement at Market Price   Double Horse Yarn Falls by Ten Dollars or More   Japanese Yarn Prices Also Drop Slightly

The yarn market is sluggish, and the downward trend is intensifying.  After the promulgation of new financial stabilization measures, credit has tightened.  Goods with expiring pledges can no longer be re-pledged for extensions.  Moreover, there's an urgent rush to redeem them.  Due to this weakness and lack of support, sellers are forced to settle at market prices, further disrupting the market.  A major player, for example, harbored thoughts of boosting prices, but was unable to realize them due to environmental constraints.  His market activities have decreased compared to before, causing the market to trend downwards.  20-count Double Horse yarn fell by over ten dollars.  However, certain entities remain unmoved, it is said.

The current yarn situation: The market opened with a scattered and disoriented atmosphere, and everyone was hesitant.  Although the Guangdong buyers had appetite, it wasn't as robust as before.  The opening price fell by eight dollars, with 20-count Double Horse yarn quoted at 488 dollars for outside godown delivery.  Hong Kong buyers only purchased 20 bales.  Recognizing the unfavorable market conditions, ticket holders were eager to sell, causing the market to decline further to 484 dollars, with godown warrants priced at 480 dollars.  The major player began to reappear, offering support at low prices.  However, due to credit constraints, he couldn't act as he pleased.  After the close, sellers continued to unload their holdings, but buyers were scarce, and no compromise was reached.  It's recorded that various buying groups purchased a total of 1,115 bales during the half-day session.  20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 dollars, Double Globe by 2.5 dollars, Special Jin Cheng by 7 dollars, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 3.7 dollars.  The quantity purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 475 Fellow Traders 450 Mainland 110 Yunnan 80 Total 1,115

The Japanese yarn market has turned downward.  The discount rate on banknotes has risen again, and sales are also affected.  Market prices have dropped slightly.  20-count Yueqin is currently quoted at 405 dollars.

### Sino-Foreign Cotton Transactions   Yesterday Saw a Slight Improvement   Selling Prices Were Looser

Cotton transactions showed some activity, but the volume of transactions was minimal.  Factories showed no interest in purchasing.  Fellow traders showed some interest, but most of this cotton was resold to other factories to settle transactions.  However, trading among foreign cotton traders was more active, but selling prices were looser than before the closure.  This was mainly due to the tightening of banknotes.  Supplies from Subei were very scarce.  Only 60 bales of Xia Sha cotton arrived at the docks.  The current cotton transaction details are recorded below:

Wistend 96.00 Fellow traders purchase 800 pieces Payment via banknotes for godown delivery

Xin Te Hua 78.50 Also 300 pieces Also cash

Xia Sha American Cotton 88.00 86.50 Also 200 bales Delivery at the wharf via bank transfer

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday. However, a local firm's telegram predicted no movement. The Indian cotton market was also very sluggish. The Indian monsoon season has already begun, significantly impacting cotton yields. Yesterday, Indian cotton rose by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by over 10 pounds.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are becoming increasingly narrow. Even paying due funds for all arriving ships is proving difficult. The premium on cash increased again yesterday, making it even more difficult for all parties to raise funds. A Qingdao trader, seeing the strong demand for cotton in North China, purchased 800 bales of current cargo Compo cotton, with a godown delivery price of 96 dollars, enlivening foreign cotton transactions since the reopening of customs.

### Grains   Flour Transactions Subside   New Wheat Being Bought by Certain Parties

Flour Yesterday morning was quieter than ever. Both northern and southern merchants were affected by the current situation and the cash problem, and it is feared that a turnaround will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Apart from a few sporadic touches, there has been no wholesale volume sold, and manufacturers are planning to stand by and wait for opportunities. Therefore, No. 2 flour remains at 4 dollars 65 cents in cash and refuses to accept transfers, and the market remains in a wait-and-see situation. As for the retail transactions in this street, after the market closed, the purchases were once stronger, but yesterday due to the urgent need for money and the high discount rate for transfers, the transactions also decreased from more than 10,000 bags to 6,000 to 7,000 bags, it is said.

Wheat Yesterday, the supply of new wheat was slightly higher than before, with about 2,000 bags arriving by wheeled transport. However, the goods and the production areas have also been purchased by certain parties, and there are often messages from across the border, so they are all insistent and unwilling to relax. The market relies on stability. Unified sales opened at 6 dollars 73 cents for Nanjing wheat, 78 cents for Danyang wheat, 88 cents for Suzhou wheat, and 78 cents for Kunshan wheat. More than 1,600 bags were transacted, still purchased by local hoarders and Japanese factories. The market is still firm.

### Shanghai Rice Outflow

Du Geng Yesterday, river bottom rice from various merchants arrived, totaling 1,200 to 1,300 wheeled bags. After reports from Wu that the area was closed off, people's hearts were still firm and the route out was very lively. Sellers are holding out, so the market continues to rise by 2 cents. Although the sales of thick and thin Geng rice in this street are also active, they are not as popular as Wu pointed rice. However, the owners are very determined and the market presents a tight situation. Du Yang pointed rice is similar to the Geng rice market. There is still slack in the route out and it remains weak. Observing the trend of the rice market, in terms of existing inventory, it has been decreasing day by day recently. According to a rice industry survey report, there are still about 400,000 stones, of which 50,000 stones have been sold to the interior and various places within the past week. The sources from various places are mostly blocked. Shanghai rice merchants only care about their own interests and are willing to sell the Shanghai stock of grain to other places. If the rice market has a major impact in the future, rice merchants should be held jointly responsible. The authorities should also prevent the outflow as early as possible to protect the food supply in Shanghai.

Ke Xian Because of rumors of the closure of Wuhu, people's hearts were trending upward again, and merchants and hoarders, seeing the digestion of Ke Xian rice not weakening, all seized the opportunity to get a higher price. Medium-grade broken rice, in the rice market, was even more welcomed by inland merchants: broken rice at about 16 dollars, milled rice at 15 dollars 50 to 60 cents, and brown rice at about 14 dollars were all absorbed by inland merchants. Purchases from rural villages and the shops on this street are also keen and the market continues to rise by 10 to 20 cents. The number of transactions is still more than 4,000 bags, most of which are handled by inland merchants.

Yang Rice Deliveries from set orders have yet to arrive, and the existing Saigon inventory on the market is gradually decreasing. Yesterday, about 200 bags were transacted in the market, and the price was raised by nearly 1 cent. The price opened at 23 dollars 15 cents. However, foreign merchants are still continuing to promote sales, and there are reports of two telegrams being sent out, and a reply and proper delivery may be expected within this week.

### Silk and Tea   New York Closed, Local Silk Trading Not Smooth

Yesterday, New York was closed due to the Democratic Festival. Yokohama silk prices for spot goods fluctuated around 1,200 yuan, and there was no sign of firmness or decline. Although there are rumors that silk stocks in New York are decreasing, it is now the peak month for the appearance of new silk, and both buyers and sellers feel that maintaining the current market price is the most advisable strategy until the relationship between supply and demand changes. Therefore, Yokohama silk prices rose and fell alternately, and the fluctuations were minimal. The spot price was 1,195 yuan, the forward price was 1,130 yuan, and the recent price was 1,175 yuan, which was slightly more than 10 yuan lower than the previous market. However, in the afternoon, it rose by 5 to 10 yuan.

It is said that a portion of fresh cocoons can now be exported from the local silk market, so the market is slightly excited. However, yesterday's silk trading was not smooth due to the closure of the US market. White filature silk, etc., opened with 50 dan, and the market price did not fluctuate greatly. The market price of Ji Li silk can be expected to be firm upwards, because Ji Li silk has not risen sharply since the exchange rate changed.

### Green Tea Trading is Booming

Yesterday, British and French merchants of green tea, in view of the huge demand from abroad, unanimously started searching for goods, and trading became even more vigorous. It still seems that the "Chouxin" category of "Zhen Mei" tea is the most popular. The whole city bought more than 1,300 boxes of green tea from Xiehe, Yihuo, Tongfu, Baochang, and other firms. "Chouxin" was sold at prices ranging from 305 to 346 yuan, "Tong Zhen Mei" was sold at prices ranging from 254 to 280 yuan, and "Xi Xiu Mei" was sold at prices ranging from 53 to 4 yuan. Market prices are trending firm, it is said.

### Miscellaneous Grains   There Are Differences in the Quality of Dalian Soybeans   Depreciated to Boost Sales

Recently, there has been little vitality in the soybean sales market. Although the amount of exports continues unabated, most of them are direct transshipments, and the original source is endless. Yesterday, Dalian Sipingjie soybeans (today, the quality of this soybean has some differences, and it is not as standardized as in the past), in the face of the sluggish sales situation, took the path of depreciation, so it was thrown down by 10 cents from the high price of 9 dollars and 65 cents to 9 dollars and 55 cents, causing the domestic sales of Xichang and other places to rise sharply, with a total of 11 or 12 trucks transacted. In addition, two trucks of Bengbu beans were properly sold at a price of 8 dollars and 82 cents. Small batches were sold locally: 260 bags of Pudong Du soybeans at a price of 9 dollars and 50 cents, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans at a price of 8 dollars and 65 cents, and 50 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans at a price of 8 dollars and 65 cents.

### Sugar Market   Spot Dutch Red Rises Sharply by 8 Cents

According to yesterday's sugar market London telegram: August 8 shillings 2 pence 25, down 1 penny 75; December 6 shillings 2 pence; March of next year 6 shillings 3 pence, up 2 pennies and a half. Hong Kong telegram: the cost of raw white sugar brought to Shanghai is 11 Hong Kong dollars, down 4 cents. Therefore, the local guild priced, the spot 24 raw white sugar was slightly looser, the local godown price was 29 dollars and 80 cents, the outside godown price was 6 cents, and the transit bonded godown price was 21 dollars and 40 cents, all down 1 cent. However, spot Dutch red sugar rose sharply by 8 cents to 21 dollars and 60 cents, and the transit goods rose by 4 cents to 15 dollars and 40 cents. Tai Gu sugar rose and fell little, and the upper and lower grades maintained their original prices. At the same time, the spot red H mark also rose by half a dollar to 20 dollars and a half. The Chaozhou guild issued more than 80 bags of premium Diao Qing, priced at 17 dollars, and the Jianzhou guild opened up more than 100 bags of miscellaneous foreign sugar, priced at 20 dollars.

### The Evolution of Woolen Fabric Brands in the Past Seventy Years

‚Äî Zhou Zhifeng

The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai began in the Tongzhi years, and it has been 70 years since then. Therefore, it is not only a pioneer in the whole of China, but also a hub for imports and exports. In these 70 years, the rise and fall of the woolen fabric market, the annual expansion of business, and the progress of domestic and foreign sales, and the innovation of patterns and colors will not be discussed for the time being (the reporter will have the opportunity to describe them one by one). What is discussed here is the past and present changes in the woolen fabric industry.

In the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, the woolen fabric market was concentrated in the Broadway and Pengpu Road area of Hongkou, with more than 20 companies including Xinyi Gong, Renyi Gong, Hongji, Laoshengji, Quanji, Zhaoji, He Jinfeng, Guangsheng, Gongxing, Lianxing, Gongda, Xingtai, Jiatai, Yuantai, Henghe, Zhenda, Xinkang, Xiangyuan, Futai, Yongtai, Xianchang, Xieshengyu, Yuanfeng, Xinyi, and Xiangtaiyu, Ruitai Chang, etc. After the European War, it suffered a major blow from the shilling, and all but Xianchang suffered losses. (Because Wu Shandeng, the manager of Xianchang, had invested all his money at 89 shillings, he was able to make money. The others were all looking long, and less than one-third of them had purchased goods. Afterwards, the exchange rate plummeted, causing them to suffer heavy losses.) As a result, countless companies went bankrupt one after another. After the crisis passed, it returned to normal. New companies included Yichangtai, Fushun, Chen Fji, Yuandachang, Gonghe, Yongxinxiang, and Fuchang. The reorganized ones included Yuantai being reorganized into Yuanda. However, except for Quanji, Zhaoji, He Jinfeng, Henghe, Shunchangxiang, and Lianxingchang, the old ones have all closed down. At this time, there were only a dozen or so old and new companies in the Shanghai offshore goods gang, but the Dalu gang on Qipan Street in Shanghai suddenly flourished, and the market was divided into Shanghai offshore and Shanghai Dalu factions. The so-called Shanghai Dalu gang refers to more than 20 companies including Xinfeng, Meilun, Chunheyong, Taiheli, Hualun, Fuxin, Huaxin, Zhida, Yuantai, Xingchangxiang, Xiexing, Huikang, Jukang, Fukang, Yikang, Chengda, Huakang, Dalun, Yongfeng, Jiufeng, Shixin, Huachang, and Yuanhexian, etc. Those who opened in the Xinhe area (specializing in lower-grade, shoddy goods) include a few companies such as Yongyutai, Gurui Ji, Juxing, and Xingyu. It can be seen that the prosperity of the Dalu gang at that time and the number of shops had already exceeded the offshore goods gang, causing the center of the woolen fabric market to gradually shift to Shanghai, and the woolen fabric industry association also moved from Shangyang to Shanghai at this time.

In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was unified, and the sales of woolen fabrics were very smooth. However, foreign exchange suddenly changed, followed by China's tariff autonomy and the revision of national tax rules. The woolen fabric industries of the Shangyang and Shanghai gangs underwent further changes. Larger Western clothing stores in the Nanjing Road area, such as Yuchangxiang, Wangxingchang, Rongchangxiang, and Wangshuntai, etc., all carried out offshore goods. Shunxing Dechang on Sichuan Road also produced samples, and Zhang Longtai, a tailor shop with Laohexing, all set up woolen fabric stores. New companies in the Shangyang offshore goods gang included Yifeng, Hanfeng, Jingtai, Taifeng, Ziyuan, Anshengchang, Fengyu, Tianfeng, and Yuji. New companies in the Shanghai Dalu gang included Shengchang, Xinchang, Yuanchang, Huafutai, Huasheng, Xiangxing, Yuchang, Qiafeng, Hengfeng, Hefeng, Meifeng, Fuchangxiang, and Wanchengyong. Afterwards, more than a dozen companies, including Dasheng, Yongxing, Yukang, Dekang, Yida, Hongxing, Huachengxiang, Tonghexian, Jiuhe, and Taifeng, Rendexiang, have also been opened, but all of them have closed down to this day. The woolen fabric guild has also moved from Nanjing Road to Qipan Street, because the woolen fabric market has been concentrated there. At this time, there were a total of 75 member shops, large and small, in the trade association, and the executive committee members were Xu Meiqing, Ge Jechen, Liu Dacai, Hong Fuyuan, Chen Meifang, Fei Rongfu, Zhou Qifeng, Wang Lianfang, Chen Keting, Wang Houfu, Chen Shunan, Zhang Jinguan, Ni Guocai, and Wang Shenghe. (To be continued)

### Piece Goods   Tianjin Merchants Launch Autumn Goods   Eastern Market Declines Due to High Cash Prices

Domestic Cloth Yesterday, the cash discount rate for the legal tender suddenly rose, and the opening price for Yihuo coarse cloth fell by 5 cents per piece. The prices for each cloth for transfer sales are still firm. The current deposit price for Qingfeng Factory twill last month was 5 cents and 5 li per yard for transfer, and this month it increased by 1.5 cents, and the line tweed also increased by 2 cents, opening at 5 cents and 45 cents. Sales are slightly more active in the north, and the Yantai merchants continued to handle 40 to 50 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, line tweed and coarse cloth. The Tianjin merchants originally ordered a huge amount, and the autumn season orders are also gradually being launched, and dozens of pieces of blue cloth, line tweed and other goods continue to be loaded. After the Yunnan merchants restored postal delivery once last month, they immediately stopped receiving them, and due to the difficult transportation during the extraordinary period, the goods were often stranded midway, and the turnover was not smooth. Moreover, the exchange rate has soared to 12 dollars 50 cents, making it more and more difficult to receive funds, so new transactions in Sichuan and Yunnan are extremely cold. Local retail transactions in this street are still frequent, and more than 1,000 pieces of poplin, twill, bleached cloth, foreign yarn and printed cloth were sold, and 40 to 50 pieces of white coarse cloth and fine twill were also handled. The Hong Kong merchants added 30 pieces of fine twill and Zhenzhong Guoqing and other brands.

Eastern Cloth Yesterday, the fine cloth and fine twill market declined uniformly due to the continued increase in the cash discount. Each piece fell by about 10 cents. The current price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 14 dollars 10 cents to 15 cents, and Yanghe fine twill was priced at 13 dollars 90 cents per piece. Real sales were as rare as stars in the morning, and the market atmosphere was dull. The market "football" trading is also far from what it used to be, so the total daily transactions among peers are still only 200 to 300 pieces.

### Woolen Fabric Orders Plunge

Yesterday, there were still few woolen fabric spot transactions, and market prices remained high. However, transactions for foreign firm orders plummeted. No one from the offshore, mainland, or brand merchant groups inquired about prices. The orders that were about to be negotiated and those that had been finalized but had not yet been delivered were now mostly being rejected one after another. This is because most people in the industry still expect the current 6 pence and 5 exchange rate to fall further. The cost of woolen fabrics will inevitably increase sharply, and most are unwilling to take the risk of ordering. As a result, the business of general British, American, French, German, Polish, Czech, and Italian commercial firms in Shanghai has once again become deserted.

### Medicinal Materials   Patchouli Shortage Causes Prices to Soar

Patchouli, a Chinese medicine, can relieve exterior syndromes and dispel evil, enter the spleen and reach the lungs. Its fragrance can promote the middle, relax the diaphragm, awaken the stomach and refresh the mind. Its nature is slightly warm and can also ward off epidemics and stop vomiting. It is also very good at dispersing, so it is an essential medicine in the summer. Now is the peak season for sales. According to industry insiders, the stock of good quality goods on the ground is not high, and the supply from Hainan has been interrupted, which has caused people's hearts to be high. Recently, the selling price on the market has been rising day by day, and has risen by as much as 24 or 25 yuan compared to before.

### Seafood   Jian Mushrooms Rise Significantly

Recently, Hong Kong merchants have been frequently purchasing shiitake mushrooms, and the market trend is still continuing. For example, the price of Jian mushrooms sold yesterday was 320 yuan, which was 45 yuan higher than the previous market. A few pieces of Jiangxi mushrooms were transacted. Because they were of lower quality, they were slightly moldy and priced at 318 dollars 60 cents.

### Qicai (Seaweed) Remains Firm

Sales of Qicai are still active today. Sales continued yesterday, with Wudun vegetables priced at 21 yuan, Xilan vegetables at 24 yuan, Longya vegetables at 23 yuan, and Shimao vegetables at 28 yuan, each rising by 1 or 2 yuan compared to the previous market.

### M√≠ngf«î High-Quality Goods Are Scarce

Recently, new Mingfu goods have been arriving one after another, so the stock here is still quite abundant. The current Ningbo ordinary grade is still sold at 28 yuan, the premium grade is 40 yuan, and the authentic Zhoushan goods are priced at 68 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher, and the supply is extremely short, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply.

### North-South Goods   Cold Storage Lychee Rises Sharply

Since Jinshan branches were stored in cold storage, the cost has been rising daily, and the supply is also scarce. Therefore, the trend is becoming tighter. The cold storage yuan branches in yesterday's market have been shouted out at 70 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than before. Cold storage glutinous rice branches are particularly firm and expensive, and must be sold at 150 yuan, with an increase of nearly 20 yuan, it is said.

### Longan Recovers by One Yuan

Longan was once suspended due to the high premium on cash, but recently, as the premium has eased, and the brand holders have opened slightly to avoid roasting and storing for too long. It was found that the previous market had fallen by 2 yuan and has now recovered by 1 yuan, with 700 to 800 pieces transacted. The rest may need to be opened again, and most of them will be stored in roasting godowns to wait for the post-market transshipment and then be opened for cashing in, it is said.

### Xuzhou Vegetables Will Soon Be New

Since the fall of Shantou, the sales area for daylily has become narrower, so although the premium is high, there is no sharp increase. Yesterday, dozens of bags of ordinary goods were opened, priced at 20 yuan. High-quality goods are still scarce and difficult to loosen, and must be 31 to 2 yuan. Lower grades are only about 17 yuan. It is heard that this year's new goods have not been able to appear on the market in time due to frequent traffic obstacles, but a small number of Xuzhou goods may arrive. It is estimated that the goods will be available by the middle of this month, it is said.

### Coal   Borneo Coal Remains Expensive

The bituminous coal business is plain and weak, and the market transacts less than 500 tons per day. However, due to cost concerns, the owners are holding on, and the market is still firm as usual. Yesterday, Borneo coal was sold by the brand, and a small number opened, with lump coal priced at 47 yuan per ton and screened lumps at 51 yuan. From the peer's godown, it is necessary to add other miscellaneous expenses to deliver to the customer's home.

### Small Zi Coal Arrives in Small Quantities, Insufficient for Distribution, Price Difficult to Fall, 7,000 Tons of Indian Coal Arrive in Shanghai

Hongji small zi coal had a shortage of spot goods, and the opening price has been repeatedly raised, and the highest price has reached 56 yuan per ton, and there is no supply of goods. The Dehui Foreign Firm recently had a slight arrival of goods, but it was only 150 to 60 tons, which was not enough for distribution, so the price is still difficult to fall. Delivery is subject to additional charges, plus the consumption of screened crumbs, and the retail price is 7 dollars 25 cents per basket, which is still in the nature of a "service".

The "Winkfild" wheel, managed by Yihuo Foreign Firm on the 4th, arrived at Wusongkou from Calcutta with 7,058 tons of coal. Since there were no docks or pontoons to berth in the Huangpu River, it anchored outside the harbor to wait. It is now learned that pontoons 34 and 35 are empty, and the company ordered the ship to enter the harbor at 6:00 a.m. yesterday and anchor at pontoons 34 and 35 for transshipment. In addition, the "Baron Inckhape", also managed by the company, is also transporting 9,100 tons of coal from Calcutta, and the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Saturday (8th) of this week.

### Metals   Pig Iron Sales Are Stagnant

The pig iron sales market has merchants and external customers in this street but since recently, the price has been high, so business in this street is unusually quiet, and external merchant gangs (such as Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, Ningbo, Fujian, Anhui, and the Yangtze River Road, etc.) have almost no goods exported due to environmental and shipping schedules, etc. Market prices have soared due to the increase in various goods in this city. For example, the market price of No. 1 Indian pig iron is 265 yuan per ton, No. 2 is 255 yuan, No. 1 Russian pig iron is estimated at 255 yuan per ton, and the No. 1 Yangtze River Li River product is priced at 255 yuan per ton. The price of No. 2 goods is 245 yuan, all of which are more than 20 yuan higher than the previous market.

### Black Iron Sheet Prices Increase, Real Sales Are Depressed

Although the market for black iron sheets was once lively, it was caused by factories and customers competing to purchase them, but since recently, the prices of the goods have increased, and the sales from various places have been stagnant. For example, the hot water bottle factories in Shanghai have little activity. In addition, customers from Tianjin, Qingdao, etc. also purchased very little. Therefore, the lively market is no longer what it used to be. However, the market price is 4 to 5 yuan higher than before. For example, the price of 3 to 10 sheets is 28 yuan per load, the special price of 11 sheets is 29 yuan, the price of 12 sheets is 30 yuan, and the price of 13 sheets is 32 yuan (the above are all 3 feet and 6 feet). The price of 18 sheets is 27 yuan and 50 cents, and the 2-foot and 6-foot goods, it is estimated that only 30 to 40 loads were transacted yesterday.

### A Must-Read for Housewives

‚Äî Wisdom

When leaving home at night, do not turn off all the lights. It is best to leave one or two lights on, because thieves are less likely to enter a room with lights on.

Do not put your keys under the mat, on the door, or in the mailbox.

Do not put money or valuables under the carpet, or hang them behind the mirror, in pottery, or under the mat. Because these are the first places thieves search or pay attention to after entering the house.

Do not put a chain lock on the outside of the door, because this is like telling people that you are not at home.

If you lose your keys, do not forget to get a new lock.

If you find a thief in the house, do not turn on the lights, just quietly call the police station.

Do not let those who call themselves goods salesmen, meter readers, or runners into your house without showing a certificate. If in doubt, call their employer before letting them in or talking to them in the corridor.

Do not buy cheap things from strangers, because these things are counterfeit or stolen. It is best to call the police immediately. If these things are really valuable, they will definitely keep them for themselves, or sell them to their friends.

Do not neglect to inquire about the guarantors of your servants, and do not just ask the seat head on the phone. It is best to ask in person.

Do not believe that someone is a good person because they are neatly dressed, and do not flaunt your own wealth. Modern bad people will never tell you that they are bad people.

Do not put your purse on the counter when buying things in the store. This is a good opportunity that thieves are constantly looking for.

Do not doze off on the tram or bus. This gives pickpockets a good opportunity to steal your valuables.

If someone asks you the time, do not take out your watch to look, this often gives thieves a good opportunity to steal your watch.

In public places, do not let anyone cover your face with a newspaper; this person wants your watch or other valuables; they are obscuring your vision to facilitate their accomplices' theft.

### Rain Hat

‚Äî Lu Lishi

For days on end, the plum rains fall, making it truly inconvenient to go out. Carrying an umbrella and wearing overshoes is such a burden, especially when wearing a Western suit. What kind of hat is suitable to wear that can both keep out the rain and remain undamaged? Let's discuss it here:

Some people use old woolen hats as rain hats, which is indeed economical. However, hats made of inferior materials can only withstand light rain. During the plum rain season, the raindrops will penetrate them without hindrance. Moreover, woolen hats are already out of season. It is best to wear straw hats. Recently, there is a kind of madder-dyed straw hat on the market. The styles are very fashionable, ranging from ten and a half yuan to fifty or sixty yuan. You can run in the rain with them, and the rain will definitely not seep into the roots of your hair. When you return home, wipe it with a cloth, and it will look as good as new. It will not damage the original hat material at all. On the contrary, it will wash away the dust that has accumulated on it in sunny weather. Therefore, this kind of hat does not need to be taken to a laundry and dyeing shop for cleaning. However, the price is too expensive, and ordinary people cannot afford it, so they have to think of other ways.

If you only have a woolen hat, you can also wear it on rainy days. Don't worry about the rain stains on the hat not being removable, even if it is a white woolen hat. We have a method: after the weather clears, wash the woolen hat worn on rainy days with a dry cleaning solvent, hang it up to dry in the sun, making it evenly dry and clean. Then buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide (available in pharmacies) and spray it two or three times. Each time you spray, you must wait for it to dry completely before spraying the second time, until the rain stains are completely removed. If the stain is removed after one application, of course, there is no need to spray a second time.

Indeed, rainy days are most difficult for those who wear Western suits. To ensure that the hat worn does not lose its elegance and nobility, you can only use the above method. If you want to avoid trouble, you should have a top hat that can be used in both sunny and rainy weather!

### A Few Matters Concerning Living

‚Äî Huang Hu

Soldiers live in barracks, and refugees live in grass shacks. It doesn't matter to them, even if it does, they don't have money, so it's still the same as it doesn't matter.

Summer has arrived, and mosquitoes and bedbugs are rampant again, impossible to kill all and impossible to catch them all. It is truly a sweating matter. But as long as you are from a middle-class family or above, you have the ability to buy medicine to exterminate them. Mosquito repellent incense, mosquito coils, bedbug powder... there are plenty on the market.

But how are these things actually formulated? This is probably what people who want to know the reason are eager to know!

First, let's talk about mosquito repellent. The most common mosquito repellents are mosquito repellent perfume, mosquito coils, mosquito repellent powder, and mosquito repellent sticks. Now, let's write down their ingredients and preparation methods one by one:

The ingredients of mosquito repellent perfume are 100 grams of cedar oil, 100 grams of lemongrass oil, 100 grams of eucalyptus oil, 100 grams of camphor oil, 100 grams of clove oil, and then add 90% (purity) alcohol to make a total of 1 kilogram, mix well, and filter with talc powder. When using, apply to the face, neck, and legs. Mosquitoes will smell the fragrance and avoid it.

The ingredients of mosquito coils are 10 grams of benzoin powder, 10 grams of cassia bark powder, 100 grams of pyrethrum powder, and a small amount of tragacanth gum. Mix appropriately and make it into a spiral, linear, or stick shape. Dry it in the sun. If making spiral incense, you can add an appropriate amount of verdigris to make it green. This product is more expensive to make, but it is very effective. Most commercially available products contain sawdust and cypress incense.

The ingredients of mosquito repellent powder are 5 grams of eucalyptus oil phenol, 25 grams of tea powder, 35 grams of talc powder, and 35 grams of starch. First, grind the tea into fine powder, then add the powders, and finally add the eucalyptus oil phenol. When using, apply to various parts of the skin.

The ingredients of mosquito repellent sticks are 5 grams of star anise oil, 5 grams of anise oil, 25 grams of cocoa butter, 25 grams of tea powder, and 10 grams of beeswax. Melt them at low temperature, use glass or metal tubes as molds, and wrap them in tin foil or pack them in mint lozenge wooden boxes.

As for bedbug repellent liquid and bedbug powder, bedbug repellent liquid is divided into three types: A, B, and C. The ingredients of type A are 5 grams of carbolic acid, 50 grams of ether, and 150 grams of petroleum ether. The ingredients of type B are 100 grams of kerosene and 100 grams of turpentine. The ingredients of type C are 100 grams of tobacco leaves, an appropriate amount of lemon balm oil, and 1 kilogram of petroleum ether. The method of making type C: soak the tobacco leaves in petroleum ether, filter after five days; dissolve the other ingredients in the filtrate.

The ingredients of bedbug powder are 100 grams of pyrethrum powder, 8 grams of carbolic acid, and 6 grams of citric acid. Mix and shake well.

In addition, rats are also one of the dregs, so rat poison will also be described here.

Ordinary rat poison is also divided into three types: A, B, and C. The ingredients of type A are 100 grams of gypsum, 100 grams of wheat flour, and 5 drops of anise oil. The ingredients of type B are 4 grams of arsenic acid, 38 grams of lard, 58 grams of wheat flour, and 0.5 grams of anise oil. The ingredients of type C are 30 grams of barium carbonate, 8 grams of barley flour, 15 grams of glycerin, and 60 grams of cheese.

### Foot Ailments

‚Äî Zhong Maochang

Amidst this chorus of rising prices, life on this isolated island becomes increasingly difficult. We must begin by tightening our belts. It is often said that clothing is the most challenging, but one can strive to economize on both clothing and travel. One can seek simple cloth garments, and forgo transportation, relying on one's own feet to reach far and wide. However, I have long suffered from rheumatism and bone pain. During the plum rain season, my legs invariably feel numb and insensitive, with aching pains occurring frequently, making it difficult to move. I was once treated by Doctor Li in my hometown and recovered without incident. Now, having come to Shanghai to work, I am constantly on the move, running around every day. Recently, the old ailment has relapsed, making it inconvenient to walk. Reluctantly, I resort to public buses and trams, which I usually avoid, but fares have also increased, costing me a great deal each day. Later, my knees became swollen and painful, preventing me from going out. Confined to my small room, I felt doubly miserable. I consulted a surgeon, who said that I was developing gonitis. I took medicine for several days without improvement, and it even worsened. A neighbor told me that Changnian Chinese Pharmacy in Tongfu Village, Tongfu Road, sells Huangshan Health Bone Grass, which can treat severe rheumatism. I asked someone to buy two boxes and take them. The swelling and pain subsided slightly. I continued to take two dozen, and then I regained my freedom, the illness as if lost. Today, I am still out and about, my gait as normal as before. The name "Health Bone" is truly not in vain. I recall years ago when I traveled with friends to Huangshan, exploring the famous mountains and scenic spots, with their many ancient pines, old trees, rare flowers, and exotic grasses. I often did not recognize their names, nor did I pay much attention to them. I never imagined that there would be a miraculous herb that could cure my foot ailment. I must record this and tell others who suffer from the same condition.

### Unsafe Economical Meals

### Weekly Economical Menu

‚Äî Ms. Hua Ying

Potatoes, commonly known as foreign yams, are also one of the vegetables richest in vitamins. Moreover, the price is relatively low. In my economical menu, they should occupy an important position. There are many ways to cook them, and they go well with both meat and vegetables. If compared to people, they are like a friendly and sociable friend. When making coffee, potatoes are indispensable. And braised pork, lamb, etc., may as well have them added. As for vegetarian dishes, then braised vegetarian ten-scenery also needs to use them, as with cabbage being the main ingredients. Recently, my family often eats two dishes, one meat and one vegetarian, both using potatoes, and I will introduce them to the readers to try. The meat dish is mashed potato beef patties. Peel the potatoes, cook them until they are tender, add a little bread crumbs and water chestnut powder, fry them in oil until golden brown, then cut the beef into small pieces and make them into patties with onions, stir-fry them in a pot, and add some water chestnut powder inside, so the beef will not feel old and tough. When eating, mix the potato patties and beef patties together, which is very delicious. If you don‚Äôt eat beef, you can use pork. The vegetarian dish is to peel the potatoes, cook them until tender, mash them, add chopped scallions or finely chopped pickled vegetables, and fry them together, which can also be eaten with rice.

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Overseas Chinese

‚Äî Old Friends of Chaoyang

In the eyes of the Chinese people, overseas Chinese can be divided into three periods over the centuries. During the Qing Dynasty's isolation policy, the West, America, and Southeast Asia were all considered uncivilized lands. The government regarded overseas Chinese as mere weeds, and the overseas Chinese viewed the government as bandits. During the flourishing period of the Republic of China, they were eager for internal warfare. Those who had a smattering of foreign languages became ministers, regarded by the people at home as emperors and gods. The government regarded overseas Chinese as dogs and horses, and the overseas Chinese viewed the government as strangers. In recent years, with the increasing foreign threats, the thoughts and spirits of the entire nation, from top to bottom, have shifted from scattered to unified. Remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have become a vast source to supplement and balance the country's revenue and expenditure. The official reliance on overseas Chinese is roughly like that of limbs, and the maintenance of the government by overseas Chinese is mostly like that of the heart. Therefore, when a few resident envoys, who usually wield power and influence, encounter a situation where their ability is insufficient and a flaw occurs in their inability to protect overseas Chinese, they try to shirk responsibility, which is also a waste of breath. The invulnerability of the overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, I will focus on the four necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation to clarify the reality of the improved living conditions of those who have gone abroad to earn a living for the country.

First, Clothing: Except for sailors from Fujian and Guangdong, who serve on Western merchant ships and are assigned to tasks such as stoking fires and washing clothes, where short blue and white shirts and pants are most suitable. Those who live in cities, whether in Europe or America, all wear Western suits, and our overseas Chinese cannot be an exception. The degree of superiority or inferiority of their living standards can be judged by the quality of their hats and the difference in the quality of their overcoats and short jackets. Secondly, all overseas Chinese are fond of wearing the Republic of China's blue sky, white sun, and cloisonn√© silver badge to distinguish themselves from other Eastern ethnic groups from various countries. In recent years, among the Zhejiang Chinese from Wenzhou, Qingtian, and other places who reside in various countries in Western Europe, there is a small portion who make a living by making and selling ties.

Second, Transportation: The new era replaces walking with vehicles, which is deeply in line with the proverb that every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. What is even faster than vehicles is airplanes. Although there is no previous record of wealthy overseas Chinese owning their own airplanes, in Western America and Southeast Asia, where the history of overseas Chinese is the longest, it is not uncommon for them to have one to dozens of cars. Secondly, such as in the flat and vast Netherlands in Western Europe without high mountains, the Zhejiang Chinese from Wenzhou seen there, from Hantang Amster-dam in the north to Junwanglin Hertogen-bosch in the south, all competing to ride bicycles to fly on different paths for the weaving and mending utensils and so on. Next, the thing that best demonstrates the greatness of our Chinese people's ability to make a living is the long-distance walking tour that crosses the two continents of Asia and Europe. The people of Tianmen, Hubei, with their paper flowers, the people of Yantai, Shandong, with their silk materials, the people of Qingtian, Zhejiang, with their mosaic work, in recent times have penetrated deep into Russia, and the reachers have reached Paris. The vastness of the journey, perhaps thousands of miles or tens of thousands of miles, if people get good things and evolve them into notes and broadcast them on the silver screen, it will definitely greatly increase the perseverance of countless rising youths who hear about the inland and the border. Ms. Huang Yiguang, who married from Guangzhou and made a walking trip to the world, also took the universe as a school and nature as a textbook, placing herself among the pioneers of advanced countries, and should be ashamed of nothing.

Third, Housing: The characteristic enjoyment of Chinese people in Europe and America, and the thing they feel most different in their standard of living, is "housing". British and Americans love quiet and hate noise, which has become a habit. The places where overseas Chinese first had contact with overseas were mostly in Britain and America, and the most difficult habit to overcome was "housing". In Western cities, cats are silent all day long, and the Holy Child closes its heavy doors and does not hear crying. A very small number of wealthy Chinese children residing in Morningsite Heights in New York were forced to move because a certain child's crying one night caused all the residents to be forced to move elsewhere. To this day, there are special districts in various cities in North America, such as Chinatown, and one of the biggest reasons is the restriction of habits. It can be asserted. Today, times are different and labor is different. Since the Chinese people's resistance against Japan, they have been highly regarded in European and American society. Ms. Yang Huimin's talk about her personal experience in traveling to the United States has further broken the sycophantic view of those who worship foreigners and despise the Chinese. Even at the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939, it was known to promote Chinatown to stand out from the world. As Mr. Dai Jitao said, the word "China" will one day be transformed into a good name because of the efforts of the Chinese people. Another reason why Chinese people's housing and Western people's affairs are so different is frugality. The Confucian masses work hard every day and night, their minds are keen on saving the country, and they serve themselves very modestly. During the national crisis, it is very appropriate, even if the purchase coupons are still abolished by a certain ambassador to the Republic of China, the opposite is true. Therefore, although the life of citizens in various landlocked countries in Europe is not as low and strict as that of British and Americans, Gharlotten-hmrg in Berlin, the Ding district in Paris, and Katen-dreeht in Rotterdam have also been as convenient as New York's Lower Town to accommodate Chinese people.

Fourth, Food: What our China is most proud of in the world is the beauty and abundance of its dishes, and Cantonese chefs are especially unique in their skills. Looking at the restaurants in various European and American countries, only Erchusi in Paris, who has the oldest qualifications, is from Nanjing, and the rest are almost all from Bin'an, Guangdong. There are seven of them in the Netherlands. The oldest is the China Building organized by Yuan Hua (located at 18 Delistraat, Rotterdam). The second is Guangxing Building founded by Wu Fu (Intangible Han Dandan). The next is Zhongshan Building managed by Deng Sheng (Rotterdam). The next is the Far East Hotel of Zhang Guoshu (next to the Peace Palace in The Hague). The next is the Zaidong Building of Wu Zijun (72 Grindstone Street, Hantang). The next is the Nanyang Building of Chou Zu (50 Thomsonlaan, The Hague). And the smallest is Feng Sheng's good restaurant (21 Guanye Street, Leiden). All seven are owned by Bin'an people.

Others such as the Chinese Restaurant on the Tian'anmen Straight Street leading to Saint-Germain Avenue BD.St.Germain in Paris, the Wanhualou and Tanhualou in Paris and London, which have become brother companies, the Shanghai Building in San Francisco, the Nanjing Building in Washington, and the Divine Continent Building in Philadelphia, are all due to the Cantonese overseas Chinese setting up restaurants that make the scholars and merchants who travel overseas feel the joy of being at home. As for the food of sailors, it is even more difficult among the Qinglian, which seems to be not easy for those pedestrians to know. Mr. Zhou Yijie, who was elected as the vice chairman of the National Diplomacy Committee during the Pacific Conference, once said in his experience: "Working hard on the ship, although the scenery and waves do not allow sleep, the sea must eat if there is no strength, and although it is vomiting, it should continue to eat. In this way, it can gradually become a habit from reluctantly. The food method to avoid dizziness and vomiting is to avoid tea and water. Those who work on the ship every know to persuade people to chew more pot-scorched rice, and the mouth contains codonopsis." Mr. Zhou's statement also helps the self-reliant students who go abroad, and can be combined with the new medicine prepared for passengers on the new era airplane to prevent vomiting, which can be combined with each other.

### Universal Love

‚Äî Geng Zhi

As soon as you mention benevolence, you have to bring in righteousness, or even morality by association. But everyone knows about benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and the two old masters, Confucius and Mencius, have said so much and lectured so much, it seems that there is no need to add another word. However, in this civilized age, there are many things that did not exist in the past, and the scope of benevolence has also increased a lot, so it is necessary to broaden this benevolence a bit to show it to future generations.

For example, benevolence is compassion, and compassion is charity. In today's charitable undertakings, it is better to send him to the Western Paradise as soon as possible, which is more appropriate. There are also items such as deducting relief funds or selling relief grain, which is because those who manage this undertaking feel that relieving themselves is more urgent than relieving the refugees, and without relieving themselves, it is difficult to relieve the refugees. Their actions are still with compassion. Similarly, in order to run charitable undertakings, it is necessary to add a few cars, and the food, clothing, and housing must be more particular, all of which are reasonable, because without doing so, their precious work will be more time-consuming, and the precious bodies that are related to the safety of so many people will be unwell. As for the poor and beggars wandering on the streets, there is no need to provide relief to encourage their self-reliance. Once they die of cold and hunger, then provide them with coffins and burial, which is even more immeasurable merit, because abandoning corpses in the open is something that the benevolent cannot bear. And cleaning them up, so as to avoid decay, epidemic, and harm to oneself, is it not a benevolent and righteous act?

I have also heard of a type of philanthropist whose actions are truly inconceivable. He has money, so he goes to collect many poor girls, living in the courtyard he designates, never allowed to leave the garden gate for the rest of their lives, serving as his unnamed but de facto concubines, so that they can eat endlessly for the rest of their lives. Of course, everyone praises him, because if he did not do this, these poor girls might have filled the gullies long ago. So now some smaller philanthropists go to adopt a few poor children, boys or girls, teaching them to sing operas, teaching them to dance, etc., with "a skill," earning money for him, supporting him and supporting themselves, so we can only praise him.

However, the benevolence of charitable undertakings is still social and personal, and ultimately not as great as the benevolence of the state. The benevolence of the state is the so-called benevolent government. We already know a little about what large-scale charitable undertakings are, so we cannot but know what large-scale benevolent government is, which is also called broadening.

Originally, the benevolent government passed down from ancient sages was to provide relief to widowers, widows, orphans, and the lonely, so that there would be "no resentful women within, and no unmarried men without." Now, indeed, some people do this; however, their manpower and methods must first create many widowers, widows, orphans, lonely people, resentful women, and unmarried men as preparation for relief. They say that without doing so, benevolent government cannot be implemented.

In addition, it is said that there is another kind of benevolent government that provides relief to anyone. For example, if you have been bullied and want to take revenge, he will come to advise you not to take revenge, saying, once you take revenge, since the outcome is not yet determined, there is danger to be taken. If you fail, you will not survive. If you win, you will inevitably make others unable to step down, and it will lead to mutual destruction. It is better to bow your head and seek peace with those who bully us, which is more sure, enough to shrink your head without danger, and preserve your life. ‚Ä¶ They have the legacy of "the king going to Bin," and the benevolence is spread far beyond "King Wen's governing with benevolence." I think the people of the world and future generations will definitely write a special book for them in history and sing their praises again and again!

However, such benevolent government is only advocated by people, and whether it will work is still unknown. If they really get it to work, maybe everyone will truly ascend to "the other shore"! Alas, benevolent government!

I remember a famous monk who made a gatha when he ate eggs. The last two sentences are: "The old monk will take you to the Western Paradise, to avoid eating a knife in the world." This monk is indeed a benevolent gentleman. The benevolence I want to broaden is mostly equivalent to this monk's eating eggs. Smart people can infer from this, and I will not "give another example."

### Light Is Already Beckoning

### Rain

‚Äî Li Qiao

‚ÄîMemories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou

In the misty dawn, the procession resembled a long serpent, winding along the ridges of the fields. As far as the eye could see, the boundless fields were filled with ripening wheat, parched and dry. The grains, each and every one, were so plump and lovely, yet left to waste in the fields, exposed to the wind, slowly decaying!

As the night receded, the villages, scattered across this vast land like exquisite little parks, appeared in their pleasing green attire, clear and distinct. These villages all shared the same layout: they were encircled by a defensive ditch, along which were planted jujube and mulberry trees. The thatched cottages, made of sorghum stalks, were half-hidden within the groves. The villages lacked the pungent odor of cow dung found in southern villages, and entering them felt like stepping into a small park, evoking a lingering reluctance to depart.

After passing Zhu Village, the sky suddenly grew somber, a fierce wind whipped up, followed by rain.

The procession continued its advance. The rain, pelting the sun-scorched heads, brought a comforting coolness. However, it quickly soaked everyone, raindrops coursing down faces like streams and dripping onto the drenched clothing‚Ä¶

"The commander's order: Pass it on‚Äîrun!"

"The commander's order: Pass it on‚Äîrun!"

The command echoed, fading into the distance, and the procession quickened its pace.

The road, barely wide enough for two to run abreast, was riddled with puddles of muddy water. Stepping onto this muddy path, individuals stumbled one after another, yet immediately picked themselves up, desperately pushing forward towards our destination. Was this not a symbol of our current resistance: though beset by setbacks, so long as we press on, victory will be ours?

Sometime in the afternoon, we arrived at Li Xin Settlement, a substantial earthen town. Though the populace had not entirely fled, they remained huddled within their homes, doors firmly shut‚Ä¶

They seemed to harbor some misunderstanding of us. We immediately found someone to roam the streets, sounding a gong:

"This is our army! Quickly open your shops! Fair trade, no price gouging allowed!"

After the gong sounded, the firmly shut shop doors did indeed open. Before each shop, a throng of people in drenched clothing gathered, creating a bustle of business that had never been seen before. The shopkeepers, happily bustling about, seemed to be smiling inwardly: "These, indeed, are our army!..."

The rain grew heavier and heavier. Late that night, an allied force, braving the torrential downpour, surged into the town. Hearing the clamorous footsteps, one could not help but think: Good, we continue fighting, we are not alone!

### My Dream

‚Äî Qian Changnian

People often harbor many dreams, because human emotions blindly pull people's hearts to fly in all directions, just as walking without a fixed route, unable to recognize the direction, and unable to find an end. Those fleeting, wonderful, and strange dreams create in people an unstable mood like a paper kite floating, and a chaotic feeling like the shadows of slender willow branches being blown in the breeze.

Here, you get no stimulation, nor do you feel tired, it really feels like you are in a "dream"; here, you get no moment of stability, not a moment that makes you truly, silently "think." Everything is so empty and ethereal. This dream is not a spiritual bud that can blossom and then bear fruit, but merely a wave floating in the ocean of thoughts. It washes away humanity's ambition to create itself, and sweeps away the lifeline that people tightly grasp!

I also have my own dreams; it is not like the rainbow that appears occasionally in the sky after the rain, which is only simple beauty; it is not like the sound of thunder that disappears in an instant, which only vibrates the eardrum; nor is it truly dreamlike, without edges to be found. It is the crystallization of my thoughts, the only flower in my heart, and it will gradually bloom. But this is not its end; merely blooming is not precious, its end is a plump fruit that does not decorate the surface!

Those empty dreams cannot occupy my heart, I am concerned about a dream that must be truly realized, because I know what I am living for. I do not want to wander like a cloud towards the realm of reflections of the moon in water and flowers in a mirror, letting time turn my beard and hair gray, and then lament my fate like a withered flower. I do not want to see the vague, wonderful underside of life as if through aÁ∫± screen, I do not want to use my eyes to dominate my happiness, because I deeply understand that such happiness will become yesterday's flower!

I want to see all the ugliness and hypocrisy in the world; I want to see the sneers, the weeping, the angry glares, the long faces, and the large drops of sweat turning into money!

But, what should I do? I want to use my "truth" to drive away mankind's "falsehood," and use my "goodness" to melt their "evil," to replace the bitterness on their faces with smiles they have never had!

### Starting from "Anti"

‚Äî Zou Sheng

Currently, the "anti" movement is unfolding vigorously in the literary world. Sometimes "anti" is deemed insufficient, and with righteous indignation, labeling things as "shallow," "not understanding anything," "not knowing what something is for," after quoting a large amount of evidence, it ends with "look in the mirror, know yourself." I think this attitude fails to understand the effect of "anti," and on the contrary, gives readers a bad impression of itself.

Examining the object of this "anti" movement, it is "individualism" and "mechanists." Tracing back to the source, it still boils down to the entanglement between "stereotyped writing" and "art." However, my humble opinion is that "stereotyped writing" is needed, and "art" is even more needed; but one cannot transcend the times, and everything must have a close relationship with the "War of Resistance."

Argument is also necessary, but the first goal should not deviate from the times. "Stereotyped writing" that belongs to the "War of Resistance" is still needed after all. Of course, "art" that is related to the "War of Resistance" is even more needed. But it cannot be asserted that "stereotyped writing of the War of Resistance" is all "shallow theoretical articles."

Let's look back, to what stage has the so-called "art" been "deepened" and "elevated"? The atmosphere of "pure literature" is indeed very rampant, and it is still growing vigorously. But from several "pure literature" publications, can we smell the bloody scent of reality? If one is not careful, one will be involved in "stereotyped writing" again, which is extremely "inappropriate"? However, this demand is very common, and most young people will shout: "We want bloody things." This is not surprising, because young people growing up in such an era seem unable to protect anything that transcends the times.

It is said that the reason why "pure literature" publications are so flourishing is not so simple--for the art of art--originally, who is also in doubt, things that adapt to the needs of readers, but still time economic panic, forced to suspend publication; This kind of beauty (?) that specializes in technique, ignores the reality, can it continue to support it? The question is here. The impact of the empty and skillful beauty on readers is: to dilute the awareness of the War of Resistance! This is something no one can deny, right? Therefore, I have great doubts about this kind of so-called "pure literature," that is, I must make a judgment immediately.

"Anti" should be directed against individualists, and even more should be directed against those who talk about art without regard to reality. This is not a mechanical conclusion, because the creation of individualists and those who cling to transcendental art theory is by no means accidental. Since it is not accidental, you should not think of "persuading," let alone "winning over."

It is also a fact that a small number of writers have returned from the united front to the realm of individualism, which is by no means a matter of "cause and effect, no evidence." Since we understand what kind of impact this will have on the current stage of the War of Resistance, we must not only passively "disrespect" it, but also actively "anti" it!

### Dawn

‚Äî Shuguang

Dawn shines on the eastern sky,

An instant between darkness and sunlight.

Like a turbulent stream,

The stubborn rocks have time to be crushed,

But the stream never dies.

Like a galloping dragon,

Rushing through towering peaks,

Crossing deep ravines.

In that distant north,

Today, the first flame of light is lit.

### Red Devil Vasika

‚Äî Written by Gorky, translated by Di Zhou

"Break the glass? Hey, I'll make you eat the broken glass!" Vasika said.

As soon as this stubborn woman heard this, she had to hurry to Vasika's side. If the woman wanted to delay, he would walk up to her himself, twist her hair, and throw her to the floor. And her sisters, - even those who were very close to her, had to tie her feet and block her mouth, and in front of them, on the floor of that kitchen, they whipped this guilty person. If he encountered a bold woman who liked to complain to people, then in order not to open her skin, he would use a wide leather whip, separated by a thick cotton swab soaked in water, to whip her, so that she would not leave blue marks on her body. In addition, he also used a long cloth bag full of sand and gravel, - using such a cloth bag to hit her buttocks, so that she felt a dull pain, which would crawl on the flesh and not subside for a long time,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

But whether the punishment was severe or not depended on the woman's crime and Vasika's sympathy, regardless of the character of the prisoner. Sometimes, even bold women, he whipped mercilessly. His pants pocket always contained three leather whips with tails inlaid with oak handles that shone from frequent use. The leather whip was skillfully inlaid with many iron wires, and the tips of the whip laces twisted the tails of the iron wires into a circle. The first blow would tear the skin and flesh, hitting straight into the bone. And in order to increase their pain, he often smeared mustard on the broken backs, or covered the wound with a cloth soaked in thick salt water.

He punished the girls without any anxiety, always with a lonely and serious face, and calm movements. His eyes always showed an insatiable, greedy expression. In just an instant, he inexplicably became even darker.

The tricks of punishment were not limited to this point. No, Vasika had infinite such tricks. His cultivation in punishing prostitutes had reached the same level as nature.

There was such an incident. In a brothel, a woman named Vina Kabutva was suspected of stealing five thousand rubles from a client. The client was a merchant from New Bicossi, and he stated at the police station: "I was with her and her companion Sarah Miluman in Vina's room. Sarah left after sitting for an hour or two. I only spent one night with Vina, and later I got drunk and left her place."

The case went to court, and after a long time, the two defendants were questioned in preliminary hearings, but because the evidence was insufficient, they were acquitted.

When the trial ended and they returned to detention, both of them were privately interrogated again. The madam believed that they had stolen the money, and she wanted to get a share of the loot herself.

Sarah proved that she had nothing to do with this theft. The old madam desperately targeted Vina Kabutva. She locked Vina in the bathroom and allowed her to eat salted eel. But no matter what other methods were used, Vina would not say where the money was hidden. Therefore, she had to resort to Vasika's skills.

The madam made an agreement with them that if he could force Vina to say where the money was, he would give him a ruble.

So one night, in the bathroom where Vina, plagued by hunger, terror, and danger, was sitting, this devil appeared.

He was wearing a black fur coat, the fur exuded the smell of yellow phosphorus, and the smoke of blue light. His eyes shone like fire as he stood before her. He asked her in a terrible voice: (2)

Yan Jupeng was hired by the Golden Theatre this time, calling himself the Old Tan School. The first day he performed "The Empty City Stratagem", and the box office was almost unprecedented. The opera fans' welcome to Yan can be seen. As a fellow fan, I ought to go listen, and on the third day, I also went to see "Hongyang Cave" in the afternoon. After listening and returning, I couldn't sleep at night. I thought and analyzed it, and wanted to write it down to tell the fellow fans. The twists and turns are very long to say. I don't have time to say long words now. I had no choice but to find a word in each play. Although there are only two words, the relationship is very big, that is, the "thief" in the running water board of "The Empty City Stratagem", and the "idle" in the entrance yuan board of "Hongyang Cave".

When the first act of "The Empty City Stratagem" ends, he sings "The late emperor... also spared me from personally capturing the thief," the "thief" character, the entering tone returns to the Yang Ping tone. If according to the example of the Hubei and Guangdong accent low pronunciation, singing this word will not be bad. Its badness lies in making the cavity not round, and the previous word, the cavity of the character "ba", yin and yang (this yin and yang refers to the aspect of the cavity tone) will not, the disease is called "collapse" like building a house. The walls and pillars of a house must be strong and straight. If they are not strong and straight, the house will collapse; the cavity tone of singing is also like this. If a certain word is not firm, or not loud, or not high, the cavity tone of the entire sentence will collapse. Anyone who is proficient in singing, the most important thing is to understand this principle. If you don't understand this principle, and just talk about the yin and yang of the word sound, it is like a novice "Liba". True connoisseurs will secretly laugh at him. Old Tan (Xinpei) is really an expert, he does have a teacher. When singing this word, he does not sing the low-pitched sound. In the "Gongpu", it is the upper character, not the combined character, because it originates from Kunqu opera, and the character belongs to the Central Plains. (The "thief" character in the previous sentence "sweep the thieves" using "Chi Shang Shang" is also this principle.) Mr. Chen Yanheng knew it, and taught us like this, I remember it carefully and dare not forget it. I have also privately studied this "thief" character, and it must be sung like this, without any doubt. Even if the boss of Qicheng is underground, I dare to insist on this statement, without the slightest hesitation. Yu Shuyan also once stayed at Chen's door, but he sings this "thief" character differently. Try listening to Shuyan's singing, the thief character sings the low note of "He Si"... He is from Hubei, and sings this thief character using the example of the Hubei and Guangdong accent Yang Ping tone low pronunciation, thinking that he has the merit of reversing the chaos, but how does he know that he has the suspicion of a beauty following a thief and the delusion of building a car behind closed doors! From Shuyan down to the actors, as well as the amateur fans who study yin and yang word sounds, they all sing this thief character as the low note of "He Si", greatly violating Old Tan's singing method. From the micro of this one word, it can be determined the false and not false of learning Tan. Isn't the relationship of this one "thief" character great!

### Old Tan Sings "The Empty City Stratagem" in Nine Acres, Detailed Supporting Cast, Reported by Cao Fuchen

‚Äî Xiao Cang

Because recently there has been talk about the supporting cast of Lao Tan singing "The Empty City Stratagem" in the Nine Acres New Stage, there seem to be some discrepancies in the facts. Xiao Cang entrusted Ms. Wei Xinlv to ask the old actor Cao Fuchen, who had played Sima Yi in Lao Tan's "Empty City Stratagem", to report the historical facts. He also had a detailed talk with Cao Fuchen on the mainland radio station. Recently, Cao Fuchen also wrote down all the supporting roles in Lao Tan's "Empty City Stratagem", including the qintong and the reporter, which can be regarded as a precious anecdote in the pear garden. I write it out for the fellow fans, and also declare to the Shen Bao that I will refuse to pay, to show that I am not writing for manuscript fees, but to let the general opera fans know this anecdote.

Old Tan sang for a short period in the Nine Acres New Stage, and lived in Room 1 on the lower floor of the New Hotel on Second Ma Road. He sang for five days first, went to Putuo to offer incense, and after returning to Shanghai, he sang for another five days.

The entire supporting cast of "The Empty City Stratagem":

Lao Tan (Zhuge Liang), Xia Yuerun (Zhao Yun), Zhang Shunlai (Ma Dai), Pan Yueqiao (Wang Ping), Xu Kuiguan (Ma Su), Zhao Wenlian, Pan Haiqiu, Jiang Ruifang, Hu Xiulin (four children, four children appear when Jieting is lost, only two children appear in "Empty City Stratagem"), Cao Fuchen (Sima Yi), Fan Liankui (Sima Shi), Zong Yuankui (Sima Zhao), Xia Yuehua (Zhang He), Zhang Sanqing (reporter), Xia Yueshan, Qiu Zhiyun (two old soldiers), Wang Sanhu (reporter) (when the third time), Pan Guifang (the person who offered the map)

Among the above actors, those who are still alive are Xu Kuiguan, Cao Fuchen, Zhao Wenlian, Pan Haiqiu, Jiang Ruifang, Hu Xiulin, and Zhang Sanqing. The rest have passed away. Among them, the recent situation of Pan Guifang is unknown. (Refuse to pay)

### Record of the Golden Charity Opera

‚Äî Yu Tang

(Editor's note) The Golden Charity Opera was performed on June 26th and 27th. Mr. Yu Tang and Mr. Yuhong's opera reviews have been arranged for many days. Due to the crowded manuscripts, they can only be published today. Please forgive the two gentlemen.

Last night the Golden Theatre performed a charity opera. At seven o'clock, I took my seat and "came early". Mr. Feng Weide knew that Mali was opening the gong, so he sang only one act because it was a matinee. His voice was dark and had a lot of charm. He learned Zhou and there was something. Feng went down and Miss Fu Yuntai's "Fish Intestine Sword" came on stage. The play was taught by Mr. Shaoqing, and he personally played the qin, so it was extraordinary. Her singing and pronunciation had an antique charm. Miss Fu might as well seize the seat of Xiaodong and replace her. Fortunately, she paid more attention to her face and body. Then came Mr. Ou Shounan's "Stick Beating", which was Ou's masterpiece, and the people of Shanghai had been craving it for a long time. The whole play was performed for eight quarters, and the audience held their breath and listened without any noise. Ou's appearance was beautiful, his Beijing dialect was fluent, and his voice was sweet and smooth, and his singing was novel. I alone felt that there were five points in his expression that were outstanding and worth writing: (1) When Jin Song shouted for Mo Qi to leave, usually Jin Yunu said, "You come back to me!" At this point, Ou opened the door and pretended to be cold, saying, "What a heavy snow!" Subtly indicating the intention to stop him, which is just right for a girl's identity. (2) After learning that Mo Qi was a scholar from this city, he hurriedly told his father, with a shy expression, which was very suitable for the plot. (3) Mo Qi passed the exam and suddenly became arrogant. Jin Yunu was in pain inside and forced herself to endure it, and her expression was realistic. (4) When getting on the boat, Mo Qi took the lead in pushing her away, first wanting to jump into the river, then wanting to turn back, and finally enduring her anger and boarding the boat because Jin Song was old, a kind of sad and desperate expression was moving. (5) Kneeling and begging the adoptive father to pity her was extremely lingering and affectionate. Observing the subtlety and thoughtfulness of his expression, I felt that his fame was not accidental. Zhuang Xiaogu's Mo Qi and Li Zaitian's Jin Song were all competent. The finale was Mr. Zeng Xinzhai's "Selling the Horse and Pawn the Halberd". Mr. Zeng originally scheduled the play to be a complete "Empty City Stratagem". Later, because the time was not enough to allocate, he changed to singing "Selling the Horse". He also thought that it was too late, and voluntarily omitted the halberd. His drama virtue is many. The singing and acting were very similar to Jupeng. The section of the shopkeeper Dong was hit by the whole house, and the rocking board was also in the middle of the fine ink. I heard that Mr. Zeng wanted the halberd and had a unique place. Because I didn't get to see it, I had to blame the carelessness of the drama director that day. The finale was Miss Xiao Ming's "Satisfied Fate", and Jiang Shiyu temporarily replaced Gu Chuanjie to play Lu Kunjie. Did he want to hide his clumsiness by knowing that he was not good at Beijing dialect? However, the general trend has passed, and even if there is Hibiscus Grass, it cannot be saved. It was late and the rain was heavy, so I left my seat and returned.

### China also has a "Tarzan" appear

‚Äî Silver Arrow

Cantonese films prepare to compete with Western films, Peng Fei and Li Zhuozhuo are the male and female protagonists

Hollywood's "Tarzan" has won the support of thousands of movie fans, from "Tarzan of the Apes" to "Tarzan's Peril", which made the film company boss make a lot of money. So smart Chinese film merchants are also preparing to do such a thing. Recently, in the film industry of South China, someone is preparing to produce "Chinese Tarzan".

"Hercules" Peng Fei has been selected to play the male lead of "Chinese Tarzan". Peng Fei came to Shanghai once not long ago. His mission had two tasks, one was to invite Li Hong to play the female lead in this film (the rumor was Bai Hong, which was wrong). ) The second is to transport props. Now Peng Fei has returned to Hong Kong! Inviting Li Hong was not successful. The first reason is that Li Hong has a contract with Xinhua Company, and the second is that Li Hong is slightly shorter. Now Li Zhuozhuo has been hired to take the position, and Wang Cilong succeeded in contacting him. As for the props used in the film, Peng Fei has brought them to Hong Kong. Among them, the most eye-catching is the solid iron load, which is five sizes, weighing from 100 pounds to 350 pounds. This is what Peng Fei uses to practice his strength.

Since separating from Zhang Ji, Li Zhuozhuo has lost a lot of weight instead. The other day, Hong Kong China competed in baseball with the Friends Beer team, and Li Zhuozhuo also occupied a seat in the stands. Although she was still as bold as before, she was not as strong as before.

(Explanation) The above picture Peng Fei - taken by Minghua, the picture below Li Zhuozhuo - taken by Dieyi

### Part Two

‚Äî Yu Hong

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association invited famous amateurs from home and abroad to perform charity dramas. There were many public performances in the two nights, and many famous amateurs participated, and there were four dramas with special and outstanding results:

The first night was Xu Heizhen's "Six Departments of Trial". Xu specializes in cold dramas. This drama has been recognized by modern famous actors as a drama that is absolutely not fashionable, but Mr. Xu performed it with singing, recitation, and acting. Although it was only one act, he was as skilled as a professional. His voice was also exceptionally good, a masterpiece. Xiao Beiqiao's "Stealing the Imperial Horse". It seems to follow the example of Hou Xirui. The frame is stable and the momentum is majestic. The recitation is especially good. It is not easy for amateur fans to get this. The second night was Miss Xiao Ming's "Satisfied Fate". Miss Xiao is known for her singing and acting skills in Pingju Opera. "Satisfied Fate" that night focused only on recitation, expression, and body, so it failed to show all of Xiao's art. Miss Xiao's appearance on stage that night was very graceful and light. Only those who are old in this way can achieve this. The recitation was clear and moving, and every word was like a pearl. The acting and expression were lightly sketched and natural and stable. Among the female actors and female amateurs in Shanghai, Miss Xiao can be regarded as an outstanding talent. That night, she was also assisted by Furong Cao and Jiang Shiyu's green leaves, so it is appropriate that the audience applauded and praised her. Zeng Xinzhai's art has long been known in Jiujiang and Nanchang. This time on stage, his singing, recitation, acting, and demeanor were all outstanding and amazing. His stage steps were especially good, and even famous actors at home and abroad could not match him. A song came, which was smooth and hearty. It is a pity that he did not perform the complete "Empty City Stratagem". (Refuse to pay)

### Anecdotes of the Pear Garden

‚Äî Xu Muyun

The reason for Jin Shaoshan's popularity after going north

In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, when the sentence was on the road, when he arrived in Shanghai, Baosen was still out of voice and had not recovered. He was deeply afraid that Shao Yu would be able to eat it when he sang "Catching and Releasing" in the first day. ""Keng" means that when two actors sing a play together, they do not give way to each other and sell enough voice. If they don't eat each other to the point where they are willing to bow down, the actors in the Pear Garden often say that someone has been eaten by someone. ""Pull it down", which means this). So when he visited the guests, he asked me to plead with Shaoshan first. On that day, Shaoshan and Lao Yuan came together. After I explained to Jin about the intention of asking him to take care of Baosen, he immediately said, "Our superiors are all in good relationship, of course we won't make it difficult for him." Everyone was very happy during the banquet. Jin initiated that those who could sing would sing an excerpt each. After Baosen finished singing, everyone's eyes were focused on Shaoshan. Unexpectedly, he was also very understanding. Without waiting for everyone to open his mouth to him, he said to Sun Lao, "Uncle Lao (Xiushan and Lao Yuan are sworn brothers), please pull a section for me to sing." I saw that he was extremely cheerful and had no bad habits of being pretentious after becoming a famous actor, so I also said, "If you want to sing, you have to sing a big section, so that we can enjoy the fun of the opera. Then, I would like to trouble you to come to a section of 'Assassinating the Liao'." Who knew that as soon as his "The countries are in turmoil..." came out, he scared the two children in the downstairs compartment to cry; in an instant, the children's parents all ran upstairs, stretched their heads and looked into the room to see who would have such a thunderous voice. Later, when they learned that it was Jin Shaoshan, they were all silent and stood to listen, and thought it was a very rare opportunity. Three days later, Xun Yang came to the stage. Whenever Shaoshan and Baosen co-starred in "Catching and Releasing", "Empty City", and "Famen Temple", he always lowered his tone, and he would only occasionally ask for a good after Baosen received applause. He never robbed the head of the protagonist of applause, which shows that he is very loyal and pays attention to old friendships.

Speaking of his unforgetting of old friendships, I also thought of the Pudong Du Ancestral Hall meeting that year. When I went with Li Weiwu, Ye Yongfang, Zheng Zi , Cheng Junmou and other gentlemen on the first day, I met many Pear Garden friends in the backstage. Each of them was lying on a couch, busy filling up with energy to dress up for the opera. As for eating, it was a secondary issue, because there was an original "full blow, hungry singing, qi drumming" , so before the opera is finished, they are not anxious to eat. (53)

Entertainer's Rambling Notes

### Miss Lu Ming, Movie Star, Talks About: Movie Life and Love Problems (Part 2)

‚Äî Recorded by Xin Shi

Regarding my feelings about film work: This is a career I should strive for. Of course, I hope to gradually improve and achieve great success. However, I also believe it is closely related to age and may not be a lifelong career. Therefore, the idea of striving for further education becomes even more important.

Here, I want to talk about love and marriage. It's really ridiculous: not long ago, a certain publication said, "Lu Ming's criteria for choosing a husband are having land as large as a racecourse and ten million pounds." This joke is not a big deal, but there are many female classmates who ask when they meet or call to inquire about the truth of the matter. These unfounded rumors are both infuriating and hilarious. My consistent view is to oppose talking about love, especially before a career is successful. We should absolutely not talk about love. Another saying is, perhaps talking about love is something for the leisure class? Under the arduous work of filming a movie in one and a half months, trying to improve my studies, my energy is often not enough. Time and money are not things a person with leisure has. The word "love" has not even crossed my mind, so how could I further discuss marriage and what conditions? Isn't this too ridiculous?

Finally, I believe that some people think that movie actors are generally accustomed to romantic life and hedonism. This superficial observation is actually very wrong. As for myself: my current life is no different from my student days. I live under strict discipline and have never had any excessive desires or actions. (End)
