### Japanese Troops Blocked in Southern Henan as They Attempt to Advance Westward; Situation Tense in Shekki; Chinese Regular Army Arrives at Wangmoon; Chinese Troops in Southern Shanxi Attack Japanese Troops Along the Yih-Chin Highway

(Chongqing) According to an official statement issued by Chinese military authorities, the three routes of Japanese troops advancing westward in southern Henan have been blocked by Chinese forces. The first route of Japanese troops, advancing westward from Minggang, 20 miles north of Xinyang, was ambushed by Chinese forces moving south from Biyang at Wanggang, 10 miles west of Minggang. The second route of Japanese troops, attempting to advance westward from the Sanguanmiao Station (two stations south of Minggang on the Pinghan Railway), was subjected to continuous attacks on both flanks near Huanggang by Chinese forces, forcing the Japanese troops to flee eastward in disarray. The third route of Japanese troops, fleeing westward from Xinyang to Tongbai, encountered fierce resistance from Chinese forces west of Xinyang. Fighting is underway in the Huaihedian area. The statement declared that a decisive battle in southern Henan is imminent. The statement also noted that Chinese forces in southern Shanxi are operating successfully against the Japanese troops. Since Chinese forces recaptured Yangcheng and Qinshui last week, the Japanese troops' communication lines on the highways have been disrupted by Chinese guerrillas. Near Jincheng, 2,000 elite Japanese troops attacked Chinese positions last week, using twelve mountain guns to bombard Chinese positions in an attempt to break through. After a day of intense fighting, the Japanese troops' attempt to break through failed. Chinese authorities confirmed that Anjue County, south of the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway, has been recaptured by Chinese forces. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

(Chongqing) According to telegrams received here today, a major battle is currently underway in southern Henan. Japanese troops in the area are advancing westward in three routes. The northern route is advancing northwest, aiming to seize Wagang. The central route has reached Maoji, northwest of Biyang. The southern route is advancing from Xinyang towards Tongbai. It appears that the Japanese troops' objective is to occupy Biyang, west of the Pinghan Railway and east of the Tanghe River, while the southern route's target seems to be Tongbai, northeast of Zhaoyang. Chinese troops have established a T-shaped defense line, attempting to force the Japanese troops to retreat east towards the Pinghan Railway. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(Xi'an) Approximately 500 to 600 Japanese troops fleeing westward from Qinshui and over 1,000 troops coming from Yicheng jointly occupied Dongwuling on the 28th. Chinese forces are currently advancing along the Yih-Chin Highway and its southern side. (Telegram, 30th)

(Hong Kong) Chinese and Japanese forces are currently in a stalemate outside Zhongshan. Chinese artillery has established strong positions on the northeast coast of Zhongshan, west of Wangmoon. Regular troops have also arrived near Wangmoon, preparing to annihilate the Japanese marines and puppet troops stationed there. (Special dispatch, 31st)

(Hong Kong) Tension in Shekki; many residents flee to Macau. (Special dispatch, 31st)

(Macau) Several Japanese planes scattered leaflets in Shekki today, urging residents to accept Japanese friendship. Subsequently, several more Japanese planes strafed Shekki with machine guns, killing over 20 people. Simultaneously, Japanese warships off the coast of Wangmoon shelled the coastal area. Fighting is currently underway. 1,000 Japanese troops are attempting to gain a foothold but have been unsuccessful. It is reported that the Japanese troops include people from North China, Manchuria, and Taiwan. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(Luoyang) On the night of the 24th, Chinese forces attacked Wan'an (west of Hongdong). The Japanese troops were caught off guard. Chinese troops bravely charged into the city, resulting in prolonged street fighting. The Japanese troops resisted stubbornly from fortified buildings, with dense gunfire like rain. By dawn, the Chinese forces, having achieved their objective of attrition, safely withdrew to their defenses. (Telegram, 31st)

Negotiations Between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin Legal Tender and Silver Deposit Issue Extended by One Day; Opinions Remain Opposed, Britain Unlikely to Concede Further; British Newspaper Explains the Necessity of Stabilizing Legal Tender

(Tokyo) The subcommittee established by the recent Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference did not meet this morning to consider Japan's demands for British recognition of "Federal Reserve" banknotes and the handover of silver deposited by Chinese merchants' banks in the British Concession of Tianjin. The meeting, scheduled for 10:00 AM this morning, was canceled. It is said that the Japanese representatives were not ready. The subcommittee consists of Mr. Macrae, Counselor of the British Embassy, Mr. Herbert, British Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Tanaka, Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Aoki, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Asai. According to the Japanese "Rakubou" newspaper, the British delegation expressed opposition to the handover of silver, stating that it was a separate issue from maintaining peace and order in Tianjin. However, the Japanese side stated that without a solution to the silver issue, the problem of maintaining peace and order could not be resolved. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(Tokyo) The sixth Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference was held at the official residence of the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from 4:05 PM to 6:50 PM on the 31st. It was decided that the Economic Issues Subcommittee would reconvene at the official residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM on the 1st. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 31st)

(London) According to official circles here, the most crucial point in the Anglo-Japanese talks is the issue of the Chinese currency system. The resolution of this issue will determine who ultimately prevails in the competition for influence in the Far East. The British side has begun addressing this point and the measures are good, so it can still be trusted. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) Regarding the Japanese government's demand that the British hand over 48 million Chinese dollars in silver deposited in Chinese banks within the Tianjin Concession, sources close to the Foreign Office here recently stated that the British government will send instructions via telegram to Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan. However, since this silver is deposited in both British and French banks in roughly equal amounts, Britain cannot make a unilateral decision without first consulting France. Fortunately, since this issue is international in nature, it should not delay the ongoing negotiations between Britain and Japan. If Ambassador Craigie does not receive instructions from the government before his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita tomorrow, he can proceed with discussing other issues first. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph stated that Britain is unlikely to agree to Japan's demands regarding Chinese legal tender. The British government has not yet sent new instructions to Ambassador Craigie in Japan to respond to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. However, one thing is clear: Britain will not fully comply with Japan's plan to have Britain transfer its support for Chinese legal tender to support the various currencies issued by Japan in the occupied areas of China. The Times' diplomatic correspondent referred to Japan's new demands, stating, "The British government's negotiations with Japan are known to be solely about the blockade of Tianjin and related issues." Prime Minister Chamberlain stated at the beginning of the negotiations that Britain would not allow any other country to dictate changes to its China policy. In other words, Britain will not cease its determined policy. The correspondent continued, "If Britain accepts Japan's broader demands, it would be tantamount to abandoning all support for Chinese legal tender. China's export trade depends on the stability of legal tender and is connected to many countries, including Britain, France, and the United States." It is widely expected that the Prime Minister will issue a clarification to dispel the many doubts and misunderstandings caused by the Anglo-Japanese agreement. Britain will faithfully adhere to a plan to determine the facts that must be addressed in North China during this difficult or transitional period, but the Japanese commander must also show the same sincerity, and only then can this plan become the basis for a temporary solution.

### Sixth Anglo-Japanese Conference Still Discussing Tianjin Police Affairs

(Tokyo) The sixth Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference continued this afternoon, still discussing methods for maintaining peace and order within the British Concession in Tianjin. Before the meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the discussions at this afternoon's Anglo-Japanese plenary session would be limited to the issue of Tianjin police affairs. It is reported that the Japanese side initially insisted on resolving the issue of silver deposited in the British Concession of Tianjin before dealing with the issue of maintaining order. However, after talks this morning between British Ambassador Craigie, British military attaché Brigadier General Pigott, and Japanese military representatives in North China, Major General Mutō and Colonel Tatsumi, a decision was made to discuss the issue of Tianjin security. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(Tokyo) The sixth Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference was held at the official residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The attendees on the Japanese side were Minister Katō, Major General Mutō, Consul Tanaka, Lieutenant Colonel Ōta, Major Ōta, Aoki, Asami, Teraoka, Chiba, and various Foreign Ministry officials. On the British side were Ambassador Craigie, Consul Herbert, Brigadier General Pigott, and various secretaries including Campbell-Brown. Discussions centered on the following three points: (1) The transfer of suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng; (2) The dismissal of anti-Japanese personnel within the Concession's Municipal Council; (3) Concrete methods for establishing an Anglo-Japanese joint security organization. The head of the Tianjin Police Department, Mr. Tannis, presented the views of the local authorities on the various outstanding issues and outlined several specific hopes for future Anglo-Japanese cooperation. The Japanese side understood the spirit of this presentation and conducted consultations. As a result, the British and Japanese sides reached a comprehensive understanding regarding the transfer of suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng. As for the remaining two items, it was decided to establish a subcommittee on security police issues to conduct consultations, as there was a need for careful preparation to ensure smooth implementation. The meeting adjourned at 6:50 PM.

Based on the above decision, the members of the Security Subcommittee, Tanaka, Ōta, Ōta, Herbert, and Tannis, remained in their seats and exchanged views on the above topics. It was decided to reconvene the subcommittee at 2:00 PM on the 1st to continue discussions. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. It is estimated that the discussion on security police issues will be completed in the subcommittee on the 1st. After the matter is submitted as an agenda item for the next roundtable conference, the British side will formally request instructions from its government before making a final decision. As such, the following Japanese demands regarding security police issues have indeed gained comprehensive understanding:

(1) Joint search and arrest of anti-Japanese Communist elements;

(2) Immediate transfer of anti-Japanese Communist elements;

(3) Joint search and arrest of general Chinese criminals within the Concession;

(4) Transfer of the above-mentioned general criminals based on evidence provided by Chinese authorities;

(5) Prohibition of anti-Japanese Communist facilities, activities, and documents, etc.;

(6) Establishment of liaison officers and military police;

(7) Dismissal of anti-Japanese personnel within the Concession's Municipal Council. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Chongqing Government's View on the International Situation: The US Termination of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is Beneficial to China; Britain's Attitude Towards Japan Will Also Become More Assertive; If an Anglo-Soviet Alliance is Formed, Soviet Aid to China Will Surely Increase

(Chongqing) According to Chinese government sources today, since the outbreak of the war of resistance, China has been in an unshakable position both militarily and diplomatically. "This summer and winter, we will lay the foundation for our 1940 and 1941 offensives. The purpose of this offensive is to break through the Japanese army's outer defenses and completely capture all 800,000 Japanese troops within China." Diplomats and military experts here believe that the US decision to terminate the US-Japan commercial treaty is a favorable sign of US Far East policy towards China. At the same time, Britain's attitude will also become tougher. Pessimists here believe that the US may impose economic sanctions on Japan in 1940, but optimists believe that Britain and the US will jointly sanction Japan and force Japan to surrender and seek peace. Chinese officials believe that if Britain and the US jointly sanction Japan, Japan may retaliate militarily against Britain and the US, but most people believe that the financial and military power of Britain and the US is enough to intimidate Japan, so it may not take futile retaliatory action. There is also much speculation about the benefits and harms of the outbreak of a European war for China. Some believe that after the outbreak of a European war, British and French munitions may not arrive as scheduled, while others believe that if the European war does not break out, Germany and Italy will be able to supply Japan with large quantities of aircraft, bombs, and munitions, allowing Japan to launch another fierce offensive this winter in an attempt to resolve the China issue first. However, most people believe that if the European war does not break out, British and French financial and economic aid will surely continue to flow in, and at the same time, Soviet aid to China will greatly increase after the establishment of an Anglo-Soviet alliance. What the Chinese side hopes to see is the establishment of a democratic axis to counter the fascist axis of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Those who currently oppose the establishment of this democratic axis include Chamberlain of Britain, who is clearly unwilling to use force against force, the traditional isolationist policy of the United States, and British fear of the Soviet Union, so its current peace efforts with the Soviet Union are clearly insincere, and it is also uncertain whether the treaty will ultimately be adhered to in the future. However, if the democratic axis does become a reality, China will ultimately benefit from it, whether directly or indirectly. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

### British Consulate Denies Japanese Allegations

According to United Press news from this city, the Japanese military in this city yesterday provided the United Press with a report stating that according to reliable sources, British consular officials and Soviet consular officials in this city are currently cooperating closely, providing information to Communist guerrillas, which is why Japanese airfields and arsenals along the Jinghu Railway have recently been attacked by Communist guerrillas. The British Consulate in this city has formally denied these allegations, stating that the Japanese claims are completely unfounded and that the British Consulate in this city has never had contact with the Soviet Consulate in this city. As for the so-called retaliation against Japan, it is also beyond the duties of British officials in this city.

Editorial

### Japan's Last Struggle in Military and Diplomacy

Yesterday's Chongqing dispatch reported: According to the observations of a certain foreign military observer, the Japanese army seems to be planning to launch another fierce offensive against the Chinese fronts in September in order to end the war. The targets of the offensive are likely to be Xi'an in Shaanxi, Yichang in Hubei, and Nanning in Guangxi; the scale of the offensive will likely be similar to the previous conquests of Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan; and the offensive force will likely involve transferring seven to ten fresh divisions from Japan. The Japanese army has already exhausted 60% of its strength, and its future success or failure hinges on this one move. It is still remembered that two weeks ago, a Hong Kong dispatch reported that the Japanese would launch a new offensive in August; there were some discrepancies between the news at that time and the current observations; after all, only the future facts are most accurate regarding future events, and predictions are inevitably different. However, this newspaper once commented on the Hong Kong dispatch, saying that the new offensive had its military, political, and international reasons, and in short, it was gradually approaching the end point; the new offensive was an important stage before the final destination. In discussing the Chongqing dispatch now, we will also reach the same conclusion, but there is still something to be said: When discussing the US announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation the other day, we said that the Japanese side might regard the next period of time as a period of final struggle; yesterday, when discussing the brewing international situation, we said that the reasonable people on the Japanese side should take this as an opportunity to change their policy, change course, suddenly change their plans, and quietly withdraw; these two statements can be mutually illuminating with the Chongqing dispatch's so-called fierce offensive to end the war.

From a military perspective: What the foreign military observer has observed may coincide with the Japanese plan, but there must be a mistake in the observation and the plan. The truth is that Xi'an, Yichang, and Nanning are not easy to attack, and it is impossible to succeed in attacking them without adding seven to ten fresh divisions; not to mention the terrain, the mobile teams deployed by the Chinese side in the occupied areas are already hindering the Japanese army and preventing them from advancing deeply alone; and the new armies trained by the Chinese side in the inland areas have reportedly completed their basic training by the end of April and their training in the use of new weapons by the end of August, so what is being done to contain the Japanese army will also make it difficult for the Japanese army to reach its offensive targets. Even if Xi'an, Yichang, and Nanning are successively captured, the Chinese resistance will continue, and it is still insufficient to speak of "ending the war" in "military terms." The military observer said that the Japanese army's strength has been depleted by 60%, and yesterday's Tokyo dispatch from the British Fast News Agency said that according to the "East Daily" statistics, the Japanese army has only occupied 16% of China's total area; comparing the two and calculating them at the same ratio, the Japanese will not be able to occupy 30% of China's area even if they devote their remaining full strength, so how can they end the war militarily? Moreover, judging from the stalemated situation on the various fronts in the past six months, the Japanese army has repeatedly attacked without gaining an inch, and the Chinese army has been reporting frequent victories in western Shanxi and central Hubei, so it is not appropriate to predict that the remaining 40% of the Japanese army will be able to achieve some development; and the Chinese side, in addition to the improvement of the international situation, recognizes the remaining strength of the Japanese army as the final struggle, so it can be asserted that the morale and battle results in the future will be very different from the past.

Judging from the Japanese character and its internal affairs: There is the possibility of its taking adventurous attempts, hoping to win by luck, and preferring to be completely destroyed rather than not making a desperate bet; there is the possibility of its being willful and impulsive, unable to control itself, internally contradictory, unable to resolve its contradictions, and thus acting perversely and arbitrarily; and because it is arrogant and self-willed and overconfident, it envisions several vague scenarios; such as cutting off all means of retreat and joining forces with Germany and Italy to seek a way out in the cracks, which is one aspect; regarding the US authorities as not having much determination and having other "friendly" techniques, and further plotting to win over the isolationists in the United States to restrain the White House, in order to make the United States tolerate its aggression, which is another aspect; using propaganda and action to coerce the compromise-prone Britain into finally compromising, directly seeking success from Britain, and indirectly dividing Britain and the United States and defeating them individually, which is another aspect; envisioning scenarios like these, and at the same time supplementing them with a new offensive in China, is how the Japanese may see that the technique of reversing the decline and the method of turning death into life lie in this. Therefore, what the Japanese side sees as success or failure depending on this one move will not only be the new military offensive, but also the application of international diplomacy.

Looking at the big picture: The Chinese side's morale and spirit have been strong from the beginning, and have become even more enhanced recently, so there will surely be great achievements to be seen in responding to the Japanese army's final struggle; to be wary of the Japanese army's new offensive is to regard the Japanese army's new offensive as an opportunity to give it a head-on blow and kill the enemy to achieve success. The international effort to stop aggression has been going on for two years of patience, and has gradually reached the stage of fruition recently, so it is impossible to change it with any tricks or techniques; but looking at the fact that the German side signed a commercial treaty with Japan the other day, it still had to declare to China that trade between China and Germany would be maintained, and that the treaty was not applicable to the occupied areas; this intention is very subtle. China is like that, the international situation is like this, so in this final moment for Japan, to say that it must make a desperate bet and pour out everything it has, and that it must wait for further international actions to fall into a hopeless situation, and that it must not be willing to rein in its horse on the cliff edge and preserve its remaining strength, this is also not a necessary conclusion.

### Britain Still Needs to Carefully Consider the Issue of Terminating the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan; Chamberlain Announced in the House of Commons that He Must Consult with the Dominions

(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, three members asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, given that the United States has terminated the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, whether the government will consider taking the same action regarding the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The Prime Minister replied that this matter requires careful consideration and he regretted that he could not say anything today. Labor Party member Henderson then asked, given that both the British and American governments have accepted the obligation to maintain the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, whether the Prime Minister meant that the British government did not consider it necessary to follow the same policy as the US government as much as possible regarding the situation caused by Japanese aggression against China. The Prime Minister replied that, in a broad sense, he believed that the objectives of the British and American governments were the same, but that all circumstances were naturally not entirely the same. Labor Party member Noel-Baker also asked, is the difference between the two countries that Britain is facing an even greater challenge, and he wanted to know if the Prime Minister could immediately guarantee that he would begin talks with the Dominions in order to take actions in parallel with the United States. The Prime Minister replied that he would contact the Dominions. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) Opposition Labor Party member Baker asked whether it was true that the Japanese government had requested Britain to stop supporting Chinese legal tender and that the British government had provided verbal assurances. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler immediately replied, "That is not the case."

(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor Party member Strauss asked whether the Japanese authorities had requested the British government to hand over silver deposited in Tianjin. The Foreign Secretary Butler did not answer this question. Labor Party member Bellenger asked whether Craigie and Arita had mentioned this issue in their discussions. Butler said he would check. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, members asked whether the Anglo-Japanese agreement negotiated in Tokyo contained the intention to recognize the jurisdiction of Japanese courts in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler replied that the agreement did not cause Britain to change its attitude towards Japanese courts. Labor Party member Noel-Baker then asked whether the government would assure the House that it would never hand over the four Chinese in Tianjin to the Japanese, as there were no courts with legal judicial power in the occupied areas of China. The Deputy Secretary replied that this matter was currently under discussion and he could not report the details of the negotiations to the House today. The Deputy Secretary continued regarding the court issue, "The only court we know of now is the Japanese Consular Court, and these courts only handle Japanese cases." Noel-Baker then continued, if there were no courts with judicial power over the four suspects, then the British government would certainly not extradite these four people to the Japanese. Labor Party member Kennedy asked whether we could assume that the British government did not endorse the aggressive attacks on China. The Deputy Secretary replied, "That is absolutely certain." (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) At this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative Party member Cole asked what negotiations the government would hold with Japan, given that there was anti-British propaganda all along the Chinese coast, from Tianjin in the north to Guangzhou in the south. Deputy Secretary Butler replied that Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had made strong representations to the Japanese government. In addition, British consulates in all ports with anti-British propaganda had made strong representations to the local Japanese authorities. Cole also asked whether the Japanese government had promised to stop this anti-British activity. Deputy Secretary Butler replied, "The Japanese government has not provided a promise, but stated that it is responsible for maintaining law and order in the occupied areas, so the British government expects the Japanese to protect the lives of British nationals in the areas it protects." Labor Party member Davison then asked whether the Japanese had provided a satisfactory answer after Britain made representations to Japan. Deputy Secretary Butler replied, "The Japanese have filed this representation." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### 50,000 People Hold Second Anti-British Rally in Tokyo: Slogans and Declarations Copied From Others, Crowd Marches to British Embassy Chanting Slogans

(Tokyo) Fifty thousand Japanese people participated in an anti-British demonstration and march today, passing in front of the British Embassy. Roughly one in two people held a flag with anti-British slogans. The orderly march lasted two hours, unprecedented for its scale. Hundreds of police accompanied the crowd to prevent any transgressions. A few radical elements threw anti-British flags into the empty courtyard of the British Embassy, or hung them on the iron gates; these individuals were arrested. Most of the demonstrators were members of the reserve soldiers association, veterans association, patriotic women's association, and women's national defense association. As they passed the British Embassy, they shouted "Banzai," and the leaders took the opportunity to address the crowd. The flags bore slogans such as "Withdraw Craigie!", "Britain, Rethink Your Policy!", "Down with Britain!", "Down with Pro-Chiang Britain!", "Japan Will Not Yield an Inch!". The crowd also carried several satirical cartoons, mocking the British Ambassador and bearing the inscription "Craigie, Enemy of Asia." Several British representatives attending the Anglo-Japanese conference were trapped in the crowd of demonstrators but were escorted to safety by the police and were reportedly unharmed. A Reuters reporter, out seeking news, was also trapped in the crowd. However, the demonstrators appeared to be benign. Marching and shouting in the sweltering heat, with temperatures reaching ninety degrees in the shade, they were covered in sweat. Before the march, the demonstrators gathered in Hibiya Park and passed several anti-British resolutions. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) The Tokyo Citizens' Anti-British League, initiated by members of the Tokyo Municipal Assembly, held its second citizens' anti-British rally at Hibiya Public Hall and Akasaka Sanno-dai at 10 AM on the 31st, calling for Britain to quickly reconsider its policies. Details are as follows: At 9 AM on the 31st, citizens of all thirty-five wards of Tokyo unanimously responded to the anti-British movement, led by military bands, with representatives from youth groups, veterans associations, national defense women's associations, and citizens writing anti-British slogans on flags and banners. Approximately hundreds of thousands of citizens participated in the event and unanimously passed various declarations, which were presented to Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Naval Minister Yonai, and Army Minister Itagaki by representatives. Subsequently, the citizens marched to the British Embassy, chanting slogans such as "Japan Will Never Yield!" The resolutions and declarations are as follows: In the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks, based on the Arita-Craigie Agreement, Britain must genuinely abandon its hostility towards Japan and declare complete recognition of various situations in China. Unexpectedly, British actions have recently revealed their cunning nature, rejecting Japan's proposals for the transfer of the Tianjin concession to China, as well as the prohibition of the circulation of legal tender. If Britain disregards international faith, and insincerely accommodates Japan's "Holy War for the Revival of Asia" while implementing a chain of alliances to support Chiang Kai-shek, then the Japanese authorities would rather sever conference negotiations to uphold the aims of East Asian renewal.

### Japan Watching Situation Regarding Northern Sakhalin Island Dispute

(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson told journalists this morning that Japan should adopt a wait-and-see approach regarding the situation on Northern Sakhalin Island. However, should the situation warrant action, Japan would have no choice but to respond accordingly. There have been no new updates from the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo. However, the Soviet court has notified Japanese oil and coal merchants on Northern Sakhalin Island that their assets will be seized, but the implementation may be temporarily delayed. According to the local court, it previously ruled that Japanese companies must pay fines for failing to provide workers with daily necessities, with a deadline of the 19th for payment, or assets would be seized.

During the same period in 1937, there were 3,052 officers and 52,387 soldiers. The reduced numbers are partly due to transfers elsewhere to strengthen the general defense of the Empire. It has also been decided to transfer one cavalry regiment elsewhere during the next rotation. Whether the number of infantry needs to be further reduced, I am not yet able to comment."

### Christianity in China Now Welcomed: Bishop Wader of Sichuan Returns to US to Talk

(New York, Airmail) Bishop Wader, of the American Methodist Episcopal Church, stationed in Sichuan Province, China, has preached in China for thirty-five years. From the Xinhai Revolution until a few weeks ago, when Japanese planes bombed Chengdu, he has experienced many events, knows the Chinese people, and understands Chinese affairs, especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Recently, he returned to his country via the Burma Road and gave speeches to various newspapers here, briefly stating: "Christianity in China is increasingly welcomed, and the future is unlimited. This is something that has not been seen before. Since the Japanese army invaded China, hundreds of millions of refugees have migrated, and the churches have taken this opportunity to provide relief, thereby demonstrating the true meaning of Christianity in practical life. From material services to spiritual guidance, many new converts have already been gained. Christian pastors in China were originally suspected of being fronts for imperialism, and they were unable to make progress for many years. Until the past two years, pastors in various places have risked the dangers of bombardment, stayed in various churches, and provided relief. Professors and teachers from various universities and middle schools have also moved to the southwestern provinces, re-establishing schools, not afraid of repeated bombing by Japanese planes, and able to lead a simple life, not suffering from abandoning ease and comfort. The general public has reversed its old views of the pastors, believing that their actions are solely to carry out the spirit of Christian charity and have no other purpose." (Havas Dispatch)

### US Navy Should Adopt Offensive Defense Strategy: Chief of Naval Operations Submits Annual Report, Praising the Achievements of Admiral Yarnell

(Washington) US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy stated in his report to the Navy Department today that the US Navy has become the most powerful navy in the world, with its strength so formidable that it can destroy the navies of any country in the world before they reach US territorial waters. Admiral Leahy is scheduled to resign as Chief of Naval Operations tomorrow, so this report is his last. Leahy stated, "I firmly believe that in wartime, the efficiency, training, and morale of our Navy will be unmatched by any navy of any country." Referring to former Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Admiral Yarnell, Leahy stated, "Admiral Yarnell's service in the Far East was highly commendable. For example, during the Sino-Japanese War, the difficult problems encountered in protecting the lives and property of American citizens, and issues that greatly impacted American prestige, were all properly handled by Yarnell, fulfilling the mission of our Navy." On the international front, Leahy advocated that the United States accelerate its naval rebuilding plan, because "the current international situation remains unimproved. If peace ultimately cannot be maintained, then our navy should adopt an offensive strategy, in other words, the US Navy should have the power to engage and defeat the enemy on any sea." As of June 30, the United States had 348 surface warships and 194 auxiliary ships. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy, who has served in the Navy for 48 years, has recently been transferred to the position of Governor of Puerto Rico, and is about to take office. He recently submitted his annual report to President Roosevelt, concluding that "the US Navy is powerful in attack, well-trained, and highly motivated, unparalleled in the world, and will surely defeat the fleet of any naval power." The main points of the full text are as follows: After the naval shipbuilding program passed by Congress is completed, it will be more than capable of defending the borders essential to the survival of the United States. Although US naval policy is purely defensive, if peace cannot be maintained, then our navy should adopt an offensive military strategy, preventing enemy fleets from approaching our coast and swiftly defeating them no matter where the battle takes place. In order to achieve this goal, all factors that make up our navy should be given great power and given sufficient training: (1) A naval expansion plan requiring $1 billion has been approved by Congress and should be completed as soon as possible. (2) Naval aviation bases and destroyer and submarine bases should be started immediately. (3) The number of officers and soldiers in the Marine Corps should be increased. Only then can the efficiency of the US Navy reach its peak. (30th Havas Dispatch)

### Britain, France and the Soviet Union to Commence Military Talks Immediately: British and French Military Delegations Set to Depart Soon, Chamberlain Reports on Recent Negotiations

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that British and French military representatives will be dispatched to Moscow as soon as possible, or within this week, to begin military talks, while political discussions will proceed simultaneously, with the aim of reaching a final decision on the terms of a political agreement. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that while the mutual agreement talks between Britain, France and the Soviet Union were ongoing, the Soviet government made a suggestion, saying that since the talks had progressed to the current stage, all countries concerned should immediately begin military talks which would dovetail with the political negotiations in order to arrive at a final agreement. The British and French governments have voiced their approval to this suggestion, and decided to dispatch military delegations to Moscow as early as possible. The British military delegation will be made up of Admiral Plunkett, Air Marshal Bennett, and Army Major Heywood. At the time, Independent MP Ms. Rice-Bons asked when the military delegation would be able to depart. Prime Minister Chamberlain also replied, "Within the week or so." (31st Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) According to "Paris Midi", the Soviet delegation participating in the three-nation military talks will be personally led by Defense Commissar Voroshilov, with General Orlov as interpreter. Members of the delegation will include General Gurik, Major General Chatenho, and others. (31st Haitong Dispatch)

(Paris) Regarding who France will select as its chief representative in the staff talks that will be held by Britain, France and the Soviet Union in Moscow, the official announcement has yet to be made. However, it has been learned from reliable sources that General Dumonque, the garrison commander of Lille, France, will lead the French military delegation to participate in the Moscow staff talks, assisted by Honziger (Commander of the French Forces in the Near East) who has just returned from Turkey after participating in French-Turkish military talks. (31st Haitong Dispatch)

(Paris) According to "Paris Midi", British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds is currently awaiting new instructions from London. It is unlikely that he will meet with Molotov again within the next day or two. Regarding the three-nation military talks, the newspaper declared that the Soviet Union is now demanding that the world's democracies decisively end the policy of non-intervention and replace it with military mutual assistance. This goal is currently being hastily drafted by the National Defense Committee. (31st Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

### Britain and Soviet Union to Commence Business Negotiations Soon

(London) According to local sources, once the political agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is completed, Britain and the Soviet Union will be able to conduct business negotiations with the hope of signing a new business agreement. The Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, expressed this intention to the Soviet authorities when he visited the country. According to British exporters, the current Anglo-Soviet business agreement is more favorable to the Soviet Union and less favorable to Britain, so a new agreement should be drafted to replace it. However, some people in the business community, given the Soviet Union's strong stance during the current three-nation negotiations, are deeply concerned that it may not be willing to grant Britain new benefits after future business negotiations, and therefore advocate maintaining the current business agreement.

### Swedish Foreign Minister Talks About the Problem of Guaranteeing Finland

Swedish Capital Foreign Minister Sandler, in a recent speech here, gave a broad account of the European situation, which involved the issue of the fortification of the Aland Islands. He said that only the Soviet Union has not yet expressed its consent to the fortification plan, and that the neutral status of the island must be protected. There is a natural need for fortification. Sweden has communicated its views to the Soviet Union in a friendly, open and frank manner, hoping that the country will eventually provide guarantees for maintaining the neutral status of the Aland Islands, and expressing concern for this would be good. In addition, he also touched on the issue of guaranteeing Finland, saying, I have heard that Britain, France and the Soviet Union are ignoring Finland's objections and forcing it to accept guarantees. The right for each small country to accept guarantees rests in its own hands. In the case of Poland, it does not want to accept the guarantee of the Soviet Union, so Britain, France and the Soviet Union do not force it. Then, since Finland is a neutral country, and its position is outside the tense area, why do Britain, France and the Soviet Union ignore its opposition and forcibly place a guarantee on it? If Britain and France organize a peace front in this way, then it will be difficult for other countries to believe that they respect the independence of small countries. (31st Havas Agency Dispatch)

### News Report Ridicules Non-Interventionism

(Moscow) The Soviet Russian newspaper "Izvestia" yesterday published an editorial commenting on international politics and involving the Moscow negotiations. First, it attacked the policy of non-intervention, saying: "We agree to organize a peace front, but it must be organized by sincerely and resolutely rejecting the damaging doctrine of non-intervention. As for the Moscow negotiations, the reason why progress has been slow and no agreement has been reached is due to the influence of non-interventionist thinking." (31st Haitong Dispatch)

### Four German Former Aristocrats Lobby in England

(London) The Daily Herald recently reported, "German former aristocrats Baron von Leienbaden, Baron von Fagenheim, Count von Bockler and von Wahdusky are all highly regarded by Führer Hitler and recently visited England in a private capacity, taking the opportunity to hold talks with members of both Houses of Parliament, as well as representatives from the business and media. They informally listened to the opinions of the British side and explained the views of the German side. They have now submitted a report to Führer Hitler on British opinions and British policy. Baron von Leienbaden was a German representative to the League of Nations and met with his friends, including Lord Cecil, the chairman of the British League of Nations Society, to lobby him, saying that Führer Hitler is in fact a pillar preventing Bolshevism. Baron von Fagenheim is well acquainted with Lord Sambourne, the leader of the opposition Labour Party in the British House of Lords, and discussed German-Polish relations with him in detail, telling him that a large part of his property in Poland had been lost due to the Treaty of Versailles. Count von Bockler is the author of "How Strong is Britain?" and gave a speech in Palestine, criticizing British policy in insulting terms. Von Wahdusky previously worked in the German Embassy in the Soviet Union. His visit to Britain shows that the National Socialist Party is paying close attention to the negotiations between Britain, France and the Soviet Union." (31st Havas Dispatch)

### Italian Residents in France Present Commemorative Medal to Herriot; Herriot Elaborates on Historical Relations Between the Two Countries; Italian Residents Express Willingness to Fight for Democratic Governance

Farion City. The Italian Residents Association in France presented a gold commemorative medal to Mr. Herriot, Speaker of the French Chamber of Deputies and Mayor of this city, in recognition of his consistent sympathy towards Italians. The medal features an image of Italian national hero Garibaldi. The presentation ceremony was held at the Employment Agency building, attended by 5,000 Italian residents, creating a grand spectacle. Herriot delivered a speech, stating that he had strived for closer relations between Italy and France when he was the leader of the Radical Socialist Party in 1932. Historical records show numerous instances of cooperation between Italy and France. In 1859, France sent troops to assist Italy in achieving unification. In the Battle of Solferino and the Battle of Magenta, the French officers and soldiers who died numbered no less than 10,000. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when France was abandoned by all countries, Italian national hero Garibaldi voluntarily offered his services to France. After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, even though Italy maintained neutrality, Garibaldi's descendants and workers still came to France to serve. "Later, the people of Italy and France ultimately fought together for the same cause. It is hoped that the two countries can be close again in the future." Subsequently, Mr. Kerkchi, secretary of the Italian Residents Association, delivered a speech, stating, "France has provided shelter and livelihoods to 900,000 Italians under the protection of the Republic's laws. Therefore, when the situation in Europe became critical last September, 100,000 Italian immigrants were prepared to fight for France. In the future, 'if war breaks out, Italian democrats will still fight for France and for democratic governance.'" (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### Polish Officer Arrested in Danzig; Polish Side Lodges Protest; Militarization of Danzig

The Polish High Commissioner to the city, Mr. Chodacki, will lodge a protest with the city council. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

(Paris) "Le Matin" recently reported that after Lieutenant Colonel King-Hall, a British political commentator, repeatedly sent a large number of letters secretly to the German people, Mr. Fuchs, a journalist from the Free City of Danzig, has recently followed suit, also sending a large number of letters to France to advocate for Germany. He identifies himself as the Director of the Information Department of the Danzig City Council. These letters are postmarked from "Cologne, Germany." In addition to explaining Germany's views on the Danzig issue, they also claim that the port of Danzig is threatened by the Polish port of Gdynia. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Danzig. Regarding Poland's ban on Danzig goods being exported to Poland, local newspapers today carried alarming headlines such as "Poland Attempts to End the Danzig-Polish Economic Union" and "Warsaw Declares Economic War on Danzig."

Cleveland, USA. Mr. McNutt, the former High Commissioner of the United States to the Philippine Commonwealth, who was recently transferred to the Director of the Federal Security Agency, is a possible Democratic candidate in next year's election. He recently participated in the International Peace Festival here and delivered a speech against isolationism and in support of the government's current policies. He said, "If our country implements an isolationist policy, the naval power must be expanded more than threefold to be prepared for contingencies in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. We must also expand the army so that we can send expeditions to any point on the American continent when necessary. Furthermore, we would have to give up the markets that our agricultural products hold in various countries. Two-thirds of the cotton fields in the southern states and most of the wheat fields in the western states would be deserted. The livestock industry in the west would also be difficult to operate." In short, the result of implementing an isolationist policy would be to reduce the standard of living of the people, militarize the entire country, and require the United States to bear the defense of the American continent alone. The economic life of the whole country would be bankrupted until the next generation. Is this a good plan? He concluded by saying that peace cannot be sought through surrender, but should be achieved through cooperation. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### Germany and England Attempt to Improve Economic Relations; Whether Göring Will Visit England Depends on the Situation

(London) Lord Kemsley, the British press tycoon, returned to London tonight after meeting with Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Germany, a few days ago. Well-informed sources in the Conservative Party claimed that when Hitler met with Lord Kemsley on the 27th of this month, they discussed the possibility of the German Minister of Aviation, General Göring, visiting England before December of this year to conduct economic talks with the British authorities. (Note: Mr. Walda, a counselor from the German Ministry of Economic Affairs, has held formal talks with Mr. Hudson, the British Secretary for Overseas Trade.) However, this matter depends on the international situation. In other words, if the Danzig issue can be resolved in some way and the situation in Europe eases, General Göring may be able to make the trip. But under the current circumstances, this is difficult to achieve, which is the view shared by Hitler and Lord Kemsley. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

In short, the difficulties in the negotiations are entirely technical in nature, and it is hoped that they can eventually be overcome. However, due to various difficulties that could not be resolved in time, it was not possible to submit a bill to the House of Commons immediately." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### English Naval, Land and Air Forces; Test Defense Strength; Continuous Large-Scale Exercises in August and September; 135,000 National Defense Troops Participate

(London) England will test its naval, land, and air defense strength in August, on a scale unprecedented in peacetime. The first step will be taken today, with 12,000 reservists, including retired officers and pensioners, joining the team, driving the reserve fleet in preparation for a review by the King of England in Weymouth on August 9. They will report in Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, and Gosport, and will drive the fleet according to the new plan and at a record-breaking speed.

Civil defense in 28 counties in southern England will undergo an unprecedented major test. The King's review in Weymouth will feature 123 warships in formation, including three battleships, four cruiser squadrons, five destroyer squadrons, aircraft carriers, submarine escorts, patrol ships, and tugboats. Among them, 60 ships form the reserve fleet, and the rest are auxiliary ships driven by non-reserve soldiers. For the first time in 15 years, the reserve fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Houghton on the flagship HMS Effingham, will be fully deployed. Over the past three years, the ships of the reserve fleet have been greatly modernized and will be reviewed by the King in a state of readiness for combat. After the review, the ships will sail to Portland, Rosyth, and Invergordon for exercises in August and September. The domestic fleet has begun to move to Rosyth and Invergordon, where the largest fleet seen in the northern seas in 20 years will be stationed. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) A Havas reporter recently learned that the British government has invited the famous Spanish General Aranda to come to England in September of this year to observe army exercises. Although General Aranda has not yet responded, he will surely accept the invitation. General Aranda gained fame for defending Oviedo during the Spanish Civil War. He recently gave an interview to reporters from Portuguese newspapers, opposing Spain's joining the German-Italian Axis, which has made him even more prominent in the eyes of the world.

### Long Yun Reports; Number of Yunnan Province Troops Sent to War of Resistance; Reached 170,000 in the Past Two Years; Continued Troop Deployment Before End of War

Kunming Communication. The first Provincial Assembly of Yunnan Province has been held, with nine meetings held successively. When the eighth resolution meeting was held on July 20, Provincial Chairman Long Yun specially attended and delivered an important speech, lasting two hours. First, he talked about the general situation and explained the significance of convening the Provincial Assembly. Second, he talked about the military affairs of Yunnan Province and the process of sending troops. Third, he elaborated on his own three feelings. Because the deployment of troops in Yunnan is very broad and unprecedented, local gentry have the greatest impact on administrative relations, the greatest help to the execution of conscription, and the greatest hindrance to the execution of conscription. He hoped that the gentry could cooperate with the government in a practical manner, implement administrative orders, and solemnly pointed out that the most contributors in the two years of the War of Resistance were the soldiers at the front and the farmers in the rear. The children of farmers have served as soldiers and laborers, so-called shedding blood and sweat, and have done the greatest for the country. The following is a summary of his statement. Long Yun said that since the province received the central government's order to send troops to participate in the War of Resistance, it initially organized one army (i.e., the 60th Army), with more than 30,000 people. Then it organized another army (i.e., the 58th Army), with the same number of people as the 60th Army. In total, about 70,000 troops were sent. Afterwards, replenishment continued, with eight decisions made before and after. Including the regular army, a total of nine decisions were made to send troops. After the troops from the province arrived at the front line, they were transferred from southern Shandong to the north and south of the Yangtze River, and then changed to a group army. The two armies were formed into three armies. This decision to send troops from the province included two regular armies and eight decisions to send supplementary troops. The total number of troops sent was about 130,000. Plus the number of troops currently being fine-tuned, which is about 20,000, the total number of standing troops in the province's counties is about 30,000, totaling about 170,000. Initially, the province had said it would send 200,000 troops, and now the difference is only 20,000 to 30,000. The number of troops sent is almost the same as the original number. However, it is not yet known whether the military situation can come to an end after the original number of troops has been fully deployed. If the war cannot be ended, then the province's troop deployment in the future may even exceed 200,000. As for all the formations, they are all in accordance with the central government's formations, and each division has very complete light and heavy machine guns. There are particularly many heavy machine guns, with one company per battalion, which can be formed into a total of 27 companies. These weapons were all purchased by the province. Only the heavy artillery was allocated by the central government. Regarding the province's talent of generals and officers, after years of training, there are more than 7,700 people. However, after the war broke out, it was felt that it was not enough. Regarding military expenses, from the date of mobilization to the completion of the reorganization, the province made every effort to bear them. After the troops departed from the province, the central government was responsible for receiving them by the Military and Political Department. This decision to send troops from the province felt the most difficult to handle the supplementary troop quota. The province successively dispatched 27 or 28 regiments, and half of their equipment, weapons, and expenses were issued by the province. It took three months from recruitment to departure, and the hardships were indescribable. Finally, it was discussed with the central government that the province would first establish a supplementary regiment, and the Military and Political Department would be responsible for the expenses. The province was only responsible for the responsibility of collecting slightly. It was agreed by the Military and Political Department. After the implementation of this method, it was not a small help to the province's military expenses. As for those that have already been used, it will not be requested from the central government to make up for it.

### Chinese Army in Punan Counterattacks Zhalin; Puppet Tax Police Serve as Internal Response; Japanese Pacification Squad Leader Beheaded; Qianjiaqiao Recaptured Simultaneously

Punan Communication. In Punan, tax revenue is mainly from the salt district. The military expenses of each team depend on this for maintenance. The Japanese army has long coveted it. Due to the activities of the guerrillas, there is no way to interfere. This time, the Japanese side launched a large-scale invasion in various parts of southeastern Pudong. For strategic reasons, the local National Salvation Army decentralized into smaller units, temporarily abandoning the Zhalin city area. However, the salt tax revenue in that area is the highest. Now is the hot season, and salt production is very prosperous. Therefore, the Japanese army sent a large team to garrison there, and appointed the puppet Fengxian County Pacification Chief Ogawa to supervise and command. In addition to building solid defense projects and setting up heavy steel cannons on all sides, the team was stationed in the Gu family house at the foot of the East Gate of the city, and the area was divided into a restricted area with barbed wire. The situation was very serious. The leader of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army, Ding Xisan, believed that this area was not only related to tax revenue, but also an important place along the coast of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Therefore, he sent elite troops to attack. One day in advance, he secretly sent plainclothes teams disguised as salt vendors to mix into the city and pre-arrange with the puppet tax police stationed in the salt farms. The police were forced to hire, deeply understood righteousness, fully agreed, and were willing to serve as an internal response. On the morning of the 28th, they launched an attack from inside and outside, the sound of shouting and killing rose, and bullets flew like rain. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and most of them escaped with their weapons. Each team rushed directly into the warning line, and then used machine guns to strafe. The Fengxian County Pacification Squad Leader Ogawa, who was directing the battle, was captured on the spot and immediately executed by shooting to show military power. Six small steel cannons and more than 30 boxes of ammunition were intercepted. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, and strategically the area was indefensible, and Japanese warships were anchored on the sea surface, making it even more difficult to resist the artillery fire, the 8th Detachment withdrew in an orderly manner at 6 pm that afternoon. In this battle, the Japanese suffered more than 100 casualties. The 8th Detachment lost only more than 10 people. As of the 29th, the Japanese side had not yet sent a team there. Qianjiaqiao, more than 30 miles away from Zhalin city, is also a salt tax revenue agency. The Japanese side has occupied it three times, and each time it has been driven out in embarrassment by the fierce counterattacks of the National Salvation Army. On Monday of last week, the Japanese army sent 50 members of the Nanjū Ogawa team, along with 80 puppet police officers, to take over the salt warehouse, tax bureau, and bulletin, and forcibly imposed an additional salt tax of more than one yuan per catty on the salt people. Under the lewd power, the suffering of the salt people was unspeakable. After the 8th Detachment triumphed in Zhalin, it immediately sent a team the next day to expel the Japanese army, and still appointed Team Leader Zhang to work with the original Ao Chief Zhao to be responsible for handling the exemption of old debts and salt tax to provide relief.

### Deng Benyin's Troops Attack Kunqing; Deaf and Mute Captive Writes Poetry to Express Ambition

Kunshan Communication. Deng Benyin, commander-in-chief and pacification commissioner of the Southern Jiangsu Guerrilla Army of the Second War Zone of the Military Commission, after receiving the new commission order, reorganized and reorganized the teams in the triangle area separately. At the beginning of the month, he thoroughly destroyed 17 bridges on the Su-Xi Highway. The traffic in the area has recently stopped, which is due to this. Deng also personally led the Mei and Zhu troops to advance eastward to Kunshan and Qingpu, and joined the Wang Shilan and Jiang Fengwu troops of Baimao and other troops in Qingpu and other places, killing more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 232 people, seizing one heavy machine gun, four Czech-made Wallis-type light machine guns, 48 wooden cases, and 239 rifles. Among the captives, there was a deaf and mute Japanese soldier named Ikeda Nijo, who could write fluent Chinese. He said that he was willing to be a Chinese, and wrote a limerick to express his ambition. The text says, "Helplessly embarking on the journey, dragging wife and bidding farewell to mother, knowing that there is no way to survive, shedding tears and swallowing hard, fortunately to be captured today, like ascending to the paradise of bliss, sincerely returning and relying, not making a Fuso circle." Deng recently sent the Zheng troops to join forces with the New Fourth Army to advance to the suburbs of Shanghai. A few days ago, they once broke into the Toyota Yarn Factory in Caojiadu, and seized six self-defense guns. When a Japanese employee tried to resist stubbornly, he was immediately shot and killed. After the troops achieved their goal, they calmly withdrew.

### Tragic Situation of Taixian Bombing; Japanese Aircraft Drop More Than Twenty Bombs

Taixian Communication. After Huaiyin was abandoned, Taixian became a major cultural and economic center in northern Jiangsu. The Japanese side often used airplanes to bomb Taixian. On June 14, it was first subjected to bombing and devastation. After the bombing, the prosperous market was restored by the local authorities. However, on July 23, Japanese aircraft flew again to Taixian. At 9:15, three planes came to Taixian from Yangzhou. First, the plane flew to the city to circle and reconnoiter. After a while, it disappeared. After twenty minutes, the three planes flew to Taixian again and circled back and forth to inspect the target. Then, more than twenty bombs were dropped one after another, including one burning bomb. At the same time, machine guns were used to strafe the people, and leaflets written by Wang Jingwei were distributed. It lasted for nearly an hour, and did not escape until about 10 o'clock. It is reported that the bombed places in the city were near Chenjiaqiao, near Zhouqiao Doutian Temple, and the city theater. Outside the city, they were in Dajie outside the North Gate, Tianfu Commercial House, Xu Jiaqiao Jianbi, Hedong Electric Company, and Pozi Street. Among them, several places were hit by bombs and caught fire, and the disaster was extremely tragic. It is estimated that 78 city houses and civilian houses were damaged, and about 20 civilians were killed or injured. Rubble flew everywhere, and the corpses were blurred, which was unbearable to witness.

### North Jiangxi Road Still Tense; But There Will Be No Further Disputes; Relevant Military Authorities Have Already Agreed; Expected That Migrated Chinese Can Return to Their Former Residences

North Jiangxi Road, from the south of the tap water bridge to the north of Old Bazi Road, the shops and residences on the east side have been suddenly blocked by the Japanese side with wooden poles and barbed wire fences since 3 pm on the 29th of last month. The residents within the barbed wire fence have moved to the concession one after another. According to those who continued to patrol the road yesterday, this kind of panicked migration situation has not stopped and is even worse, because there are still gaps in the current blockade, allowing the residents to move freely. It is heard that these gaps will be blocked from the 10th of this month. It is said that the blocking date may be brought forward. At that time, the Japanese side will inevitably apply the same restrictions to those living in the area as they do to the residents of Hongkou, which is the reason for the panicked migration. However, the residents or shops who have left the area feel the most difficult and painful, because there are no spare houses in the central area of the concession to accommodate them. Therefore, many residents feel that they have nowhere to go after moving their furniture outside the barbed wire fence. The sadness in their hearts cannot be expressed in words. As for the gaps, there are still Japanese soldiers guarding them yesterday, so the tense atmosphere has not dissipated.

As Reported by the Western Press

According to the Zi Lin Bao, everything was calm yesterday (30th) in the area along the former Qiankou of Hongkou. The Chinese residents who were very alarmed on Saturday and Sunday afternoon were greatly stabilized after understanding that there would be no further development. However, the attitude of the Chinese residents on the east side of North Jiangxi Road seemed to be different, because several sections of the road were very active, without stopping all day. Many shops, factories, small inns, and residences moved out, while some parts seemed to be business as usual, and many shops

Open as usual

However, there were piles of furniture and bedding on the sidewalks on the west side of Jiangxi Road, indicating that many people had not returned to their residences in the Japanese-occupied Hongkou area, and seemed to be waiting and seeing, because most of their belongings were not far from them, and they stayed in North Jiangxi Road and side roads. The Japanese Marine Corps strengthened the obstacles that they suddenly erected on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, along the blocked road

Add barbed wire

The British military authorities also erected obstacles opposite the old ones erected by the Japanese army. Except for the section between Haining Road and Peng Road, there were workers from the Public Works Department busy removing the old obstacles of the British soldiers and replacing them with new ones. British soldiers still occupied the defensive house at the intersection of Bazi Road. However, on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, British soldiers entered the house and cut off the Japanese soldiers' obstacles in two places. One of them has been blocked yesterday, leaving a way to enter the house. In front of the telephone company building at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road Bazi Road and Haining Road, both

Stationed British sentries

And the British soldiers' defensive house with the letter "A" in the Japanese defense zone has been blocked and separated by Japanese soldiers, but there are no soldiers stationed in it. Except for two sentry positions of the Japanese Marine Corps on Chongming Road, no other Japanese sentries were seen. The obstacles erected by the Japanese side have not been moved out of the British defense zone to the sidewalk on the east side of the definite boundary. It is believed that because the residents east of Ren Road can enter the shops and alleys, the obstacles have not been moved out,

British defense zone

The "loss" suffered by the British army due to the erection of obstacles by the Japanese soldiers is only a 40-yard section of road on Tiantong Road. Before the incident on Saturday and Sunday, the British defense zone was almost at the New Asia Bank Building. Although the obstacles erected by the British army near the hotel still exist, the Japanese soldiers have blocked the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Jiangxi Road. Yesterday, it was heard from reliable sources that there would hopefully be no further disputes there, because the military commanders involved in the matter have completely agreed on everything. It is expected that the Chinese residents who have left Hongkou believe that there will be no war and will move back in one or two days.

### "China Central Transport Company" Director Missing; Rumored to Be a Political Kidnapping; Related to Strike

According to the English Great American Evening News, according to Japanese sources, Dong Ming (transliteration), a director of the Sino-Japanese joint venture China Central Metropolitan Transport Company, which is affiliated with the China Central Development Company, disappeared on Thursday after leaving his residence on Di Siwei Road with three unknown Chinese in Western suits. Until late last night (30th), people in general were increasingly afraid of Mr. Dong's safety. Dong's wife was afraid

Dong has been kidnapped

And said that her husband's disappearance was related to the strike of the employees of the "Public Bus Company on the North Bank of Suzhou River". At 9 o'clock on Thursday morning, Mr. Dong left home, saying he was going to the office, but immediately returned with three other Chinese. He talked briefly for a few words and went out again. On the verge of leaving, he told the maid that he was going to the company, and then

Never seen again

If Mr. Dong was kidnapped, then the kidnappers must have been politically motivated, because his family has not yet received a notice of ransom. On Thursday, some employees of the company were instigated to strike by Chinese terrorists, so it is more believed that those who kidnapped Mr. Dong were politically motivated.

### Tragic Situation of Taixian Bombing; Japanese Aircraft Drop More Than Twenty Bombs

Taixian Communication. After Huaiyin was abandoned, Taixian became a major cultural and economic center in northern Jiangsu. The Japanese side often used airplanes to bomb Taixian. On June 14, it was first subjected to bombing and devastation. After the bombing, the prosperous market was restored by the local authorities. However, on July 23, Japanese aircraft flew again to Taixian. At 9:15, three planes came to Taixian from Yangzhou. First, the plane flew to the city to circle and reconnoiter. After a while, it disappeared. After twenty minutes, the three planes flew to Taixian again and circled back and forth to inspect the target. Then, more than twenty bombs were dropped one after another, including one burning bomb. At the same time, machine guns were used to strafe the people, and leaflets written by Wang Jingwei were distributed. It lasted for nearly an hour, and did not escape until about 10 o'clock.

Outside the city, they were in Dajie outside the North Gate, Tianfu Commercial House, Xu Jiaqiao Jianbi, Hedong Electric Company, and Pozi Street. Among them, several places were hit by bombs and caught fire, and the disaster was extremely tragic. It is estimated that 78 city houses and civilian houses were damaged, and about 20 civilians were killed or injured. Rubble flew everywhere, and the corpses were blurred, which was unbearable to witness.

### Unified Principal and Interest Paid Yesterday, Securities Soar in the Gray Market, Unified Reconstruction and Gold Bonds Handled Equally, Credit Foundation Solidified, People's Hearts Stabilized

After the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the payment of principal and interest on various customs-guaranteed debts, the National Debt Fund Management Committee consulted with the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—agreeing that the four banks would handle the discounting of principal and interest. The payment of principal and interest on the Unified Public Bonds began yesterday. Shanghai will pay in six installments. The details are as follows:

Three Banks Act, Discount and Pay

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China, upon notification from its head office, allows discounting of principal and interest within customs guarantees. The bank will, starting yesterday, handle the discounting and payment of the principal and interest of the seventh installment of the Unified Public Bonds due at the end of July, through the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Bondholders should first fill out an application for principal and interest discounting and apply to the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. After the banks verify the application, they will issue a "Discount Certificate" and pay in six installments, each installment being one month, and provide a remittance bill from the Joint Reserve Committee of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications.

Apply for Discount, Note the Points

Bondholders wishing to apply for discounting should note: (1) The principal and interest due for discounting are limited to Unified, Reconstruction, and Gold Bonds; (2) Various principal and interest coupons of Unified Public Bonds can be filled on one form. If both Unified and Reconstruction bond coupons are held, two forms should be filled; (3) If there are more than fifty interest coupons of each type of public bond, every fifty coupons should be combined into one bundle; (4) 5% income tax should be deducted from the public bond interest. The application form stipulates: (1) Public bond name; (2) Installment number; (3) Amount receivable per coupon; (4) Amount; (5) National currency payable, after deducting defaulted interest on bonds or income tax on interest coupons.

Three Bonds Stipulated, Payment Dates

A reporter from New Sound News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China that after the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—discount and pay for the customs-guaranteed debts, the payment dates for the principal and interest of each debt are as follows: (1) The seventh principal and interest installment of the five types of Unified Public Bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) of the Republic of China Year 25 will be paid starting July 31; (2) The seventh principal and interest installment of the Republic of China Year 25 Reconstruction Public Bonds will be paid starting August 31; (3) The twelfth principal and interest installment of the Republic of China Year 17 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds will be paid starting September 30. However, the Unified Bonds due at the end of July will be paid via remittance. The Reconstruction and Gold Bonds will also be paid via remittance in the future.

Payment Confirmed, All Bonds Soar

Regarding various reports from outside sources that the Unified Public Bonds being discounted and paid by the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—were not credible, it is now confirmed that they are indeed facts. The securities gray market soared yesterday due to the confirmation that the Unified Public Bonds are being discounted and paid by the four banks. Closing prices: Type A was 52 yuan, up 1.2 yuan; Type B was 45.8 yuan, up 0.7 yuan; Type C was 44.05 yuan, up 0.85 yuan; Type D was 42.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan; Type E was 43.2 yuan, up 0.55 yuan.

### Adapting to Market Needs, Increased Use of Remittances, Banks Not Using Remittances Can Borrow from Counterparts, But Should Also Provide Reliable Collateral, Financial Market Stabilized Yesterday

The Shanghai financial market has stabilized after the efforts of the Discount Committee of the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—and the Banking and Money Trades Joint Reserve. Rumors have ceased, and people's hearts have settled. The change to paying the discounted Unified Bonds' principal and interest through remittances has greatly increased the remittance supply of the Banking Joint Reserve. The details are as follows:

Financial Market Has Stabilized

The black market exchange rate yesterday was four pence for British pounds at HSBC and 7.75 yuan for US dollars, with no changes. The actual exchange rate was 4.34375 pence for British pounds and 8.46875 yuan for US dollars, and the prices are gradually stabilizing. HSBC and other banks continue to provide as much supply as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries. The black market price of gold closed at 3,650 yuan in the morning and 3,643 yuan in the afternoon, with minimal fluctuations, also trending towards stability. The remittance premium has receded to 240 yuan yesterday. The securities gray market rebounded across the board due to the confirmed payment of principal and interest.

Remittance Supply Circulating in the Market

After the Banking Joint Reserve Committee handled the use of remittances by counterparts, various banks and firms have provided collateral to the committee to obtain funds, directly adjusting funds and indirectly maintaining the market by increasing supply. By the end of last month, the amount of remittances used was 10 million yuan. However, it is expected to increase significantly starting today because the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are using remittances from the committee to pay the principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds due. The committee takes the use of remittances by banks and firms very seriously, depending on actual needs. The Remittance Use Preparation Inspection Committee will hold a committee meeting in mid-August to conduct inspections.

Credit of New Remittance Supply

Yesterday, a financial magnate told a reporter from Daguang News Agency that in this allocation of new remittances, banking counterparts are purely subject to allocation. The amount of remittances that each bank needs is reported by the banking clearing house, based on the remittance needs of each bank. The inspection committee makes an extremely fair allocation based on the reported situation. The amount allocated to each bank starts from 500,000 yuan. There are very few banks that do not need to use remittances. However, if a bank that does not use remittances needs them, it can only request distribution from relevant counterparts. The amount borrowed should also be accompanied by reliable collateral, and the procedures are roughly the same as those for money traders. As for the main reason why foreign banks trust this bill, it is because the bill is accompanied by full collateral. Moreover, important figures from foreign banks participate in the selection of inspection committee members. The inspection of each bill is conducted publicly and audited by both Chinese and foreign members.

### Proposal to Order Foreign Rice, Authorities Refuse to Discuss, Yesterday's Market First Weak, Then Up, Detectives Reconnoitered at Trading Platforms

The seven rice trade groups in Shanghai held a joint meeting at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Those in attendence included Fu Qian耕, Huang Zhihe, Zhu Xiangsheng, Jiang Hongbin, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Yang Wenqing, Yu Bingwen, Chen Zi某, Changshu Rice Trade Association Pan Jibin, Lu Wenshao, South Gang Guild Yan Jiyun, etc., over twenty people in total. Xing Zhigang chaired, and the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Market Management Committee Director Fu Qian耕 reported the recent rice market situation for the past week. Then they began to discuss the proposal to stabilize the rice market. (Decision) It was found that the recent rice supply has been scarce, and inventory has been reduced, leading to a rise in rice market prices and food security concerns. Fortunately, the two concession authorities are doing their best to maintain price limits and strictly crack down on transactions exceeding the limits. The various rice trade groups in Shanghai unanimously agree with this measure. In the future, they should understand the hard work of the concession authorities in maintaining food security, earnestly persuade merchants to continue procurement and transportation within their capabilities, and advise cargo owners to sell all their stored rice as much as possible. What is especially important is that the buying and selling of rice by firms and customers must uniformly comply with the price limits and must not exceed them in any way. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

Wuhu and Suzhou Successively Lift Bans

A reporter from New Sound News Agency learned from various rice trade groups yesterday that the original scarcity of supplies was due to local restrictions on rice exports in various national rice-producing areas. Now, Wuhu, Suzhou, Wuxi and other places have successively lifted the bans, allowing rice exports to be transported and regulated. Also, Suzhou and Wuxi have allowed the issuance of removal permits starting today. This removal permit is temporarily limited to 6,000 bags, so general traders are purchasing upon hearing the news.

Cash Supply Still Insufficient

Due to scarce supplies and declining inventories in the bean and rice market a few days ago, rice merchants raised prices and traded privately, causing market tensions and chaotic order. After the two concession authorities sent personnel to investigate and strictly enforce price limits, and each member of the Market Management Committee separately advised firms and customers to comply with price limits and maintain food security, things gradually calmed down. Recently, due to frequent news of lifting bans in various places, people's hearts have stabilized, and rice prices have fallen back. The bean and rice market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday and closed at 12:00 PM. Medium and low-grade goods were all traded at price limits. However, top-grade white rice was still not shipped. Three or four boats arrived from downriver yesterday, and 2,000 bags were loaded by land and water. A total of about 15,000 bags were traded in the morning. However, the market first weakened and then rose. The reason is that the cash supply for trading is still insufficient. Although hoarders are releasing some, the demand is very strong. Although it can help, in general, both buyers and sellers are engaging in off-the-books transactions under the close watch of personnel dispatched by the police authorities of the two concessions.

Advise Merchants Not to Exceed Price Limits

Because the Market Management Committee saw rice prices rebounding and trending upwards again during the mid-market yesterday morning, all members of the Management Committee advised 105 firms and customers not to exceed price limits and violate the law. At the same time, detectives stationed on the trading floor reconnoitered the buying and selling situation of each firm and customer. If there was anything suspicious, they would immediately detain the witnesses on the spot and report them to the bureau for legal action.

Ordering Foreign Rice, Refused Discussion

The Municipal Council suddenly received a submission from a rice merchant yesterday afternoon. The content stated that the current price limits set by the Municipal Council made it impossible to sell foreign rice. The tone implied dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's 20 yuan price limit. It is said that the Municipal Council will not consider this petition from the rice merchant. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency at the rice trade meeting, Yang Heqing, the manager of Cheng Yu Rice Store, proposed that the two concession authorities consider ordering foreign rice, but it was deemed unnecessary and was also refused discussion.

### Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Shipping Rates Increase by Another 25%

British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire increased freight rates by 25% on the 22nd, and changed the price list to be calculated in Hong Kong dollars, with settlement every two weeks. It has only been a month, but because the price of Hong Kong dollars has soared and the market is unstable, the two companies have notified customers again that from the day before yesterday (30th), subsequent payments will be made according to the daily market price of Hong Kong dollars, which has already been reported in this newspaper. According to shipping merchants operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, it has now been agreed that starting today (August 1st), the freight rates before June 22nd will be increased by another 25%. (For example, the original price of general merchandise was 18 yuan per ton. After adding the previous 25%, the total price per ton is 27 yuan. Adding a 30% public welfare donation and a 20% lighterage fee, the total freight cost per ton of general merchandise is 40.05 yuan.) The freight rates for other goods are increased according to this percentage.

They rushed into the town on the day before yesterday. There was no major contact between the two sides. The current situation is unclear, but half of the town has been destroyed by fire as a result. In addition, vagrants are rampaging, and the town's losses amount to more than 30,000 yuan in cash.

### Refugee Relief Prepared, Purchase of Food Rice, Supply of Coal, Increase the Standard of Relief Cost

Recently, Shanghai market prices have been continuously rising due to the impact of foreign exchange, and the livelihood of citizens is deeply threatened. The refugee relief of various charities is facing greater difficulties due to high prices. The Refugee Relief Association has made efforts to properly arrange adjustments. The association's office purchased 1,235.394 shi of food rice this spring. At that time, the average price per shi was about 13 yuan. Therefore, although the current market price is more expensive, the association can still supply the needs of various charities at a price of 13 yuan per shi. In addition, the coal used by the various charity shelters is also supplied by the Kaiqu Mining Bureau at a special price after the association's consultation. When the association continued to supply relief to various charities from the International Red Cross last November, the refugee relief cost issued at that time was two yuan per person per month. Later, as various goods continued to rise in price, the current standard of relief cost has been raised to 2.63 yuan per month, so as not to affect the nutrition of refugees.

### Scarce Shipments of Fresh Eggs to Shanghai from Various Places

The fresh egg raw materials needed by various egg factories in Shanghai are mostly supplied by eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu. Now, transportation in various parts of northern Jiangsu is difficult, and shipments of fresh eggs to Shanghai are scarce. Although a small number of shipments to Shanghai have been made from eastern Zhejiang after the indirect resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, it is quite troublesome to obtain export certificates, so it cannot be transported smoothly.

The telegram said, "Extremely Urgent, It is found that export certificates for fresh eggs have always been issued by the county.

### Dinghai City, Recovery Plan, Dinghai County Chief Su Back to the Mountains to Reorganize Troops

After Dinghai and Shenjiamen fell one after another, County Chief Su Bensen, feeling responsible for the loss of Dinghai, has secretly returned to a mountain in Dinghai to reorganize the dispersed troops to plan the recovery of the county seat.

### Plate-Making Workers Demand Salary Increase, Present Eight Conditions, Awaiting Employer's Reply

According to China News Agency, there are more than 40 photography plate-making industries in Shanghai, with a total of more than 400 workers. After months of preparation, the Photography Plate-Making Industry Research Association has now been organized. It has received a group registration certificate C No. 47 from the Political Department of the Police Department of the Public Concession. All plate-making workers have filled out volunteer forms and joined the association, aiming to unite the friendship of all workers and striving to

improve treatment and increase worker benefits. In view of the fact that the treatment of plate-making companies in Shanghai is not uniform, with varying degrees of good and bad, some even work day and night without rest all year round, and only get more than ten yuan in monthly wages. At a time when the cost of living is rising, even personal life is difficult to maintain. For those who have family responsibilities, for this reason, after the resolution of the Association's Board of Directors, it was presented to

the employer

eight conditions for improving treatment. The most important is that each company should set aside another two points for every square inch of copper-zinc plate under the income item to be allocated to the workers as a salary increase. The employer should subsidize the association's operating expenses with 150 yuan per month. In addition, conditions such as the cessation of work on Sundays are essential. This resolution has already been signed and submitted by the workers' representative to

the employer

before the end of this month (ie July 31) for a satisfactory reply. Otherwise, from August 1, the workers of companies that do not accept these conditions will declare a strike and seek another solution. According to a reporter from China News Agency, it is learned that several large-scale companies have agreed to accept the conditions in moderation, but there are also opponents. The opinions of the employers are quite different. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, there was no formal reply.

### Refugees at Guangci Shelter Petition Against Relocation

The Guangci First Refugee Shelter in Qingliang Temple, Xinzha Road, has been accommodating refugees from Guangdong in Shanghai. Since August 13th, it has been almost two years. Recently, it was rumored that the owner of the temple intends to reclaim the property, and all the refugees inside will be disbanded. Upon hearing this, the refugees were greatly alarmed and, yesterday morning, formed a group of several hundred people and went to the Cilian Association, the governing body of the shelter on Yunnan Road, to petition. They stated that they have been living in the shelter peacefully for a long time and pleaded for the owner to be persuaded to postpone the recovery of the property and to cancel the relocation. They also drafted a long letter detailing the difficulties of relocation and submitted it to the directors of the Cilian Association for review. After reading it, Mr. Guan Jiongzhi, Mr. Huang Hanzhi, Mr. Wen Lanting, and Mr. Feng Yangshan, recognized the validity of the reasons stated and readily promised the refugees that they would find a way to postpone the relocation of the shelter.

### Contraband Items in Concessions Released; Shanghai East Already Controlled Is Not Included in the Area

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, if contraband items are transported to the Shanghai concessions, they must be certified by the consuls of various countries or the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce before customs clearance is permitted. However, the so-called concession area originally included Hongkou and Yangshupu, but the administrative power there has not yet been returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and various factories are often subject to control. Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stipulated that Hongkou and Yangshupu are currently controlled and cannot be included in the concession area mentioned in the review procedures.

### Factories in Concessions and Extra-Settlement Roads Surge, More Than 2,000 Workers Added, Foreign Goods Skyrocket, Domestic Goods Sell Well

According to statistics released by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the number of factories in the Public Concession and the Western District's extra-settlement road areas increased daily in [month not stated]. The number of workers employed by the factories also increased sharply, totaling 188,362, an increase of 2,557 compared to May. The reason is that the prices of foreign goods have skyrocketed, resulting in brisk sales of domestic goods. All factories are increasing production, so the number of workers in July is even higher than in June.

### Tax Law on Flax Etc., Both Transshipment and Export at 7.5%

The customs announced the agreement on tariff issues for June of the 28th year [of the Republic of China, i.e. 1939]. Export number 52, commodity name: linen handkerchiefs, hemmed without drawn thread or Gu embroidery, issue: tariff classification, agreed method: linen handkerchiefs, hemmed without drawn thread or embroidery.

### Parcels to Sichuan Temporarily Suspended

The Parcel Business Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration began accepting parcels of all sizes to Sichuan Province on July 26th. However, due to the large number of deliveries and transportation congestion, acceptance was temporarily suspended on July 30th. All parcels, whether medicines or personal items, were temporarily suspended. As for Yunnan Guiyang, only medicines and personal parcels are being accepted. Furthermore, due to the increase in Shanghai-Zhenhai flights, transportation is still relatively convenient. Therefore, all light mail from various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, such as Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Yuyao, Shangyu, Jinhua, Zhuji, and Xiaoshan, are forwarded through Zhenhai. Exchange services in Dinghai Shenjiamen are suspended because the local post office does not have funds to pay out. Therefore, the Shanghai Exchange Bureau has temporarily suspended the issuance of drafts. The first-class post office in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, has been operating smoothly since its resumption. Effective immediately, Shanghai-Jiujiang exchange services have also been restored, with a limit of 20 yuan per person per day and a remittance fee of one cent per yuan.

### Superstition in Ghosts and Gods, How Can Incense Ash Cure Disease? Shen Zhong's Life Was Wrongfully Lost, Cai Anhua Deserves Punishment

In Shanghai, there are often men and women who are devoted to superstition. Even when they are sick, they do not seek medical treatment but instead resort to seeking gods and worshiping Buddha, using incense ash and cold water as miraculous medicine. They delay treatment, and when the disease has worsened to the point where medicine is difficult to administer, they finally seek medical attention, but it is already too late. Countless people have lost their lives because of this. Recently, another such incident occurred. The wife of the stove owner [for heating water] at number 284 Yunnan Road, Gao You native Shen Zhong (31 years old), suddenly

Contracted an Epidemic

Her husband, Shen Jingui, happened to be away from Shanghai, so his business partner, Zhong Yuanxiang, through a friend's introduction, invited Cai Anhua (40 years old), a Jiangbei native known as the "Wen Wang Great Immortal" who lived in a bungalow on Route Ratard in the French Concession, to come for treatment. Cai went immediately and set up an incense table, performing various kinds of ghostly arts. He then declared that her illness was not serious, but she needed to sincerely seek the immortals to recover, and said the Great Immortal instructed that no other doctors should be sought, otherwise he would be punished by the gods. At the same time, he demanded 120 yuan for treatment, guaranteeing she would be

Released from the Suffering

Zhong Yuanxiang, being a superstitious person, paid the ten yuan immediately. On the 24th, Cai returned for continued treatment, still insisting her illness was not serious and that one or two more treatments would allow her to get out of bed. He also gave her incense ash mixed with water to swallow, and ordered that she be covered head to toe with a blanket. Zhong also gave him thirteen yuan for incense and travel expenses, and fearing the anger of the gods, dared not seek medical treatment. That evening, her illness suddenly took a turn for the worse,

Becoming Extremely Critical

So they urgently called for a well-known doctor, but the disease had already penetrated deep, and even the most effective medicine could not save her. She died. Only then did Zhong Yuanxiang realize that his wife's illness was not terminal, but that she had been delayed by Cai, causing her condition to change and ultimately leading to her death. Therefore, on the 30th, when he encountered Cai on Xinzha Road, he called on Chinese Detective Xu Shutian to arrest him and take him to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit under Article 3399 of the criminal law, stating that Cai and others only knew how to

Defraud People of Money

Using the guise of gods and ghosts to delay others. Countless people have been misled by the defendant's flowery words, resulting in loss of life. If they are not severely punished, it will be difficult to deter others, and so on. Under questioning by Judge Dai Rongduo, Cai Anhua was sentenced to six months imprisonment for using deception to induce others to hand over property, as a warning.

### Defendant Arrested for Impersonating a Public Official to Defraud Money

Cao Dongxiang, a 28-year-old man from Tongzhou, was an employee of the Pu Zaiji Cleaning Bureau on Maybach Road in the Public Concession. Recently, he was extremely bored and came up with a strange idea. He crossed the border to impersonate an employee of the Cleaning Bureau of the Hygiene Department of the French Concession. Every morning in the French Concession, he would inspect the night soil carriers in various alleys, claiming that dumping urine and feces into the drains was detrimental to hygiene. He would then extort three or four yuan, or five or six yuan, from each carrier. It is said that in the middle of last month, on the 15th, he encountered Qu Shuigen in Baoxing Lane, on the 21st he encountered Yan A'gen in Yuqing Lane, on the 22nd he encountered Yu Xuelin in Zhizhong Lane, on the 25th he encountered Zhao A'gen in Dexing Lane, and on the 29th he encountered Zhou Jinfu in Baoyu Lane. The five of them were defrauded of money one after another. It was only now discovered that Cao was impersonating a public official to defraud money. The case was reported to the police station, and Detective Chen Lishun arrested Cao. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, requesting detention and a postponement for investigation. The victims also recounted their experiences of being defrauded. After Judge Qiu questioned the defendant, he ordered him to be detained pending further investigation.

### Rice Shop Manager Embezzles, Released on Bail Pending Investigation

The Dachang Shen Rice Shop was located in Kaibei, with a capital of 19,500 yuan. Wu Jiyun from Suzhou was the manager. After the war, the shop set up a liquidation office at No. 4 Jingye Lane, Xinzha Road. Now, shareholders Pu Junda and others have discovered that Wu embezzled 8,710 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen of public funds. They reported this to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese Detective He Yunpu investigated Wu without success. On the 30th, Wu suddenly surrendered to the police station with a lawyer. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit for embezzlement in the course of business. The defendant's defense was that this amount of over 8,000 yuan was either a bad debt or litigation expenses, all of which could be verified in the accounts. Judge Xiao ordered a postponement for further interrogation, and the defendant Wu Jiyun was released on bail to his defense lawyer so that the accounts could be verified.

### Investigation of Vegetable Prices in the City; Bean Curd Prices Rise Today

The prices of various commodities in the city have soared, especially daily necessities such as rice, flour, beans, meat, vegetables, oil, sauce, and fuel, which have risen by one or two, three or four times compared to when the war broke out. Therefore, the livelihood of the poor is becoming increasingly difficult. Yesterday, it was learned that bean curd businesses also decided to raise prices as follows due to soaring raw material costs: Old bean curd: minimum 4 fen, 1 yuan (large) per board, 7 jiao (small). Tender bean curd: minimum 2 fen, 6 jiao per board. Bean curd skin (commonly called "baiye"): 1 fen per sheet. Dried flavored bean curd (large): 5 fen per piece, (small): 2 fen per piece.

Yesterday, the supply of vegetables from various goods in the 16th Pootung Old Gate Bridge area was scarce. Water chestnuts: 8 yuan and 8 jiao per hundred market catties. Eggplant: around 5 yuan. Winter melon: 1 yuan and 8 jiao. Pumpkin: also requires 5 yuan. Watermelon: 15 or 16 yuan per load, 5 or 6 yuan per hundred market catties.

### Landlord in Hongqing Lane, Wuding Road, Raises Rent by 40%; Tenants Request Postponement

The houses in Hongqing Lane, No. 237 Wuding Road, are managed by Jardine Matheson & Co. Yesterday, in the name of the management office, they sent a letter to each tenant, demanding a 40% rent increase. The tenants in the lane believe that, as prices of all goods have risen sharply and life is difficult, the landlord is actually raising the rent at this time, and by as much as 40%, which has aroused public anger. Therefore, they have initiated procedures to first request the landlord to postpone the increase or slightly increase it by 10%, in order to show sympathy for the difficulties faced by the masses.

### Ministry of Finance Cables Orders to Ban Exports of Mercury and Cinnabar; Shaoxing Native Textiles Exempted from Exchange Settlement; Stone Tax Exempted to Show Compassion for Laborers

The Ministry of Finance recently cabled orders to customs offices in various places: (1) Inquiries about mercury and cinnabar, which were previously banned from export, should be handled in accordance with the ban. In the future, the transport of mercury and cinnabar, whether within the central government's jurisdiction or from ports in the central government's jurisdiction to guerrilla areas, will not be permitted without a passport issued by the Resources Committee, in order to facilitate management. The previous requirement for a guarantee for the domestic transport of mercury and cinnabar is no longer necessary. (2) Inquiries about the silk textiles produced in Huashe, Shaoxing County, which are entirely sold domestically and not exported, should be temporarily exempted from exchange settlement and from the restrictions of the measures for reporting and transshipping export goods, in order to facilitate domestic sales. (3) In order to show compassion for laborers, the Ministry hereby approves the exemption of stone tax. However, those transported to and from treaty ports are not exempt. Please comply accordingly.

### Male Servant Abducts Woman, Hides Handgun, Jumps from Building Out of Fear of Crime and Dies; No Family Found, Ordered to Be Buried by Charity; Maid Wang Qiufen Ordered to Be Taken Back by Her Master

Wang Fengsong, a 25-year-old man from Shandong, worked as a servant at the home of Zhang Songshan at No. 9 Shengda Lane, Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession. On the 11th of last month, after being dismissed by his master for some reason, Wang concealed 51 yuan in wages owed to him by his master. That night, he went to the Meimei Hotel at No. 15 Rue Wagner and booked room No. 15, asking tea boy Xu Zhirong (40-year-old Shanghainese) to call a

Ningbo Prostitute

Li Meizhen (20 years old) from the Ji'an Lane No. 13, No. 178 Avenue Min-Tillet, to accompany him. They stayed for nine nights, and then moved to the Rongxing Hotel. On the 25th of the same month, Wang also abducted Wang Qiufen, a 14-year-old Yangzhou maid from the home of his employer, Zhang Songshan, hoping to sell her. Having nowhere to hide her, he hid Wang Qiufen at the home of Yu Renchu, the family of the prostitute Li Meizhen. That night, Yu asked the girl about her background and learned that she had been abducted. Fearing that the police would find out and

Escape Responsibility

Yu was also informed by the prostitute Li Meizhen that Wang had a handgun with him when he stayed at the Rongxing Hotel. Yu believed that Wang's behavior was improper, that he had abducted a girl and was illegally carrying a firearm, and that failing to report this would make him even more responsible. Therefore, on the 26th, he reported this to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Wang Fengsong and take him and the girl Wang Qiufen into custody overnight. The next day (27th) at 7 p.m., Chinese and Western detectives took Wang to the office on the second floor of the Lujiawan Police Station for questioning. Unexpectedly, Wang Fengsong, feeling guilty and fearing punishment,

Jumped Out of the Window

Attempting to escape, resulting in internal injuries. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died on the morning of the 30th due to severe injuries and ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan branch. Unable to find the deceased's family, it was reported to the prosecutor of the Second Special Court yesterday to examine the body. The official ordered the body to be buried by the charity. The abducted girl Wang Qiufen, after being identified by the police, was ordered to be taken back by her master.

### Feng Baorong and His Son Suspected of Instigating Perjury, Prosecuted by Prosecutor, Defendant Denies Instigating Perjury, Further Interrogation Pending Arrest of Feng Guifen

The estate of the late Ningbo native Feng Yimei, a shareholder of Yangzhen Ginseng Shop, consisting of 100,000 yuan, was managed by his wife Feng Jin. Feng had a son named Shanzhang, who married a woman named Wang. Later, Shanzhang also died of illness, and Wang became a young widow, adopting a son named Feng Gengfa. Later, she gave birth to a posthumous child named Feng Gengsheng. Wang originally intended to live with her aunt, Feng Jin. However, Feng Baorong (who lived in Yuyang Lane, Baiyu Department Road, and ran a dental shop called Ronglingxuan in Baxianqiao), a cousin of Feng Yimei, instigated discord, causing Feng Jin and Feng Wang, the

Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law to Fall Out

They once litigated in the Shanghai Local Court. After Feng Jin died of illness in Zhenping Lane, Avenue Joffre, on March 10th of last year, Feng Baorong colluded with Feng Guifen and others to forge a will, claiming that Feng Jin had dictated a will, giving all her property to Feng Baorong for safekeeping, and that Feng Baorong would also be responsible for the guardianship and education of her two grandsons, Feng Gengfa and Feng Gengsheng. As for the widowed daughter-in-law Feng Wang, she was driven out. Feng Wang, feeling resentment that her cousin Feng Baorong had forged the will

To Seize the Estate, last winter hired lawyers Yu Xiangqin, Lu Shanyu, and Yu Zhonglu to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting that Feng Baorong be ordered to hand over all the estate. Judge Wu Xiaoke, who heard the case, repeatedly summoned witnesses, and there were many suspicious points. At the end of May this year, a key witness in the case, Feng Guifen, suddenly submitted a statement to the court, confessing that the testimony he had given in court, stating that the will was genuine, etc., was all at the instigation of the defendant Feng Baorong. Therefore, Judge Wu Xiaoke, who was hearing the case, detained Feng Guifen and handed him over to the

Second Special Court

The Prosecutor's Office investigated the case, and Prosecutor Wang Ren repeatedly interrogated him, ordering Feng Guifen, Feng Baorong, and Feng Shanliang (Feng Baorong's son) to each post bail of 500 yuan pending further interrogation. After Feng Guifen was released on bail, he disappeared without a trace. Prosecutor Wang believed that Feng Guifen had committed perjury, and that Feng Baorong and Feng Shanliang had both instigated perjury. Therefore, he filed separate public prosecutions with the Criminal Division of the court. The case was heard yesterday morning in the Second Criminal Division by Presiding Judge Liao and Prosecutor Wang. First, Prosecutor Wang stated the

Instigation of Perjury

Of Feng Baorong, Feng Shanliang, etc. Then, Presiding Judge Liao questioned the defendant Feng Baorong accordingly. Feng still claimed that Feng Jin dictated the will on March 5th of last year, and Feng Guifen wrote the will on March 17th. He denied instigating Feng Guifen to commit perjury. Feng Shanliang's testimony stated that he had sent a letter to Feng Guifen reporting the details of the case. The court questioned the defendants Feng Baorong, etc., for a long time, and also summoned witnesses Feng Zixiang, Zhu Binglu, Chuan Erqing, and Kan Yangyu for brief questioning. Because Feng Wang had not arrived, and Feng Guifen had not surrendered, Feng Baorong and Feng Shanliang were ordered to post bail, and the case was postponed pending the arrest of Feng Guifen.

### Russian Patrolman Sentenced for Transporting Opium

Russian Luo Xinggao Yiwang, 25 years old, has been a patrolman for the Taikoo Steamship Company. Recently, the Russian man used the convenience of his position to specialize in transporting opium for others. At 9:30 a.m. on June 10th, Luo and a Chinese man were carrying a large leather suitcase on the Bund, taking two rickshaws, traveling along Avenue Edward VII Tianzhutang Street, when they were spotted by Chinese Constable No. 868. Suspecting their behavior, he immediately went forward to search, discovering 36 kilograms of opium inside the suitcase, worth about five or six thousand yuan. At that time, the Chinese man took the opportunity to escape. The Russian man was then taken to the police station along with the opium. It was said that it was transported from Tianjin on the Shuntian wheel. Later, a wanted criminal named Sun Dongyuan was also captured and brought to the court together. Repeated interrogation has been completed and concluded. The case was sentenced yesterday: Luo Xinggao Yiwang and Sun Dongyuan, each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for helping others transport opium, each deprived of public rights for one year, and the four blocks of opium confiscated.

### Punishment for Flower Gambling Offenders

Since flower gambling has been rampant in Shanghai West and spread to the concessions, ignorant men and women have become bankrupt and committed suicide by taking poison, which is becoming more and more common. The French Concession authorities, in view of this, in order to eliminate this evil, have ordered detectives to intensify their investigations and arrests. Recently, detectives have successively arrested flower gambling offenders Zhou Baobao, Zhang Qiaosheng, Xiang Jiming, Wen Yuanyuan, etc., in the concession and sent them to court.

### Ding Fubao's Compilation of Books Such as Qunya Gulin: Another Monumental Work Following Shuowen Gulin

Mr. Ding Fubao once spent thirty years meticulously collecting the writings and established theories of scholars who studied Xu Shen, and compiled "Shuowen Jiezi Gulin, Supplements and Corrections," totaling more than 1,200 volumes. Mr. Hu Puan praised it as an unprecedented masterpiece in the field of philology. After completing "Shuowen Gulin," Mr. Ding immediately planned to compile "Qunya Gulin." Ding believed that what "Shuowen" explained were the original meanings of characters, while what "Qunya" interpreted were mostly borrowed meanings. The two complement each other and neither should be neglected. The books included range from "Erya" downwards, including "Xiao Erya," "Guangya," "Xu Guangya," "Baiya," "Pianya," "Bieya," "Biya," "Shiya," "Dieya," and the attached "Erya Yi," totaling eleven kinds. Annotations and commentaries on these books are compiled in a manner similar to "Shuowen Gulin." Among them, "Erya" alone references over 270 specialized works, and countless miscellaneous writings, notes, and literary collections are also included. It can be called a grand collection of philology and exegesis. Furthermore, Ding considered books such as "Fangyan" and "Shiming" as treasure troves for textual research and exegesis, so he separately compiled "Fangyan Gulin" and "Shiming Gulin." In the future, he plans to combine the three books for publication. Amidst the current turmoil of war, Ding continues to diligently compile books to benefit scholars, which can truly be described as dedicating himself to academic and cultural work. It is said that the first draft of his book has already been completed, and as soon as it is finished, it will be published by a major bookstore in this city that has branches in various provinces.

### Chen Dong, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Talks About How to Choose Departments and Schools: Choosing a Subject Must Be Close to One's Personality; Subjects Good at in Middle School Are Not a Basis for Further Education

Furthermore, if choosing a subject only focuses on personal prospects, it is easy to go astray. If one chooses a subject that is not close to one's own nature, just because it has prospects and can find a job, that would be terrible. Because the subject is not close to one's own nature, the result is that one cannot learn it well. Even if one graduates and勉强 engages in that kind of job, one will definitely not have good results. There is an educational film in the United States that depicts a young man seeking a career, listing dozens of possible occupations. After selecting and selecting, he felt that the best occupation was a bank, because the bank had a lot of money, and he was handling money all day long. Therefore, he fantasized that after engaging in the banking business, he could become a rich man in the future. As a result, he engaged in the banking business. Who knew that the bank's career was not close to his nature, and he spent every day with numbers. Others were familiar with the things he did, but he found it difficult. He was fired by the manager in less than two weeks. Later, he carefully reflected on the proximity of his personal nature, avoided all external temptations, and chose another career, and he felt comfortable and happy. If we choose a subject, we only pay attention to the way out, and do not take into account the proximity of the sex and me, the result will definitely be difficult and difficult to achieve. I thought it was a very promising thing, but in you or no way out.

(3) The principle of proficiency in subjects: It is a very valuable principle to use the subjects that one is good at in middle school as the standard for choosing departments and schools when entering school. However, this question is also worth discussing. First, middle school students must pass the subjects they study. Most people can't be good at a certain subject at all. There are a few students, excellent qualifications, or even each subject, everything is good, and can not determine which subject is particularly good at. These two situations can not determine the department that should be studied. Second, what is learned in middle school is all ordinary subjects, which are not the same as the departments of the university. If you say that those who have good Chinese scores in middle school will enter the Chinese Language Department of the University, those who have good English scores will enter the Foreign Language Department, those who have good math scores will enter the Mathematics Department, and those who have good physics and biology scores will enter the Physics and Chemistry or Biology Department, it is really a bit far-fetched. Even if this is the standard, ask the medical school of the university, which is the graduate of a certain subject in middle school who goes to school, middle school also has no law, politics, economics, philosophy, society and other subjects (although these are in the civic class, but there is no independent subject), how can it be considered that the graduates of each subject have good grades, enough to make the graduates choose these departments, the engineering and agricultural courses of the university, ordinary middle schools are also not there, can the engineering and agricultural colleges of the university not allow high school graduates to enter school, so if you think that a certain subject in middle school is good, you think that the standard for selecting a certain subject is not universally applicable. The subjects studied in middle school are basic and ordinary materials. The excellent performance in a certain subject does not mean that you are particularly close to the subject. In the ordinary and basic materials of a certain subject, or because the teacher teaches well, or because everyone is studying hard in the subject, so you also work hard, or because of an accidental reason, you spend a little more time on the subject, which is enough to make your performance in the subject better, but you enter the university, and you may not be able to learn in a specialized and profound way. My personal experience is that in middle and primary school, the scores of Chinese subjects have always been good, and later English homework, because I have met two very good teachers successively, is also quite interesting, so when I graduated from middle school to prepare for further education, I was determined to learn English at the university, and I took the exam with this wish. Later, when I entered the university, I spent two years focusing on literary writing, but the more I wrote, the more I felt that my literary talent was insufficient, so I resolutely gave up and changed to education. Therefore, it is not enough to take a good grade in a certain subject in middle school as the standard for choosing a department.

Yesterday's spot red market was still volatile, as if it was shifting with the tightness of foreign exchange. However, there was still a fluctuation of 145 yuan a day, and the trend after entering had the appearance of restoring the normal track. The situation today was weak at the beginning, and once opened at 3,610 yuan, making a low of 2,570 yuan. Then it rose sharply, once reaching a high peak of 3,715 yuan, and finally turned down again, which was caused by the tightening of foreign exchange in the middle, which caused a buying spree. As a result, it closed at 3,643 yuan, a rebound of 48 yuan from last Saturday. The whole day's trading was mostly by scalpers, so the entry and exit were still strong, with more than 1,200 taels. Silver shop jewelry gold rose first and then fell back, and finally hung high by 5 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold were unchanged.

Spot Red Up Four Eight Yuan

Since the early morning, each bar (ten taels), at the beginning of the opening, due to the news that foreign exchange was slightly soft, the people's hearts were still good, and the opening was 15 yuan higher than the closing last weekend. The silver shop helped to enter the money exchange industry for 20 taels, and the price was 3,610 yuan. After opening, suddenly heard that foreign exchange was very hard, and the selling wind rose sharply. The money exchange industry and the silver shop helped to compete to sell, and suddenly pressed down 40 yuan. The gold number sold ten taels to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,570 yuan. At that time, because the cash number and a certain gold number and securities helped to absorb vigorously on the low side, it soon rebounded 40 yuan. The cash number sold 20 taels to the securities help, the price was 3,610 yuan. After that, the money exchange industry came to block out again, and a certain silver number also had the intention to sell, so it once again made a small 20 yuan. A certain silver number sold 30 taels to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,590 yuan. However, in the blink of an eye, it suddenly moved against the rise sharply, because foreign exchange stopped 松趋紧, buyers suddenly saw active, a certain gold number and securities helped to scramble to absorb, plus the money exchange industry also stopped blocking and bought, in the sparse transaction, actually soared 125 yuan, a certain gold number gained profit and then spit to the securities help 20 taels, the price was 3,715 yuan, at that time, a certain gold number gained profit and continued to come out of the cage, the entrants watched, and the decline was also strong, the price immediately poured 85 yuan, the silver shop helped to sell 10 taels to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,630 yuan, at noon, slightly returned, the securities help entered a certain gold number 20 taels, 3,650 yuan for the closing price at noon, in the afternoon, because foreign exchange did not change much, so the situation was still flat, first by the money exchange industry to do each other 20 taels, the price was still 3,650 yuan, then because the silver shop helped to scramble to block out, once the press was small 15 yuan, a certain money exchange industry entered the silver shop to help 30 taels, and the same industry 20 taels, the price was 3,635 yuan, After entering, because foreign exchange was stable and soft, the intention of buyers turned better, and soon returned 10 yuan, the gold number sold 10 taels to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,645 yuan, and then the silver shop helped to sell 20 taels to the gold number, 3,643 yuan for the evening closing price, and the result was a rebound of 48 yuan from the end of last week, with a fluctuation of 145 yuan throughout the day.

The Shanghai standard gold price is still 1,207 yuan and yuan, which is due to the fact that the London electricity on the 19th, the British pure gold per ounce, is still fixed at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 half-officials.

### The Bank of Japan Suddenly Grabs Fiercely, Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listing, all remained unchanged. Due to the large number of settlements by foreign firms such as Asiatic Petroleum, Texaco, Mobil, and other foreign firms, coupled with the sudden and fierce grabbing by the Bank of Japan through a commissioned agent, the situation became tight. Initially, although Sassoon, a Western merchant, tended to release, briefly showing a loosening trend, it ultimately could not last long due to demand exceeding supply. There were slight fluctuations during the day, but although the Indian bank suddenly came in to replenish in the afternoon, it was not affected because Sassoon, a Western merchant, continued to sell, and the Chinese yarn and flower guilds also came to supply. The overall trading was still robust.

### Sassoon Sells Off, Oil Firms Settle

In the early morning, recent London telegraphs continued to rise to 0.0625, and forward rates also rose by 0.125. New York silver prices remained closed. London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rate between British and American currencies did not change, against Shanghai it was up 0.0625, and against France a small 0.01. All foreign exchange rates against the US dollar remained stagnant. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank opened its spot selling price in the morning: British gold at 4 pence 4.0625, and the US dollar at 8.5625 yuan. Compared to last weekend, British currency tightened by 0.03125 and the US dollar softened by 0.0625. After opening, Chinese merchants first offered British gold to the British bank at 4 pence 0.0625 for August, at which time the situation was quiet and unchanged. When HSBC's listing was announced, it did not move, and when the silver equalization tax was revealed, it was still exempt. Thereafter, due to the tendency of the British firm Sassoon to release, and the bank's poor appetite, the trend was towards lower prices. It is estimated that Sassoon sold spot British gold to British banks like Hua Bi at 4 pence 4.375 and 4.6875, and then offered spot US dollars to a certain bank at 8.6875 and 75 yuan. Later, the bank had once bid back British gold, with the strongest at 4.5 pence, and the lowest US dollar at 8.78125 yuan. At this time, Yu Li (acting for the Bank of Japan) grabbed spot British gold from fellow banks at 4 pence 4.0625, and spot US dollars at 8.625 yuan. In addition, Asiatic Petroleum, an oil firm, also followed suit and settled spot British gold with HSBC at 4 pence 3.125, and then Mobil and Texaco also settled spot US dollars with Chinese and foreign banks at 8.4375 yuan, so the situation turned tight. Near noon, as foreign firms reduced their settlements, the market gradually stabilized. Extended until the close of the morning session, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pence 3.75, and the US dollar at 8.53125 yuan, compared to the morning opening, British currency tightened by 0.03125 and the US dollar also softened by 0.03125.

### The Indian Bank Also Absorbs

The afternoon market situation was quite stable, without major changes. First, the Chinese yarn and flower guilds offered spot US dollars to a certain bank at 8.5625 yuan. Then, the British firm Sassoon continued to release spot British gold to the Indian bank at 4 pence 3.75, and spot US dollars at 8.53125 yuan. Afterwards, the Indian bank settled spot British gold with Hua Bi at 4 pence 3.4375, and also purchased spot US dollars from Anda at 8.5 yuan. Extended until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pence 3.75, and the US dollar at 8.5 yuan, resulting in British currency tightening by 0.0625 and the US dollar softening by 0.125 compared to last Saturday.

### Not Much Activity in the Hong Kong Exchange Market

Hong Kong, 31st dispatch: Today's exchange market opened steadily, unchanged against British currency and easing by 0.0615 against the US dollar. The Shanghai exchange rose by five jins. The Japanese exchange eased by 0.25. At 11:30, the Shanghai exchange rose by six yuan, to 331 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. At 1:30 in the afternoon, there were no changes.

### British and American Gold Pounds Fall Two or Three Yuan, Gold Certificates Rise Instead

Yesterday, there was little demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, and the market even tended to fall at one point. British and American gold certificates rose because of the high demand for foreign exchange settlements at the end of the month, and foreign banks actively absorbed them. The exchange market was weak, so it followed the rise. The Hong Kong exchange market was firm and expensive as demand increased. The supply and demand for other currencies was scarce, and they were very stable. Japanese gold certificates rose first and then fell back, but ultimately remained at 1.07 yuan. Korean certificates were quite stagnant, remaining at 0.87 yuan. Transactions in the public association were scarce, with only Yongfeng selling and Rentai buying British gold certificates for 50 pounds. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds at 2 yuan, British gold certificates up 0.7 yuan, American gold pounds down 3 yuan, American gold certificates up 0.25 yuan, Hong Kong certificates up 0.01 yuan, French franc certificates up 0.04 yuan, Australian gold certificates up 0.3 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

In the afternoon, the drop was even sharper, finally reaching 220 yuan, which was 37.5 yuan lower than last Saturday.

### Securities: Trading in Both Domestic Bonds is Brisk, World Rubber Stockpile Greatly Reduced

In yesterday's securities gray market, the issue of the seventh series of principal and interest was officially resolved. It is still in accordance with what this newspaper reported a few days ago, paying in six installments through foreign exchange drafts handled by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank. There is no talk of discounts or mortgages as rumored by various newspapers, which shows that the propagandists have other purposes. Various newspapers do not check and are often used by them. However, even according to this method, it is 75% different from the sixth payment of legal tender. Therefore, the market was initially firm and then weak. Transactions on the market are still calculated with interest. There are quite a few who are unwilling to receive interest and sell. The market sentiment is therefore strong with underlying weakness. It is a pity that the Soviet loan is not a fact. Therefore, although buying interest is strong on one side, selling is also very active, so it is high and then low again. The difference is still about one yuan. The future may not be easy to stabilize immediately due to environmental factors. The selling sentiment in the market is strong, mostly due to forced liquidation due to pledges. Therefore, twists and turns in the future are still inevitable. The buyers and sellers on the market are mainly Lianyi, Dafeng, Hongkang, and Zhenkang, while the sellers are mainly numbers 22 and 46, which are said to be related to pledges. Class C with interest once reached 45 yuan, but at the close it quickly fell back by about one yuan. The ex-interest price in the gray market was about 42 yuan, and the trend is still firm. As a result, the market price rose again by several dimes to 1.2 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 1.45 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Stock trading, traded 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the price was 37 yuan.

According to the June rubber statistics report from the Public Industry Association, a total of 62,136 tons were exported from various production areas, 5,500 tons less than in May. Total consumption was 88,021.6 tons, 3,000 tons more than in May. Inventory was 375,700 tons, 22,000 tons lower than in May. According to the previous calculation, the inventory can supply consumption for five months, but now it can only supply for more than four months. The International Rubber Regulation Committee seems to have noticed this early, so the production from July to December has increased to 60%. Production areas may have exported 7,400 tons less in June, which is equal to the approved output, while 22,000 tons more were exported in 1938. The continued low inventory is noteworthy. The current world rubber inventory is the lowest in the last ten years. Yesterday's stock delivery was completed in the morning, and the trading time in the afternoon was very short. Prices were stable, but the market was sluggish.

### Yarn and Flowers: Speculation Focuses on Unpopular Yarn, One Mark Jumps Twenty Yuan for Five Sons

The yarn market, which has been fluctuating for many days, showed signs of recovery yesterday. This is because actual demand is still not weak. As for the value difference between unpopular yarns and popular goods, it is too far, attracting the attention of some hoarders. There was a slight increase in purchases, and the market tightened. The price of 20-count yarn with the Five Sons brand jumped by 20 yuan. Because Hong Kong has a special demand for this yarn, the spot goods of 20-count Special Jincheng are becoming more and more scarce, and the market price has become a situation of rising without falling. Yesterday's highest price was 650 yuan, which is inevitably cheaper compared to other brands. General operators reorganized their forces and came back to drag in goods.

The current yarn situation. The market situation was very peaceful at the opening in the morning, and there were no major changes in the opening price. It was also rumored that Ma Zhang had stopped loading and handling goods, so the market was sluggish. The single price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse was 547 yuan, and the spot price of foreign warehouses was 559 yuan. After a short time, it was heard that the inland merchants were purchasing cheap unpopular yarn, and there were also sales in the north. However, the amount of purchases was very small, and people's hearts were lifted, and the buying interest suddenly became strong. The closing price of 20-count Jima has risen to 566 yuan, and the warehouse single price is 552.5 yuan. It is found that the statistics of various gangs buying in half a day are 1,075 bales. The market of 20-count Double Horse rose by 8 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 10 yuan, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn was flat. Today, 40 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Yantai. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed on the left:

Fellow traders 660, Yunnan 20, Hong Kong 185, Ningbo 50, Tianjin 75, Mainland 155, Fuzhou 20, Northern Gang 10, Total 1,075

### Cotton Trading Stalls

External cotton market price, New York cotton market, is very active. The opening was good due to the good telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. There were many transactions among peers, and overseas cotton merchants were very interested in purchasing due to export subsidies, attracting purchases from the banking industry and speculators. The market price rose by eight or nine pounds of sound. There was no fluctuation in the middle, and the closing was very firm. The result was the same as the opening price. The Indian cotton market was very strong. Yesterday, the forecast rose by more than two robins. Egypt was closed yesterday.

In Shanghai, there was a rumor yesterday that the customs would be controlled by a certain party and that all tax revenues would be paid with "Huaxing" banknotes starting tomorrow. People's hearts are very unstable, and the prices of various items have risen slightly. The industry is deeply afraid that the import tax on cotton will be increased, so there were a few transactions yesterday, but the selling price was more than 20 yuan cheaper than the price set by foreign firms, and the price of Pingguo'er was 84 yuan.

Local cotton trading has come to a complete halt, with not a single package sold. The factory is restricted by tight money and its purchasing power is abnormally fragile. As for foreign cotton, it has also entered a standstill. The Japanese factories have already been handling it in succession, and the amount has been large. At present, due to financial reasons, they are temporarily resting and there is no movement. The cotton market is also in an awkward situation. The source of Su North is smooth again, and 372 bales of Tonghua arrived at the dock.

### Grains: Early New Rice is About to Appear, but There are Still Many Old Goods, the Rice Market Suddenly Relaxes, and Gray Market Prices Drop by More Than One Yuan

Dumi: The 25 piculs of Pudong's new early japonica rice, which were decided to be purchased en route, have already arrived in port yesterday, and the price opened at 20 yuan. The chaotic market situation has already been clarified. This is because the sources from all directions have gradually become smoother. It has been confirmed that Wuhu will lift the ban on exports soon. This is because the new early rice in that area will be harvested in half a month, and there is still a lot of old stock, so this measure to lift the embargo has been taken. In the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, except for Changshu and Wuxi, which are still shipping goods, places such as Changzhou, Su Tong, Li Ping, and Wang Di can still be transported out as long as taxes are paid. The areas of Nangang and Songjiang can be transported out at any time. Recently, because general rice merchants have been watching with their arms folded because of the strict price limits in Shanghai, making it unprofitable, there have been no arrivals on the river for days, and there are also few trolley buns. Now that it is heard that new rice is gradually appearing in various places, and it is becoming smoother again, they have all transported goods to Shanghai without prior agreement. Therefore, quite a few arrived in port yesterday. There are more than 20 ships of Songjiang and Nangang gangs on the river, and there are also 3,400 to 3,500 bags of Fenjing Nangang goods. Since the source is strong, the price limit can finally be lowered, and people's hearts are at peace. Moreover, because of the financial relations of the general cargo owners, it is difficult to raise prices again, so they have been selling samples one after another. Except for the special japonica rice from Changxi, the old japonica rice and early late rice have all been opened according to the limit line. For example, Su Tong japonica rice is opened at 20 yuan, Wuxi old japonica rice is 20 yuan, and Fenjing and Nangang fresh early late rice are also opened at 20 yuan. The number of transactions is more than 3,000 bags. In addition, Wuxi Yangjian opened at 19 yuan, Du Jian opened at 18.5 yuan and 18 yuan, Wuhu Gao Jian opened at 16 yuan and 15.8 yuan, Jue Jian opened at 15.5 yuan, and Wei Jian opened at 15 yuan. The number of transactions is also more than 3,000 bags. Bian Yuan opened at 21.5 yuan and 21 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice dumplings opened at 22 yuan, and pointed grains opened at 21.5 yuan and 21.3 yuan. The number of transactions is more than 360 bags, all of which have fallen sharply by one yuan compared to the gray market heard before, and the voice of the gray market is also silent.

Ke Xian: Yesterday, the shops in the Japanese street had a very greedy appetite, because at present, the price of Ke Xian rice is the lowest, and the market price of Wei Xian is around 15 yuan, which is welcomed by the civilians who sell in this street. The cargo side is no longer insistent because it is hoped that the opening of the production area will be opened. Therefore, yesterday, the various machine oil and Wei brown rice were all sampled in large quantities. The hoarders were afraid of being forced to sell at a flat price, and none of them asked about the direct handling in the mainland. Therefore, the old Jue Xian has returned by one or two cents, and the high Wei and the big market machine Xian are all at the station.

### Flour Market Turns Steady, Wheat Factory Appetite Suddenly Moves

Flour: After the No. 2 flour factory's market sharply rose by 0.15 yuan since the end of last weekend, it has reached a whole price of 5 yuan. Although the returned goods on the market are more suitable than the factory's market, the chips have long been exhausted, and all factories have a firm selling intention. For those who sell a large amount to customers, they are still unwilling to sell as much as possible. The total sales of the north and south gangs to customers is more than 20,000 bags, and the retail sales in this street and the mainland are also more than 10,000 bags. The factory's market has not changed in general, and it can be stabilized for a while.

Cross-examination: Foreign flour has been silent for a long time. Although the current inventory is as high as 200,000 to 300,000 bags, due to the tight foreign exchange and high costs, all are held by hoarders and will not be released. There are occasional sellers, but they are also a small number. Yesterday, it was heard that the Flower Basket brand only opened at 4.85 yuan in cash, and 1,000 to 2,000 bags were handled by the customer. This is a special price trial sale and is not considered a normal market.

Wheat: The market continued to improve yesterday. Because Hua Factory, which has not moved for a long time, went to the stomach, the market suddenly turned active yesterday. This is because the foreign wheat ordered by the factories, except for those that have arrived, the rest of the goods have been greatly hindered due to foreign exchange relations. In addition, the sales of flour in North China and South China seem to be more active than before, so the factory's appetite is gradually expanding. Yesterday, it was heard that Fuxin Factory had already started to handle it, and 2,000 bags were traded. The hoarders in this street also handled about 1,400 bags of high-end goods, including wheat from Nanjing, Caishiji, Shaheji, Guandian, Kunshan, and Danyang. The highest price was 7 yuan and the lowest price was 6.2 yuan, which was a corner higher than the previous weekend.

### Piece Goods: Busy at the End of the Month, Cloth Market Quiet, Traders Still Buying Cheap Goods

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday was the end of the month, and the floating accounts have been sold off. All goods for delivery have early preparations for advances, so the price of goods has been raised uniformly. Moreover, the traders have chosen cheap goods to continue absorbing the balance of funds at the end of the month, and the raw yarn and Dongpi are also very sharp. Traders trade frequently. The selling price of Yihua, Dasheng, and Zhenzhong 16-pound coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, light-pound coarse cloth by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, fine cloth and fine twill rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, Yihua Three Towers bleached cloth rose by 0.25 yuan, and dyed cloth also increased uniformly due to the increase in dyeing costs and raw materials. The wholesale numbers on this street advanced more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and grey cloth, and customers and non-industry people hoarded more than 100 pieces of white goods. The end of the month is the busiest time for delivery, and there was a rush to load goods before the week, but it was slightly quieter yesterday. The Shandong gang on the north road continued to purchase 50 to 60 bags of 16-pound coarse cloth.

Yesterday, the gangs from Yantai, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao on the north road actively handled more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, causing the selling price to continue to rise by about 0.3 to 0.1 yuan per piece. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 15.5 to 15.6 yuan, and the market price of next month's futures is 16.3 yuan, then fell back to 16.2 yuan. The Nissin and Ito companies offered Dragon Head fine cloth for 16 yuan per piece in August, which was purchased by the industry, totaling about 500 bags.

Nine pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai on the 1st. 88 boxes of wool were imported from Hong Kong on the 31st of last month, and 178 pieces of silk were imported from Ningbo.

### The Worsted Wool Industry is Uneasy, The Sultry Weather is Good for Entertainment

The worsted wool industry is now in the so-called off-season. Adults are busy with mahjong, and children are busy with chess. But since the sudden contraction of foreign exchange and the soaring costs, people in the industry are worried. The hoarding of goods is less than in previous years, and most sellers are unwilling to throw out their goods. The cargo gangs are continuing to increase by one to two tenths, and recently they have been taking back their samples. The specialty shops that specialize in clean water doors have always adhered to the principle of buying cheap and selling cheap and buying expensive and selling expensive, with the aim of following the market, so although the cost of capital has increased, in addition to sighing that business is difficult, they are not as uneasy as the large wholesalers who place orders. The inventory can indeed rise in price and have unexpected gains, but there are many new goods, and the bills of exchange have not been fully settled, and the cost of eating is extremely high, and the danger is getting greater and greater. For example, the Dong goods, the market is quite strong, and they are also rising. The fortune of the ordering gang is very similar to that of the pre-emptive order 20 years ago. From next year, the market price of worsted wool, manufactured in England, most of the most basic flannels will have to be sold for more than 10 yuan per yard, and the difficulty of operating can be predicted.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Costs are High, The Result of Heavy Taxes and Miscellaneous Taxes

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market was 1,255 yuan for spot goods, down 25 yuan, and 259 yuan for forward goods, down 4 yuan. The New York and Lyon markets were closed on Sundays, so the silk trading in the city was very deserted yesterday. White factory silk was 3,100 yuan, with a price but no market. Qili was opened at 1,800 yuan by Six Xie, with 30 dans traded. The current increase in Qili silk in the mainland is also very dramatic. The current price of the top brand grade is 78 yuan per hundred taels, and the sub-brand is 75 yuan. It is estimated that the cost of silk is 1,400 yuan, and wages, freight, and various false heavy taxes must be added. Therefore, although there is a strong demand for Qili warp from abroad recently, and there are very urgent inquiries about the forward goods of Qili warp, the Shanghai silk merchants are not dare to throw it out easily.

### Green Tea Transactions Only Needle Eyebrow

Yesterday's foreign companies' green tea. The European companies did not respond to the telegrams sent out last week, and they all held a wait-and-see attitude. There were no transactions in the main core tea and precious eyebrow green tea. The whole city only had needle eyebrow tea. Duto De Fushi and other companies bought more than 30 boxes, and the selling price was 56-7 yuan, which was 7-8 yuan lower than before. At present, the sources from all directions are scarce, and they are all three or four phases of tea, hoping to be sold together. The market is declining day by day. In addition, 44 pieces of tea leaves came from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Sugar Market: High Mian, Opens at 33 Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market rose slightly according to the London telegraph, with 7 shillings 0.75 for August, 6 shillings 2.5 for December, and 6 shillings 3 for March next year. The trend of the Public Association's market in this city turned steady. The original prices were maintained for 24 coarse whites and Taiche Baihe Chis. The national sugar is still firm. Chao Gang opened more than 60 bags of Special High Tongtai Mian Chi, and unexpectedly saw a new high of 33 yuan. The rest were tight and it was not easy to loosen up for a while. Yesterday, there were 100 bags of sugar from Xiang

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Soybeans Fall by One Yuan, Chen Also Drops by 0.7-0.8 Yuan

Yesterday, the second batch of new soybeans was launched on the market, and the market fell by one yuan. But the quality of the first batch was fresh. The price opened at 10.2 yuan, and 106 bags were traded, which were distributed by this street. Other Hankou Zha beans were difficult to stand, and they also fell by 0.6-0.7 yuan, with more than 400 bags traded. 80 bags of Pudong Du beans were opened, and the price was 10.05 yuan. 20 bags of medium-sized beans were opened, and the price was 10.02 yuan. The market also fell by 0.8-0.9 yuan compared to last week. Today, 1,000 bags of beans will be shipped to Tianjin.

### Miscellaneous News: Soy Sauce Prices Increase by 10%

The sauce garden industry in this city has increased the price of raw materials such as soybeans and flour, resulting in an increase in costs. Therefore, the industry convened a public discussion in mid-last month, and it was decided that all goods would increase by 10% from today (1st).

### Paper: Tin Foil Arrives in 2,000 Pieces

2,464 pieces of tin foil were shipped from Ningbo on the 31st. 510 pieces of paper were shipped to Yantai on the 1st.

### Hardware: American Narrow Strip Iron Very Active

American narrow strip tinplate was very active yesterday. Because the price of 200-pound company iron and Zhenghao tinplate has skyrocketed, the factories (such as toy factories, cigarette factories, can factories, and biscuit companies, etc.) have purchased narrow strip iron at relatively low prices for application. Therefore, the market is very lively. It is heard that more than 1,000 boxes were opened yesterday, and the market is soaring. The current market price of Tonghua color is 64-5 yuan per box (200 pounds), 73-4 yuan for single-pick shipment, and 55 yuan for single-hanging small color.

### Seafood: Domestic Shrimp Tails Sell Well in This Street

The source of domestic shrimp tails has been very scarce recently, and the sales volume is the highest in this street, showing a situation of supply falling short of demand. The current market price of high-grade Longxudao shrimp tails is 160 yuan in cash, and the average is 140 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than before. Wenzhou Kaiyang is sold for 85 yuan, which is also 5 yuan higher.

### Shanghai Q&A

Recently, a Western visitor came to Shanghai for the first time, touring the city to broaden his horizons. He asked a Chinese person, "Shanghai is a famous area, why is the city so small and humble? The Chinese person replied: "Shanghai is indeed a major port for trade between China and foreign countries, famous overseas. However, in terms of China, it is only one of the 1,297 counties. It is just a small coastal county town, and the system is only so. If it were a prefectural city, provincial city, or capital city, it would be even larger the higher you go." The Westerner then asked, "The city gates of a country should be solemn, regardless of size. Why is it so cramped and crowded here, almost blocking the entrance? For example, the piles of red mud at the northeast gates are as high as a person, and pedestrians have nowhere to step. Why don't the officials notice this?" The Chinese person replied, "When officials enter and exit, pedestrians give way, so they naturally don't notice the crowding. Moreover, they are only focused on official duties and don't have time to observe. It's like they are not paying attention, seeing without looking." The Westerner then asked, "I heard that during the Eastern Jin Dynasty, there was a man named Tao Kan who was praised for his diligence in transporting bricks. Are today's officials emulating the ancients, accumulating thousands upon thousands of bricks to practice their diligence?" The Chinese person replied, "Perhaps it is because this place is a gathering place for all nations, so these jar-like and bottle-like piles are set up to enhance the scenery." The Westerner asked, "China values gold and jade, and has never valued jars and bottles. It is certainly not to enhance the scenery." The Westerner seemed thoughtful and remained silent for a long time.

To be continued tomorrow: Shanghai Q&A (II)

### "Getting Ahead"

— One Blade

"Getting ahead" is originally a common human trait. A casual stroll down the street will surely satisfy you: "getting ahead" on the tram, "getting ahead" when buying movie tickets, "getting ahead" when rummaging for old goods, and even more "getting ahead" when going to a restaurant to solve the bread problem; regardless of the size of the matter, "first come, first served" is considered the best approach. Thus, the general translators in the literary world have also been "getting ahead."

Of course, translating foreign works is a good business. Buying the original for a dozen or so yuan, adding some manuscript paper and printing costs, and then selling three or four thousand copies to earn hundreds of yuan is naturally something everyone is willing to do. So everyone sees the opportunity, and everyone comes. But, as a result, sales decrease. So how can translators not "get ahead" in translating?

Thus, as soon as a foreign work that describes the Sino-Japanese War is discovered on the market, bookstore owners and all translation agencies immediately mobilize translators to rush out a translation for printing within a week or ten days. Because of the urgency of time, translators can only fill the ranks with inferior products, perfunctorily completing the task. Therefore, there is simply no time to ponder the overall meaning of the work. When encountering difficult passages, they can only translate them literally without carefully studying them. Some works are even translated by several people, resulting in inconsistent meanings and often leaving readers confused.

In the current difficult creative environment, translations are indeed abnormally prevalent. But here, I would like to advise general owners and translators not to focus too much on "business sense" and cause chaos in the literary world. On the one hand, my intention is certainly not to hope that the literary world will forever remain blank. In order not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, even if there are some thorns, they are needed (if there are no beautiful flowers). The important thing is to have someone sort, delete, preserve the good, and eliminate the bad. This work is indeed very important, and a part of it can be assigned to critics.

Mr. Lu Xun once said, "The road of translation should be wide, and the work of criticism should be emphasized." Here, I hope that the work of translation should also be done with a little more caution, and the work of criticism should not be relaxed. Like "the painful work of cutting out rotten apples," this will achieve mutual benefits.

I further hope that Free Talk can accommodate more book review articles, so that unruly bad translations can be subjected to the most severe condemnation and rebuke, and on the other hand, vigorously encourage critics not to disdain to undertake the work of book reviews.

### Smuggling

— Cai Xiebang

The Qiantang River is so calm! The sea breeze stirs up light green ripples, as if they were gentle smiles.

A layer of black clouds covers the sky. There is no moonlight. It is pitch black. The undulating mountain ridges on the opposite bank are just some blurred outlines.

A small boat floats lightly on the waves. A small oar is rowed urgently, stirring up the river water. A whirlpool rushes past, and another follows, stirring up tens of millions of them all chasing the stern. The boat is even more tossed in the rushing waves.

The river water is playing a marching song, interspersed with occasional breezes. The surroundings are shrouded in silence. Looking back at the departing riverbank, like the eyes of a sleepy person, the gloomy lights are blinking, but they are already far away.

No one moves in the boat. Only the boatman bends his waist and fiddles with the boat. Except for the roar of the river water, no one speaks, but they have ironed faces and survey the surroundings with their eyes.

The boat sails into the heart of the river. The evening tide rises. The boat is tossed even more violently, but they are still silent and black. The river flows faster and faster, and it becomes more and more difficult to cross the river. They listen to the roar of the river flowing against the砥柱, but there is no sound, as if the turbid waves of the澎湃are washing clothes, causing them to forget themselves.

The evening tide gradually subsides. The boat continues to rush towards the opposite bank. The people on the boat still have no excitement; they only hold a cold rifle, their faces stern.

The boat moves slowly. The boatman at the stern is exhausted from rowing, but he is still rowing... The evening tide is quiet. On the calm river, only this small oar breaks the surface of the water. The wind has also stopped; looking back, the faint lights on the distant riverbank have also been extinguished. All around is darkness, only a world of ink; only the solo of that single oar rowing urgently continues.

The boat slowly approaches the shore. The rugged outlines of the mountains are clearer.

"Close to the shore!" The boatman, already sitting down, warned the entire boat in a low voice.

The faces of the people on the boat are more solemn than rocks. They quietly spread out and lie on one side, aiming their guns.

Sharp eyes only look at the opposite bank. The shore lies quietly in front, as if it were dead.

The boat slowly approached the shore, gently turning sideways. Immediately, several advance team members rushed out from the bow, quickly stepped onto the river embankment, and advanced along the highway. Gradually, their magnificent outlines disappeared into the darkness of the Qiantang River bank.

In an instant, a gust of river wind rolled up splashing river water, moaning, as if singing the success of the smuggling.

### The Philosophy of the Face

— Liu You

From the time we come out of our mother's womb,呱呱falling to the ground, we are born with a face that cannot be changed until we die.

From ancient times to the present, people have indeed put effort into their faces. The so-called "art of the face," "philosophy of the face,"... are all unspeakably wonderful. The art of the face is more common, and there are countless people with this specialty. The so-called art of the face can be said to be "changes on the face," for example, pleasing superiors with a kind face, begging with a weeping face, and pretending to be dignified and solemn to subordinates to prevent them from offending. Unless you are a stupid ox who never understands the art of the face and suffers白眼all your life, most people can always play one or two tricks, and some are simply born with this ability.

As for the philosophy of the face, it is "hard to put into words." Some people, hearing these four words, will associate them with the "江湖術士" "相面先生" and other such figures. That's right, those are "philosophers of the face," but that set of knowledge is too profound. In order to be proficient in it, in addition to "the teachings of extraordinary people," one must also have some "仙骨".

Let's first talk about the "大众 philosophy of the face." Since the face is bestowed by heaven, human power cannot force it. Its essence is unchangeable in the slightest. Even amazing cosmetic surgery cannot completely transform it. If there is a method to cut off the head to fundamentally solve it, you still have to beware of not装歪申公豹's head.

Since the face cannot be changed, one can judge a person by looking at their face. Society also mostly uses the face as a standard for distinguishing classes. The faces of upper-class people are definitely different from those of lower-class people. The face of an official is always a little special. As for the faces of "emperors" and "chiefs of state," they are probably custom-made.

From this, it seems that the face and career are directly proportional. If the face of a leader is not spirited, few people will admire them. If a public representative has a bad face, everyone will think they cannot be moved. If a person with an unremarkable appearance has slightly larger ambitions, someone will immediately point at them and say, "You deserve it? Look at yourself in the mirror!" or even "Why don't you take a piss and look at yourself."

Alas, if a face is born poorly, one cannot raise their head for a lifetime, blaming their parents and blaming fate. Thus, the philosophy of the face of fortune-tellers comes: if your face is not good, it is a bitter fate, and the eight characters are not good. If the face is good, it is a good fate, cultivated in a previous life.

Therefore, by looking at the face, one knows a person's destiny. The face is the measuring instrument of fate. However, this skill is not something that everyone can do. It must be an expert who has high opinions, because the goodness or badness of the face in terms of fate is not the distinction between beauty and ugliness. Zhu Yuanzhang's strange face could ascend to the Nine-Five Supreme, while the red颜倾国倾城 with beautiful faces are薄命. Therefore, those experts blow their art greatly. Their eyes seem very sharp, for example, if the nose is too high, the middle-aged will lose their son; if the lips are too thick, one must be wary of villains for life!! It is really unpredictable.

If the face has such a relationship with fate, then I can conclude that Hitler's "英武之貌" can indeed "稱雄一時", and Chamberlain's face has some "苦像", and his fate must be more frustrated, and he will always be unable to do things satisfactorily.

However, I still have some doubts about the philosophy of the face, and I also think that the fortune-tellers are somewhat unreliable, and the magical methods taught by异人 are somewhat deceptive.

Confucius and Yang Huo's faces were so similar, and their fates should be十九the same, but the "大成先师" is not only not Yang Huo, but also can't find Yang in the hundreds of spiritual positions in the Confucius Temple.

When someone is frustrated, someone will secretly say that he is full of晦气, and once he becomes successful,叉someone will say that he is a 福相. Before the young wife is 正扶, no one can be sure that she has a "太太像". After a person dies, someone says that his forehead was shining before he died.

Although the philosophy of the face has been talked about by people as 天花亂墜, I do not say that it is mysterious, but it can make countless people believe in and use it, which contains an incredible mystery!

Children

Casually flipping through a book, I saw such a photo: two children, with their chests held high and their small mouths bulging, are blowing trumpets. The appearance is quite heroic and lovely. Underneath the photo is a line of small words: "We grow up in gunfire."

Infants picked on the tip of a spear, children carried across the ocean, we have heard about it for a long time. Martial nations can only carry forward their power on the young generation, can that "military fortune" still be "long-lasting"?

And our children? They really grow up in gunfire. A pair of small hands holds a handful of soil and throws it on the road under construction. Isn't that sincerity and seriousness enough to make you shed tears? There are many stories that move you to wet your eyes in the front line and in the rear.

Use your imaginary colorful pen to sketch a quick sketch, what kind of scene is it?

### One Word Reversed, Meaning Completely Different

— Zhang Guyu

Slave and He - He and Slave

In "The Trial of Su San," Su San, incited by Lord Liu, once said, "What kind of affection is there between him and this slave, a fleeting affair?" Her words were to resent that the Third Young Master was too unfeeling. Now, singers other than Yan Qiu all sing, "What kind of affection is there between this slave and him, a fleeting affair?" It is not known that "Slave and He" and "He and Slave" have completely opposite meanings. Changing the song to "What kind of affection is there between this slave and him, a fleeting affair" turns it into the Shanghai dialect, "What kind of affection is there between me and him, a fleeting affair?"

I Helped You - You Helped Me

In "審頭," when Tang Qin teased Xue Yan, there was "......Alas, Master Tang, when we boarded the ship in Qiantang, you helped me, and in my heart, there was you." Only Lanfang can perform according to the above words, and the rest all exchange the two words "you" and "me", turning it into "I helped you......" Should a man be helped by a woman when boarding a ship? What's more, Tang Qin is a door 客 of the Mo family, not Xue Yan's husband, so why should the wife help the door 客 aboard the ship?

Because at that time, Mo Huaigu took Xue Yan and Tang Qin to the capital to补官, when crossing the river in Qiantang to board the ship, Tang Qin welcomed Mo Huaigu, so he helped Xue 體ashore. While helping, Tang Qin had frivolous actions. Xue 體knew he had intentions, so she remembered it in her heart. Here, she brings up the old story, trying to please the thief Tang, so as not to involve brother Qi Ren. Now, the two words "you" and "me" are reversed, turning into Xue Yan having this intention to Tang Qin early on.

One word is reversed, the meaning is completely different. Celebrated actors should pay attention to such places.

(Author's note: "Slave and He" is indeed smoother to sing than "He and Slave." As for "審頭"'s "I helped you" to sing "You helped me", this is easy, but you must tell the Xiaohua face扮 Tang Qin in advance that I have changed to念 "You helped me", but he still 念 "......You helped me......". Because Dan角 mostly 念 "I helped you".)

### Stage and Screen (Middle)

— Xia Xia

- Is my mother's house and mother-in-law's house

The day I will never forget came. That was one morning half a month after I arrived in Shanghai, when film critic Mr. Ling He ran over to tell me that "Forty Age Drama Club" was short of 人, and maybe there would be some hope. Ah! This was like finding life in despair. I was so happy that I was stupid. I couldn't wait to step into "Forty Age". Mr. Ling He laughed at me for being calm, but he understood my mood at that time?

The azure blue sky, the warm sun, everything on the road seemed more lovely and kind than usual! I felt that everything seemed to symbolize that there was hope and light again for the future, so I couldn't help but give a knowing smile to the toys in the glass window of the roadside store. When I arrived at the drama club, I met the host, and Ling He said that because there was a lack of Gu Ma in "Sai Jinhua Opera", could I try it? No one else said anything, only the protagonist Miss Wang Ying was not willing. She was not at ease with me, worried that if I didn't perform well alone, it would影饗 the whole play; because at that time the rest of the actors were some red people on the stage and stars on the screen, so success was naturally what they expected; so in order to avoid making a perfect play, because of me, she didn't advocate using me. Later, thanks to Ling He's repeated requests, she got her approval and gave me a script. Call me to go back to念詞 and try again tomorrow? Ah: God! At that time, I really wanted to hug her and kiss her. I was so happy that I couldn't say a word. I took the script and ran home.

What a memorable day this is! I have never been so diligent in my life. I held the script and 念 again and again, 念 again and again. I 念 while eating, I 念 while going to the bathroom, and I was still 念 in bed for a minute I was not willing to let go; so the next morning, I memorized it by heart. In the afternoon, I went to the drama club to rehearse, and I was 120 points of careful attention. Everything the director told me, I didn't dare to be lazy, and I rehearsed carefully. Miss Wang saw that I was willing to work so hard, so she no longer disagreed. So from that time on, I officially started to have a relationship with my mother's house.

The play was staged, and I walked onto the stage trembling with a heart beating so fast that it couldn't be faster, and met the audience in Shanghai for the first time. The mood at that time cannot be described by the current pen and ink. I nervously finished the first day's play, and soon the next day's newspaper had criticism. Unexpectedly, it would say that I was the most successful one in the whole play, followed by the newspapers on the third and fourth days saying the same thing. Ah! God knows, what kind of feeling I had at that time, did I want to laugh? It's like crying again. Do you want to cry? And no tears flowed. In short, a kind of taste of getting a little comfort from thousands of hardships, I will never forget it for life.

### Extracurricular Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

However, in that conservative place in Beiping, it is not easy to do new things. It is true that most of the actors have old brains. Either they say that there has never been a rule to cut the gong in the middle since ancient times. They are saying that the tea service people object and cannot get through. Later, it was enforced, and it actually passed without any hindrance. At the same time, Yan Qiu was also the first to abolish the case目, and each ticket cost a total of one yuan and seven angles, which also slowly worked. It can be seen that no matter what, I am afraid of "being afraid and retreating", then there will never be a day of improvement. Now, the Golden Grand Theater also imitates it. Not only breaks the old rules of the Pear Garden, but also can slightly contract the time, so as not to make the corners太也受趕, this is a good thing for the corners, I don't think it will be punished by the ancestor.

The Difference Between Inviting Corners Now and in the Past

Now the trend is new, and everything in society has changed. What was previously considered to be absolutely secret is now very public. What was previously considered to be against the law and extremely inhumane is now openly practiced, and boasted as a proud stroke, and at the same time praised by people, 群讚as a certain government's good deeds. It is true that on the isolated island of Wan悪, there are heavy black幕and morality is lost. We are inconvenient to say it and we can't bear to say it. Let's talk less and return to the drama above.

Not 佞祖 lives in Xuzhou, where the four provinces of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui meet. In the years of 遜淸, this place could often see good plays. Not only did 名伶接踵而至, there were good plays to listen to all year round, and also the Bangzi腔 of Shandong and Henan, the Kao徽調 of Anhui Province, and the Er黄 of Jingji, and the Bangzi of Tangshan, almost none of them could not greatly satisfy the enjoyment of the eyes and ears. What is the reason? It turns out that this is really thanks to the great virtue of the descendants of Mr. Confucius.
