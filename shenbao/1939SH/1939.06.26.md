### The Result of Two-Pronged Counterattack by the Chinese Army: Recapture of Outposts Around Meixi; Shantou Becomes Ruins; A Unit of Valiant Soldiers Vows to Live or Die With the City; Fresh Chinese Troops Arrive in Northern Shantou, With a Commander Personally Overseeing the Front Lines; Japanese Troops Invade Northward Along the Chao-Shan Road, Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Caitang

Chao'an: Since the 21st, when the Japanese launched a sea, land, and air assault on Shantou, they have been unable to advance deeply. On the 23rd and 24th, the Japanese army launched five-pronged attacks. On the Daji Road, Chinese troops are still confronting the Japanese army across the river in the Donghu'ao mountain area. Chinese troops on the Sijiwei front, after several days of fierce fighting and continuous bombardment by Japanese warships and aircraft, which completely destroyed their fortifications, have moved to Dafan (northwest of Sijiwei) to hold their ground. Fierce fighting between Japanese and Chinese troops is still ongoing. In Anbu (more than 30 li north of Shantou), a detachment of Japanese troops initially used more than 80 shallow-water vessels and small motorboats to invade with over 1,000 soldiers. After suffering a heavy defeat by Chinese troops, they reinforced with several hundred more and attacked Anbu again, briefly breaking through. On the 23rd, Chinese reinforcements rushed to the scene and counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army, which retreated south of the iron bridge, now confronting Chinese troops across the river. Furthermore, Japanese troops in the Meixi area northeast of Anbu launched a fierce advance under heavy artillery cover. On the morning of the 24th, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged counterattack, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army retreated immediately, and all outposts around Meixi were recaptured by Chinese troops. Also, on the morning of the 22nd, three Japanese shallow-water vessels arrived off the coast of Tuopu Dongxi, northwest of Shantou, and shelled Tuopu to cover infantry landings, attempting to disrupt the Chinese army's left flank. To date, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting. As for the Shantou city area, although the Chinese army is surrounded by Japanese troops on three sides, it is still able to fight tenaciously and is engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. (25th dispatch)

Chao'an: Shantou has become a ruin after three days of bloody fighting and looting by Japanese soldiers and civilians. The Chinese army, finding no defensible positions left in the city, moved to Shanxi Beikoukou Mountain on the evening of the 23rd to establish contact with the Chinese troops in Anbu. A unit of valiant soldiers vowed to live or die with Shantou, making heroic sacrifices. Fresh Chinese troops have been arriving in northern Shantou and Koukou Qianqian, and a certain commander has personally gone to a certain location to supervise the fighting. (25th dispatch)

Chao'an: The Japanese troops attacking Shantou, having suffered repeated defeats in Anbu and Meixi, have reinforced with cavalry and mechanized units and are invading northward along the Chao-Shan Railway. Fierce fighting has erupted with Chinese troops in Caitang, ten li west of Anbu. The Chinese had prepared for this in advance, and all soldiers deployed in their positions, showing extraordinary courage. The Japanese army has made no progress and is still locked in a stalemate in Caitang. (25th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Since the start of the Lingdong war, most of the Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Huiyang have been withdrawn to Guangzhou, replaced by new troops and puppet army "pacification" units. Yesterday, Deng Longguang's forces took advantage of the situation to counterattack Jiangmen, engaging in fierce artillery battles on the Xinhui-Heshan road, killing many Japanese soldiers. Chinese troops from the Xinkai, Jiangmen, and Foshan roads are also advancing. (25th afternoon special dispatch)

(Hong Kong) On the morning of the 25th, twelve Japanese aircraft in four formations reconnoitered along the Shao-Shan highway. At noon, three aircraft flew over Jieyang and dropped two bombs on the Xi Chang. They then flew to Fuyang and dropped three bombs. Zhongshan is now intensifying wartime preparations, and the Qi-Guan highway is being destroyed in three sections. (25th special dispatch)

### White Russian Demonstration and Parade in Tianjin; Food Supplies in Concessions Running Low; British Woman Also Subjected to Degrading Search; Mr. Smith Regains Freedom

(Tianjin) This afternoon, five hundred White Russians in uniform, apparently under the direction of the Japanese, held a demonstration and parade in the First Special District. They all raised their hands in salute as they passed twenty Japanese officers. After the parade, the White Russian crowd gathered at the "White House" of the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee here. Representatives from Germany, Italy, and Spain attended the meeting, as did the chairman of the committee, Mr. Bertushin, White Russian leader Mr. Semenov, and Japanese officers. (25th Associated Press dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin dispatch: Of the two British warships docked at the British concession's wharves, one left Tianjin on the 23rd. However, vigilance in the British concession has not slackened. Patrol vehicles of the Municipal Council appear every few minutes in any part of the concession. Patrol vehicles of the British barracks also constantly patrol the area. The volunteer corps organized by British expatriates is actively training, with all members on standby. A reserve team is also being formed to provide reinforcements. (24th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatch: The British Consulate in Tianjin issued a communiqu√© stating that food supplies in the British concession are becoming increasingly difficult, and there is a severe shortage of milk, even insufficient for the needs of children. British authorities are currently seeking to use ships to transport food to provide relief. (25th dispatch)

(Tianjin) Mr. Smith, a British expatriate who was detained by the Japanese on the 17th, was released by the Japanese this afternoon. According to Mr. Smith, when he was arrested, he was thrown into a small, extremely dirty and filthy room without a bed. He was not given any food for 24 hours. After repeated protests, he was taken to a cleaner location at the Chinese police station and allowed to buy his own food. On Thursday, after several interrogations, he was allowed to have Western food. The injury to his head was only treated once after he was detained. (25th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tianjin) According to today's news, on Saturday afternoon, at the Japanese sentry line at the Racecourse Road intersection, a German-born British woman, Mrs. Finland, was stripped of her clothes, almost completely naked, by puppet female police officers hired by the Japanese in front of Japanese sentries. The only garment left on was her underwear. At the same time, her husband, Mr. Finland (an employee of the Mercantile Bank), was publicly stripped naked in broad daylight, in front of men and women, by Japanese sentries until he was completely naked. This is the second time Mr. Finland has been stripped of his clothes. The previous stripping was on June 22nd, when, in addition to being stripped, he was also robbed of two five-yuan notes of legal tender. In addition to Mrs. Finland being stripped on Saturday, there were also reports that several Soviet women were also forced to remove their clothes. (25th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tianjin) Today is the twelfth day of the blockade of the concessions. The major events that have occurred include: (1) Mr. Smith, who was detained by the Japanese, has been released. (2) The supply of milk in the British concession has been completely cut off. (3) The White Russian Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps held a demonstration in the First Special District. Yesterday, a British couple who are usually highly respected were subjected to extremely brutal searches by the Japanese. The victims were Mr. Fentley, a Scotsman, and his German wife. Mrs. Fentley is the female manager of the Country Club. Yesterday afternoon, she and her husband went to the office in the First Special District. They stood in line waiting for the search at the entrance at the southern end of Racecourse Road for over an hour. After watching many Chinese and foreign people pass through, they were finally called into the search hut. The Japanese ordered Mr. Fentley to take off his clothes in front of many Chinese and foreigners, leaving only a shirt and trousers. At the same time, Mrs. Fentley was led to an inner room, where a Chinese female searcher ordered her to remove her hat and inspect her hair in front of a sentry. She was then ordered to remove all her clothes, including her dress and petticoat. Mrs. Fentley immediately asked the Japanese sentry to leave the room, but the soldier only turned his face away for a few seconds before continuing to stare at her. Finally, she was forced to remove her underwear, leaving only a vest. After the female searcher thoroughly inspected her entire body, she was allowed to put on her clothes and leave the room. The Japanese sentry was present throughout, and the door to the room was wide open, so that all passing Chinese and foreigners could see inside. When Mrs. Fentley left the room, she saw her husband standing in the open air, with all his clothes scattered on the ground. Mr. Fentley is the manager of the Mercantile Bank and often assists his wife in the office at the Country Club. Mrs. Fentley is originally from Germany and married Mr. Fentley during his military service in Germany. Currently, British expatriates are reluctant to enter or leave the concessions unless it is for essential duties, in order to avoid being humiliated. Some British employees of the British-American Tobacco Company reside outside the concessions and are therefore spared the humiliation when going to the office in the Third Special District. Mr. Smith, who was previously detained by the Japanese, was released unconditionally at 10:00 this morning. Today, a Reuters reporter who visited him said that he was held in a dirty room with lower-class Chinese criminals for the first two days of his detention, before being moved to a cleaner cell and allowed to buy foreign food. Before his release this morning, the Japanese forced him to sign a paper expressing his apologies for his actions on June 17th. Today, the supply of milk in Tianjin suddenly decreased, greatly affecting the British Municipal Council Hospital. Many patients who rely on milk for sustenance are suffering greatly. It is said that efforts are being made to transport fresh food from Shanghai to Tianjin for relief. The White Russian Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps held a demonstration today, attended by a large number of members of the Anti-Communist Committee. White Russian leader Semenov and several Japanese officials also attended as observers. Fortunately, it passed peacefully without incident. Mr. Semenov and a Japanese officer addressed the crowd. After the parade, more than forty members in uniform sang loudly and proceeded along Wilson Road towards the British concession. The situation was tense for a moment, and the British concession immediately closed its iron gates. However, it was later learned that these people were returning home to the concession after indulging in food and drink, so the iron gates were reopened and they were allowed to pass through.

### The Situation in Tianjin Deteriorates Further; London Times Suggests Implementing Retaliatory Measures; Britain Has Not Notified France of Any Specific Plans; French Foreign Minister Solemnly Declares That the Two Countries' Interests Are Intertwined

British Labour Party MPs Vigorously Criticize Simon's Policies; Indian Newspaper Criticizes British Government's Attitude of Submission

(London) British foreign authorities are currently closely monitoring the precarious situation in Tianjin and considering implementing retaliatory measures. British Foreign Secretary Halifax has not left London this week, and Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to return today to convene a meeting of the Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee. As further reports of the humiliation of British expatriates in Tianjin have arrived in Britain, it is generally believed that the situation there has deteriorated further. The British government authorities are also deeply concerned about the lack of progress in the British-Soviet negotiations, and are also paying close attention to the news of the movements of German and Polish troops on the French border. The concern of China about the Tianjin case can be seen from the special visit of Counselor Chen of the Chinese Embassy to the British Foreign Office yesterday. According to Foreign Office authorities, the British side believes that the situation in Tianjin is becoming increasingly serious, but the actual situation remains the same as it was several days ago. The London Times today made suggestions on how to deal with Japan, stating that if British expatriates in Tianjin continue to be humiliated, Britain should implement widespread retaliatory measures within the imperial territories, and this should certainly be done in Singapore. A British government spokesman has confirmed that there is a possibility of retaliation in the future, but the Japanese side here views this statement as merely empty threats. The reason for Britain's hesitation is the imperfection of its military preparations. The European peace front has not yet been completed. If retaliation is indeed implemented in the future, it will inevitably lead to a crisis of war. This point has become an open secret. To deal with Japan, the cooperation of the United States is required. It is learned that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has encouraged the British side after consulting with the commander of the British defense forces in Tianjin. The London Observer commented on the attitude of the United States, stating that the United States is less isolated in Asia than in Europe, and the country's isolationist sentiment is decreasing daily. (25th Associated Press dispatch)

Calcutta, India: Yesterday, the "Political" newspaper here published a commentary criticizing the British side's attitude of submission to Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. The newspaper said, "Most countries currently believe that the British ministers are a group of teachers without courage, and the Japanese side, due to the British government's overly cowardly attitude, has regarded Britain as a 'shameless' nation." (25th Associated Press dispatch)

(Paris) French Foreign Minister Bonnet solemnly declared at a political meeting yesterday that the interests of Britain and France are intertwined. Regarding the Tianjin incident, Britain has not notified the French government of any specific retaliatory plans, as London is still seeking to ascertain the intentions of the Japanese government. The French government hopes that this matter can be resolved locally, especially in light of the recent attitude of the US government. The mood here is that the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not as optimistic as it was a few days ago. Bonnet reviewed these negotiations at the political meeting. (25th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech at a Conservative Party meeting in Cardiff today, touching on the Far East. His conclusion was: "I must add that the treatment of British expatriates in Tianjin, as we have heard, is not acceptable to the British government, and the British government's foreign policy cannot accept orders dictated by other countries. I hope my observation is not mistaken, that the Japanese government's intention is not such, that it has no intention of condoning the behavior of its soldiers, and that it has no intention of provoking the rights and interests of the British people in China." (24th Havas dispatch)

(London) Morrison, a Labour Party MP and chairman of the London County Council, delivered a speech here today, again vigorously criticizing the policies pursued by Chancellor Simon during his tenure as Foreign Secretary, stating that Sir John Simon bears a major responsibility for the current situation in China and should resign to apologize to the people of the country. Resignation is also necessary for the benefit of the Conservative Party itself. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Four Days and Nights of Bloody Fighting: Japanese Attack on Zhongtiao Mountain Ultimately Unsuccessful; Battles Continue Fiercely Around Yuanqu; Japanese Troops Suffer Heavy Losses Near Gaoluo and Retreat to Hengling Pass

(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch: The Chinese army is implementing its established plans step by step, and its fighting strength is increasing. Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have reinforced and are fiercely attacking Zhongtiao Mountain again. After four days and nights of bloody fighting, they were heavily attacked by the Chinese army, suffering nearly 2,000 casualties. A large number of Chinese reinforcements have arrived at their destinations, and the battle situation will greatly expand. There are no major battles in central Hubei. There are only 400 to 500 Japanese troops remaining in Qianjiang. The Chinese army is besieging them and will resolve the situation soon. (25th special dispatch)

(Luoyang) Japanese troops in Yuanqu shelled the southern bank of the river on the afternoon of the 24th, engaging in fierce artillery battles with the Chinese across the river, seemingly to cover their retreat. The Japanese troops in Wangmao Town (northwest of Yuanqu) and Gaoluo were attacked by Chinese troops from both sides of the Gao-Yuan Highway. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and have retreated entirely to Hengling Pass. Before fleeing, they burned all the houses in Gaoluo. Chinese troops are pursuing them. Furthermore, after Chinese Koukou and another units established contact, they jointly counterattacked the Japanese troops facing them. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated northeast. The Japanese troops south of Zhujiazhen and Shangxiahengyu (southwest of Gaoluo) have been completely cleared, and Chinese troops have regained their original positions. (25th dispatch)

(Luoyang) The battles around Yuanqu are still proceeding fiercely. After the Chinese armies were ordered to attack the Japanese from both sides, and after a senior commander personally oversaw the front lines, morale immediately soared, and the offensive became more sharp. There were reports of victories on all fronts. In total, the Chinese army has killed or wounded over 2,000 Japanese soldiers in the past three days. A portion of the Chinese army has now approached Yuanqu. The Japanese troops, under pressure from the Chinese army, have mostly retreated east. (25th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Today, news was received here from the Chinese army in Shanxi stating that the Chinese army has recently withdrawn from Yuanqu and has retreated into the nearby mountains. (25th Reuters dispatch)

(Xi'an) Military news: On the 19th, 400 Japanese troops with three artillery pieces and over 30 vehicles invaded Dawangyin (over 30 li northeast of Zaoqiang) from Longhua Town, Jing County, Hebei Province, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army throughout the day, ultimately failing to succeed. At dawn on the 20th, the Japanese launched another fierce attack and occupied the eastern end of the village, resulting in a fierce street battle. Chinese regimental commander Zhang Yuting took the lead, bravely charging and killing. After three hours of bloody fighting, he dispatched a battalion to attack the Japanese flank. At 10:00 in the morning, they finally recaptured their original positions, annihilating most of the Japanese troops. The Japanese collapsed and retreated. In this battle, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, over 40 bodies were left behind, and over 40 rifles were seized. (Gan 25th special dispatch)

### Multiple Japanese Aircraft Attack Jiangxi in Batches

Ji'an: Eighteen Japanese aircraft attacked Jiangxi again in batches on the 25th. The first batch of three aircraft invaded Jiangxi from Guangdong. At around 12:00 noon, they sneaked into Ruijin and dropped four bombs. There were no losses on the Chinese side. The second batch of three aircraft also invaded Jiangxi from Guangdong. At 12:50, they entered Jiangxian, reconnoitered, and then fled to Nanchang before returning to Guangdong. They dropped four bombs in Qujiang.

### Rumors That Wang Jingwei Is Negotiating Conditions With the Japanese

(Hong Kong) Tianjin dispatch: According to sources close to the Japanese, Wang Jingwei has proposed conditions to the Japanese, requesting that the puppet Federal Government be established in Nanjing and continue to use the Blue Sky White Sun flag. The Japanese have also proposed two conditions: (1) the puppet Federal Government signs an anti-communist pact with Japan, allowing Japan to station troops in necessary areas in the north and south; (2) an economic agreement is signed with Japan, with China's heavy industrial resources managed and operated by Japan. Both sides have generally agreed. (25th dispatch)

Editorial

### Is Japan Fighting for Economics?

A righteous cause makes one bold; moreover, the distinction between appearance and reality, and right and wrong, cannot be blurred. Whoever initiates the conflict bears the responsibility. China is fighting for survival and to uphold the independence and freedom of the nation; this will surely be recognized by the world and future generations. But what is Japan fighting for?

At the beginning of the war, Japan claimed that China's three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were its lifeline, so it was fighting to secure this lifeline. To regard the rich resources and territories of a neighboring country as one's own lifeline and attempt to seize them by force is undeniably wrong. Midway through the war, Japan claimed that China was becoming communist, and it was fighting to eradicate communism. China, however, was founded on the Three Principles of the People, which even the Communist Party adheres to, demonstrating the falsity of the claim of communism. Furthermore, what does the ideology of a neighboring country have to do with Japan? Japan also claimed that East Asia needed a new order, and it was fighting to establish this new order. But what is this new order? "Those who obey me shall live, and those who resist me shall die," using an iron fist to enslave other races, preventing them from ever rising again. Establishing a new order means establishing a master-servant relationship, with no other meaning. Japan further claimed that it was staking its national destiny on this, and therefore fighting to place China's sovereignty under its control (as stated by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24th). The logic of this wording and definition is no different from saying, "I am taking a desperate risk, so I will kill with a knife." All these claims are fragmented, contradictory, and utterly false. It is no wonder that even after years of war, members of the Japanese Diet still questioned their government: "What is Japan fighting for?"

However, the essence of China's resistance is extremely clear. Therefore, to end China's resistance, it is only necessary to restore China's sovereignty, land, and administrative integrity. Because Japan's cause is without merit, it can only resolve the war through war. In other words, only when it wins to the point where further fighting is unnecessary, or when it loses to the point where further fighting is impossible, will the war end. If one seeks a solution to the war outside of war itself, the world has long abandoned such hopes. However, yesterday a London dispatch reported that Sir George Paish, a British baronet, made a grand statement, the gist of which was:

"Within Japan, there are differing views on the government's current policies. Businessmen and industrialists generally do not support the war against China, believing that peace is the best path for trade. The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. Because countries implement protectionist tariffs, and Japan has a population of 100 million people, increasing by one million each year, with limited domestic resources, it remains a poor country despite having cultivated all available land. Many Japanese businessmen and ordinary people, excluding the military, have told me that they are prepared to resolve the China issue and wish to coexist peacefully with China. However, they do not know how to achieve this goal without losing face. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but to make this possible, the world should plan a future for Japan, allowing it to sell its goods and provide its population with a reasonable standard of living. From a military perspective, Japan's finances are strained and cannot allow the current situation to continue. From this perspective, it is clear that Japan will adopt a rational attitude in the near future."

Sir Paish is a renowned British economist who recently returned to England after traveling to Japan. Yesterday, he delivered the above speech at the invitation of a certain international affairs gathering. The cable transmission was likely less than one-tenth of his full speech, but the essence is probably no more than this. His analysis of cause and effect is insightful, and naturally welcomed by those who pay attention to Japan's wartime internal affairs. Although there are a few points in the above excerpt that do not form a logical cause and effect, this must be due to the brevity of the cable transmission, and not contradictions from the renowned scholar. After hearing this from afar, what we cannot refrain from saying is: Sir Paish calls Japan a poor country and attributes the current situation in the Far East to the current economic policies of various countries, suggesting that the cause of Japan's invasion of China lies here. He also suggests that the world should plan an economic way out for Japan, implying that the method to end Japan's invasion of China lies here. If Sir Paish is correct, then the answer to the question "What is Japan fighting for?" held by both Japanese and non-Japanese people lies in this. However, is it really so?

Sir Paish is a renowned economist; the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Therefore, economists view all phenomena through the lens of economics. However, we do not consider Sir Paish's view to be a prejudice. Tracing the path of human civilization and evolution over thousands of years to the present, international problems in terms of scope, and social problems in terms of depth; entrusting the resolution of problems to religion, general culture, or seeking solutions in science, or even resorting to war; and ultimately attributing everything to economics is something we are willing to frankly acknowledge. Therefore, Sir Paish's statement is fundamentally correct. It is a pity that Japan does not act accordingly. Taking a step back, Japan cannot escape this principle in reality. It is a pity that Japan is not aware of this. In the current era of international competition, regardless of political measures, military plans, and actions, everything is viewed through an economic lens, and politics and military affairs are merely tools. Japan is not like this. It is still blindly obsessed with realizing its military ideals and fulfilling its political ambitions, viewing economics as merely a tool. Therefore, from the early stages of its invasion of China to the present, the various explanations and expressions of its authorities have never hinted that its desires lie in economics. Furthermore, it fundamentally criticizes its military aggression and violates the ironclad rules of economics. We do not have the space to provide a detailed argument in this short article. However, at the very least, the opportunities that China has historically provided to Japan in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to develop its economy and alleviate its poverty, which Japan has never fully utilized, can prove that Japan's consciousness and desires are not in economics. That is, the invasion of China after the September 18th Incident, and the disasters in the Far East over the past few years, are not caused by economics.

The fault lies with Japan in the Far East, and the responsibility lies with Japan. However, Japan's consciousness and desires are not in economics. Therefore, Sir Paish's suggestion of planning for Japan's economy is not enough to prompt Japan to change its course. It can be asserted. Therefore, in today's situation, China has no other option but to resist, and friendly nations must also recognize that, in addition to resolving the war through war, there is no need to harbor any other hope. If one hopes to resolve the situation outside of war, one must wait for Japan to fully awaken and abandon its political ambitions and military ideals! Otherwise, giving it an economic lifeline will only strengthen its political ambition and military expansion.

### Soviet "Izvestia" Publishes Article on the Failure of Japan's Invasion Plan in China

(Moscow) Izvestia recently published an article entitled "The Crushing of the Japanese Imperialist Strategic Plan for the Invasion of China," analyzing the development of the war situation since the Japanese army's provocation at Lugouqiao, stating, "Japanese imperialism, in preparing for the invasion, did not originally want to fall into a protracted war in China. Because of its limited domestic economic resources, Japanese fascism tried to achieve a quick victory in order to preserve its strength and prepare for further aggression. Therefore, all of the Japanese warlords' operational intentions were to decisively annihilate the Chinese army and force the Chinese government to surrender.

"However, the loss of territory has not caused the Chinese government and people to surrender. On the contrary, the deeper the invaders penetrate, the higher the Chinese people's will to fight against the enemy. During the two years of resistance, the highest Chinese military authorities have completed the strategic policy of protracted war. The basis of the Chinese operational plan is the unstable economic position and domestic and international situation of Japanese imperialism, which makes it impossible for it to sustain a protracted war. Therefore, the Chinese army must find ways to prolong the war, temporarily sacrifice part of the territory to preserve its strength, gradually and decisively exhaust the Japanese people's blood, and finally deliver a fatal blow." Izvestia continued to discuss the further development of the war, with special emphasis on the Chinese army's counteroffensive in April, saying, "The Chinese army's counteroffensive in April 1939 was an extremely important event. This activity, spread across a vast front, was not intended to deliver a decisive blow to the enemy. The Chinese people and army are working hard to prepare for such a blow, but its implementation is still to be awaited in the near future. "The main purpose of the April counteroffensive was to solve two major problems: first, to attract the Japanese army's forces in the guerrilla areas; second, to contain the Japanese army's actions with simultaneous counteroffensives on all fronts, preventing them from concentrating.

"These two tasks have been gloriously completed. The Chinese army has recovered many cities and towns. The Japanese army's casualties during this period are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. From this point of view, the April counteroffensive is actually equal to the summary of the achievements of the two years of resistance. During this period, the Chinese army has increased new strength, expanded its forces, and improved its combat and moral qualities through fierce battles.

"The basis of the Chinese army's resistance is its strong rear and the unity of the people. At present, more than a million heroic guerrillas, including the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, are working hard to harass the invading army's rear, fighting side by side with the regular army everywhere.

Izvestia finally summarized the achievements of China's two years of resistance, saying, "The fact that Japanese imperialism has had to fight in China for two years and still cannot achieve the expected victory in itself proves that the Japanese warlords' strategic plan for a quick victory has completely failed. Although the Japanese fascist military clique has successively increased its troops in China, from 325,000 to five or six times that number, although it has reorganized its national economy on a wartime basis, and although it has spent more than 100 billion yen in war expenses, thereby almost exhausting its gold reserves and military material reserves, the result is still that it has not achieved its goals.

"The Chinese people are still continuing their resistance and are working hard to prepare to defeat the invaders in the Far East in one fell swoop, making them unable to recover." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

### Japanese Occupation of Dinghai Intended to Alleviate Anti-War Sentiment

A certain place in eastern Jiangxi. Dinghai fell on the 23rd. Our reporter today visited a certain military expert to inquire about his opinion on the Japanese occupation of Dinghai. According to him, since the Japanese occupied Wuhan and Nanchang, they have been militarily lost, in a dilemma, and do not know what to do. The recent disastrous defeats of the Japanese in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan, as well as in western Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, are all enough to clarify that the Japanese have reached the end of their rope. The Japanese warlords are deeply afraid that this will cause domestic turmoil, so they have launched the Xiamen incident at the risk of great injustice, blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, and recently occupied Shantou. The purpose is to threaten Britain, the United States, and France, and to stimulate the people and alleviate anti-war sentiment. The Japanese occupation of Dinghai is no different in meaning. As for its military value, it is extremely insignificant. (Dispatch of the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, intense fighting is taking place in Dinghai, the largest city and town on Zhoushan Island. The Japanese army landed on the island opposite Ningbo on June 23 under the cover of naval and air bombardment. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### Chongqing Newspapers Express Gratification After the Announcement of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty; Progress is Also Evident in Sino-Soviet Transportation

(Chongqing) The Chinese government officially announced today that the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty was signed in Moscow on June 16th. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, signed on behalf of the Chinese government as a special envoy of the Chinese government, while Mikoyan, Director of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau, signed on behalf of the Soviet government. An official statement issued today stated that the treaty is based on the principles of equality and reciprocity. It is reported that in addition to commercial and navigation clauses, the treaty also stipulates the legal status of the Chinese Soviet Trade Commissioner's Office. The full text of the treaty has not yet been published. This is the official preliminary expression. Sun Ke is currently in Moscow. It is now reported that Mr. Sun and Soviet Ambassador Orelsky departed from Chongqing on the same plane, flying from Chongqing to Urumqi for the inaugural flight of the Sino-Soviet airline. It is that plane. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an editorial today welcoming the announcement of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty, saying that this treaty and the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact signed in August 1937 are the two most important things in Sino-Soviet history. The relationship between the two countries must be found on a solid economic basis, and the new treaty will place Sino-Soviet relations on a normal and permanent footing. The newspaper also expressed gratitude for the Soviet Union's sympathy and assistance to China's resistance. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

(Moscow) Soviet newspapers today did not list the contents of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and China on the 16th of this month, but TASS officially released the above news last night. It is reported that Chinese representative Sun Ke has been in Moscow for three months, and Stalin personally received him, but Soviet newspapers have always kept silent about this matter, which is particularly noteworthy. It is also the day when the Soviet Union and China signed the commercial treaty when British special envoy Strang arrived in Moscow, but the news was not revealed until after the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France had stalled. In the future, the amount of Soviet military supplies transported to China will increase. Furthermore, transportation from Soviet-controlled Central Asia to Xinjiang and western China has made significant progress compared to before. Transportation by large trucks is now unhindered.

### Multiple Bombings in London Overnight; Irish Government Orders Dissolution of IRA

(London) Three explosions occurred in central London tonight. In the explosion that occurred at Piccadilly Circus at around 9:00 PM, at least three people were injured, one of whom has been sent to the hospital for treatment. The second occurred an hour later in Piccadilly. In the blink of an eye, a third incident occurred in the Aldwych area, resulting in six injuries, four of whom have been taken to the hospital by ambulance. The police have apprehended three people for questioning. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(London) The Irish Republican Army launched another terrorist act last night, causing four bombs to explode in London. The city's police officers made every effort to prepare beforehand, so many of the bombers were arrested on the spot. It is reported that the first bomb exploded in front of the "Piccadilly" circus gate. At that time, it was just after the show, so the spectators going out were extremely crowded, resulting in a young newspaper seller being injured and falling to the ground at the entrance of the underground train, and three passersby being injured by fragments of glass windows. In addition, another person was injured in the abdomen by glass, bleeding heavily, and was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment by ambulance. The police closely followed the terrorists and chased after them, finally capturing one of them in the crowd. Afterwards, another bomb exploded in front of the Lloyd's Bank on Wellington Street, causing the windows along the street to shatter in response, and glass fragments fell on the heads of pedestrians, resulting in six serious injuries who were sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition, a patrol officer was also injured by glass fragments. The third bomb exploded near the Midland Bank on the street, and three terrorists were arrested on the spot. Afterwards, a Molotov cocktail exploded in a bunker in Marylebone, but fortunately the firefighters were able to put it out, so a major disaster was avoided. Associated Press reporter Sibon witnessed two people being arrested and personally saw a police officer forcibly capturing a bomber who was fleeing. The police officer said to Sibon, "I firmly believe that the arrested person is the terrorist who threw the bomb." According to reports, the Irish authorities banned the IRA's activities on Friday. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

(London) Four banks in London's West End were heavily damaged last night by bombs thrown by the Irish Republican Army. The police have arrested four people. The situation was very tense after the bombs exploded in the West End. The police requisitioned streetcars to direct traffic on the footboards and dispatched the National Guard and mounted police to assist in maintaining order on the road and suppressing the crowded crowds. At that time, one person was chased by an angry crowd, and everyone shouted, "Kill him," but his life was saved by the police's rescue. An unexploded bomb was found in the cloakroom of the Oxford Theater. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### British and French Agree on Principles of Military Cooperation to Prevent War in the Far East, Using the China Sea as the Center of Resistance, and Cooperating to Protect Borneo

(Paris) Regarding the meeting between the British and French army and naval generals stationed in the Far East in Singapore, well-informed sources here recently stated that the principle of close cooperation between the British and French naval, land, and air forces in the Far East has been affirmed by this meeting. In the event of war in the future, the navies of both sides will be under the command of Admiral Noble, commander of the British fleet stationed in China, and the China Sea will be the center of resistance. In addition, the Singapore meeting discussed the following issues: The Japanese army has occupied Hainan Island and the New Southern Islands, which is enough to threaten Vietnam and blockade Hong Kong, but in terms of the situation in Hong Kong, even if it is surrounded by enemy forces in wartime, it can be defended for a long time, waiting for the navy to be sent from Europe to assist, this is one. The Kingdom of Siam has close relations with Britain and France, and will be able to maintain benevolent neutrality in wartime, this is two. Borneo (belonging to Britain and the Netherlands) is an oil-producing area, which will inevitably be coveted by enemy countries in wartime, and will be jointly defended by Britain and France, this is three. In addition, there was a saying that the Netherlands indirectly participated in the Singapore meeting, and the government of that country has recognized it, saying that it is eager to maintain a detached position. As for the United States, although it did not participate in the meeting, if the fleet of that country joins the war in the Far East, the Singapore naval port will be allowed to use it. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Singapore Meeting Closed Yesterday

Singapore. The British-French defense conference held here will close today. The chairman of the conference, Admiral Noble, commander of the British fleet stationed in China, is scheduled to return to China tomorrow. It is reported that at yesterday's meeting, the concentration of various military supplies in the event of war and a full investigation of the manpower and materials that can be used by the British and French forces were discussed at the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### Considering the Issue of Japanese Military Advance to the South

Singapore. The joint meeting of British and French army and naval leaders continued to meet yesterday to consider the issue of the Japanese military's advance to the south and the strategic significance of the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island and the New Southern Islands. Attendees deeply considered the Japanese policy of invading uninhabited islands in the eastern part of Asia as a place for Japanese to reside, because such actions, once Britain and France officially fight against Japan, will pose a threat to Britain and France. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

### Difficulties in Renewing Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty

Osaka. Japanese commercial firms are now watching with deep concern the Indian government's future policies regarding the renewal of the expiring Indo-Japanese commercial treaty. Yamada, the final manager of the Indian Karachi office of the Japan Cotton Association, has been in India for 20 years and recently returned to Japan to discuss this issue, warning Japan that it must proceed with great caution in seeking to renew the treaty, because in view of the current world situation, it is expected that India will take a tough stance. Yamada also stated that this year's Indian cotton crop is low, resulting in a sharp decline in general purchasing power, so it is expected that the Indian government will implement strict restrictions on the import of Japanese goods. The treaty that is about to expire was concluded by Japan and India alone. Now the Indian government will consider the recently concluded Anglo-Indian commercial treaty. Indian capitals know the position Japan is in and cannot take a tough stance or suggest actions to boycott Indian cotton. Therefore, it is expected that the Indian government will not make concessions. In fact, Indian capitals have clearly not taken any action to prepare for the renewal of the treaty. What is difficult is that since India and Japan adopted a barter system, Japanese exporters have flooded the Indian market with large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth of very poor quality. The motive was to hope to obtain the right to import Indian cotton. As a result, this kind of low-quality cotton yarn and cloth is now overstocked in the Indian market. The only solution is for Japanese merchants to focus on exporting high-quality cotton cloth, allowing it to be printed cloth, although according to India's current customs tax rate, the tax levied on Japanese printed cotton cloth is eleven times higher than that of British goods, but according to Yamada's opinion, Japanese goods can still compete with British Lancashire cotton cloth.

### The Dutch East Indies Intensifies Expansion of its Army and Navy, Increasing Troop Strength and Improving Armaments

The authorities in Batavia, observing the turbulent and uneasy situation in Europe and the Far East, are rapidly implementing a large-scale plan to strengthen the defenses of the Dutch East Indies. This plan aims to increase the East Indies army by at least one-quarter. A large number of the latest military equipment, including various cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and the fastest tanks, are arriving on every ship from Europe. Batavia has a senior commander and large garrison stationed around the city. All activities and the entire military organization present a picture of high efficiency, enjoying an unprecedented reputation. The authorities are paying great attention to improving the army's air force. The headquarters of the air force is also located in Batavia. The Glenn Martin bomber squadron is being increased; these bombers are estimated to have a range of 2,000 miles. New equipment is being added, such as Fokker fighter planes and other types of aircraft. The army's air force recently completed its largest public performance in history, celebrating its 25th anniversary. Thousands of spectators gathered around the perimeter of the Batavia airfield, witnessing the large bomber formations taking to the skies, and the flight formations of fighter squadrons. Increasing the East Indies army involves adding troops from the Netherlands, and increasing the strength of the native troops. It is rumored that a large number of soldiers will be recruited locally. To accelerate progress and reduce training costs, a new method has been established, integrating the local militia into the regular army during their mandatory military training. The militia, composed of Europeans residing in the Dutch East Indies, all undergo eight months to one year of mandatory military training. Half of this year's total budget for the Dutch East Indies is now being used to expand the army and navy, which is a fact of great significance. However, opinions differ here on the rumored supply of battleships to the Dutch East Indies navy in the future. Some believe that their maintenance costs will become an excessive burden.

### Japan Pursues Wartime Economy, National Economic Structure Loses Balance as a Result

(Washington) The State Department has released a report stating that Japan is effectively pursuing a wartime economy. The production, import, price, and distribution of various goods within the country are almost entirely managed by the government, resulting in an imbalance in the national economic structure. To maintain currency value, imports are limited to essential goods, and their quantity is also limited to what is needed. Meanwhile, its export industry has declined. (Havas, 24th)

### Latest Military Aircraft Being Built by U.S. Government

(Washington) Among the various new types of aircraft ordered by the United States to strengthen its air force, there is a thoroughly improved design. All performance aspects greatly exceed any military aircraft in the world, and it has a speed of over 400 miles per hour. The name of this aircraft is the Lockheed XPL-38, a twin-engine fighter with six heavy machine guns mounted in the nose. If the initial batch of more than ten aircraft proves satisfactory, the US Army may order over one hundred more. According to US Air Force leader Major General Arnold recently, the performance of this aircraft will exceed that of any military aircraft in the world. (Reuter, 25th)

### Italian and German Armies Preparing for Large-Scale Maneuvers on French Border

(Rome) According to reliable sources last night, the Italian army will conduct large-scale exercises in the Po River Valley (located on the back side of the Alps, which forms the Italian-French border) in August. Authoritative sources deny that the Italian army's autumn maneuvers are a demonstration against the French army's autumn maneuvers. It is rumored that the Italian army will depart from the Venetian province, on the Yugoslav border, and stage a simulated attack against the Italian troops "defending Piedmont." (Associated Press, 25th)

(Paris) It is reported that German troops are conducting large-scale military operations on the French border today, preparing for summer exercises. Germany is working hard to build fortresses at the intersection of the German, French, and Swiss borders. Germany is concentrating heavy troops in Trier and Saarbr√ºcken, which are directly opposite the great military zone of northeastern France (i.e., the Maginot Line). German troops are rebuilding fortresses in the mountains near the Swiss border, intending to make the area one of the strongest defensive zones in Europe. (Associated Press, 25th)

### German-Yugoslav Oil Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Agreement

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Yesterday, reports from Germany claimed that the Yugoslav government had ceded oil and other goods to Germany. Well-informed sources here have since corrected this, stating that although negotiations between the two countries regarding Yugoslavia ceding the right for Germany to explore and develop an oil field of 18,000 square kilometers in northern Yugoslavia have entered the final stage, no agreement has yet been reached. (Havas, 24th)

### Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Expected to Reach Compromise, Three Countries' Interests Completely Aligned

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Observer claims that although the negotiations currently underway in Moscow have been repeatedly delayed, it would be incorrect to say that the hope of a final compromise has diminished. The consistency of the interests of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is indeed a crucial point, and it has not diminished in the slightest. The complete alignment of the three countries' interests will certainly lead to results. The main point of contention at present remains the Baltic states' refusal to accept allied guarantees, while the Soviet Union believes that the feelings of the Baltic states are irrelevant. The purpose of the alliance is to repel German aggression. If Germany invades the Baltic states, it will be tantamount to indirectly invading the Soviet Union. Therefore, regardless of the willingness of the Baltic states, an alliance must be concluded to protect them. This move is not for the benefit of the Baltic states, but for the benefit of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 25th)

### British Economist Discusses Far East Situation: Japan's Financial Difficulties Make Sustained Military Action Unlikely

(London) Prominent ladies and gentlemen from various countries recently held a gathering here to discuss international issues. Sir Basil Blackett, a well-known British economist, had just returned from Japan and attended the meeting to report on the situation in the Far East. He said, in brief, that domestic opinions in Japan on the current policies of the Japanese government are divided, much like the situation in Britain. Business and industrial figures do not support the war against China, and believe that peace is the best path for trade. "The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. Countries are implementing protectionist tariffs. Japan has a population of 100 million, increasing by one million annually. Its domestic resources are extremely limited. Although the entire territory has been reclaimed for farmland, it is still a poor country in reality. Farmers cannot even afford to buy rice. They rely on growing their own vegetables and supplementing with a small amount of fish. Generally, people in the country outside of the business and military circles have told me that they are ready to resolve the China issue and are willing to get along with China in a friendly manner. However, they don't know how to achieve this goal without losing face. Therefore, it is necessary to end the war between China and Japan. However, I have found that there is a very unthinking segment of the Japanese population who believe that Britain is currently encountering great difficulties in Europe, and therefore there is no real force to oppose Japan's actions in China. In fact, we should first resolve the Far East problem, and then the European problem can be easily solved. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but if this is to be achieved, the world should plan a future for Japan, so that it can sell its goods, feed its population, and maintain reasonable health. As for the military aspect, Japan's financial difficulties cannot allow the current situation to continue for long. Even oil alone is extremely scarce and must be restricted in its use. From this perspective, Japan will adopt a reasonable attitude in the short term," he said. (Havas, 24th)

### US Factories Prepare for Wartime Mobilization

(Washington) Colonel White, Chief of Staff of the US Army, declared, "10,000 US factories are now prepared for total wartime mobilization, but it will take 12 months to transform ordinary industries into complex wartime industries." Colonel White also pointed out that industrial mobilization can indeed make national industries cooperate more closely and increase production effectively, so as to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of what is needed in wartime. In addition, the US defense mobilization plan can increase the official army of 400,000 to 1 million within three months. (Associated Press, 24th)

### Chamberlain's Efforts Futile, German Newspaper Criticizes British Prime Minister's Speech

(Berlin) Political figures here are commenting on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Cardiff with ironic tones. The semi-official German News Agency reported, "The collusive actions of the British Foreign Office are trying to cover up and make people believe that they are seeking understanding and consultation with Germany. In fact, their efforts are futile. As of today, Germany has no need to explain to the world where the responsibility lies for the failure of Britain and Germany to reach a compromise. Perhaps Prime Minister Chamberlain speaks of the possibility of cooperation between Britain and Germany because he wants Germany to give some kind of guarantee so that when the Soviet Union demands too high a price from Britain, there will be something to resist." (Havas, 24th)

### Bulgarian King to Visit Italy

### Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Declaration Displeases Italy, Italian Newspaper Urges Bulgaria to Take Back Lost Territories, British Newspaper Says Maginot Line Extended

(Rome) The Italian side is very dissatisfied with the signing of the mutual assistance declaration between France and Turkey. Because Turkey has colluded with various democracies, and it is possible to establish an agreement with Egypt, Turkey may assist Egypt in protecting the Suez Canal in the event of a future war in the Mediterranean. As a result, the warships of the Axis powers cannot pass through the Dardanelles Strait, nor can they enter the Red Sea. Italy is extremely resentful of this and is launching a large-scale diplomatic offensive. One target of the offensive is the Balkan Peninsula, with Bulgaria being the most important. The other target is the Arabian Peninsula, because the Arab peoples are dissatisfied after the British government published a white paper on the Palestine issue. It is easy to take the opportunity to incite them. As far as Bulgaria is concerned, Italy will urge the country to demand the return of lost territories from Romania and Greece. (The Dobruja region of Romania and the Macedonia region of Greece both belonged to Bulgaria before the European War.) Italian newspapers are now filled with propaganda on this issue, saying that Bulgaria will not be able to recover its lost territories unless it follows the Axis powers. As for the Arabian Peninsula, key figures from various Arab countries have been in frequent contact with the Axis authorities. Italy is very optimistic about the future and believes that the difficulties Britain is encountering in the Far East will affect Britain's attitude towards the Arabs in the Near East. (Havas, 24th)

(Rome) Today, newspapers here are publishing angry criticisms of the Franco-Turkish Sanjak cession agreement, denouncing it as a betrayal of countries with mandates and as an act hostile to Italy. The Italian People's Newspaper compares France's actions in ceding territory to Turkey with the French government's repeated refusal of Italy's demands. (Reuter, 24th)

(London) Regarding the Franco-Turkish agreement, London newspapers only make brief comments. For example, the "Daily Express" states that this agreement has extended the Maginot Line to the eastern Mediterranean. However, provincial newspapers discuss it in detail. For example, the "Yorkshire Post" (the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) states, "Local disputes can sometimes be very sharp (referring to the dispute between France and Turkey over the Sanjak region), but they can still promote political connections. The Franco-Turkish agreement is one example. This agreement is of great significance to the relationship between the Suez Canal and the Balkan Peninsula. Now, Great Britain, France, and Turkey have united because of common interests. Britain's expression of happiness over the Franco-Turkish agreement is well-founded." In addition, the "Manchester Guardian" points out, "France and Turkey have now reached an agreement before Great Britain and the Soviet Union. After all, the problem of the Sanjak region is easier to solve than the problem of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. The port of Alexandretta in that area is the best port in the eastern Mediterranean and can become a naval base for Turkey." (Havas, 24th)

After the Franco-Turkish agreement was signed the day before yesterday, the Sanjak region will be incorporated into Turkish territory. The entire region of Sanjak raised the Turkish flag in unison today and is scheduled to hold a formal celebration on July 5, the anniversary of the day Turkish troops entered the region. (Havas, 25th)

(Rome) According to reports from Ankara, the Turkish government wants to increase the military equipment of the port of Alexandretta, making it a strategic military base. (Haitong, 25th)

### American Jewish Zionist Movement

(New York) The American Jewish Zionist movement held a conference here today. It was attended by a thousand representatives from forty-four states, chaired by Goldman, the leader of the Zionist movement committee. They immediately presented the British government's white paper on the Palestine issue for discussion. The chairman first read a telegram from President Roosevelt, which stated that American Jews had participated in the development of Palestine and made great contributions, which were worthy of pride. Although the Zionist movement is encountering various difficulties, the great progress Palestine has made can hardly be eliminated. It is hoped that the discussions at your conference will produce a truly constructive spirit, which is also symbolic of the spirit of various American undertakings. The future development of Palestine truly depends on it. Committee Secretary Margolis then submitted a report to the conference, stating that all resolutions of this meeting will be submitted for discussion at the World Zionist Congress to be held in Geneva in August of this year. (Havas, 14th)

### US Dockworkers Respond to Stimson's Call to Refuse to Ship Scrap Iron to Japan, US Political Circles Study the Issue of Banning Arms Shipments to Japan

The British ship "Whiteington" in Tacoma, Washington, was forced to stop here today because dockworkers refused to cross a picket line formed by the "Committee Against Participating in Japanese Aggression." It is reported that the ship intends to transport a large amount of scrap iron to Japan. The "Committee Against Participating in Japanese Aggression" is an organization chaired by former Secretary of State Stimson. Its main task is to urge Americans not to ship war materials to Japan. (Associated Press, 24th)

(Washington) The issue of whether the United States will ban arms shipments to Japan has been hotly debated in political circles for a long time. Since the recent events in the Far East, opinions have converged. The reasons for the change in American sentiment on this issue can be stated in three points: First, from a moral standpoint, according to recent official statistics, Japan's military purchases from other countries, those from the United States, account for 57 percent. Some people in the public opinion world are quite uneasy, and all ask whether the United States is indirectly responsible for Japan's continued aggression against China. Second, from an economic standpoint, according to reports recently received by the State Department, Japan's recent offensive against foreign concessions in China is aimed at the Chinese legal tender (Fabi), with the intention of preventing Fabi from circulating in the occupied areas. This is in contrast to the United States providing China with a $50 million loan to help maintain the status of Fabi. Naturally, we cannot turn a blind eye to this type of erosion by Japan. Third, it is the view of the State Department. Namely, after Japan's invasion erodes Chinese interests, its goals are expanding more and more. It first attacks the Soviet Union, saying that it should not supply China with arms. Then it accuses France of supplying China through French Indochina. Now it is launching an offensive against British concessions in China. At this moment, although the United States has not been directly harmed by the Tianjin incident, the results of Japan's actions will eventually damage American interests. Although the United States is not in a position to use force to stop this "aggression" against the interests of various countries, it would be the right thing to do to stop supplying Japan with war materials. However, to ban arms shipments to Japan, President Roosevelt must first declare that a state of war exists between China and Japan before a ban can be issued. This action, considering the current neutrality law, would be sufficient to strike at Japan, but the impact on China, which is under attack, would be no less than that on the aggressor. This is the reason why President Roosevelt should not declare an embargo. Under these circumstances, only economic sanctions are still possible. US experts are currently studying it. There is a precedent for this matter. Previously, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the United States imposed an additional tax of 25% on imports from Germany to show its punishment. Now, a similar approach may be adopted for Japan. The increasing anger towards Japan in public opinion is also enough to facilitate government action. Certain isolationists have expressed concern that this move may draw the United States into the whirlpool of war. In fact, Japan's economic and military situation is becoming increasingly difficult. According to a report released today by the Foreign Policy Association, if the country were to participate in a great war, its remaining gold would certainly be exhausted quickly, thus encountering a great crisis that would be far more serious than the current difficult situation. Based on this, the idea that the United States will be drawn into the whirlpool of war is just unfounded worry. (Havas, 24th)

### Dutch-German Trade Agreement Concluded

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency has received a report from the capital of the Netherlands stating that the Netherlands has concluded a trade agreement with Germany. The agreement stipulates that trade between the Netherlands and the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia will be settled in cash. It will take effect on July 1 and has no time limit, but it is stipulated to last until another method is agreed upon at a later date. (Havas, 24th)

### US Senate Discusses Government's Authority to Use Large Sums of Money, Borah and Others Oppose Roosevelt's Proposal

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently sent separate letters to the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, requesting authorization for the government to allocate $3.5 billion, of which $3 billion is intended to be used to carry out various public works projects, and $500 million would be used as credit loans to be provided by the Federal Export-Import Bank to various countries to develop their trade with the United States. At the Senate meeting today, Republican Senator Borah was the first to express his opposition to this request, and said that Congress must not grant the government the power to act expediently. In other words, it should maintain its own power so that it can decide under what conditions credit loans can be granted to foreign countries. Democratic Senator Lucas then spoke, and his views were the same as Borah's. This case was not included on the Senate's agenda, but most senators hold an opposing attitude, which can be seen from the opinions expressed by Borah and Lucas. (Havas, 24th)

### Anglo-Soviet Cooperation: The Stumbling Block in Negotiations

‚Äî Uncle Di

Inconsistent preparations on both sides, differing opinions on the completion of the alliance, and complicated establishment of mutual trust.

London Correspondence

The Anglo-Soviet cooperation negotiations, which have been going on for some time, are still continuing in this manner. Perhaps another "crisis" will have to arrive before a leap forward response can solidify it. Here is a brief account of the current situation.

(1) Three Different Questions

According to an eyewitness, when the recent Soviet reply arrived at the British Foreign Office, the current Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately scratched his head and said to a visitor: "These Russians are really difficult to deal with! What exactly do they want?" This question perfectly represents the confusion of the general British public. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax himself clearly knows the crux of the matter; of course, the enlightened British, led by people like Lloyd George, Churchill, and Eden, are even more aware.

On the other hand, Molotov, who also serves as the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, openly asked in a formal speech: "Do the current British and French authorities really want to resist aggression?" His words naturally represent the opinions of Stalin and the general Soviet public. However, regardless of the subjective attitudes of both sides, countries that are equally friendly to both Britain and the Soviet Union are most concerned about the concrete establishment of this cooperative negotiation. Therefore, in countries such as Poland and Turkey, the common question is: "Where exactly is the crux of the matter?" This similar situation may also apply to China, which currently has friendly relations with both Britain and the Soviet Union, just like Poland and Turkey.

(2) Where is the Stumbling Block?

Judging solely from the proposals, counter-proposals, and expressions of the authorities responsible for the negotiations on both sides, it seems that the differences between the two sides have been largely eliminated. What remains as a problem, as the British government said some time ago, is merely a matter of "method and technology." However, if it were really just a few questions, then they would not prevent the concrete establishment of Anglo-Soviet cooperation (now commonly referred to as the Anglo-French-Soviet Three-Power Alliance). The biggest stumbling block now lies outside the so-called "method and technology" issues.

In summary -

The first current stumbling block is the inconsistency in the preparations of both sides for joint decision-making steps. First of all, the establishment of an Anglo-French-Soviet three-power alliance to resist aggression has been accepted in principle by both sides. But what about the joint decision-making steps after the establishment of this alliance? On the British and French side, the preparation is to immediately use this three-power alliance as a background to begin negotiations with Germany and Italy for a final compromise. The intention, of course, is to make considerable concessions. The Soviet Union, however, believes that it would be acting as a "cat's paw" in the Anglo-French bargaining negotiations with Germany and Italy, which is meaningless and dangerous for itself. Its intention is to re-establish a collective security system on this basis, to protect the territorial sovereignty of all countries, to judge existing aggressions, and to resist future ones. But Britain and France believe that this would "endanger peace" and are unwilling to support it. So, what should be done? Currently, a compromise has not yet been found. Therefore, this constitutes one of the current stumbling blocks.

The second current stumbling block is that the two sides have not yet reached a consensus on what constitutes the completion of the alliance. In the distant past, there was the example of Italy in the European War abandoning Germany and joining the Allied powers to seek its own benefit by betraying its ally; more recently, there was the example of French diplomacy at the Munich Conference last year, even though there was a mutual assistance alliance relationship, France still participated in selling out Czechoslovakia. Now, in this environment of complex international relations, the binding force of a blank paper treaty is completely gone. So, if we want to make the alliance relationship truly binding, what should we do? On this point, the recently publicized German-Italian alliance, as well as the German-Italian alliance with Spain that has not yet been publicized, and even the Anglo-French alliance that has been further strengthened recently, offer three good examples. According to these examples, the alliance relationship can only be concretely established after passing through three steps. The steps are: ‚ë† the establishment of the alliance on the treaty; ‚ë° the negotiations of the general staffs of both sides, followed by the establishment of the general allocation of military strength in which both sides will participate in future operations; ‚ë¢ the final tacit understanding, mixing the operational forces of the two sides, so that after the war begins, victory is shared, and defeat is also shared, and no country is absolutely allowed to compromise with the enemy first to establish partial peace. Only in this way can it be considered a true "alliance." However, in the current Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, although the British side is declaring that once the Soviet Union agrees to and signs the alliance treaty, the negotiations between the general staffs of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will follow, but as it stands, that is only a formality. The most urgent requirement of Britain and France is still only the signing of the first step of the alliance treaty. This is of course not enough to satisfy the Soviet Union's requirements. Its intention is to implement the above three steps, otherwise, it would be better not to have it at all. Therefore, the Soviet Union recently requested Britain and France to give a guarantee first: in case of war, everyone will not negotiate peace individually. So at this time, the so-called "alliance" in the eyes of Britain and France is very different in degree compared with that in the eyes of the Soviet Union. I think that sooner or later a point of mutual agreement will be found, but at present, this has become the second stumbling block.

The third current stumbling block is due to the difficulty in establishing mutual trust. The line followed by the British Chamberlain cabinet for more than a year has created deep-rooted suspicions on the Soviet side. And this time, suddenly turning around and negotiating cooperation with the Soviet Union, the abruptness of this action will inevitably make it difficult to gain the trust of Soviet Russia in the short term. Although Maisky, the current British ambassador, was summoned back to his country to report on the pro-Soviet attitude of the general British public, and especially the unanimous urging of the government to be pro-Soviet by members of the opposition in Parliament, however, judging from the situation after Maisky's return to office, the Soviet Union's trust in the Chamberlain cabinet is still unimproved. Last week, Foreign Secretary Halifax suggested to Prime Minister Chamberlain that Eden be sent to the Soviet Union to negotiate directly with Stalin and Molotov. This suggestion is still under consideration, and whether it can be realized in the future is of course questionable, and even if it is realized, whether it can take effect is an even bigger question. Also, from the Soviet Russian side, Litvinov, who previously advocated the old collective security system, using the League of Nations as a tool to sanction Germany most forcefully, is no longer on the stage. Molotov, who was replaced, is merely holding a concurrent post, while Stalin himself, in his inclination, undoubtedly attaches importance to the Far East and despises the European situation. The current British government has been circling in two contradictory concerns regarding Soviet Russia all these days; if a complete military alliance is established, they are worried that the Soviet Union will immediately give extra weight to the Far East and no longer share the burden for Europe, otherwise, they are afraid that Stalin will come to a tacit understanding with Hitler, one focusing on the Far East, and the other extorting in Europe. However, this is only a psychological obstacle. If the aforementioned first and second points are resolved, this will not constitute any stumbling block. However, in order to explain the true situation of the current negotiation difficulties, I have also listed it here as the third stumbling block.

The fourth stumbling block is the so-called "guarantee of the independence of the Baltic Sea coastal countries." If Britain and the Soviet Union can reach a consensus on the first and second points, then this point will not be a problem at all. However, at this time, the Soviet Union's proposal of this point is actually giving Britain and France a big problem: the intention is naturally to test whether Britain and France can completely agree with the Soviet Union's point of view on the first and second points. We must remember that the lessons of the past year or so have made some small and weak European countries thoroughly realize two things; one, Britain and France will not care about their interests, and if necessary, they will even give them to Germany and Italy as sacrifices to alleviate the crisis between themselves and Germany and Italy; two, the Soviet Union will not fight alone for them without the participation of Britain and France, at most providing material assistance; and they themselves are not countries that can only rely on assistance to confront Germany and Italy. So, the inevitable conclusion is: if Germany and Italy can automatically not invade them, that would be the most ideal situation; they call this state "absolute neutrality." Now, Hitler has already taken the lead over Britain and France and automatically signed "non-aggression pacts" with them. This not only eliminates their concerns about the invasion of their territorial sovereignty, but also implies to the Soviet Union; the possibility of conflicts between Germany and the Soviet Union on the Soviet Union's western border has now been completely removed. At this time, if Britain and France were to guarantee their security, they would undoubtedly be severely rejected. If they want them to accept the guarantee, there is only one way, and that is to first establish a complete alliance relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has cleverly regarded it as a major premise for the alliance under the method proposed by Britain and France, which is really a troublesome thing for the British and French authorities.

In the end, everything else is a relatively minor difficulty. The most important thing is still the above-mentioned first and second points. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can reach a consensus on these two points, then an alliance relationship can be realized immediately. The realization of this alliance will not only bring peace and prosperity to the contracting countries, but it will also bring light and progress to all mankind. (June 9th)

### Japanese Warships Kill Fishermen: Hong Kong's Blood Debt: More Than 10,000 Fishermen Killed; Property Loss Exceeds 20 Million

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the Japanese Navy has illegally blockaded the Chinese coastline, causing unprecedented hardship for fishermen along the coast. Since September of the year before last, any fishing boats from Hong Kong engaged in fishing have been intercepted by Japanese warships. The lives of fishermen are not protected, fishing boats are burned, and property on board is looted. These incidents occur almost daily. Initially, some fishing boats accepted the advice of the government authorities and temporarily stopped going to sea during the war. However, as time went on, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of fishermen became a problem. They could not sit idly by and wait for death. Therefore, before long, the fishermen in Hong Kong risked going to sea to work again, disregarding life and death. If they encountered Japanese warships, they tried to escape. If they were captured, they resisted with all their might, and finally sacrificed heroically, creating an unprecedented record of fisherman casualties.

Casualty Statistics

After each incident of Hong Kong fishermen encountering disaster at sea, the survivors reported to the Hong Kong Fishermen's Association. In the past year or so, the association has collected reports from various sources and submitted the fishermen's disasters to the motherland government authorities. According to the latest statistical report released by the association, from September of the year before last to the end of December of last year, a total of 628 Hong Kong fishing boats were burned by Japanese warships in Hong Kong's overseas waters, and 10,092 fishermen were killed. From January to the end of May of this year, within five months, 16 fishing boats were burned and 34 were missing. On average, another 1,205 fishermen were killed. From September of the year before last to the end of May of this year, a total of 644 fishing boats were burned and 11,342 fishermen were killed in 21 months. The above numbers are only based on reports from fishermen and statistical analysis. Others who did not report to the association have not been included. It is estimated that more than 1,000 Hong Kong fishing boats have been burned or missing in the past 21 months, with a total monetary loss of 20 million yuan for the fishermen's boats.

Destruction Process

According to fishermen's reports, the destruction of fishermen by Japanese warships outside Hong Kong can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage was intimidation: whenever fishing boats were working overseas, they were burned. The second stage was to implement a appeasement policy towards fishermen, enticing them with profits, and using bewitchment. The most recent is the third stage, which is to implement a policy of robbery. Therefore, in the past five months, there have been many missing Hong Kong fishing boats. The missing people and boats have been abducted. Only those who escaped returned to report. In addition to robbing property, the children of fishermen are the object of these people. It is found that each fishing boat has an average of six or seven children, most of whom are abducted. It is said that they are given a enslavement education to supplement the strong men in their country.

Induced to Attach to Japan

What is even more heartbreaking is that ignorant fishermen have been induced to attach to Japan. Near Sanmen Customs, some fishermen have been bought by the Japanese side. According to fishermen returning to Hong Kong from Sanmen Customs, some fishermen there have been induced by the Japanese side and have become traitors, forming a group to transport grain for the Japanese side, and are protected by Japanese warships to fish along the coast. If Hong Kong fishing boats sail to that area, they will be burned by Japanese warships. In the past, many fishing boats seized by Japanese warships in various places in Hong Kong waters were also docked there. After receiving the report, the Fishermen's Association, in order to prevent ignorant fishermen from being attracted by the Japanese side, actively advised the fishermen to pay close attention when going out to fish, and not to approach the Sanmen Customs area to avoid misfortune. Most fishermen also realized that fishing in that area was too dangerous and did not dare to go there, and instead fished in Lufeng, Jiazi, Jieshi, Pinghai, and Aotou to avoid robbery.

Planning for Aftermath

The reason why fishermen attach to the Japanese side is due to the difficulty of life, which leads to being tempted by profits. The domestic military and political authorities, in view of this, are carrying out improvements to the lives of fishermen. Recently, the Command Headquarters of the „ÄÄth War Zone, in order to investigate the living conditions of residents along the coast of Guangdong and carry out improvements, specially organized the Guangdong Donghai District Fishery and Salt Inspection Group and sent it to various places along the coast for inspection. The group arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and transferred to Baoan. During its stay in Hong Kong, it investigated everything with the Hong Kong Fishermen's Association. The association provided a lot of reference materials on the living conditions of fishermen and reported in detail the various situations in which illegal public officials extorted money from fishermen, requesting the authorities to thoroughly improve the situation in order to solve the difficulties in the lives of fishermen. The Fishermen's Association also prepared a written report to the authorities, so that they could find ways to improve the situation.

### Fierce Battle of Japanese Army Invading Shantou: Sixty to Seventy Japanese Warships Encircle Shantou City; Japanese Army Attacks in Three Routes and is Repelled; As of the Night of the 21st, Street Fighting is Ongoing

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army's invasion of Shantou has already begun. Earlier, at about 6:00 p.m. on the 20th, the Japanese army moved seven gunboats outside Shantou Port towards the Ma Yu estuary along the coast, covering electric-powered speedboats and attacking in three routes. By 10:00 p.m., Japanese warships from Taiwan, Xiamen, Qiongya, and Guangzhou had gathered outside Shantou Port, as many as sixty or seventy ships. In addition to the large ships, there were also hundreds of speedboats and rubber boats. The naval landing forces and the newly trained field soldiers and swamp soldiers from Taiwan, numbering twenty to thirty thousand, first invaded the North and South ports of Chenghai, which are the outlets of the Han River tributaries. Fierce fighting broke out at about 7:00 p.m. The Chinese army and civilians fought bravely to protect the residents of Waisha and retreat to Zhanglin, Donglong, and Lotus Mountain. By 10:00 p.m., the Japanese army had occupied Caogou Binhai as a foothold. The Chinese army arrived from a certain place and used hand grenades and broadswords to kill all the Japanese soldiers who had landed. Near the Shantou Airport, the Japanese army landed again, and the two sides were entangled until the morning of the 21st. More than two or three hundred corpses were lying on the beach, indistinguishable as Chinese or Japanese, fighting to the death in a pile. Coastal refugees belonging to Chenghai used small boats to cross to nearby Mayu and Aotou, but that area had been rushed into by Japanese speedboats, and some Japanese soldiers had landed and were engaging in battle with the Chinese army in Aotou, Gezhou, and Donghu. The artillery fire was very fierce. The refugees leaned towards the shore, abandoned their boats, climbed mountains, and fled to Jiaoshi to hide. Also, Aotou is twelve miles away from Jiaoshi. The war started at about 7:00 p.m. on the 20th. By 10:00 p.m., the artillery fire had slightly stopped. The Japanese soldiers who landed were repelled three times. This is the middle route of the Japanese army's invasion, mostly Taiwanese troops, carrying new-style automatic rifles, which are very light. At the same time, the Japanese army rushed ashore in hundreds in the areas of Dahao, Haimen, and Hetoutou. The fortifications relied upon by the Chinese army were all destroyed by artillery fire, and they were forced to retreat to Magao and Shalun. The Japanese army gained this foothold and gathered bamboo rafts and sailboats in Haimen Bay to transport heavy weapons ashore, trying to directly approach Chaoyang. Fortunately, the Chinese army had dismantled the highway early and buried more than a hundred landmines. That night, the two armies were in a stalemate in the Haimen area, which was also extremely fierce. The Japanese army used a column of ten armored vehicles as the vanguard. The lights on the vehicles shone on the rugged and uneven silt, and the movement was extremely slow. More than a dozen tanks were detonated by landmines and overturned outside Magao Township. As of 6:00 a.m. on the 21st, the Japanese army on that line had made no progress. However, more than a dozen Japanese speedboats had broken through the Mayu blockade line, firing artillery towards the Jiaoshi coast on one side and sending minesweepers to the entrance to clear obstacles and mines. Several Japanese speedboats carrying soldiers landed in Jinsha Township to attack the Shantou Airport. The airport has been converted into farmland. The two armies then engaged in a bloody battle in the rugged land. Most of the Japanese soldiers who landed were wiped out by the Chinese army. Just as the Chinese army was winning, 15 Japanese planes flew into Shantou City and dropped bombs. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on the 21st, Shantou City had turned into street fighting. The Japanese warships cleared the blockade line obstacles, and 20 entered the port, cutting off the traffic between Shantou and Jiaoshi. Outside Mayu estuary, there were several Japanese giant ships blocking the import and export of various ports. The Japanese Navy, commanded by Kondo Akira, invaded the Chenghai, Shantou, and Chaoyang lines. The main force of the Japanese army was the one that advanced along Chenghai, Donglong, and Zhanglin, and the two routes to Chaoyang and Shantou were auxiliary attacks. Shantou City was bombarded by Japanese warships and bombed by planes in turn. The Chinese army and police never retreated. The great war continued until the afternoon of the 21st, and street fighting was still going on. The entire machinery of the electric light factory, the water tower, the current conversion machine room, and other important buildings were all detonated by landmines. The fire and smoke soared into the sky. On the evening of the 21st, the Chinese army and police in the city, seeing that the people had retreated, retreated while covering and fighting. At night, they retreated along the embankment road to Anbu, or to the Sangpu Mountain in Yuepu Pengzhou to plan a guerrilla war. After the Chinese army withdrew from Shantou City, there were still landmines that had not been detonated. The Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese army and civilians were determined to defend to the death, dared not move forward lightly. The Japanese army that invaded from Dahao and Aotou was in a stalemate with the Chinese army and police in Bogongling Tianren Village, and was only separated from Shalun by a Lian River. This battle of the Chinese army was to fight more with less everywhere. They knew that a battle with their backs to the water could not last long, but all the defenders were determined not to retreat a step, so they could support it for a day and night. The Japanese side also thought it was magical.

At present, the Han River water is rising sharply, and the downstream embankments have already become dangerous. The larger Japanese army groups dare not attack Chaoan along the railway, but focus on Chenghai Donglong to bypass and attack Chaoan. A floating combat team composed of speedboats traveled upstream along the Xiangzi Bridge. At this time, the river water was turbulent. The speedboats drove in from Caogou, but they were unable to steer and were sunk by the defending army on the shore for more than ten boats. Although the North and South ports were occupied, the Chinese army also rushed to the scene. There was a bloody battle all day on the 21st. The Japanese tanks, cavalry, etc., in the fields surrounded by floods, were all equal to waste. As of 10:00 p.m. on the „ÄÄth, the Chinese police force was still firmly defending Shantou City. The Japanese army that rushed from the airport and the rugged terrain were led by Taiwanese people. Once they entered Zhongshan Road, Waima Road, and Tongji Road, they were immediately attacked by the Chinese army. Jiaoshi was occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese army stationed in Dahao, numbering 700, could not cross to invade Shantou. The Japanese warships in the port requested foreign nationals and foreign ships to evacuate within a time limit, claiming that they would bomb Shantou City to the ground. Therefore, the great war of Shantou is about to begin.

### Under the Active Guerrillas, the Japanese Troops Occupying Shandong are Exhausted, Qingdao's Destroyed Factories are Unable to Recover, and Japanese Bayonets Still Cannot Control the Rural Areas. The Guerrillas are Very Courageous and Have Penetrated Deep into the Provincial Capital.

The Continental Daily reports that in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, when the Chinese army withdrew from Shandong Province, they left behind as little as possible for the Japanese to seize. The industrial factories in Qingdao were systematically destroyed, railways were dismantled, and bridges were blown up. However, the Chinese army left behind guerrillas who have been fighting the Japanese in Shandong for over a year. The Chinese policy is to impose a heavy economic burden on the Japanese and to hinder the Japanese reconstruction efforts with guerrilla warfare. The following can be said to be:

Chinese Policy

Successful: (1) The Japanese army has to maintain a huge and costly military defense throughout the province. (2) The guerrillas constantly lure the Japanese army into "mopping-up" operations, consuming even more resources. (3) The Japanese forces are limited to areas marked by bayonets, and the economic resources of the interior are cut off, inaccessible to the Japanese. The Japanese army in North China recently invited foreign visitors to inspect Shandong Province, hoping to show them another side of the situation. What the Japanese wanted the visitors to see was the failure of the Chinese guerrilla strategy, the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation, the political stability under the current Shandong "Provincial Government", and the economic reconstruction in the year or so since the Japanese occupation. However, the visitors had no opportunity to talk to anyone other than Japanese officials and generals. The following can be said to be the successes of the Japanese activities in Shandong: (1) The Chinese factories in Qingdao and Jinan have been taken over by the Japanese, rebuilt after being destroyed, and put into operation using raw materials obtained in Shandong. (2) The Qingdao Customs is in Japanese hands, and the profits from the factories operated by the Japanese help support the Japanese army in Shandong. This naturally helps prevent the depletion of Japan's economic resources. (3) Despite the active guerrillas, the railways have been rebuilt and are open to traffic. (4) Although the "Provincial Government" does not control the entire Shandong Province and does not have the loyalty of the vast majority of the people, it has become somewhat active. (5) The Chinese guerrillas have no possibility of driving out the Japanese army or the "Provincial Government" under Japanese protection in the short term. However, the guerrillas have made it clear that building a "New Order" is a costly project, and they have greatly troubled the Japanese. Qingdao has been opened up, and foreign ships are allowed to enter. The city is still peaceful and lively. As far as foreigners are concerned, their lives are still comfortable, much like the Germans'. However, trade restrictions are another matter. January 1938.

Occupation of Qingdao

The Japanese Marine Corps, which occupied Qingdao, has its headquarters in the city, and there are Japanese army and special forces stationed there. The Japanese Asia Development Board also has a general office there. Of Qingdao's 160,000 population, the Japanese account for 23,000, and the number increases by 500 or 600 each month, as ships sailing from Japan to Qingdao are full of Japanese. The Japanese industries in Qingdao were destroyed, amounting to 40 million Japanese yen. Although some are being rebuilt, progress is slow due to the lack of capital in Japan. Although the Japanese have occupied Qingdao for more than a year, the Kanegafuchi Spinning Factory, which lost 23 million Japanese yen, has not yet started operation. The Japanese are still planning to restore part of the factory first, but the textile machinery shipped from Japan to Qingdao is old and unusable. One flour mill taken over by the Japanese has been opened, but it cannot obtain wheat from the Yangtze River basin, and wheat produced in Shandong and other North China provinces is also unavailable. According to the Japanese manager of the factory, this is because "there are not enough vehicles on the railways". However, this explanation is not true. It is not that there are not enough vehicles, but that the Japanese bayonets have still

Failed to Control

the rural areas, and Chinese farmers have not yet expressed their willingness to help Japan establish a "New Order" in East Asia with their agricultural products. In order to facilitate the transportation of local products, the Japanese Navy has relaxed its blockade of the Shandong coast and allowed sailboats to travel in the rivers. However, a shipping association has been organized to inspect ships to prevent the smuggling of goods to supply the guerrillas. The 1,000 White Russians in Qingdao have been organized by the Japanese army into an anti-communist federation and used for "spontaneous" demonstrations. The situation outside Qingdao is completely different. The railway lines are heavily guarded. The Japanese claim that the Shandong guerrillas are mostly in Laoshan east of Qingdao and the mountains southeast of Jinan. However, of Shandong's 107 counties, the "Provincial Government" has only appointed 76 county magistrates, and more than one-third of them have not taken office due to "poor health", even though they are receiving their monthly salaries. This shows that Chinese troops are also active in other areas. In May, Japanese planes constantly bombed the Chinese guerrillas near Yantai. Although the news of the clashes in Shandong is not as frequent as in other parts of North China, observers believe that this is because the Japanese army is disturbing a less active "hornet's nest" in the area.

The Jiaoji Railway

is one of the important arteries for transporting local resources to Qingdao. The number of guerrilla attacks on the railway has been greatly reduced this year. Chinese sources say that this is because the guerrillas are taking into consideration the interests of the masses. When a railway line is demolished in a certain area, the Japanese army retaliates against the villagers in that area. The guerrillas understand that this is not in the interests of the farmers, so they have relaxed their activities to destroy the railway. However, these attacks have not completely stopped, as indicated by the heavy Japanese guard on the railway. The section of the line between Fangzi and Zhangdian, about 80 miles long, has guards every few hundred feet. These Japanese guards are stationed in machine gun outposts near the railway, surrounded by barbed wire. At certain intervals, there are simple trenches, with one or two soldiers stationed in them. In some places, new underground bunkers, trenches, and huts are being built. The trees along the railway have been cut down to make it difficult for attackers to find shelter. Armored vehicles, sometimes driven by motors, run in front of the train to prevent the rails from being damaged. In a narrow strip of land five to ten miles wide along the line, the Japanese army has organized 5,000 villagers to help them build a "New Order". The villagers' task is to protect the railway from guerrilla attacks and to warn the Japanese garrison where there are "bandits". Japanese officers expect that the attacks on the railway in Shandong will end this year, but they admit that guerrilla activity will only end when the Chinese resistance ends. According to a Japanese lieutenant general, the Shandong guerrillas have rifles, machine guns, and some field guns, but lack ammunition. The lieutenant general also admitted that the guerrillas are very courageous individually. Their numbers were 90,000 half a year ago, and now they are 20,000. These figures given by the Japanese officer are inevitably somewhat optimistic. According to Chinese and foreign observers, the current number of guerrillas is about the same as it was half a year ago. In terms of guerrilla activity,

the area around Jinan

is one of the most troublesome places for the Japanese army. In the mountains southeast of Jinan, there is a troop led by Admiral Chen, which often launches attacks on the Japanese garrison from its base. On the night of May 16, 600 Chinese troops attacked the Japanese garrison in southeastern Shandong with mortars and machine guns. The Japanese garrison in Jinan had to rush troops to rescue the attacked Japanese garrison. According to the Japanese, the Chinese attack resulted in the Japanese army sending four teams to "mop up" two guerrilla bases. In fact, the guerrillas only moved their headquarters. This is a common policy of the guerrillas. The Japanese army in Jinan is heavily defended. Chinese entering the train station are subject to strict searches. No one is allowed to enter or leave after 10 p.m. However, guerrillas still often

sneak into the city

to buy and sell, and sometimes engage in anti-Japanese activities. Several officials of the "Provincial Government" have been assassinated in this provincial capital controlled by the Japanese. Japanese trucks often speed through the streets and alleys. The Japanese investment in Jinan is not as large as in Qingdao, and most of the establishments are taverns and geisha houses. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese army in Shandong began to attack the coast, the Hua army and guerrillas of the 113th and 114th divisions between Longhai Road, Jinpu Road, and Jiaoji Road totaling more than 100,000 people. The Japanese authorities in Beiping said that their purpose was to disperse these "anti-Japanese elements" and gain control of the cotton and peanut producing areas. At the same time, other Chinese troops are attacking south of Yantai in an attempt to "mop up" what the Japanese call the "New Order". All of the above is a general picture of the current situation in Shandong.

### The Commander of the Puppet Imperial Collaboration Army Corps, Ge Chongshou, Captured.

Has been escorted to a certain place by the Magistrate of Funing County. According to his confession, the inside story of the puppet army organization.

Funing Correspondence: Zhang Yihui, a puppet soldier in Funing, recently revolted and cooperated with the regular army of the Chinese county to destroy the nest of the Japanese and puppet troops at Shangjiuhe. In addition to obtaining guns and spoils of war, he also captured Ge Chongshou, the commander of the puppet imperial collaboration army column, on the spot. Magistrate Xiong sent someone to escort him to a certain place on the 16th. According to Ge Chongshou, he is 46 years old, from Changping, Hebei. He worked in the military in his early years and served as an intelligence officer in Song Zheyuan's army. Last year, he was detained in Beiping Prison for a case. He was taken out by the Japanese army, appointed as the commander of the column, and given more than 100 bandit soldiers to command. The Japanese army often sent people to monitor his regimental headquarters. They usually did not provide rations and ordered him to rob the people to support himself. Most of the guns were also extorted from the people. He was captured by Zhang Yihui (the captain of his unit). According to reports, Ge Chongshou is a black man with a pockmarked face. His clothes are also very tattered and he looks very embarrassed.

### Various Industries are Striving to Promote the System of Drawing and Remitting Notes. Financial Industry Requests Chinese and Foreign Banks to Accept it. The Discount on Remittance Drawings will be Strictly Prohibited.

After the Ministry of Finance sent telegrams to Shanghai, the silver and money industries have complied with the regulations, and the financial market has stabilized. The tide of withdrawals has also subsided. Various industries are discussing the promotion of the remittance system, which must be jointly accepted by Chinese and foreign banks. In order to eliminate speculation, the discount on remittance drawings must be prohibited. The details are as follows:

Market is Calm

Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram stipulated the new method of withdrawal in Shanghai, in the first one or two days of implementation, due to the fact that all sectors of society did not fully understand the truth, it caused considerable fluctuations. However, this fluctuation has subsided. Because in addition to those engaged in speculative business, ordinary citizens can withdraw 2,000 yuan per month, and do not feel any inconvenience. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, in addition to the payment of wages, separate applications are not restricted. The system of drawing notes has been quite effective since its implementation.

Remittance System

The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from various industries yesterday that they have been discussing in recent days how to promote the system of drawing and remitting notes to replace legal tender, and considerable results have been obtained. Because the Ningbo people occupy a considerable force in Shanghai's commerce, and the Ningbo market also adopts the remittance system (the so-called transfer of accounts in foreign currency) without paying legal tender, it does not hinder the development of commerce. However, this remittance note must be jointly accepted by Chinese and foreign banks in order to circulate. This matter is under consideration by Zheng Jun in the financial industry, and there will be considerable resolution in the near future.

Withdrawals Subside

In the banking sector, in the week before the promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's regulations, deposits were withdrawn due to speculative influences. After the promulgation and implementation of the Ministry of Finance's regulations, the situation changed drastically. It is reported that the ratio of income to withdrawals of major banks on the 22nd was about 1:9, which changed to 2:8 on the 23rd, and to 3:7 on the morning of the 24th. Because people's hearts have calmed down, those who withdrew earlier are now depositing again. It is expected that the situation will be even better after today, because all sectors of society have a deep understanding of the government's painstaking efforts to prevent the outflow of funds.

Prohibiting Discounts

Since the implementation of the remittance system, with Shanghai's large population, the daily necessities all need to be paid in legal tender, the supply of remittance drawings is greater than the demand, and the demand for drawing heads is greater than the supply. Thus, speculative discounts on remittance drawings have been created. Fortunately, with the maintenance of the Banking Preparation Committee entrusted by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and the maximum supply to the industry, the situation has been turned from danger to safety. Now, in addition to striving to promote the system of drawing and remitting notes, if the discount on remittance drawings exists, it is not in line with the wartime financial policy set by the Ministry. In order to eliminate speculative manipulation, the discount on remittance drawings must be prohibited.

Considering Methods

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various financial institutions requesting the prohibition of discounts on remittance notes. At the same time, the Silver and Money Industry Associations, in view of this and for the sake of stabilizing finance, have notified member banks and firms to strictly restrict the payment of remittance notes, so that finance can maintain a normal state. The Ministry of Finance has also sent a telegram instructing strict prohibition, but in fact, the practice of remittance discounts still exists. Those who engage in this speculative discount are general small money exchange shops, while formal banks and remittance money shops do not engage in this discount business. Now the financial industry is considering the prohibition of discounts.

### The Fall of Dinghai City, Regiment Police Guarding Qingling, County Government Authorities Had Arrangements in Advance, Various Places in Eastern Zhejiang Have Been Repeatedly Bombed.

Since the Japanese army forcibly landed on the Zhoushan Islands in eastern Zhejiang, the local self-defense corps and police have offered fierce resistance. Unfortunately, Shenjiamen and Dinghai County City have fallen one after another, and local order is very chaotic. The self-defense corps have all retreated to the nearby mountains to wage guerrilla warfare. However, Ningbo is as peaceful as ever. Telecommunications from De Ping and Moufu have arrived in Ningbo one after another. The details are as follows:

Dinghai Shenjiamen has fallen

The Zhoushan Islands are sea islands outside the Zhenhai Estuary in eastern Zhejiang. They are salt-producing and fishing areas, and are not militarily important, so there are no regular troops stationed there. The Japanese army had previously occupied the islands of Qushan and Daishan in order to plunder salt and maintain its fishing plan. It has been a month now. Today, suddenly at 5:00 a.m. on the 23rd, under the cover of planes, Japanese warships bombed Dinghai, Shenjiamen, and other places, and then forcibly landed. The local self-defense corps and police offered constant resistance, but due to their numerical inferiority, they made heroic sacrifices. Unfortunately, Dinghai and Shenjiamen have fallen one after another, and the guards have been forced to retreat into the mountains to wage guerrilla warfare. Local order cannot be maintained, and a large fire broke out in the Dongyue Temple area.

Qingling Area Preparing for Fierce Battle

Shenjiamen is the only important town southeast of Dinghai and is the base of the fishing industry in the Zhoushan Islands. It is 80 li from the county seat and unfortunately fell first. Therefore, the landing troops immediately attacked Dinghai County City, and later the county city also fell one after another. County Magistrate Su Benshan has led the police and guards of the entire county to retreat through the North Gate to the deep mountains of Qingling to reorganize all the troops and implement guerrilla warfare, attacking the landing Japanese army at any time. As for the local situation, according to the Gaudens of the German company Ruilin Foreign Company, who telegraphed from Shipu to Shanghai yesterday, mentioning that Shenjiamen Dinghai had fallen and the local situation was chaotic, it was also heard that residents had been ordered to retreat into the deep mountains. The Dinghai no-money radio station was originally located in the police station. Since the fall of Dinghai, telecommunications have been completely cut off. It is heard that Dinghai County City and Shenjiamen are both places with densely packed shops, which are not conducive to defense. However, the area around Qingling outside the North Gate is full of towering mountains. The county government authorities had arrangements in advance, so the war will be seen to be carried out on the ridge.

Strict Precautions in Putuo and Other Places

The state of local order in Dinghai, because the radio has been cut off, so the truth cannot be clarified for a while. However, the Gaudens of the German company Ruilin Foreign Company and the Tianbao of the German company Schimidt Foreign Company, which operate between Ningbo and Dinghai, have stopped entering Dinghai. As for the small steamers from Dinghai to Shenjiamen, they have also stopped. The sailboats that sail to the inner harbor, including Chuanshan, Shipu, Ninghai, and Sanmen Bay, have also stopped sailing. In addition, the police sent by Dinghai County still maintain order on islands such as Putuo Mountain, and are on strict alert. If the Japanese army attempts to land, they will be severely attacked. It is heard that some residents of Dinghai have taken refuge in Putuo Mountain.

Japanese Side Fully Building Naval Port

It is found that the Zhoushan Islands are composed of islands of various sizes such as Dinghai Island, Hengdao Island, Daishan Island, Changtu Island, and Taohua Island. They control the Baka Islands and the Ma'an Islands in the north, and the Feishan Islands in the south. They have various ports such as Xiangshanpu and Dinghai Island, and are rich in fisheries. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. The Japanese side first occupied Daishan, and now they continue to land in Shenjiamen Dinghai. Their purpose is to plunder fisheries and to build a naval port there. Therefore, the significance of their landing is worthy of attention.

Various Places in Eastern Zhejiang Were Bombed Again

According to news from the navigation industry, various places in eastern Zhejiang have been repeatedly harassed by Japanese planes. The situations are as follows: (1) Twelve Japanese planes invaded Zhenhai at 1:00 p.m. on the 23rd and dropped 60 bombs on the Jiangnan Xiaojiang, destroying more than 100 houses. At 4:00 p.m., another Japanese plane flew to Fanshi Town and dropped two bombs, destroying five houses. (2) Guanhaiwei in northern Cibei was also bombed by Japanese planes on the same morning, dropping ten bombs, destroying more than 50 houses, killing 13 people and injuring 35. (3) In the Longshan area in northern Zhenhai, two Japanese planes also dropped many bombs on the 23rd, destroying more than ten houses and injuring three civilians. (4) In the Xiangshan area, three Japanese planes invaded on the morning of the 22nd and bombed Nanmen Yangxing Street and other places. A certain middle school in western Xiangshan was bombed and destroyed seven or eight school buildings, killing and injuring several civilians.

Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Qushan Fishing Boats

Qushan Wufeng Fish Stack and others hired 500 pieces of yellow croaker to be shipped from Qushan to Shaoxing. On the way, passing near Dongshajiao Dongkenshan, they were detained by Japanese warships. After inspection, the fish were robbed and moved to the old site of the Bank of Communications warehouse in Dongshajiao for storage. Then the salted duck egg boat was burned to the ground, with losses estimated at 50,000 yuan. In addition, a civilian boat was set on fire by a Japanese warship off Zhitoushan Yangmian in Zhenhai a few days ago. Six compatriots were rescued by a coal ship and fled in distress to the Zhinan Township Office, requesting relief.

Ningding Both Hometown Associations Anxious

Since receiving the unfortunate news of Dinghai, the Ningbo Shanghai Hometown Association has been very concerned. A telegram has been sent to the local area to inquire about the truth, but no reply has been received. At the same time, the Dinghai Hometown Association has also telegraphed Dinghai to inquire about the situation, but no reply has been received. It is thought that all government agencies have been evacuated.

### Silver and Money Industries Decide on Methods to Stabilize the Market. The Preparation Committee Will Handle the Collection and Use of Interbank Remittances. The Total Amount is Provisionally Set at 50 Million Yuan, Registration to Begin Today.

This newspaper's Chongqing telegram on the 25th: According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, the ministry's decision to restrict the method of withdrawal and deposit in Shanghai was based on the fact that the trend of withdrawing deposits and buying foreign exchange in Shanghai has been very strong recently. In order to stabilize finance, the temporary emergency measures mentioned above were taken. It is still hoped that the market will return to its original state in the short term. When the situation is considered, the aforementioned methods will be cancelled immediately. Therefore, it has been stated in the original order that it is a temporary method. The method of stabilizing finance announced on August 15, 1937, has also been telegraphed by the ministry to continue to be effective.

Since the arrival of the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting the method of withdrawal and deposit in Shanghai, the silver and money industries have been discussing and requesting the Ministry of Finance to fully support legal tender in order to cope with the situation. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency has learned from the Silver and Money Industry Association that there are four methods to stabilize the market:

1.  All remittance deposits in the Bank Industry Joint Preparation Committee and the Money Industry Preparation Bank by various banks, money shops, and other financial institutions as of June 30, 1939, totaling 22 million yuan, will be allowed to be exchanged for legal tender by the Preparation Committee at 95 percent.

2.  The legal tender converted from the aforementioned remittance deposits will be paid in twelve weeks starting from July 4, 1939. Each bank and firm will withdraw up to one-twelfth per week. However, if the balance of each bank and firm is less than 10,000 yuan, and the bank and firm needs to withdraw in advance in order to cope with deposits, the Preparation Committee mayÈÖådetermine the amount to be paid in advance after verification.

3.  Starting from July 4, 1939, the Preparation Committee will begin to handle the collection and use of interbank remittances by various banks and firms. Each bank and firm may provide collateral to apply to the Preparation Committee for the collection and use of interbank remittances. The method of collection and use will be determined separately.

4.  This method has been resolved and implemented by the joint meeting of the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Associations, and it is understood that this method refers to the balance of interbank remittance deposits of various banks and money shops in the Bank Preparation Committee and the Money Industry Preparation Bank. All external remittance deposits of various banks and firms will continue to be handled as before. It is also heard that the Preparation Committee will handle the collection and use of interbank remittances by various banks and firms, with a total amount provisionally set at 50 million yuan, and registration will begin today.

### Large-Scale Selling Off by Hoarders, Rice Supply Exceeds Demand, Concession Management Committee to Meet Tomorrow, Steady Source of Supply for Days, People's Hearts Greatly Stabilized

The rice problem in this city, since the concession authorities repeatedly resolved to convene rice industry leaders to discuss price limits, now the market transactions are being handled in accordance with the price limits stipulated by the authorities, so the market order was restored yesterday, rice prices stabilized, the concession authorities, are paying close attention to the rice problem, and are doing their best to dredge sources and curb rising prices within the possible scope, but sources from various places have not yet been seen to be smooth, the 13th survey of stored rice will be released today, now a detailed account is given as follows,

Order Restored

The rise in rice prices in Shanghai had been soaring recently, presenting a phenomenon rarely seen in history. It is reported that the reason for its sharp rise is nothing more than hoarding manipulation, intentionally waiting and seeing. After the Bureau of Public Works repeatedly resolved to convene rice industry leaders to discuss rice price limits and stabilize market order, now, in the rice market, in addition to the top-grade white rice being traded in accordance with the price limits stipulated by the authorities, the middle and second-grade rice have been publicly agreed upon by the rice industry groups to set standard prices. The rice market opened at 9:00 am and closed at 12:00 noon yesterday, order was restored, rice prices stabilized, and all transactions were in accordance with the newly set price limits, people's hearts were more stable than before, and a total of 7,340 bags were traded in the morning,

Supply Exceeds Demand

Since these days, the weather has gradually become hot, the season of the Yellow Plum has arrived, and it is difficult to store the huge amount of white rice stored in the rice warehouses for a long time. Because rice prices were rising the day before yesterday, large households firmly refused to sell, rice prices were still expected to rise, and they planned to make huge profits. Now all rice prices in the market have been limited by the authorities. Seeing this situation, large households have sold in large quantities to avoid rotting and insects, so the spot chips in the market have suddenly become sufficient. Also, because of the shortage of legal tender, and the delivery of buying and selling transactions are mainly in cash, transactions are therefore sluggish, and the current situation is that supply exceeds demand. The prices of all grades of rice are lower than the limit price, averaging a drop of two or three corners,

Authorities Watching

The two concession authorities are very concerned about the food problem of the people in the concession. They had previously dispatched detectives to rush to the rice market to interfere with those who manipulated and disturbed the market order, and intentionally spread rumors to raise market prices. After the foreign exchange plummeted, unscrupulous rice merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. The two concession authorities, in view of the continued rise in prices of all goods, the lives of citizens have been unable to bear the burden, if rice prices rise again, the impact on the lives of ordinary people is indeed not small. Therefore, they have repeatedly convened representatives of the rice industry to discuss countermeasures, and now a new price limit for the rice market has been set. However, the two concession authorities are still deeply concerned about the market transaction order. Now the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided to convene a management committee meeting at 2:00 pm tomorrow (Tuesday). It is heard that the dredging of the source of national rice and the stabilization of the market rice price will be discussed at that time,

Rice Storage Survey

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association is responsible for investigating rice storage. Now the thirteenth phase has ended yesterday and will be released by the association today. According to rice industry sources, although the rice storage in this city has slightly decreased due to the reduction of sources, it is still extremely abundant. The number of rice stored in various rice warehouses is more than 523,000 bags, and the total number of rice purchased and hoarded by rice shops and citizens is also around 560,000 bags, so there is no need to worry about the food supply in this city,

Steady Source of Supply

After the vendors from various rice-producing areas have made every effort to purchase rice in recent days, the national rice transported to Shanghai has gradually increased. The amount of goods arriving every day has increased compared to before. On the 24th, the amount of goods arriving by water and land was 8,000 bags. On the 25th, it was also estimated to be 5,600 bags. Yesterday, more than 2,000 dan were transported by water and land. As for rice industry transactions, whether it is the market or the Rong Gang, they are all paid in cash as usual. It has been resolved and passed by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, and announced that the market will comply with it uniformly,

Detained Ships Released

After the rice purchased by cargo owners from various places and rice merchants in Shanghai from the producing areas and transported to Shanghai was detained in Minhang and other places, it caused anxiety about the source of supply in the market and caused a surge in prices. According to people in the rice industry, the number of detained rice ships reached more than 30. Now, after the cargo owners have dredged various parties and paid various donations and taxes, eight or nine ships have been released to Shanghai. More than 20 ships will continue to arrive in the coming days, so rice ships coming to Shanghai in the future can be opened in as usual, and the incidents of being blocked can be expected to decrease,

### Securities Black Market Opens Today, There is a Way to Unified Debt Principal and Interest to be Repaid, The Revival Public Debt Will Be Drawn as Usual on July 10

The Ministry of Finance has always been consistent in maintaining credit. There are considerable measures for the principal and interest payable on the five types of debt instruments, namely A, B, C, D, and E, of the unified public debt that expires on July 31. The Ministry of Finance will announce it at that time. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has approved the seventh principal repayment lottery of the Revival Public Debt guaranteed by customs duties to be held on July 10. As for the securities black market in Shanghai, it was temporarily suspended for two and a half days from the afternoon of the 22nd due to uncleared deliveries and restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. It is planned to open the market from today (Monday). However, it is expected that after the market opens, transactions will inevitably decrease sharply. The market lacks cash, making it difficult for speculators to manipulate,

### Sino-French Loan Established, Assisting Southwest Construction, France Will Transport Railway Materials to China, Rogers to London Within Two Weeks

The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 24th) this port received news from Hong Kong that the French government's loan to China was formally completed on June 23 after a long period of negotiations. The amount is 1.5 million pounds in British gold. The main purpose of the loan is not yet known in detail. However, according to various well-informed circles in Hong Kong, the nature of the loan granted by the French government to China is the same as the export credit loan granted by the former British government to China. Therefore, France will transport various materials needed to build railways and highways connecting the southwestern provinces with French Vietnam to China in the future. All circles of Chinese in Hong Kong regard the establishment of the Sino-French loan as another clear proof of the French government's foresight. It is heard that the French Ambassador to China, Gossner, has been instrumental in the early conclusion of this loan. Yesterday it was rumored that Sir Leith-Ross will come to China again soon.

The official did not verify this. However, according to well-informed circles in Hong Kong, Rogers, chairman of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, will go to London within two weeks. It is likely that he will return to Hong Kong with Sir Leith-Ross. If there is not enough time, Rogers' trip to Chongqing will be cancelled,

### Safety Movement Achieves Great Results

Incidents in One Week Decreased Significantly Compared to Last Year

The Continental News reported that the Safety Movement Propaganda Week ended on Saturday night last week. Its results were far beyond expectations. According to news released by four radio stations broadcasting in English, the number of incidents on various roads during the week decreased by more than 30% compared to the same week last year. According to the broadcaster, this is entirely due to the universal education movement that has achieved such good results. The statisticians of the Bureau of Public Works were still compiling figures yesterday (the 24th) and waiting for reports of road incidents from various police stations. However, it is said that the number of various road incidents during the Safety Movement Propaganda Week was reduced by 50% compared to the week of June 18, 1938. Mr. Mikkelsen, Chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, delivered a speech on the broadcasting station to thank the residents of the concession and the staff of the Bureau of Public Works for their active assistance. Other speakers urged the citizens not to forget the lessons learned this week and continue to work hard to benefit society in the future,

### The French Municipal Council Provides Financial Support to Employees, Salaries Increased Across the Board, Calculated from June 1, Implemented After Approval by the Council Members

The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 23rd) it was heard from reliable sources that the French Concession Municipal Council, due to the recent drop in foreign exchange and the high cost of living, in order to compensate the service personnel in the bureau, is planning to increase the salaries and foreign exchange allowances of all employees (French, Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese). It is expected that it will be implemented from June 1 after being approved by the French Municipal Council Members today (the 24th) or Monday. The teachers of the Municipal Council Academy will also be

Included in the Salary Increase

The Municipal Council's plan to adjust salaries and implement it from June 1 was confirmed yesterday by a senior official of the Municipal Council. However, the official did not know how much the employees' salaries would be increased. It is said that the percentage increase has been drafted, but it still needs to be approved by the Council Members. It is heard that the plan submitted to the Municipal Council is that the basic salary of European employees below 700 yuan per month will be increased by 30%, and those below 700 yuan will be increased by 25%,

Chinese and Vietnamese Police

Including police officers, will be increased by 20%, and a rice allowance of 1.5 yuan per month. It is also heard that European employees will also be given child and housing allowances. The employees of the French Municipal Council were happily waiting for the official announcement of the salary increase yesterday to cope with the high cost of living, but no one knew exactly how much it would be increased, and they were only guessing. Monday, it is expected to be

Officially Announced

In addition, the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works Establishment Committee, in view of the decline in foreign exchange, will meet at the end of the month to discuss the adjustment fee to be given to employees. Although no official news has been released so far, it is heard that the adjustment fee will indeed be issued, which is true for "B" grade employees, because the salaries of "B" grade employees are not paid in foreign currency like "A" grade employees,

### Shanghai-Shantou Flights Resumed

Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Carry Passengers and Goods as Usual

Japanese troops landed in Shantou, and fighting broke out. Flights between Shanghai and Shantou were once blocked. According to news from the shipping industry, the Jinan, a British merchant ship of the Taikoo Company that runs between Shanghai and Shantou, safely arrived in Shantou under the protection of a British warship on the morning of the 23rd and unloaded cargo. The Fusheng of Jardine Matheson arrived in Shantou from Shanghai on the 24th, safely entering the port. The Yisheng arrived on the morning of the 25th. Now the Shanghai-Shantou flights of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have been officially resumed, carrying passengers and goods.

According to news from the shipping industry, the Yongsheng and other ships that departed from Shanghai to Tianjin have all arrived in Tianjin safely without being detained. The British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have sent ships to resume Tianjin flights. Today, the Chunsheng of Jardine Matheson and the Shengjing of Taikoo Company are departing for Tianjin,

### XINGHUA, QUANZHOU, XIANGYU AND NEARBY PORTS OPENING UP NEW ROUTES FOR FOREIGN SHIPPING, JAPANESE USE MILITARY REASONS TO DEMAND PERMITS FROM THE ARMY AND NAVY, FOREIGN SHIPPING UNWILLING TO APPLY AND CHANGING NAMES AND ROUTES

The ports of Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Xiangyu along the coast of Fujian Province produce a large amount of local sugar and longan, which have always belonged to inland ports, and foreign ships are not allowed to transport them. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War,

Chinese Merchant Ships

Stopped sailing, and foreign ships took the opportunity to sail. The local government, in order to connect products, also gave understanding. Therefore, for a year, foreign ships have exclusively enjoyed the benefits. The goods transported are mainly flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes. The exports are

Longan and Local Sugar

The number is considerable. Unexpectedly, from the first of this month, the Japanese army, under the pretext of the military period, said that the above-mentioned three ports must not be sailed without the permission of the Japanese army and navy. The Japanese tax official of the customs also issued a notice, and the situation has been recorded in the previous report. Until now,

It has been more than Two Sentences

Foreign ships are unwilling to apply for permits, and would rather sacrifice and stop sailing. However, local business circles and Shanghai-based customer gangs have repeatedly decided to discuss how to find ways to connect. Now it is heard that Taikoo Company, in order to meet the needs of customers, plans to open up new routes nearby. It has now been decided to

Send Liangzhou Transport

To Xiudu (Suido) (transliteration) on the morning of the 28th, "the place is near Quanzhou", and send Niuzhuang to Linqiu (Lineju) (transliteration) at the same time, "(the place is near Xiangyu)", and Sanjiang (the place is near Xinghua) and Wenzhou and other places. Yesterday, customers were notified to undertake goods,

### HSBC Enters Dock for Repairs

Shipowners to Report Incident in Shanghai

The Norwegian vessel HSBC, chartered by the Fufeng Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road in this city, loaded flour, soap, groceries, etc. from Shanghai on the 20th and sailed directly to Zizhulin, Tianjin. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 pm on the 22nd, it encountered fog on the ocean near Weihaiwei, causing it to be heavily damaged by the Japanese vessel Kaiun Maru. Fortunately, the Japanese vessel, together with another Japanese vessel, Kangrui Maru, jointly rescued it, plugging the leak in the first cabin and removing a portion of the heavy cargo and throwing it into the sea, so the hull was spared from sinking, and all the crew members were safe. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency who inquired from Fufeng Shipping Company yesterday, after the ship was towed to Yantai, all the cargo had been unloaded, and it had entered the dock for repairs yesterday. All the shipowners and crew members are scheduled to take a ship to Shanghai in the coming days and report the truth of the incident to the Norwegian Consulate General and the company, so as to study the issue of responsibility and conduct negotiations for compensation,

### Shanghai Rubber Industry Gradually Turning for the Better

Eleven Factories in Operation

Before the war, there were more than 50 domestic rubber factories. Since the outbreak of the war, most of them have fallen into the war zone, so only eight factories, including Dachina, Yisheng, Jiaotong, Hongda, Yongqin, Yuanyuan, Wuhua, and Likang, are in operation. However, due to the interruption of sales in the mainland and other places, they are all maintaining production by reducing work. This year, due to the gradual prosperity of sales in Nanyang, South China, and Northwest China, various factories have also increased production. At the same time, several new factories have started operation in summer, including Guotai on Bailinan Road, Huafeng Factory on Kangjiaqiao Nandunxin Road, etc. In total, there are eleven factories in operation in the city, only one-quarter of the pre-war number,

### Elite Chinese Troops Along the SUJIA Road Are Being Replaced, The 62nd and 63rd Divisions Return to the Rear, The 103rd Division and the 35th Brigade Take Over

It is reported that there are six divisions and more than 100,000 men of the regular Chinese army mobile force, which are crossing the Qiantang River from the source and entering the rear of the Japanese army in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and Sujia Road areas. It is said that they have gained strong strongholds and are waiting for an opportunity to attack. It is now heard that two divisions, which have been fighting for a long time, have been ordered to be replaced, one is the Tao Lou troops of the 62nd Division, and the other is the Tan Jingguo troops of the 63rd Division. They are moving quickly and crossing south of the Qiantang River. The two divisions have been active on the border between Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, Suzhou, and Zhejiang for a year, repeatedly resolving to attack Japanese strongholds and building extraordinary achievements. Therefore, they have returned to the rear for rest and replenishment in accordance with wartime operations. The vacated defense areas have been transferred by the Chinese military authorities to two new forces, the 103rd Division and the 45th Independent Brigade, which have crossed north of the Qiantang River and have completed the takeover,

### Japanese Headquarters Announces the Total Number of Japanese Troops in China, Japan's Domestic Military Strength is Exceptionally Thin, All Defense Forces are Only Three Divisions

According to the French Shanghai Daily on the 25th, according to the Japanese headquarters, the distribution of Japanese troops in China is roughly as follows: (North China) 15 divisions (South China) 3 divisions (Central China) 15 divisions (Northeast China) 15 divisions

According to the strength of each Japanese division, which is 25,000 men, the military strength in China has reached more than one million men. In addition, it is heard that there are still three to four divisions in Japan, which are used to prevent rebellion. It can be seen that this military strength is the highest power of Japan. Although Japan still has some manpower that can be mobilized, this manpower is neither well-trained nor has sufficient military equipment to enable them to be organized into an army. From this point of view, the Japanese army, at best, is only 50 or 52 divisions. It is truly unwise to wage a widespread war against China, and they have now deeply felt it,

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds

Yu Qiaqing and Others Initiate and Organize Events on the 1st and 2nd of Next Month

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has been established for 21 years, and its achievements are remarkable. Over the years, it has saved countless lives of ordinary people. Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, most of the epidemic hospitals in this port have been suspended due to location reasons. The hospital has been able to preserve and continue to serve the community because it is located in the central area. However, it is the only survivor, and its workload is far beyond the original calculation. According to the number of people treated last year, it reached 95,600 people, so the organizers have spent a lot of effort on the funding. This year is already the summer season, and the number of residents in the concession is increasing. If there is an epidemic, the situation may be serious. At this extraordinary time, it is difficult to raise funds for medicines, and prices are rising, requiring a lot of money. The people of Shanghai are deeply worried about this. Now, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Jin Tingsun and other five gentlemen, in view of this, have initiated an invitation to famous opera performers, famous actors, and famous flowers to broadcast all day and night at the Guohua Radio Station on July 1st and 2nd to raise funds from all walks of life, and have sent letters to Zhang Shankun, Fan Hengde, Gu Zhuxuan, Dong Yong, and Chen Yuelou as sponsors. The radio station work is hosted by Yuan Senzhai, Sun Lanting, Bao Xiaodie, Wang Qijun, Zhang Zhongyuan and other ticket-holders. At that time, the entire Shanghai national opera community will participate. It is hoped that all walks of life will promote elegance, order songs at will, help those in need, and donate generously, which is the supreme merit,

### Customs Brokerage Industry Tightens Expenses

Adding Additional Expenses for Entertaining Customer Gangs Has Been Understood After Discussion

The business of the customs brokerage is to act as an agent for customers, handling import and export goods, transportation, customs declaration, payment of taxes, and other procedures. The business is prosperous. The industry is divided into three groups: Beiyang, South China (divided into Chao Gang and Guang Gang), and Yangtze River. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has been completely suspended. The North and South Ocean groups can still maintain, but the customs brokerages with larger scales have branches in various ports, and the customer gangs are attached to them. The customs brokerages provide food and lodging and writing rooms, and charge the lowest room and board fees. The customs brokerages give preferential treatment to the customer gangs, because the customers who live in the customs brokerages have priority in handling customs declaration, transportation, and other procedures for the goods they purchase. Both parties make use of each other. Since the outbreak of the war, the cost of living on the isolated island has gradually increased, such as electricity bills, water bills, and rents, which have been increased repeatedly. The customs brokerages, for emotional reasons, still follow the old example for the affiliated customer gangs, so the losses are huge. However, recently, due to the impact of the first order shrinking, prices have suddenly soared, and various industries have raised prices. The customs brokerages are afraid that it will be difficult to support the current situation if they still charge the same meal and room fees for the customer gangs. Therefore, the customs brokerages of the Beiyang group, such as Litaichang, Xinshengchang, Dongyuegong, Beihengmao, Chengxinchang, Yongchangtai, Xinji, Yongfengli, Yuancheng, etc., have decided to increase the room and board fees and electricity fees of the customer gangs from the first of next month to make up for the losses. In addition to the announcement, they also discussed with the customer gangs, and the customer gangs also understood the difficult times and have understood,

### Asian Cultural Association Receives Enthusiastic Donations

Already Raised 10,000 Yuan, The Future is Very Optimistic

The Zi Lin Bao reported that the local Asian Cultural Association has recently been in financial difficulties, with heavy debts, and it is difficult to maintain. It has appealed to the public to donate for emergency relief. In recent days, donors have been enthusiastic. An anonymous person donated 2,000 yuan, and the Yizhong Tobacco Leather Company donated 1,000 yuan. So far, more than 11,000 yuan has been donated. Although it is not possible to repay all debts in one fell swoop, the association is quite optimistic about the future. The association has a library and a museum, which greatly benefit the academic community. The association is not only the oldest cultural organization founded by foreigners in China, but also the only one in the Shanghai Public Concession, so the citizens deserve to give it full assistance,

### Amateur Art Writers Association Prepares for Public Exhibition

Proceeds from Sales to Be Used for Disaster Relief

The Youth Amateur Art Writers Association, in order to promote the art movement, is actively preparing for the first public exhibition. It has collected many masterpieces, including Western paintings, Chinese paintings, architectural paintings, fan paintings, calligraphy, etc. Mao Xin Yi, Jin Zutong and other gentlemen of the association are responsible for preparing everything. The address is the entire Xiuzhou Bookstore at No. 33 Seymour Road. It is being speeded up and will be opened to the public soon. It is also heard that the association will use the proceeds from all sales to provide relief to refugees,

### Tranquil and Unstained Mind - A Visit with Mr. Wen Lanting

‚Äî Zhou

Just past the Dragon Boat Festival, still in the season of the Yellow Plum rains, the weather is already scorchingly hot, no different from midsummer. On the morning of the 24th, I got into a car, its rubber tires speeding along the melting asphalt, arriving at a densely wooded area in western Shanghai. I saw many emerald green parasol trees by the roadside, bravely struggling against the intense sunlight. Getting out of the car, I realized that the stuffy air inside was not as refreshing as walking.

I had arranged a meeting with Mr. Wen Lanting beforehand. I presented my card and went upstairs to Mr. Wen's elegant guest room. Mr. Wen greeted me with humility, and in an instant, without thinking, I felt as if I were in Chairman Lin's private residence on Shibanqiao in Nanjing. Taking advantage of the time before the conversation began, I was filled with recollections as if I were in the Chairman's private residence. Looking around, I felt that this small guest room was almost enveloped by antique vases and old books, with an ancient square table in the middle, still the domain of ancient books and writing materials. Mr. Wen, with his long beard and dignified appearance, sitting in the middle, was perfectly suited, as if adorning this ancient room. This serene scene, with Chairman Lin's room full of antiques and a dazzling array of books, was almost indistinguishable.

"Poetry is not as wonderful as speech, leaves can surpass the fragrance of flowers," a short couplet hung opposite me, further convincing me that Mr. Wen was an elder with humorous and wonderful words. Below the couplet was a throne-like rattan chair, somewhat resembling a lotus seat in the Buddhist world. I had seen the throne of the Nona Hutukhtu in Nanjing, and it was similar. I always thought it was a product of a considerable era, but Mr. Wen said that it was a gift from an Indian friend, so it was still an antique imported item!

Mr. Wen lamented the current hardship of the people's livelihood. He reads the newspaper every day and is very concerned about commerce and economy. He suddenly mentioned the issue of the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on cash withdrawals from banks. He firmly said that the restrictions were well-intentioned, but the market still has exchange discounts, which negate the effectiveness of the restrictions. Therefore, if there are restrictions, there should be no exchange discounts. He hopes that the government and the Shanghai business community should take this matter seriously.

He greatly encouraged this newspaper, saying that the competition in the world's commerce and economy has reached the point of close combat. Shen Bao's reports on commerce and economy are quite detailed. He hopes that it will further guide the business community to increase knowledge and strengthen its power. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Wen is very concerned about the advancement of knowledge for young people in the business community.

Mr. Wen enjoys high prestige in the business community, which is self-evident. He did a lot for the country in his early years, but he did not dwell on his achievements. During our conversation, Mr. Wen said that it was a citizen fulfilling his due responsibility and was not worth mentioning. He said that he used to smoke cigarettes often, because a student was scolded by a teacher for smoking and was almost ashamed. In order to plead for this student, he felt that he should also give up the habit of smoking cigarettes. At 10 p.m. on April 30th of the eleventh year of the Republic, he was traveling on Mount Yuntai in Xuzhou. He decided to quit this habit, and for eighteen years, he has remained completely detached from cigarettes. He said: "I never lie in my life," because he had already said that he would no longer smoke cigarettes, of course, he would fulfill the principle of keeping his word without any compromise.

He usually gets up at 7 a.m. and goes to bed at 10 p.m., without taking a nap. He has no hobbies in his life, and he doesn't drink alcohol at all. His way of maintaining health is to have a regular life. He keeps books like Han Feizi on his desk. He said that most of his time each day is spent on books, and he loves to read philosophy books. When he was forty-six years old, he unfortunately lost his wife. He firmly believed that the worldly customs of widows remaining chaste after their husbands' deaths, while husbands can remarry after their wives' deaths, were unfair. So he started growing a beard that year, determined not to remarry. Speaking of this, he smiled and said that in the past twenty-four years, I have neither remarried nor had a concubine, which is just following the peace of my heart.

He especially disapproves of the social custom of sending out invitations for weddings and funerals. He has never printed invitations. He hopes that wasteful social gatherings should be reduced, and even regarded as a serious prohibition. His motivation for being a vegetarian was because of the uncleanness of livestock. Later, a friend persuaded him to believe in Buddhism, because he was naturally kind, so he started reading scriptures, and after a considerable period of time, he converted.

Sexual Health

### To Become an Ideal Couple: Frequent Sexual Activity Requires Prompt Kidney Nourishment

‚Äî Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University

Young men and women are in love with each other, their hearts always depicting the beautiful image of their beloved, embracing sweet ideals. How beautiful and happy this is! If heaven and man comply, and they become a formal couple, the lover in their heart becomes a companion for life. Isn't this kind of newlywed sweetness even more intoxicating?

However, this joy of marriage often declines due to excessive indulgence between men and women. Many men and women, after their honeymoon, are ignorant of hygiene, resulting in men developing symptoms such as kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation within a few years, and women becoming anemic and prematurely aging due to indulgence. Therefore, to keep the joy of marriage fresh, in addition to moderation, pay attention to sexual power at all times to avoid weakening due to sexual activity. The "foundation of love" can only be consolidated by the soundness of sexual desire. Therefore, the abundance of sexual function cannot be considered the entire happiness of married life, but at least it can be considered the key to harmony. If sexual function is not satisfactory, there will never be happiness in the family. Therefore, couples should strive to maintain the health of this function.

Our sexual power may obviously change if we are ignorant of hygiene before marriage, but it will also become thin and pale, with kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation if we are too active in sexual activity after marriage. To study the causes of these diseases, we must first understand the role of the main gland in the human body, the puberty gland. The puberty gland is located in the testicles of men and the ovaries of women. This gland is often damaged by self-indulgence before marriage, but after marriage, it often loses its prosperity due to indulgence. Therefore, the occurrence of the above symptoms is due to these reasons. I am a specialist in sexual medicine. When I studied medicine in Soviet Russia, I repeatedly conducted various effective remedial therapies. According to experience, the most effective method is to use the genuine animal puberty gland extract, German "K√∂rperkraft" for men, to increase sperm and nourish blood. The "K√∂rperkraft" promotes the function of metabolism, nourishes the brain, nourishes the kidneys, nourishes the blood, and accelerates the development of reproductive organs. Countless sex disease experts in Europe and America know that the drug is accurate and is an effective medicine for treating kidney deficiency and premature aging, and the drug does not contain domineering impurities, and is suitable for all seasons. Anyone who loses health after marriage will recover immediately after taking it. The "K√∂rperkraft" for women is an effective medicine for women's anemia, premature aging, and irregular menstruation. Those who suffer from infertility will become pregnant after taking it.

Modern Medicine

### New Treatment for Old Gonorrhea

‚Äî Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine, USA

Whether gonorrhea is new or old, there is hope for recovery. The only goal is to completely eliminate it, so that not a single residual gonococcus remains. Eliminating gonorrhea also has its difficulties. Gonorrhea is easy to eradicate in the early stages, but after a long time, it often causes unexpected problems, making it difficult to eliminate. However, it is not untreatable. When gonococcus is in the anterior urethra, its base is not large, so it is not difficult to cure. But once it becomes chronic, there are many complications of gonorrhea, which are not only difficult for doctors to diagnose, but also more difficult to treat. Therefore, many people often declare a death sentence once gonorrhea becomes chronic. In fact, this is not always the case. If the latest scientific methods of treatment can be used, even the most stubborn and long-term old leucorrhea can be solved.

Speaking of the latest treatment for gonorrhea, from my many years of research and experience, nothing surpasses the remarkable effectiveness of the German gonorrhea specific medicine "Klimanon." This medicine was invented by Dr. Peter, a master of gonorrhea science. It not only destroys the initial gonorrhea like a crumbling, but also can easily cure the old gonorrhea whose roots are old. Because the medicine "Klimanon" is made according to non-specific therapy. I knew the effectiveness of this agent when I was studying in the United States. Since returning to China, my belief in "Klimanon" has become stronger. Since I used "Klimanon," male and female gonorrhea, such as acute and chronic gonorrhea prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and female gonorrhea leucorrhea, vaginitis, oophoritis, etc., can be completely solved in three to five weeks after taking "Klimanon." Men with gonorrhea can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Cardil Snowdi Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, which will be more effective.

### Consolidating the Jing Guan is a Thorough Treatment for Spermatorrhea

‚Äî Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine, Germany

Why is spermatorrhea not easy to cure? The reason is mostly because they do not know how to maintain health, or are still addicted to self-indulgence, so even if there is good medicine, it is difficult to help.

Self-indulgence and spermatorrhea are easy for young men and women to commit. In addition to being easy to break the hymen and damage the pure virgin spirit, the harm to women is not as deep as that to men. Men can often hinder the development of reproductive organs, damage the jing guan, and loosen their ejaculation center, so they have spermatorrhea. After worrying and impatience during the day, the semen will flow out automatically. In addition, there is also a symptom of physiological spermatorrhea, which is unavoidable for healthy unmarried people. It is completely caused by dream inducement, the number of resolutions is very rare, and they are never tired after spermatorrhea. However, people with weak will are easy to inspire the motivation for masturbation and gradually turn to pathology, making both the spirit and the body lose health!

To thoroughly cure spermatorrhea, you must first consolidate the jing guan, and quit masturbation and avoid labor. The most effective medicine for consolidating the jing guan is the German product "Neeres Spermatorrhea Tablets." Taking three tablets before going to bed will stop spermatorrhea that night. If the body is weak, or has been congenitally insufficient, or has neurasthenia, it is advisable to take the German testicular essence preparation "K√∂rperkraft" for men, which is very effective.

### Special Treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

‚Äî (Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang, Specialist in Pulmonary Diseases)

Pulmonary tuberculosis is a very serious disease, so it is called a chronic self-destructive disease, but if we can solve the terrible pulmonary disease with the new wisdom of science, it is not difficult. Now, based on our more than 20 years of experience, there is reason to believe that pulmonary disease can be eliminated by scientific therapy. And can still return to a healthy state. Because I always use "Pulmonal One" invented by Dr. Thormer in Germany to cure early and second- and third-stage pulmonary diseases, such as tidal fever, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, phlegm is not refreshing, mental burnout, loss of appetite, shortness of breath like a cow, etc. Taking "Pulmonal" can stop coughing within four hours. During the period of the intellectual bag, all tuberculosis symptoms are gradually reduced day by day. At most one month, the difficult-to-heal pulmonary disease can be completely and fundamentally solved, defeating all perfunctory and making the patient neither dead nor alive pulmonary tuberculosis therapies. It is a truly effective therapy for pulmonary disease. No wonder major European and American pulmonary sanatoriums are scrambling to use it.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### No Need to Be Pessimistic About Gonorrhea Turning Bad

‚Äî Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrhea originally has an easy-to-cure opportunity, but often let go and do not treat it. This is indeed a pity in the gonorrhea treatment community. If gonorrhea is once mistreated, the gonococcus will obtain a stronghold to carry out further internal invasion. As a result, the complications of gonorrhea will occur in various ways, and treatment will be more difficult. Although there are many reasons for this kind of disease, the patient's misuse of inferior drugs and local surgery of medical equipment to make the gonococcus escape inside is no different from an accomplice of gonorrhea. However, this kind of complication is not absolutely incurable. According to experience, many gonorrhea become bad diseases. As long as scientific therapy is used to save them, they can often save the situation of decline and make them rejuvenate. I have seen this many times in my 20 years of experience. Considering that gonococcus is a very easy-to-escape pathogen, our treatment should not be limited to the local area. Moreover, in the complications of gonorrhea, the gonococcus has mostly invaded three systems, that is, invading the urinary system to become cystitis, nephritis, etc., invading the reproductive system to become prostatitis, orchitis, etc., and invading the blood circulation system to become arthritis, etc. With these kinds of complications, treatment cannot be ignored

To cure such a wide range of gonorrhea, local therapy alone is not enough to cover all gonorrhea. I always use the gonorrhea specific medicine "Klimanon" as an internal medicine, and on the other hand, I use German static electricity therapy, German anti-gonorrhea serum, and X-ray electrotherapy, etc., and select them appropriately. Because "Klimanon" has the effect of searching for a wide range of gonococcus and destroying it, and local sterilization of each branch and section, and anti-gonorrhea serum, it can exert the effect of "Klimanon" to kill bacteria. Therefore, it can be effective. Consultation hours: 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. From now on, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day. Each number will only be charged five jiao, and a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan will be given away.

### Guerrilla Warfare Occurs in Various Places in Tongtai, Japanese Warships Bombard Longwokou, Hutong Port, Niuhong Port is Chaotic, North Sand Navigation is Normal but Does Not Combine Bays

Recently, the Chinese army in Subei, such as Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, Qi, Tai, etc., has adjusted most of the guerrillas to cooperate with the regular army, supplemented them completely, and obtained the belief of the people. They often report the traces of the Japanese army to the Chinese army's command organs. The Chinese army, according to reports, dispatched troops at any time to attack.

Exerting Power

Therefore, the Japanese army suffered great losses. Although under the guise of so-called "clearing unstable elements and suppressing guerrilla bandits," they transferred reinforcements from Shanghai and the Yangtze River to gather, forced the puppet self-defense corps to lead the way, went to various rural areas, and searched for guerrilla teams. However, the Chinese army was well-informed. When encountering small groups of Japanese and puppet troops, they immediately carried out raids and seized their weapons. When large groups of Japanese and puppet troops invaded, they hid and did not come out, and informed friendly forces according to the situation. After reinforcements from all sides arrived and made contact, they surrounded them.

To Annihilate

The Japanese and puppet troops rarely broke through, so they were defeated in every battle, and the losses were extremely heavy. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, who learned from the transportation industry, battles are currently taking place in the inner ports and rural areas of Tongtai. The rural area of Xinyang Baykou, the junction of Tong and Tai counties, was originally stationed by Chinese army guerrillas. On the 21st, the Japanese and puppet troops suddenly dispatched more than 100 soldiers, carrying sharp weapons such as machine guns and small steel cannons, and advanced from the land through Shigang and Juegang.

Attempting a Sneak Attack

On one side, a small gunboat of the Japanese navy sailed near Longwokou Port and fired to cover the landing of more than 60 Japanese soldiers on a speedboat. They were blocked by the defending Chinese army and fought back bravely, sweeping with machine guns. The Chinese army's mortar team also participated in the battle. As a result of the fierce battle, both sides suffered casualties. The Japanese and puppet troops on the land retreated to the vicinity of Shigang, and the Japanese warships were still parked on the sea in that area, harassing the coastal ports. Because the center of the war was on land, the waterways were smooth. The foreign shipping companies in the city, such as Jardine Matheson's Tonghe Wheel, are operating as usual, but

Cargo Transportation Drops Sharply

It has been affected. As for the location of the battle in Nantong, it is on the Houjia Oil Press and Guanyin Mountain. The Chinese army sent plainclothes advance teams to destroy transportation and consume Japanese and puppet troops' bullets, so as to contain their military strength. It has been quite effective. The Japanese and puppet troops feel deeply tired of running around. The situation in that area is chaotic. According to people in the shipping industry who spoke to the Daguan News Agency reporter, when the foreign shipping companies' ships such as Swire's Wantong and Far East's Haiyi returned from Beisha yesterday, they did not combine with the lower ports such as Hutong Port and Niuhong Port, but the outer ports such as Shanggang, Xintang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port were still peaceful, and passengers and goods were still boarding and disembarking as usual. Today, there are many ships sailing to Beisha, such as Swire's Wantong, Far East's Haiyi, and Fuhua's Tingding.

### A Woman With Loose Morals Privately Has an Affair With a Friend of Her Husband, the Defendant Fails to Appear After Summons

Shi Zhiyao from Ningbo was on good terms with his fellow villager Zhao Songmao. Shi's wife, Hu Linchun, silently compared the two and felt that Zhao was better than Shi. Therefore, on March 25th of the lunar calendar, she abandoned her six-year-old child and ran away from her husband to Zhao. They rented together at No. 11 Yidi Village, Hadong Road, as if they were a couple. Since the woman disappeared, Shi went to find her. It was not until the 12th of this month that he learned where they were hiding. He reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address that night and found them on the spot. The man and woman also confessed to adultery. The police station then filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court in accordance with the law. The court hearing was held on Saturday morning, but the defendant Zhao Songmao dared to resist the summons and did not appear. Judge Fang questioned Shi Zhiyao and his wife Hu briefly, and ordered them to wait for Zhao to be brought to justice for interrogation.

### Three Robbers Who Robbed the Shen Tai Timber Shop in Shiliupu Were Executed, Stealing Motors, Copper Wire, etc., and the Elderly Gatekeeper Was Beaten and Seriously Injured

More than a dozen short-clothed thugs suddenly came to the Shen Tai Timber Shop in Xuejiawan, Shiliupu, Nanshi, late the day before yesterday, each holding weapons such as pistols, axes, and iron rulers, and broke in. They robbed all 40 motors in the sawmill and two large purple copper wires, each 20 zhang long, worth 4,500 yuan in total. Before leaving, they severely injured an elderly gatekeeper. After the shop reported the information to the Hongkou Japanese Army Department, which ordered the Japanese military police in Nanshi to investigate and arrest them, more than 40 robbers in this case were arrested. Three of them were identified by the injured gatekeeper as being heavily involved. They were tied up at the South Pier last night. One robber was cut into three pieces (head, body, and feet) by the Japanese army. The other two robbers were tied to electric poles with wire around their necks and stabbed to death with bayonets. However, the Japanese army has not yet found out that the robbers in this case possessed pistols and other weapons, and must continue to investigate the remaining accomplices.

### Cook Falsely Reports Robbery

Six Months' Imprisonment, Suspended Sentence

Cui Delin from Tongzhou was a cook in the residence of a Westerner named James. He was usually honest and trustworthy, and was deeply trusted by his master. Recently, because the place where he worked was adjacent to major gambling dens in western Shanghai, he was tempted and occasionally went to gamble in his spare time, incurring many debts. His master was still unaware, so the day before yesterday (23rd), he was still asked to send 110 yuan in cash to the Datong Bank. Cui actually used this money as gambling capital and went to the gambling den at No. 71 Jing'an Temple Road to bet everything on one throw. When the money was exhausted, he cut open his pocket with a knife and returned home, falsely claiming that the money had been stolen by thieves on the way. The Westerner reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to find out the truth and arrested Cui. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Cui was willing to repay the money in installments and begged for mercy. Judge Fang, considering that he was a first-time offender, sentenced him to six months' imprisonment, suspended for three years in court.

### Chengye Company Repeatedly Sued Tenants to Move Out, Finally Rejected by the Supreme Court, Resolving the Housing Problem for Hundreds of Tenants

The city houses and residences in Yufuli, Lane 135, Kaizier Road, French Concession, and the houses in Lane 126, Xiahui Road, etc., are all properties of Chengye Company at No. 2, Henry Road, Henryfang. They have been rented by Zhou Xifan, Jin Zixi, Zou Kezhong, Wu Wanheng, Dong Xueliang, Huang Chunrong, Wu Xinpu, Shao Yulin, Shao Huikang, Chen Antong, Zhang Daoxiu, Ma Jinliang, etc. for residence or business. The leases are all indefinite. Last autumn, in order to obtain the huge transfer fee from Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop, Chengye Company, on the pretext that the houses were old and planned to be demolished and rebuilt, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting the court to order all tenants to move out. The tenants, Zhou Xifan, etc., jointly appointed lawyer Tang Hao to defend and oppose the move, detailing the plaintiff's litigation motive, which was to take advantage of this extraordinary period to drive away old tenants in order to obtain the huge transfer fee from new tenants. Their purpose was to harm the good order of society. After the court inquired about the case, it ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected. Zhu Xueseng, the legal representative of Chengye Company, refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Higher Branch Court, which was rejected. Zhu still refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, attempting to achieve the purpose of driving away the tenants. Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop originally planned to open another branch at the entrance of Yufuli on Kaizier Road, but because Chengye Company failed to drive away the old tenants, it filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court the month before, accusing Zhu Xueseng of Chengye Company, requesting a judgment to return the transfer fee and compensation for losses of more than 10,000 yuan. After the court inquired about the case, it ruled that Zhu Xueseng also lost the case. It is now learned that Zhu Xueseng's appeal to the Supreme Court, requesting a judgment to order the tenants Zhou Xifan, etc. to move out, has been reviewed by the presiding judge of the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court, Weng Jingtang, together with judges Guo Xuru and Cao Fengxiang, etc. The result was that Zhu Xueseng was deemed to have no reason, and the appeal was rejected the other day. The third instance litigation costs shall be borne by the appellant. The reasons for the judgment have been delivered to both parties. Since this case has been finalized by the Supreme Court, the housing problem of hundreds of men and women of tenants such as Zhou Xifan has been legally resolved from now on.

### Practicing Kung Fu, Fighting to Death

Liu Changsheng from Changzhou, who lived at No. 7 Shudelili, Pingjili Road, French Concession, fought with his friend Xu Gaofa at the iron gate at the intersection of Laushenfu Road, Pingjili Road and Tangjiawan in the Chinese Concession at 9 p.m. on the 23rd of this month, fighting for the stone immortal shoulder pole while practicing kung fu, resulting in a conflict. At first, they quarreled, and then they fought and wrestled each other. Liu was beaten and injured by Xu, and reported to the French police, who arrested Xu. Liu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 4 a.m. yesterday due to severe internal injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday was Sunday, and it will be reported to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for an examination.

### Woman Xu Pingan Accused of Adultery

Zhai Yijing, the wife of Xuan Zhendong (also known as Fansheng), who resides at No. 9 Futian Village, Avenue Edward VII, recently filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, accusing Xu Pingan, who resides at Room 103, Xinda Xiang Building, Nanjing Road, of adultery with her husband, saying that she married Xuan Zhendong as his wife in the first year of the Republic of China. They were a loving couple and had already given birth to two sons. However, Xuan Zhendong often did not return home recently, and treated her like a discarded object. Now she knows that she was seduced and cohabited by Xu Pingan, and was deceived by sweet words, so she suddenly became so cold-hearted. Therefore, Xu Pingan is actually violating criminal law, and she is especially asking to summon him and punish him according to the crime he deserves according to criminal law, etc. The hearing was opened by Judge Fang on Saturday, but the defendant Xu Pingan and witness Xuan Zhendong did not comply with the summons and did not appear in court, so the hearing could not proceed and was rescheduled.

### A Woman Seven Months Pregnant Takes Poison and Dies

A woman from Ningbo named Mao Baofeng, aged thirty-two, lived with her husband at No. 14, Dong Qinghua Li, Jules Pasteurs Road, in the French Concession. Yesterday, at approximately 10:00 AM, she suddenly had a quarrel with her family over a minor matter. In a moment of anger, she conceived the idea of ending her life. She secretly purchased poison and swallowed it in secret. By the time her family noticed something was amiss, she was already losing consciousness. They rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but because she had been poisoned too deeply, she could not be saved. She died from the poison at approximately 11:00 AM. At the same time, the woman was also pregnant, having reached seven months. The unborn child was also destroyed due to its mother's suicide, a truly tragic event.

### The Weather Turns Cool, and Heavy Rain Dispels the Heatwave

The weather in Shanghai was hottest the day before yesterday, with temperatures nearing 100 degrees. The whole city felt like it was boiling. The heat did not dissipate that evening, and residents took to sleeping outdoors on mats. Some even sat outside until midnight before going to sleep. Despite fanning themselves constantly, they still sweated profusely. Yesterday morning, the sky began to turn overcast, and a gentle breeze stirred, easing the oppressive heat. By midday, there were intermittent showers. At 5:40 PM, the sky darkened like ink, and shortly after, heavy rain poured down, making the weather much cooler.

### Two Versions of the Bloody Case on Tianjin Road the Night Before Last

Peng Hanchang, a Cantonese man of forty-nine years, ran a foreign goods store at No. 4000 Wusong Road before the war. After the war, he closed the business and opened a Hongchang Woolen Yarn Store at No. 253 Tongfu Road. His family resided on the second floor of No. 333 Fuxu Road. When Peng was running the foreign goods store, his accountant, Mr. Wang, developed deep-seated grievances with Peng due to various reasons. The night before last, Wang suddenly learned that Peng and his wife were playing mahjong at a friend's house at No. 18 Tianjin Road. Wang, still harboring resentment, secretly went there and stabbed Peng in the abdomen three times. At the same time, Peng's wife was also stabbed. Blood flowed freely. They were rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment yesterday morning, but due to the severity of their injuries, their lives were in danger. The course of these events was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to Huang Guisong, the following account of the events is reported in a letter:

"I recently read in your esteemed newspaper about the stabbing of a couple by a thug lying in wait at No. 18 Tianjin Road. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Huang is actually Shunxiang, and he has been employed by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in Shanghai. Previously, a friend of his partnered with Peng Hanzhang to open a Songjiang Spring Restaurant on East Wuchang Road in Hongkou. Huang, entrusted by his friend, served as the manager of the restaurant. Because Peng Hanzhang's conduct was improper, with suspected embezzlement, Huang withdrew his investment midway to protect his friend's capital, causing the restaurant to close. Peng harbored resentment towards Huang, believing he instigated it. Consequently, at 11 PM on the 24th of this month, Peng and his wife, concealing a sharp knife, went to Huang's residence at No. 18 Tianjin Road to seek revenge. Huang was at home, enjoying the cool air. He was stabbed once. Huang immediately rose to defend himself. Peng's wife, fearing her husband would lose, stepped forward to help fight. All three were injured in the melee. Fortunately, a Chinese constable arrived and took them all to the police station. The report in your esteemed newspaper that Huang learned Peng was playing mahjong at a friend's house on Tianjin Road is inconsistent with the facts because that lane is where Huang lives. Peng, in fact, came with his wife from the French Concession to Huang's residence on Tianjin Road, armed with a knife, to seek revenge. I have always admired the fairness of your newspaper's commentary. I hope you will correct this. Respectfully submitted to the editor of the Shen Bao, Huang Guisong."

### Nine Japanese Planes Arrive at Dachang Airfield Yesterday

Yesterday, at approximately 10:00 AM, a large, gray biplane took off from the Japanese airfield at Dachang. It flew low and circled over Zhabei and Hongkou, no more than a few hundred meters above the ground, seemingly to welcome other planes. Shortly after, at approximately 10:15 AM, three formations of gray monoplanes, each with three planes, flew from the southwest clouds along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. They circled over Pudong, the Nanshi, and the western part of Shanghai before flying over the foreign concessions, Zhabei, Hongkou, Jiangwan, Wusong, and landing at the Dachang airfield. When passing over the concessions, the nine planes formed a single formation, creating a loud noise. Pedestrians stopped on the roadside to look up.

### Weng Xunxun's Summer Discount for Medical Consultations

Mr. Weng Xunxun, a distinguished disciple of the renowned Menghe doctor Ding Jiwan, has established his clinic at Aishou Lane, No. 64, Meibaiq Road. Considering that summer has arrived and the number of patients is increasing, he has decided to offer discounted consultations for two months, starting July 1st, to reduce the financial burden on impoverished patients. Those who seek consultation will only be charged 20 cents for the appointment fee. House calls, regardless of distance, will cost one yuan for transportation. However, this is only limited to the consultation hours set by the doctor. Outside of those hours, regular fees will apply.

### Japanese Nationals Collude with Chinese and Korean Nationals to Extort Gambling Dens; Arrested for Extorting 30,000 Yuan Claiming They Could Obtain an Operating Permit; Five Japanese, Korean, and Chinese Nationals Detained

A news agency reports that since gambling dens became active in western Shanghai over a year ago, incidents of taking advantage of the situation to extort money from the gambling dens have frequently occurred. According to an announcement from the Japanese side yesterday, recently, some of its nationals colluded with Chinese and Korean nationals, impersonating Japanese military police interpreters, and engaged in systematic extortion. After obtaining this information, the Japanese side ordered the military police to investigate the matter thoroughly. On the 21st of this month, the extortionists were arrested. It is said that several Japanese and Korean nationals contacted Qian Zhengwen, the operator of a gambling den at No. 864 Yuyuan Road, claiming they could obtain permission for the gambling den, which had been shut down, to continue operating, but it would require 30,000 yuan in lobbying fees. They also stated that after obtaining permission to reopen, they would require a daily reward of 200 yuan. An agreement was reached. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, they were formally negotiating the payment inside the gambling den at No. 864. However, their plot was discovered by the Japanese military police. On the 21st, Japanese nationals Senta Atsushi (31 years old, No. 164 Kunshan Road), Asanuma Ryoichiro (23 years old), and Fukuyama Taro (21 years old, No. 6 Jinfu Li, Baibao Road, North Sichuan Road), Chinese national Chuan Xue Zhang (36 years old, No. 61 Kader Road), and Korean national Lim Chang-soo (29 years old, No. 149 Yuanmingyuan Road) were arrested. They are currently being interrogated and detained.

### Resolution of the Brother-on-Brother Assault Case; Each Sets Up His Own Household and Separates the Family; Reconciliation Achieved, Lawsuit Withdrawn

Shen Xiongqing, a local Shanghai resident of 40 years of age residing at No. 2, Ayer New Village, Albert Road, in the French Concession, is currently a professor at the Shanghai Medical College on Haig Road. His father worked for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in Nanshi in his early years. During the attack on the Manufacturing Bureau by Liu Fubiao's troops of the Fu character army in the summer of the second year of the Republic of China (1913), Shen's father sacrificed his life in the line of duty and received a pension. Shen relied on this money to pass the official-funded entrance examination for Qinghua University in Beiping.

Studied in Europe and America

After returning to China, he successively served as a professor at various universities. Shen has a younger brother, Shen Yuqing, 27 years old, who is a posthumous child. Their elderly mother is still alive. The brothers and their mother live together. Yuqing works at the He Feng Foreign Firm. However, the Shen brothers have not yet divided the family property and live together. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 1:00 PM, the Shen Xiongqing and Shen Yuqing brothers had a conflict over inheritance issues. After fighting each other, they each went to the French police station to

File Assault Charges

and request investigation. The police station, considering that the Shens were brothers and the dispute was within the family, did not detain them and ordered them to return home to await further instructions. Yuqing requested a medical examination at the Prosecutor's Office of the Special District Court. On the 8th of this month, the police station escorted the Shen brothers to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court, where lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the French Concession authorities,

Filed a Public Prosecution

for assault. The Shens hired lawyers Shen Weihan and Wang Hengyuan to defend them. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe's interrogation, he ordered a postponement for further questioning and instructed both parties to reconcile outside the court. It has been learned that after the Shen family relatives learned of the matter in the newspaper, they tried their best to mediate between the Shen brothers and obtained the consent of the Shen's elderly mother to divide the family property so that the brothers could each set up their own household and separate the family. Now

Reconciliation is Established

Therefore, when the court reconvened the other day, the Shen Xiongqing and Shen Yuqing brothers each requested the court to withdraw the charges. Judge Zhu Chuzhe approved the request and ruled that the case would not be accepted. The brothers' dispute came to an end, and the Shen brothers happily left the court hand in hand.

### Machine Factory Technician Withdraws Shares; Sues Shareholders for Defamation; Demands Compensation of One Yuan for Losses

Xu Fusheng, a local Shanghai resident residing at No. 201, Zhu Jiaku, Haig Road, previously partnered with Cao Zuochen, a local Shanghai resident residing at No. 800, Belle Road, to open the Tianhua Machine Factory. Xu served as the technician. Later, Xu partnered with a shareholder surnamed Ji to design and operate the Jiji Machine Factory. Cao Zuochen believed that Xu had violated the partnership agreement by operating the same business, which damaged the business of the Tianhua Factory, and a dispute arose. Xu then withdrew his shares. Cao entrusted Xu Wufang to represent him in publishing an announcement in the newspaper to inform all customers that Xu had withdrawn his shares. After seeing the newspaper announcement, Xu Fusheng believed that Cao's publication was detrimental to him and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special District Court, accusing Cao Zuochen of defamation and requesting a legal investigation, and also included a civil suit requesting the court to order the defendant to pay one yuan in national currency for reputational damage. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court opened a hearing the other day and summoned both parties. The plaintiff, along with his lawyer, appeared in court and stated the previous events and presented the newspaper as evidence. The defendant, Cao Zuochen, along with his defense lawyer, Xu Wufang, appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff was originally a shareholder of the Tianhua Factory, but because he violated the partnership agreement, the defendant legally convened a meeting of the partners, resolved to have the plaintiff and Ji withdraw their shares and be removed, and legally entrusted a lawyer to publish a public announcement, which was not illegal or improper. He requested a declaration of innocence. The court verified the statements and, after ordering arguments, announced the conclusion and set a date for the verdict.

### Report of the Livestock Protection Association for May

All Reports of Cruelty to Horses Must Record the Branding Number

The Shanghai Livestock Protection Association's report for May 1939 states that during May, the association's investigators inspected the Municipal Council's dog pound and found that it had been improved with the installation of skylights, making the air and light more adequate. The drainage facilities in several dog pens still need improvement. Most horse stables had lame horses, which were apparently being rested. During this month, the association found only one incident of a lame horse being used for work, and the owner was fined six yuan.

When members of the public report incidents of lame or weak horses being forced to work or horses being overloaded, please record the license plate number of the vehicle and the branding number of the horse. These numbers are usually located on the upper left side of the horse's rear. This is the only way to identify abused horses. Two lame horses were put up for auction, but the sale was canceled at the request of the association's investigators.

Due to the need to transport pigs for tax collection by the "authorities" outside the concession this month, fewer pigs arrived in port, so the number of inspections of pig boats and pig pens also decreased. Investigators inspected three fires, all of which were near dairy sheds or livestock barns, but fortunately, none of the livestock were affected. In addition to the above inspections, investigators also patrolled various areas within the two concessions daily and handled many complaints of cruelty to livestock.

Incidents of slaughtering cats and dogs to sell their meat were investigated. Two people were punished by the French Concession authorities for this crime. The association received repeated reports that someone was selling sparrows near the western children's school on Columbia Road, but this person has not yet been seen by investigators. During the month, the association discovered a particularly cruel incident involving a laborer who deliberately put lime in a dog's eyes. The dog suffered terribly and eventually went blind. The association humanely euthanized the dog and, with the help of the French police, apprehended the laborer, who was sentenced to thirty days in prison. The association received a report that there was an incident of cruel pig handling on Avenue Joffre and quickly took action, reporting the individuals involved to the Jing'an Temple police station.

In addition to the work of the association's permanent staff, much work to alleviate the suffering of livestock is done by public-spirited individuals. The association's June issue of "The Blue Cross" magazine is currently being edited and will be mailed free of charge to all members at the end of the month.

### Li Jingtai Carries a Broken Gun and Counterfeit Money; A Detective Partner Frames Him by Abandoning Stolen Goods; After Interrogation, Li is Found Not Guilty and Released; Detective Partner Sentenced to Ten Months for False Accusation

Li Jingtai, a man from Shandong, 34 years old, residing at No. 162, Yidingpan Road, previously worked as a police officer in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at approximately 1:00 PM, he was stopped near the intersection of Connaught Road and Avenue Joffre by Chinese Constable No. 2258. A broken Browning automatic pistol and three counterfeit banknotes, including two 5-yuan Jiaotong banknotes and one Chinese banknote, were found in a paper package he was carrying. He was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the Special First Court. He confessed that the gun and counterfeit money were given to him by his friend Ge Yuting from Anhui, who promised to pay him 20 yuan to carry them. He was deceived by Ge and asked the court to investigate. In the middle of the adjournment, Ge was arrested and sent to the court. Chinese Constable No. 2258 admitted that Ge was his detective partner, but he did not report the matter. Ge Yuting denied abandoning stolen goods and falsely accusing Li Jingtai. Judge Jiang Shuzhi clarified the facts through interrogation and ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing. The verdict was delivered in the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Li Jingtai was found not guilty and released, while Ge Yuting was sentenced to ten months in prison for false accusation as a warning.

### Municipal Council's Health Overview for May

Typhoid Fever Exists Throughout the Year; Flies are a Carrier of Infection

The health situation in Shanghai last month was similar to that in April, with no major changes. Scarlet fever was found in a Jewish refugee camp, but there was only one death, so it did not become serious. Typhoid fever was quite prevalent at the end of the month. This disease has always been more common in the summer months, but in recent years, it has existed throughout the year. Although the reason is difficult to determine, it is conceivable that flies are a carrier of infection. The Health Department has been paying close attention to this issue and is advising citizens to get typhoid vaccinations for prevention. Meningitis has decreased significantly. The Health Department has tried a new treatment method, and the results show that the mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and medical expenses have also been significantly reduced.

Causes of Death

A total of 3,023 Chinese deaths were recorded, including 2,005 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, pneumonia, and typhoid fever. A total of 82 people requested treatment for dog rabies. Among the patients admitted to the New Zha Road branch of the Chinese Isolation Hospital, the most were those suffering from meningitis, with 43 cases. Among the patients admitted to the Beihai Road branch, the most were those suffering from measles, with 60 cases. Cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, paratyphoid fever, smallpox, and malaria were also recorded. Medical services at the schools set up by the bureau were carried out as usual. A total of 893 students requested treatment for trachoma. A total of 334 private Chinese schools receiving subsidies from the bureau were inspected, and 15 schools were found to be in full compliance with the Health Department's regulations. Ten schools have taken steps to improve student overcrowding.

Sanitation Facilities

The vegetable markets in the concession operated as usual. Meat prices stabilized at the end of the month. As summer approaches, the Health Department has paid special attention to fly prevention in food stores. Two ice cream shops were ordered to close because their products were found to be substandard after chemical testing. A total of 11,841 pigs were imported from other areas, only one-third of the total number in April. The number of those that died upon landing was half that of April. Last month, the Health Department vaccinated a total of 36,392 people and administered 167,114 vaccinations. Mosquito and fly control work has been intensified. As of the end of May, there were 39 refugee camps in the concession, housing a total of 40,976 refugees. Disinfection work in the refugee camps is still being carried out as usual. A total of 2,752 bodies were cremated, 966 coffins were buried, and 19,953 coffins were stored in funeral homes and coffin storage facilities, an increase of 1,353 coffins compared to April.

### Memorial Service for Mr. Cao Bingsheng; Contents of Family's Thank-You Speech

Letter from Ms. Cao Sun Xueying; Slightly Different from Yesterday's Newspaper

Yesterday, various groups in Shanghai held a memorial service for Mr. Cao Bingsheng at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, a letter has been received from Ms. Cao Sun Xueying, which reads: "To the esteemed editor, yesterday (the 24th), the 52 public organizations in Shanghai, along with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lidun, Xu Jiqing, Xu Caicheng, Lin Kanghou, Xi Yushu, Dai Chunfeng, and Huang Zenshi presided over the memorial service for my late husband, Mr. Bingsheng. I am deeply grateful for the presence of dignitaries from all walks of life and the solemn ceremony. Regarding the widow's thank-you speech, the main points were as follows: (1) My late husband's martyrdom has been deeply mourned by all circles at home and abroad. In addition to my grief, I am deeply grateful for the sympathy from all sides. (2) My late husband was honest and self-disciplined throughout his life and had no property. The widespread sense of justice and sympathy from all quarters, both those who knew him and those who did not, is the most valuable spiritual asset in the world. I will respectfully accept and never forget it. (3) I am deeply saddened by this great change and wish I could die, but I know that crying and being passive is only a sign of weakness. I am determined to carry on my late husband's legacy, work hard, and serve the country loyally to comfort my late husband's spirit in heaven and to repay the kindness of all those who have shown sympathy. This determination is further supported by the establishment of a memorial school and a memorial inscription for my late husband with the assistance of all parties. I hereby express my gratitude. The above points were personally heard by all those present, but today (the 25th), upon reading the newspaper, I found some discrepancies. Therefore, I have written this letter to request a correction to conform to the facts. With respect, Cao Sun Xueying."

### Miscellaneous Records of Theft Cases

(1) Near St. John's University on Great Western Road, the dense trees attract many strolling couples, especially around sunset. Yesterday, being a Sunday, the number of people in the suburbs was even greater. At around 4:55 PM, a Western couple was walking arm in arm when they were suddenly accosted by five robbers who spoke Shanghai dialect mixed with broken Western languages, blocking their path. Two of the robbers brandished weapons and threatened them. The couple did not resist, and all their belongings were stolen. Afterward, the Westerner reported the incident to the local police station and requested an investigation.

(2) At a residence located at No. 33, Lane 272, Tongfu Road, at around 6:20 PM yesterday, while sixteen men and women were sitting at the table for dinner, four robbers suddenly broke in. All the robbers spoke the local dialect. Three of them were carrying firearms. Upon entering, all the men and women were unable to escape and were held captive. They were forced to hand over their valuables. The robbers searched for a long time before leaving and disappearing without a trace. After checking, a large amount of jewelry and cash was found to be missing. A detailed list of the stolen items was immediately filed with the police, requesting an investigation.

Fulu Shouxi Candy and Toy Bags

Weekly Translation Report Commemorative Issue

The Weekly Translation Report's firm stance and accurate commentary have long been recognized by the public. It is heard that the company is commemorating the second anniversary of the war of resistance, and has specially invited famous experts to write about the domestic and international situation and the various trends in Shanghai. Therefore, the length has been increased to five or seven pages (now published, special price is one dime and two cents per copy). The rich content is self-evident and is a great gift for relatives and friends. Recently, it has been heard that the company is temporarily suspending publication due to environmental pressures, which is a great loss to the Shanghai cultural community.

Educational News

### Interview with the Director of the Vocational Guidance Center: How Graduates Should Find Employment. Choose a Career Based on Strengths and Interests for Better Results

The Chinese Vocational Guidance Center holds guidance events for further education and employment every summer. This year, 26 people, including Chen Qingshi, have been hired as lecturers to give speeches at various schools. Since its establishment, many schools have sent letters to the center requesting lecturers to visit their schools, and many students have personally requested assistance. Director Zheng Wenhan told a Shanghai News Agency reporter the other day that "Graduating means unemployment" is a very popular saying among graduates of various schools today. Many people come to the center asking for job placement. However, it is extremely difficult to introduce jobs to middle school graduates from general subjects, especially junior high school graduates, who have not received specialized technical training. When asked what kind of job they would like to take, they often answer with the phrase "any job". From this answer, one can see their lack of purpose and central ideas. If, according to their answers, they are introduced to smaller shops such as shoe stores or food stores to work as trainees, they are unwilling. Therefore, middle school students who want someone to introduce them to a job should first ask themselves what their strengths are and what kind of job they are interested in. If they are good at writing, have good eloquence, and are interested in radio, they can ask someone to introduce them to clerk, salesperson, or radio company trainee positions. Choosing a career based on one's interests and strengths will often lead to better results.

### School News Roundup

Datong University: Datong University has hired Lu Jizeng as the secretary-general to preside over school affairs in Shanghai. Starting in the autumn semester of this year, it has decided to restore the research offices of history and geography in the College of Liberal Arts, strengthen the department of vocational education in the College of Education, and restore psychological experimental research and social education programs. The Colleges of Commerce and Law will jointly establish an economic research office. The College of Law will also set up a mock court for practical training for senior law students. The College of Science will add a brewing specialty, and the College of Commerce will add accounting and banking specialties.

China Vocational School: The China Vocational School, affiliated with the China Vocational Education Society, was founded in 1918 and has been in operation for 21 years. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the school moved its important machines to Chongqing to establish a new school and practice factory in Chongqing. Since the population was evacuated from Chongqing, the school has moved to the countryside to hold classes. However, problems such as the factory site and transportation are difficult to solve and are being worked on.

### Shanghai Should Change to a Transfer-Account Port

‚Äî I

Mr. I, not only a monetary expert but also currently holding an important position in the city's financial circles. As requested, his name will not be disclosed to the public. This article addresses the repeated restrictions on cash withdrawals and the reintroduction of the remittance system, aiming to eliminate the past abuses of remittance discounts. The transfer-account system has been in use for a long time in Ningbo, Shaoxing, and other places and has been found convenient and free of abuses. We hope that all sectors will pay attention and study it together to implement it effectively. If remittance notes bear a "transfer-account only" stamp, the loopholes for speculation in remittance discounts will be completely blocked. This will not only restore the parity between remittances and legal tender but also prevent capital flight and reduce the need for cash. Once the difference between remittances and cash disappears, and the movement of currency is limited to legitimate commercial transactions, prices can stabilize, and the foreign exchange market can calm down. However, how to improve the review system for legitimate foreign exchange needs and legitimate cash needs? How to prevent the foreign exchange and cash obtained from being used for other purposes? We hope that domestic experts will come together to study these issues. This newspaper will wholeheartedly provide this platform for open discussion. ‚Äì Editor

Shanghai has always been known as a "cash port." Since the August 13th Incident, remittances have only been allowed for interbank transfers and cannot be cashed out the next day. Thus, Shanghai's "cash port" has transformed into a "transfer-account" port. However, in reality, due to (1) the clearing house's ability to discount "remittances" and (2) the court's ruling that remittance notes are not considered valid payment for rent, the general consensus is to use legal tender as the standard for transactions. The use of legal tender as the standard accelerates capital flight and affects the foreign exchange market. Recently, the black market exchange rate has fallen from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence. New deposits after August 13th have been restricted to a withdrawal limit of 500 yuan in legal tender, causing panic and rumors. Given the current environment, regardless of the merits or demerits of previous policies and measures, it seems appropriate for the financial sector to seize the opportunity to transform Shanghai's financial market into a "transfer-account port" to (1) strengthen the credit of legal tender, (2) reduce the outflow of foreign exchange reserves, and (3) facilitate legitimate industrial and commercial transactions. There is no need to reinvent the wheel and agitate the public, which would only create opportunities for "Hua Xing." Here are some proposed measures for research:

(1) Starting from [Date], Shanghai will be a "transfer-account" port, and all payments will be made via "transfer-account." All notes will be stamped with a "transfer-account" stamp, allowing only interbank transfers and no cash withdrawals. Exceptions will be made for specific reasons where cash (legal tender) payment is specified.

(2) Deposits made before August 13th will be processed as usual. Deposits made after August 13th will be processed according to the Ministry of Finance's telegram, that is, 500 yuan of legal tender can be withdrawn per week. Payments exceeding the limit will be made with promissory notes stamped with "transfer-account only," allowing only "transfer-account."

(3) Bank accounts will be divided into cash (legal tender) accounts and "transfer-account" accounts. Deposits made with legal tender will be credited to the cash account and can be withdrawn in legal tender. Deposits made with "transfer-account notes" will be credited to the "transfer-account" account. Withdrawals will be made with "transfer-account" notes.

(4) Remittances from inland areas to Shanghai should be used to pay "transfer-account" notes as a principle.

(5) Bank "transfer-account" account deposits can be used for legitimate purposes such as wage payments, requiring legal tender. Applications can be made to the clearing house (assuming such an organization exists) to allocate legal tender without fees and should be provided as much as possible.

(6) "Transfer-account" notes will be legally recognized as valid payment and can be used for rent payments, etc.

(7) "Transfer-account" notes will be prohibited from private discounting for a fee. Such actions will not be legally protected and will be subject to legal sanctions.

(8) Existing remittance notes or remittance accounts will be converted to "transfer-account" notes or "transfer-account" accounts at the original clearing house price. The term "remittance" will no longer be used.

(9) Existing legal tender accounts, except for those opened before June 22nd, will be converted to transfer-account accounts.

At the same time, it is best to moderately extend the foreign exchange rates and provide foreign exchange in other locations. However, the supply should also be strictly limited to those with proof of necessity.

### Another Word on Suppressing Rice Prices

‚Äî Liu Zhizhi

Those in the rice business attribute the soaring rice prices in the city to the imbalance of supply and demand, extortion by certain parties, and manipulation by hoarders. The so-called supply and demand imbalance is due to the Japanese army's consumption in China, smuggling back to Japan, resale in South China and North China, and interception along the way, causing merchants to hold back and Shanghai to fall into a rice shortage. They cite reports of declining rice reserves in various periods as evidence. However, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the main rice-producing area in the country. In the past, it supplied the entire country. Now, due to transportation disruptions, even if the Japanese buy and re-export, the quantity should not be greater than in the past during times of free export and re-export. There is no doubt about that. Moreover, last year's rice harvest in Japan was abundant, and there were virtually no imports of Chinese rice according to its customs records. On the contrary, there was a large surplus of flour and other grains to China, indicating that a portion of the Japanese army's rations in China is still supplied from Japan. Furthermore, precisely because wartime freight is disrupted, Shanghai is the main outlet for the surplus rice production in the interior. Judging from reports in Japanese newspapers and magazines and the "economic tactics" of certain parties in the occupied areas, they are restoring the economy in the occupied areas as one of their strategies to control China. Therefore, while extortion during the transport of rice to Shanghai is undoubtedly a fact, the desire to export rice for sale is also a necessary means to carry out their China-controlling tactics, maintain the "finances" of the puppet regime, and absorb legal tender for the purpose of buying foreign exchange. Therefore, a ban on rice exports from the interior may exist, but it is clearly a temporary phenomenon used to coerce and achieve their extortion goals. If the Shanghai rice market adheres to the original price limit of 14 yuan, their extortion will inevitably stop there. Because they must export the surplus rice production. Relaxing the original price limit of 14 yuan to 15 yuan, and now accommodating market price increases by raising the limit price to 21 yuan again, is a major mistake. Once the price limit can be relaxed, extortion can be endless. This is tantamount to handing over the power to manipulate Shanghai's rice prices to certain parties! Considering today's rice reserves in Shanghai, although the announced reserves are reduced, the reserves of hoarders have increased. Regardless of whether "hoarders" and rice merchants are one and the same or two separate entities, the reason for the emergence of "hoarders" and their ability to "manipulate rice prices" lies in the failure to adhere to the original price limit. Furthermore, "hoarders" are also suppliers, so they have not fundamentally broken the supply-demand balance of rice in Shanghai. Therefore, rice merchants cannot shirk their responsibility for hoarding and driving up prices. Accommodating market price increases by raising the limit price to 21 yuan is also falling into a trap. In the spring of the ninth year of the Republic, the price limit for rice in Shanghai also reached a maximum of 21 yuan, but considering the differences in today's and past measurements, this newspaper has pointed out that today's limit price is actually more than three yuan higher than in the past. The sharp rise in rice prices in the spring of the nineteenth year was indeed due to a poor harvest the following year and a genuine imbalance in supply and demand, which is completely different from today's situation where reserves are abundant and sources are bound to be constant. We hope that the authorities can understand the difficulties of the people, make impartial corrections, and promote them with the administrative power of the concession. Otherwise, if the manipulator's plan is successful once, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not continue to do so, and the consequences will be endless. ‚Äì Editor

Since the Sino-Japanese War shifted west, Shanghai has become an "isolated island," and everything has become a special phenomenon. On the commercial front, on the one hand, the influx of refugees and the surge in consumption have created a superficial prosperity. On the other hand, the surrounding areas have become ruins, and production has decreased. Moreover, due to the occupation and the deliberate monopoly and obstruction by certain parties, the prices of native products, which are not affected by foreign exchange, have also risen. Among them, the recent surge in rice prices is even more worrying.

However, it is said that at least 2 million bags of rice are currently stockpiled in Shanghai (according to estimates by those familiar with the market situation). Moreover, the transport of rice to Shanghai from the interior has never stopped for a single day. Therefore, the city's rice supply is not a problem, at least for the time being. Given these facts, according to the principles of supply and demand, today's rice prices should be able to stand firm at the previously set price limit without any doubt. However, the opposite is actually the case. Shanghai's rice prices have jumped out of the original 14 yuan limit and broken the new 15 yuan limit. Now, they have soared to over 21 yuan, forcing the authorities of the two concessions and rice industry groups to set 21 yuan as the current price limit. What is the reason for this?

First: The failure of the price limit policy. The food organizations originally set the maximum price for white rice at 14 yuan per stone in the rice market and stipulated that transactions above the price limit were invalid, and even stipulated penalties. However, in reality, transactions were made outside the price limit. The price limit committee did not exercise its power to control the situation beforehand, nor could it guide the situation, or severely punish offenders afterward. As a result, the price surge began and has been unstoppable.

Second: The monopoly and increased levies by certain parties have increased the cost of transporting rice to Shanghai. This is the same situation as other native products such as broad beans.

Third: Panic in the market. After the Tianjin incident, certain parties threatened to take certain measures in Shanghai. People inevitably became agitated and rushed to buy rice, prompting a sharp rise in market prices.

Fourth: Manipulation by speculators. This is the same as speculation in other goods. Rice is a necessity of life for residents and is more easily exploited by them. This has undoubtedly contributed to the continued rise in rice prices.

These are the reasons for the rise in rice prices. Let us offer another word on how to suppress them.

First: Set a standard price and enforce it strictly. Although setting a price limit is passive, there is currently no more effective measure. However, before setting this price limit, all factors, such as inland rice prices and freight charges, must be considered to prevent merchants from making excuses again.

Second: Rice industry groups and the authorities of the two concessions should conduct strict supervision. Violators should be brought to justice. Rice industry groups should also maintain close contact with the authorities of the concession.

Third: Attention should also be paid to the smooth flow of supplies. Shanghai has more than 4 million mouths to feed, but it does not produce rice itself. It relies on supplies from the surrounding areas of Suzhou, Changzhou, Kunshan, Wuxi, and Wuhu. Therefore, opening up the sources of supply is very important.

Fourth: Conduct registration, thoroughly investigate hoarding households, and force them to sell.

### On the Issue of Copper Subsidiary Coins

‚Äî Chen Baorong

The Chinese Ministry of Finance, in view of the soaring copper prices overseas, has long prohibited the private export of copper coins. Shanghai, being located in an occupied area, is beyond the reach of the government's power. The Jianghai Customs, forced by the environment, is unable to enforce the order. Certain parties are deliberately disrupting finance and undermining monetary policy, hoping to affect the strength of the resistance war. Therefore, they spare no effort to raise prices to collect copper coins. Initially, they purchased copper coins from the Great Qing Guangxu period, which had thicker copper and higher purity. Then, they collected Republic of China copper coins and the one-cent new subsidiary coins. It is said that 250 old copper coins are worth 3 yuan in national currency, and 100 new subsidiary coins are worth 1.2 to 2 yuan in national currency. In general, unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, constantly search the market for large quantities, transport them to Hongkou, and then ship them overseas by certain parties. It is said that the annual private export volume often reaches as high as 50 million yuan. The Central Bank, forced to do so, has recently stopped transporting new subsidiary coins to Shanghai for replenishment. Therefore, the shortage of copper coins in this port has been a long-standing issue. However, the general public has not fully realized it. Recently, after the Shanghai Tram and Bus Company posted a notice announcing the shortage of copper coins, residents began to be alarmed. Those who did not hoard coins in the past are now treating them as scarce commodities. As a result, copper coins have completely disappeared from the market.

As a result of the lack of copper coins, general retail transactions have become almost impossible. The impact on the common people is particularly severe, as some stores have converted small denominations into larger ones, effectively raising prices. For example, daily necessities that originally cost 7 or 8 cents are now priced at 10 cents, nominally to avoid making change, but actually to take advantage of the situation. Not only that, but many stores have also begun to issue their own private notes. They arbitrarily write amounts on blank pieces of paper of varying sizes, even on the backs of discarded calendar pages, and stamp them with a store seal to be used in place of copper coins. However, because these notes are limited to use in one store, the scope is too narrow, and the circulation is not widespread. The New Gate Road and other city joint branches have now issued joint substitute coupons, which is a measure of expediency and is not to be condemned, but it is an illegal act after all. Even if there is a considerable reserve, there is no strict supervisory body: moreover, the notes are crudely made and easily counterfeited, leading to abuses. Therefore, the Central Bank has sent a telegram to Shanghai, stating that this self-printed substitute coupon is detrimental to the entire financial market and is not allowed to be issued. However, the British and French Concession public bus and tram companies, due to business needs, are now completely using tokens. The French Concession trams use two types of tokens, one-cent and two-cent, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations. They were issued on June 18th, with a validity period until the end of August. Although the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession does not refuse to use stamps and revenue stamps, it also issued tokens in two denominations, two-cent and three-cent, on the same day, made of thin cardboard, also with Chinese and English explanations. The company stipulates that these tokens can be used on the trams and can be redeemed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.

As for the small-denomination transactions in various industries throughout the city, the only common bargaining chips at present are stamps and revenue stamps. Stamps are the most common, while revenue stamps are less common. This proportional measure is quite legitimate, and it has eliminated many disputes in the market due to the lack of copper coins. However, they are more difficult to carry and are easily soiled, which is not convenient after all. However, before the authorities issue a formal remedy, it is still a way to tide over the crisis. Using stamps and revenue stamps as currency substitutes is not new and can be called an "ancient and universal practice." There are even stamps issued specifically for currency use in foreign countries.

Because stamps are substitutes for postage issued by the state, and coins are national commercial mediums. When there is a shortage of coins, using stamps as substitutes is theoretically the most reasonable. Usually, major companies with mail-order departments also have the practice of using stamps as currency to purchase goods, which is most commonly used in the cultural industry.

Before the establishment of the German Federal Empire, the northern and southern states each issued stamps independently. The design of these stamps had a clear Arabic numeral in the middle, and the background was painted with extremely delicate network patterns, which were used to exchange for coins, with the same effect as banknotes. Later, as Prussia became stronger and stronger, it was replaced by Prussian stamps, which are now rare German old stamps.

In the early days of the American Civil War, due to a lack of currency, stamps were also used as substitutes to tide over the emergency.

When the European War broke out in 1914, Russia was the first to be involved in the vortex. Due to a lack of currency, it also issued three types of stamps in 1915, 10 kopeks, 15 kopeks, and 20 kopeks, to replace currency. To consider practical convenience, these stamps were printed on thin cardboard with no glue on the back. It also had a sentence in Russian, which meant "This ticket is equal to the same value of silver coins."

Various industries throughout the city are now using stamps as change in business, and over time, they are gradually getting used to it. The panic situation is therefore not as serious as it was at the beginning. It was previously reported that the Central Bank would transport newly minted copper-nickel subsidiary coins from Kunming to Shanghai for replenishment, and they would arrive in Shanghai soon. If so, then the newly minted copper coins will encounter the same fate as the previous copper coins in Shanghai, disappearing without a trace. Is the Central Bank so foolish?

Although stamps are a temporary and legitimate common medium of exchange, it is hoped that the Ministry of Finance will issue a clear order to national banks to issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible for a permanent solution. Or, referring to the example of the Zhejiang Local Bank, the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library should be given the power to issue such fractional currency notes for a certain period. If the issue is not resolved for a long time, then the illegal substitute coupons issued by private individuals and others may damage the integrity of the current monetary system.

### Measures to Restrict Withdrawals Again

‚Äî Lin Yuesheng

To understand the Ministry of Finance's measures to restrict legal tender withdrawals for Shanghai depositors, one must first understand the reason why the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee stopped supplying the Shanghai black market with foreign exchange on the 7th of this month:

The existence of the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange originally contradicted our national policy. The Central Bank had already been ordered to implement foreign exchange controls and approval procedures, closing the road to illegal capital flight. The foreign exchange black market is not only a way for illegal capital to flee, but also a source for counterfeit currency to sell our legal tender for foreign exchange. First, Shanghai is an open port, and second, the government's exercise of power in Shanghai is currently subject to various restrictions. To eliminate the foreign exchange black market, it is almost impossible without the full cooperation of all friendly countries. Currently, the degree of cooperation between friendly countries and us is becoming increasingly close to the principle of foreign exchange control that is consistent with our national policy. The Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's decision to stop supplying the Shanghai black market with foreign exchange on the 7th of this month is one example of cooperation. The reason for this measure is nothing more than to curb Shanghai's unrestricted huge trade deficit and to prevent the use of Japanese and puppet currencies to buy our foreign exchange. This publication has repeatedly discussed this, so there is no need to elaborate further. Therefore, this new measure on foreign exchange is a necessary means of standing on the front line of automatic economic defense and is by no means a harbinger of currency system changes, as is thought by the short-sighted.

Now, let's further examine the impact of the foreign exchange contraction on the Shanghai market: first, the prices of purely foreign goods rise, then the prices of semi-national goods follow suit, and finally, even the prices of purely domestic goods take the opportunity to rise. Moreover, the upward trend does not distinguish between domestic and foreign goods, nor between luxury goods and daily necessities. For example, on June 6th, common glutinous rice in Changshu still only sold for 17.2 yuan per dan. Only ten days later, it had risen to around 22 yuan. The reason for this is that the sources of supply are abundant, and the reserves are also plentiful. Although the Tianjin incident caused some slight hoarding by the public, the main reason is that the floating capital in the market is flowing towards hoarding for speculation. These people who hold large amounts of floating capital are trying to take advantage of the foreign exchange price contraction to make a quick buck.

From the above, it can be seen that this sharp contraction in foreign exchange is a deliberate attempt by the government to raise the prices of foreign luxury goods to stop people from wasting money. At the same time, it does not want the prices of daily necessities to rise, thereby increasing the hardship of the people. However, in Shanghai, due to the disconnection of political power, the government's originally perfect policy has been exploited by unscrupulous merchants blinded by profit. To combat these unscrupulous merchants, the government has made this decision to restrict withdrawals again.

The Ministry of Finance's telegram roughly means that legal tender depositors are restricted to payments of more than 500 yuan per week. The excess can only be paid by interbank transfer. However, funds remitted to the interior are not subject to this restriction. A payment of 500 yuan in legal tender per week means that 2,000 yuan in legal tender can be used per month. This not only has no impact on the lives of general middle and lower-class depositors, but also does not cause any inconvenience to general stores. The only ones who are inconvenienced are speculators with large amounts of floating capital. Therefore, it isÊâìÂáªisÊâìÂáªthe ambition of speculators, not all of their wealth. In other words, if they use their funds for legitimate purposes, if they seek legitimate profits, then the path is very broad. The implementation of this measure will undoubtedly stabilize prices, thereby allowing the general wage-earning class to breathe a sigh of relief.

Look at the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's telegram, the black market gold price has fallen by more than 100 yuan, the US dollar has been extended by 1.625 yuan, and British exchange has grown to 7 pence. The foreign exchange that guarantees price increases has not contracted but has grown sharply. Is there any reason for prices to rise? Can unscrupulous merchants still misuse their floating capital to do evil? This wise measure can not only ÊâìÂáªthe ambition of unscrupulous merchants to hoard goods and speculate, but also prevent the escape of national funds.

### Review and Prospect of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Continued)

‚Äî Anshi

4. The Intensification of the Recent Currency War in Central China and Japan's Failure

Since the legal tender showed no signs of spontaneous collapse, and the "loving protection" by Japanese "friendly nations" only increased its status day by day, some people recently advocated for a "new currency establishment theory." They believed that the legal tender was merely an inconvertible paper currency managed by the government. However, the reason why the people of Central China still trusted it was that there was no new currency sufficient to replace its circulation.

But how easy is it to issue a new currency to replace the legal tender? The legal tender can not only be used to buy foreign exchange, but also has no inflationary tendencies, making it hundreds of times better than any yarn coupon in the yen bloc, which cannot be exchanged for foreign exchange and is undergoing malignant inflation. Therefore, to defeat the legal tender, the new currency issued must have real value or be directly convertible into foreign exchange. However, this is not an easy task, and Japanese scholars and politicians have various different opinions on this:

Silver Coin Revival Theory

Initially, they focused on the fact that the legal tender could not be exchanged for silver and advocated for the revival of silver coins. This was because silver was nationalized, and a large amount of private silver was hidden among the people in China. According to statistics from some Japanese scholars, before the implementation of the legal tender system, China stored 285 million yuan of silver. During the implementation of the legal tender, 100 million yuan was exported overseas by the National Government, so there are still 185 million yuan of silver stored in China. In addition, Japan also has a considerable amount of silver in reserve. Based on these two, if a portion of the silver coins are issued in Central China first, the silver hidden in the interior of China will inevitably appear on the market. On the one hand, this will drive out the inconvertible legal tender, and on the other hand, it can please the United States, as this move will greatly benefit the US silver policy, they said.

Unfortunately, this free calculation has failed again.

First, the amount of silver currently hidden in the interior of China may not be as much as that. Some Japanese scholars estimate it to be only about 50 million yuan.

Second, most of the hidden silver in the occupied areas has already been dug up and transported away by the Japanese, so where does this large amount of silver come from?

Third, the Japanese military force in the occupied areas is only at points and lines. For the vast guerrilla areas, the Japanese cannot make the hidden silver appear in society.

Fourth, even if silver coins are in circulation, it is absolutely impossible to make the hidden silver appear on the market in a short period of time. During World War I, China's silver was over-exported, resulting in a severe shortage of silver in major financial cities and an abnormal surge in interest rates. However, the hidden silver in the interior of China did not immediately flow out because of this. It only appeared on the market after a year or two: this is one proof. Moreover, during this time of war, it is even more impossible to flow out.

Fifth, in addition, the international relations in Central China are extremely complex, and it is difficult to guarantee that there is no risk of outflow. If strict and solid control is imposed to prohibit its outflow, it will also affect the value and effect of the silver coins themselves.

Sixth, as for trying to please the United States with this, the price paid is too small.

Seventh, finally, it should be noted that if the silver coin revival policy in Central China succeeds, not only the legal tender will be driven out, but also the Japanese yen and military scrip, which will accelerate the deterioration of inflation in Japan itself. (To be continued)

Commercial News

### Domestic Sales of Woolen Fabrics

‚Äî Tang Jun

Shanghai is undoubtedly a commercial center in our country. Whether it is export or import, most of them pass through here. Large quantities of our domestic raw materials and goods are transported to foreign countries, or large quantities of goods are ordered from foreign countries and then transported to other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, it is correct to say that Shanghai's commerce is the hub of our national industry and commerce.

The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai is naturally also regarded as the hub of our national woolen fabric industry! This can be proved by looking at the marketing situation of the woolen fabric industry in Shanghai for decades. In the past, most woolen fabric firms not only supplied the needs of consumers in the city, but also adjusted the needs of many other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, in the annual business figures of many woolen fabric firms, transactions with other ports accounted for half; when transportation and transportation were convenient, it would exceed this proportion. The marketing areas include Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Yantai, Jinan, etc. in North China; before the September 18th Incident, Liaoning, such as Shenyang and Yingkou, also had sales; in Central and South China, it was even wider, such as Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Guilin, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Shantou, etc., with busy transactions every year, and Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, Hankou and other places had huge annual sales. The "January 28th" war gave a great blow to the sales of other ports! At that time, it was not only the woolen fabric industry, but also other industries such as hardware and cotton yarn, which also encountered the same situation! However, because the war ended soon, the woolen fabric industry and other industries generally resumed sales in other ports, and the situation did not decline much.

But finally, the all-out war of resistance against Japan on "August 13th" suddenly broke out in Shanghai! At that time, the woolen fabric industry was in the winter business season. Although Pingjin was in a state of tension, customers from Qinghan were coming to pick up goods one after another, so they had to suspend purchases; with the fierce progress of the war, in early September, even the sales of woolen fabrics in the city were stagnant! Many store employees also returned to their hometowns to avoid the war. By early December, when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the woolen fabric industry and other businesses generally started business, and sales in other ports were now completely absent, and many post offices were also closed, making transportation impossible; sales in the city were also extremely sluggish. During this period, the woolen fabric industry can only be said to be maintaining the store, and everyone was organizing their business after being frightened. In the following year, the postal transport on the Jinpu Line in Pingjinqing and other places was restored, and some goods were often distributed in North China; but no longer like before the war, they were loaded and sold in whole bolts and boxes, but only a few yards and sets, etc.; however, at that time, sales in Hankou and Wuchang suddenly became active: This was because our all-out war had expanded to the inner line of the Yangtze River, which created the abnormal prosperity of Wuhan. Some woolen fabric firms in Shanghai sent people to Wuhan via Ningbo and Wenzhou to "sit in" and try their best to supply spring and summer goods, so the domestic sales of the woolen fabric industry at that time almost became one-sided - to Wuhan. But finally, at the end of summer, Wuhan fell again, and sales in Wuhan disappeared again!

Since then, the domestic sales of woolen fabrics have become stagnant; now the postal transport in North China has almost been restored, and a few customers from Pingjinqinghan and other places have also come to Shanghai to pick up goods this spring; but the quantity has been reduced to half of that before the war, and Wuhan and other places are strictly sealed off by the Yangtze River, and sales are even more unpredictable. They all unanimously declared that British and American goods will soon have no place in North China and the Yangtze River! This is of course the inevitable result of being squeezed out. The future of domestic sales of woolen fabrics will certainly not escape this tragic fate!

### Finance  Rumors are Difficult to Dissipate, Cash Continues to Prosper, Unofficial Price Reaches 2,570 Yuan, Money Exchange Stores Collect 50-60 Taels

Yesterday, the cash market was sluggish due to the weekly holiday, so the outside market was difficult to dissipate due to certain rumors, and the gold price at noon on the previous day was more than 110 yuan lower than the black market US dollar exchange rate, so the industry was eager to prosper and was willing to buy at a high price, and the market was strong. According to unofficial prices, it has risen to 2,570 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan from the closing price at noon the day before yesterday, with few transactions. It is said that only money exchange stores collected 50-60 taels from the storefronts, but the selling price of money exchange stores was 2,580 yuan. The price of gold jewelry per tael was unchanged due to the holiday. Da Tong Hang still suspended the original price of 158 yuan, Xin Tong Hang was 256 yuan, and the purchase price was 148 yuan. Also, according to the London telegram on the 24th, British pure gold remained unchanged, and each ounce was still 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence.

### British Indian Silver Prices Rise Again

According to a London telegram on the 24th, a large bar of silver was bought by Indian seats, and there was a shortage of supply. The near and far months were increased by 1.875, and a small number of speculators sold out. Buyers were satisfied, and the market was flat. Also, according to the New York telegram, the spot price of American silver remained unchanged. According to the Bombay telegram, the spot price of Indian silver and the July futures both increased by two annas, and the August futures increased by five annas. The market situation is quite stable.

### Food  National Rice Weak in the Morning and Firm at Noon

Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Hebei still had no arrival. There were only 1,600 to 1,700 steamed buns. The market opened early, and the situation was still relaxed. However, until noon, the stores in this street were quite active, and there were also sales of inland gangs, so the market color recovered and became tight. As a result, the early and late markets were equal, which became a fixed situation. The quotations for thick and thin japonica rice and Duyang sharp rice remained unchanged.

### On "Strategy" in the Literary World

‚Äî Tu Lao

Recently, a bookstore published a book specializing in the skills of lawyers. I only saw the advertisement in the newspaper, which said that the book is "a collection of the great achievements of lawyers' strategies, and is sufficient to assist literary writers."

This seems a bit strange, so I couldn't help but think about it.

In the past society, lawyers were indeed a class that relied on "strategy" to make a living. Their strategies were used not only in lawsuits, that is, using words to frame and slander, but also in practical plans. They could bribe officials, collude with gangsters, forge evidence, create rumors, and do other more terrible things.

However, since the advertisement says that it is "sufficient to assist literary writers," of course, the book only talks about "strategy" in words. There have also been special books on this aspect before, but most of them do not say the key to "strategy." This is still the old problem of the Chinese, everything must be "secret" to be suitable. However, in general, the key is always no more than two: the first is to give people nicknames, and the second is to talk about motives in everything.

Nickname is the so-called nickname. The method is: before writing out the crimes of the person being accused, first put a nickname on the name, such as "Giant-eyed Tai Sui" or "Big-headed Overlord," meaning that when officials see the name, they will first determine that he is not a good thing. "Motive" is a modern word, and the former term was called "intention." The method is: if the person being accused has one or two good deeds that everyone knows, it is said that his intention is to seek fame or fortune. In short, good is also bad, or even worse than the obvious bad. This trick is often used in counter-accusations.

But now the question is, what is the use of these "strategies" for "literary writers"? - In fact, in my opinion, the person who compiled the book really wasted his time, because some of our literary writers have already learned these "strategies."

If you don't believe it, you might as well check the old and new accounts in the literary world. The "nickname school" has been popular for a period of time, and the "intention school" has been popular all the time, and it has not declined yet. And the most common thing is that when you are criticized to the point where you have no way out, you suddenly become an X-ray and say that you can see the "motive" of the critic. This is exactly the trick of the counter-accusation.

However, according to experience, this kind of lawyer's writing style really cannot "help" "literary writers." Although the "nickname school" has been popular, it has disappeared without a trace. The reason is: since you have hung the sign of a "literary writer," you always have to take care of the "face" of the article and are unwilling to give the other party nicknames such as "Giant-eyed Tai Sui" or "Big-headed Overlord," and in fact the other party is also a literary writer, and can never be bad to the point of "Tai Sui" or "Overlord," so the nicknames can only be limited to "individualist" or "pessimist." But this is really too broad. The person who receives it does not feel attacked, and the person who hears it feels very ordinary, so it is finished as soon as it is written out, and the effect is not obtained at all. The "intention school" has been maintained for a relatively long time, but in the end it still doesn't work. For example, when a writer is defending himself, he can say that the person who criticizes him is "seeking something unsuccessful" or "taking private revenge." This seems moving, but in fact it is difficult to attract the attention of a third party. Because since you are a writer, the main thing is of course the words, and everyone only looks at whether the critic's criticism of your words is correct. After all, the intention is difficult to grasp, and there is really no need to care about such a bird thing. Moreover, this will also make you lose your dignity, and the reader will suspect that you and the critic are of different genders, and that one has asked you for something that has not been achieved, so you come to "retaliate." - This is called tricking yourself.

Therefore, no matter how brilliant the lawyer's writing style is, literary writers really cannot benefit from it.

As for the actual "strategy" outside of words, some of our literary writers seem to have tried it a bit, but the effect is also very limited. The reason is very simple: after all, the literary world is not a government office. After playing around, in the end, it will always be exposed.

If you can reject the "strategy" of the lawyer style, literary writers may have some hope.

### Burning Red Chain Snake (1)

‚Äî Ming Zhi

‚Äî‚ÄîGrandma's Story‚Äî‚Äî

Due to Qian Asen's notification, the threshing ground was busy for a while. Qian Asen said that Li Yugen told him last night, "They" will go to the countryside to "search" today and will pass through here.

Captain Wang Yuan was leading us to thresh wheat at Grandma's house. When he heard this news, he gathered us to discuss countermeasures. Because "they" were very numerous, about eighty or ninety, we decided according to custom not to confront "them" directly and temporarily dispersed to Qinshan in the back.

"Okay," Grandma said, wiping the sweat from her forehead, "you go, I'll take care of everything here. When they come and go, you can go down the mountain and come back."

"How can we know when "they" come and go?" Captain Wang asked.

"You just need to see smoke rising from the ground here, that means "they" are coming; when the smoke stops, that means "they" are leaving." She also said to her son and daughter-in-law, "You also go, just let A Ming accompany me." A Ming is her grandson.

While Captain Wang was supervising us to pack up in the house, Grandma's family and Qian Asen were all carrying wheat husks and broken wheat stalks to the southwest corner of the ground and piling them up.

We went up the mountain, Qian Asen also returned to Qingzhen, and only Grandma and A Ming were left on the ground.

We put sentries at the foot of the mountain, and most of the people hid in the woods on the hillside. Everyone was holding their weapons and preparing for "them" to rush up.

Li Jingen met "them" not far from leaving Wangjia Village. After being interrogated, searched, and beaten by "them," there were no other accidents.

When Grandma saw "them" gradually entering the village, she went to light the wheat husk pile and let it simmer. It seemed that someone inside "them" was giving orders, and for this small village, "they" also had to fulfill the responsibility of going to the countryside. So a small part of the people entered the house to "search," and most of the people sat down under the tree to rest.

"Hey, old woman," a man in white cloth shorts shouted at Grandma, "you come over, I want to ask you."

Grandma walked over with a flail in her hand, and A Ming followed behind her. They both looked very calm, and it seemed that even if someone entered their house, it was not worth their attention.

"What's the matter?" Grandma wiped the sweat from her clothes.

"Are there any Yunji teams here?"

""Oil Salt Beans" are fried in every house."

"It's not some "bean." I'm asking if there are any bandits here."

"There have never been any bandits here, only robbers from outside."

"Where are the robbers?"

"They don't live here, they come and go."

"What do they rob?"

"They take whatever they see, and even people."

She chatted with that person for a while, and seeing that there was nothing going on, she went back to threshing wheat.

The people who went into the house to "search" did not come out, and several more people went in. The man in white cloth shorts seemed a little bored, so he stood up and looked around. He saw the simmering pile of wheat husks and shouted at Grandma again:

"Hey, old woman, you come over, I still want to ask you."

Grandma pretended not to hear and ignored him.

"Hey, old woman, what are you burning there?" He walked over, looking somewhat kind.

Grandma said loudly: "I'm burning red chain snakes there!"

"Red chain snakes? Where did the red chain snakes come from?" He clearly wanted to find something to talk about.

"I don't know where the red chain snakes came from!" Grandma put down the flail and said, "But they are not local, because there have never been any here. They have only been discovered recently."

"Are they big?" He was obviously like most people, and liked to talk about snakes.

"How can they not be big; the big ones are like arms, and the small ones are like fingers."

"Are there many?"

"How can there not be many; sometimes there are dozens, sometimes there are one or two. They often come. It is said that in some places, thousands and thousands have been discovered!"

"Has anyone been bitten to death?"

### An Impressionistic Journey (Continued)

‚Äî Li Jinming

The little monk called us to drink tea, eat some porridge, and borrowed three padded kasayas to put on. The morning was indeed cold, and the wind was strong. The eastern area still only had a hint of silvery white.

Along the road leading further up, a hundred steps or so, and then turning east, I discovered a platform that was slightly decorated and built, facing the eastern mountain ridge. We walked up to it, wrapped ourselves tightly in the kasayas, and huddled in the stone pavilion, waiting for the appearance of the morning glow.

This is truly a meaningless, boring task for scholars. Perhaps a god will emerge from the scene of the rising sun, sprinkling a few drops of immortal dew on them? I was first misled by this amazing agitation to come to the mountain, but immediately discovered the ordinariness of the event - in our hometown... Furong Village, Jiufeng Pass, Banzhu Ao, Xiaoxia Mountain and other small areas, you can appreciate the same type of scene. The slight difference is that Mount Heng is higher, the dew is thicker, because the scenery is covered by fog, and the glow seems more illusory, and the surroundings of the rising sun seem more chaotic and mysterious. This is not unusual. However, as a thrilling object for gentlemen and ladies who do not leave the capital, it can be somewhat justified.

I persuaded the two Pengs not to linger any longer. Coming down the platform, we went nearby to take a look at the Shengdi Temple, which stands on the highest peak.

Shengdi Temple is a desolate, isolated stone house, built on a pile of stacked boulders. The pillars are stone, the ground is stone, the walls are also stone, and almost the only monk inside is as cold and lifeless as a stone. He does not meditate, nor does he chant scriptures, nor does he take care of guests, but just sits silently by the door, staring blankly at the ground, holding wooden beads in his hand.

Ten

We returned to the foot of the mountain via West Ma Road.

Passing by the Sutra Depository, we spent half an hour loitering and chatted with a monk from Hubei. The construction of the Sutra Depository is still new, and the books on display are also recent versions, but there is not a single one who understands the scriptures. The Hubei monk claimed to be "nurturing his nature," and it turned out that he did not even understand the birth and calendar of Shakyamuni.

Passing by the Mirror Terrace, we discovered some empty houses nearby. According to passers-by, it was Zhang Xueliang's secluded residence. Several people with box cannons were standing at the door, telling us that we could not enter this place.

What we passed by later were some mountainous areas with lush trees, some temples, villas, and schools. Because we were rushing for the 1:00 pm bus, we did not stay any longer. Hastily, like this article, it ended. I don't want to transcribe and describe anything rigidly, I just need to say these short impressions. (End)

### I Want to Wake Up

‚Äî Jun Bo

I am lonely, I live in a lonely dream every day. I am used to using the pen of thought to paint a beautiful picture.

Dreams are my familiar companions, and I have never been frustrated in a dream. When I feel sad, or a little depressed, then I will lock my breath in the deep valley of sweet dreams, and wait quietly for that warm hand to wipe away a piece of autumn in my heart.

Dreams are lonely, and I have had many lonely dreams. Sometimes I feel tired after pain, so I might as well drink a glass of lonely wine. Watching the water droplets on the eaves; listening to the subtle wind passing over the maple tips in the courtyard; I begin to imagine many golden stories, and then fall into a lonely dream. I see my shadow accompanied by the laughter of the past; perhaps I still touch the lost warmth. No curses; no resentment; I hold the memory of dreams tightly, and there is lonely joy in dreams.

Towards the vast horizon, I call for the years that have passed. My heart is painful. Unintentionally waving my hand, borrowing the wings of the sky goose, I grope and fly to the road in my dream again. "There are no years in dreams," and I laugh lonely again. Laughter is lonely, who accompanies it? Except for the water droplets on the eaves, the subtle wind in the courtyard.

So, I cried in pain. The heart that had been defiled by dreams suddenly became cold again. Rubbing my eyes, I said, "Dreams are empty, aren't they just a fleeting illusion?"

Reaching out to embrace the vast world, I don't want to dream anymore. The sadness after dreams is enough to torture me. I will quickly take advantage of the flames of war in this reality, muster up a healthy spirit, and bathe in the storms of the times.

Really, I want to wake up, and never pursue that golden lie again!

### A Song in Sickness

‚Äî Guo Nidi

The sword at the head of the bed is whistling;

My love!

Unsheathe it for me! Sword,

In the past you were painted with

Glorious pages of history;

But over the years

Let mottled rust bloom

And remain unheard!

Having experienced so many melancholic winds and rains,

Now, you are finally uneasy with

The coldness of the past,

Breaking out and whistling!

(And I am uneasy with

The cramped bed!)

You are shooting with a chilling cold light,

I will rise up because of you!

I often compare myself to

An Arab of the Middle Ages,

A disciple of Muhammad:

One hand holding the scriptures,

The other hand holding you!

You are already my indispensable companion,

I want to wear you,

And ride to the distance!

Tonight, the blood of ancestors

Is boiling fiercely throughout my body!

Shouting the names of the haters,

Crying and laughing come with it!

My love,

Unsheathe it for me;

The sword at the head of the bed is whistling!

### Talk More

‚Äî Editor

This journal refuses to start "pen wars" with other journals, and it has been stated repeatedly. However, this journal also refuses to "speak out for justice" or "defend injustice" after reading the "pen wars" between other journals. This is not out of fear, but I always feel that "pen wars" at this time will disrupt the pace of unity against the outside world, and besides, what is being fought for is often the emotional impulses of one or two people. Mr. Ting Lihei's article is very good, so I have to reluctantly give it up. If you want to return it, please notify me and I will do so immediately.

### Four-Year-Old Prodigy‚Äôs Tiger Calligraphy

Zhou Yunqing, a child from Fuyang, is the fifth-generation grandson of Observer Yun Gao. From the time he was in swaddling clothes, he enjoyed looking at characters. This year he is only four years old, yet he truly loves brushes and ink. He spends his days drawing and scribbling, often drawing bricks and writing characters as a form of play. During the Dragon Boat Festival, his grandfather, Yun Sun, instructed him to write the characters for "vermilion tiger." A large piece of paper was laid out on the table, and the child was made to stand on the table. He began writing with the brush as if divinely inspired, producing several sheets of calligraphy and signing his name. The event became a popular topic of conversation among relatives and friends, and the name of the child prodigy spread widely! His calligraphy has already been appreciated by Magistrate Yao of Fuyang and sent to Hangzhou to be engraved by craftsmen. From the time the "Moon" was called until now, the number of plaques and couplets written for officials and gentry in Hangzhou, Fuyang, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is countless.

Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee Inaugural Special Issue
‚Äî Yuan Xilian

### General Overview and Humble Opinion of This Association

‚Äî Gu Kemin

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recognizing that the summer season is approaching and that diseases are easily spread, and that the health issues of refugees urgently need to be resolved, convened a meeting on the sixth of this month with the five associations of physicians, new medicines, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical groups, and pharmacies, as well as the Chinese Federation, YMCA, Jingwu Athletic Association, Silver and Money Industry Association, and other groups to discuss solutions. Representatives present included Ye Zhisheng, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Xiangsun, Gao Peiliang, Sun Yuancheng, Zhou Shiluo, Zhou Mengbai, Zhu Yuquan, Tu Kaizheng, Fang Zuyin, Ying Tianhe, Huang Weiqing, Chen Guili, Zhu Hegao, Yu Yongsui, Chen Minghua, Gao Ziwen, Li Kangnian, Qiu Yanling, Tao Ran, Cen Zhiliang, and myself, along with Mr. Fang Jiaobo, Mr. Xi Yushu, and Mr. Jiang Shangfeng from the association. All agreed that the three major issues of clothing, food, and shelter for the refugees gathered in Shanghai have been somewhat maintained through the generous donations of people from all walks of life. However, if cholera and other epidemic diseases were to break out due to unsanitary living conditions, it would be a disaster. If precautions are not taken, the harm would be unimaginable. Therefore, it was proposed that the various groups jointly establish a Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee to solicit donations for use in prevention and treatment. It was decided to hold an inaugural meeting on the twelfth. At the meeting, chaired by Mr. Fang Jiaobo, eight articles of the organizational outline for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee were adopted, with the aim of assisting the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in fundraising for health expenses. The goal is to raise 50,000 yuan. For every yuan donated, in addition to issuing a receipt, a "Philanthropy Medal" will be awarded. Various groups will be responsible for fundraising. Starting from the 26th of this month, one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and twenty-five to thirty-five executive committee members, an unlimited number of committee members, several advisory committee members, one general secretary, and two deputy general secretaries will be elected. I was nominated as chairman, but considering my lack of talent and knowledge, I felt unqualified and immediately declined. However, the committee members argued that this is a charitable cause, and being nominated as chairman is a voluntary position, so I should not decline but accept the responsibility. Persuaded by their arguments and sense of duty, I had to withdraw my declination and follow the gentlemen in their efforts. Consequently, two executive committee meetings and one cadre meeting were held within three days, the 17th, 19th, and 20th. Nine articles of incentive measures were adopted, and it was decided that fundraising methods should be tailored to each participating group and implemented accordingly. The set donation amount is the minimum, and more is always welcome. It was also proposed to the association that the health funds raised by this committee should not be exclusively used for refugees in shelters but should also be used to treat poor citizens suffering from epidemic diseases, regardless of their origin, to prevent further spread. Furthermore, prominent figures from all walks of life, known for their enthusiasm for public welfare and good reputation, were invited to serve as advisory committee members to provide guidance and make up for any shortcomings. On the occasion of launching this special fundraising issue today, I have briefly described the past events of this committee and my willingness to follow the gentlemen and advocate for this cause, despite my limited abilities. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the potential for epidemic diseases and the urgent need for prevention, and generously donate to support this charitable cause and accumulate blessings.

### Declaration of This Association

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee is jointly formed by ten groups, including the Physicians' Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the New Medicine Industry Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry Association, the Chinese Federation, the Tongle Association, the Jingwu Athletic Association, the YMCA, and the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Friendship Association. It was established on the twelfth of this month, adopted its organizational outline, elected committee members, and assigned them to their respective tasks to work together. This is because epidemics are prone to occur during the summer season, and it is necessary to take preventive measures. Refugees in shelters in this city should be given special attention, and the residents of the two concessions, which number up to four or five million, have seen an unprecedented surge in population. Due to the shortage of housing, many are crammed into small rooms. In this hot weather, epidemics are inevitable and should be prevented and treated equally. Therefore, for the sake of preparedness, the city's health matters must be planned comprehensively and the scope expanded. Health facilities, including the purchase of necessary medicines and the establishment of more temporary epidemic hospitals, are the main priorities, and raising funds is the most urgent task. This is the reason for organizing the Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee.

We believe that preventing disasters and alleviating suffering is a public good that benefits the community, and that donating generously to help those in need is a manifestation of our shared conscience. We hope that everyone will contribute enthusiastically and support this charitable cause, so that relief efforts can be completed. This will not only benefit the poor and needy but also ensure the peace and safety of all residents. This declaration is hereby issued for your consideration.

### We Should Pay Attention to the Hygiene of the Entire Society

‚Äî Yuan Hesong

Summer has arrived, and summer is the season for epidemic diseases.

In previous years, the Shanghai epidemics would always rage to the point where several epidemic hospitals were overwhelmed; now, after the war and with a surge in population in the small concessions, epidemics and other diseases are bound to be more rampant than in previous years, and this is predictable.

The demons of epidemics and other diseases certainly do not discriminate by class, and they will trouble the rich and poor alike; however, the fact is that the wealthy class suffers less from epidemics than the poor class. The reason is that the wealthy class can afford to pay attention to hygiene, live in spacious houses, and eat clean food, so the demons of disease have no chance to invade; while the poor class lives in overcrowded conditions and eats only to fill their stomachs. Material conditions limit them, and they cannot afford to pay attention to hygiene, so the demons of disease often have the opportunity to invade. However, on the current isolated island, the cost of living is rising day by day, and it is already difficult for the poor to make a living. If they unfortunately fall ill, where will they find the money for treatment? Therefore, the Relief Association and the enthusiastic people from various groups, with their compassionate and altruistic hearts, launched a campaign to raise health funds to help patients who cannot afford medical expenses, which is a truly urgent and meaningful endeavor.

It is well known that people with the means to donate to charity are doing a benevolent and righteous act that benefits others and the world, so at this time, everyone should generously donate and participate in this great cause; however, I believe that when we are able to donate to charity, it is not only benefiting others but also benefiting ourselves, and I can give an example.

There was a student who, after returning from studying abroad, had fully adopted a Western lifestyle and was very particular about hygiene. He thought the air in the city was not as good as in the suburbs, so he built a Western-style house in the suburbs. The structure of the house was not only exquisite but also equipped with hygienic facilities everywhere, with windows all around, screens installed, flush toilets, porcelain bathtubs, and gutters around the house, which were often sprinkled with disinfectant. However, he later fell ill, and his family members were often sick. The reason was that although his Western-style house and his family were particular about hygiene, the people around him were not, and the stench of fertilizer from the fields and people's irrigation would ruthlessly permeate his Western-style house, and the microorganisms could not be stopped by the screens.

From this example, we can see that it is useless to try to live well if the environment is not good. We must first pay attention to the hygiene of the entire society so that we are not affected. Therefore, as the saying goes, "Saving others is saving yourself." Therefore, in addition to acting with a compassionate heart and having those with the means donate money to engage in this relief effort, we should also understand that saving others is saving ourselves, and donate even more generously to cope with this season of epidemic diseases, so that this season of epidemic diseases can pass peacefully and that all people on this isolated island can survive this dangerous season!

### Motivation and Purpose

‚Äî Xi Yushu

Shanghai is the premier commercial port in China, with a dense population. Since the war, the number of people fleeing to Shanghai from war zones has been incessant, and the population has increased dramatically. As many as 4.5 million people live in just a few square kilometers in the central and western districts of the French Concession and the Public Concession, setting an unprecedented record for population density in cities around the world. In normal times, there are more than 250 deaths per day, so the establishment of funeral homes, although sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a rain, is still insufficient. As for the number of sick people, it is even more alarming. The overcrowding of hospitals gives us a general idea. Now that summer has arrived, if we do not plan ahead for such a large population, once an epidemic breaks out, the sick will have no way to seek medical treatment, deaths will inevitably increase, and transmission will be even more difficult to prevent. If a virulent epidemic breaks out, thousands of people will die every day, which is by no means unexpected. How frightening it is! The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, aware of this, is specifically raising health funds to purchase more medicines and medical equipment, establish more clinics, achieve the effect of prevention and treatment, reduce mortality, protect the health of refugees, and ensure the safety of residents. This is indeed an urgent task that responds to the needs of the time. We believe that there is no shortage of virtuous gentlemen in Shanghai who will enthusiastically support this charitable cause.

### Incentives for Donations

(1) For every one yuan donated in legal tender, a Philanthropy Medal will be awarded.

(2) For those who donate 100 yuan or more in legal tender, a pair of eyeglass frames from the chairman of the association will be given.

(3) For those who donate 300 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given.

(4) For those who donate 500 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given, plus a complete set of couplets handwritten by the chairman of the association.

(6) For those who raise 200 yuan or more in legal tender, a pair of eyeglass frames from the chairman of the association will be given.

(7) For those who raise 500 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given.

(8) For those who raise 1,000 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given, plus a complete set of couplets handwritten by the chairman of the association.

(9) For those who raise 2,000 yuan or more in legal tender, a plaque from the association will be given.

### A Word for Those Who Donate to the Health of Fellow Citizens

‚Äî Ye Chunhua

After the Lugouqiao Incident, charitable organizations in this city arose to organize refugee relief agencies. Subsequently, as the situation on the ground became increasingly tense, in order to concentrate relief efforts and unify the management of the agencies, the charitable organizations jointly formed the Shanghai Relief Committee, first in Renji Hall and then in Pudong Building, to handle all relief matters. Initially, five refugee camps were established to accommodate more than 500 refugees. Later, as the war zone gradually expanded and the number of refugees increased, almost all schools, playgrounds, agencies, and temples were used as camps, but the number of refugees reached hundreds of thousands, so there was still a shortage of space. Therefore, a way was found to send some of them back to their hometowns.

In the past, regarding the health problems of refugees, the initial measures were nothing more than setting up medical teams in each camp. If diseases were discovered, minor cases were treated by volunteer doctors, and serious cases were sent to refugee hospitals. At the same time, the refugees' physical condition was checked to prevent the spread of disease. The health authorities of both concessions also sent doctors to each camp to vaccinate the refugees and administer vaccinations. If someone died of illness, a burial team was formed to coffin and bury the body. In short, the philanthropists of this city have done their best to care for the refugees from birth to death, recognizing the necessity of solidarity in the entire society.

Recently, the Refugee Relief Association has also established a Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee, with the aim of raising 50,000 to 100,000 yuan for health expenses. There are currently more than 4 million residents in Shanghai, so this small amount should not be difficult to raise. The motivation of those who donate generously is humane, and I know that this undertaking will surely be completed soon.

There are more than 70,000 refugees, which is not a small number. If an epidemic were to break out and spread to the public, it would not be good for the people of Shanghai. Therefore, rather than waiting to be overwhelmed, it is better to pool our resources and efforts to benefit ourselves and others. There is no shortage of benevolent people in Shanghai, and I hope that they will take the lead and make this righteous cause a success, which would not only be a blessing for the more than 70,000 refugees but also for the more than 4 million citizens.

### A Three-Hour Tour of Zhabei

‚Äî Bo Ming

Within sight of the foreign concessions of Shanghai, once densely populated with a million people, but now filled with scorched wood and dilapidated walls, lies Zhabei, which fell on October 27th, a few days before the Chinese army abandoned the Shanghai area two years ago. Counting on our fingers, the Japanese have occupied the area for nineteen months. In theory, they could have implemented their ambitious and widely publicized plans for municipal improvement and economic development.

A few days ago, I returned to Zhabei and lingered for several hours. The scene that met my eyes was even more depressing than what I saw during my last visit to Zhabei on a gloomy winter day two years ago. At that time, the portion of the public concession occupied by the Japanese army and Zhabei were almost indistinguishable because both areas were desolate and permeated with the aura of death. Now, however, the bustling liveliness of the public concession and the deathly silence of Zhabei have become a stark contrast.

In the nineteen months since the fall of Zhabei, the Japanese have not begun to change its scarred appearance. The shell craters of that time still dot the rubble-strewn streets. Walls riddled with machine-gun fire like beehives still stand by the roadside, teetering precariously. The Chinese army's fortifications still exist, but the sandbags are slightly damaged. Peering through the half-closed doorways, one can see straight through to the street.

The Commercial Press's million-dollar factory has one wall leaning outward towards the nearby trench. The factory is surrounded by barbed wire. The tank traps in front have been filled in to allow military trucks to occasionally pass through. Baoshan Road, which was commercially bustling and crowded with pedestrians two years ago, now reminds one of a ghost market, except that the ghost market does not have shell holes on the sidewalks.

The North Railway Station, which has been destroyed twice by the Japanese aggressors in five years, has been rebuilt. However, foreign eyes cannot glimpse its secrets because it is now surrounded by high concrete walls, electrified fences, and barbed-wire obstacles. Facing the public concession, there is also a brand-new concrete underground bunker, which is used for unforeseen circumstances. Only one entrance is left for entering and exiting the North Station. Stern-faced Japanese military police stand there, carefully watching the frightened Chinese taking the train.

I recalled that in October two years ago, from a dilapidated house on the boundary road of the concession, I looked at the North Station a hundred yards away. I saw Japanese planes lazily circling in the sky above the North Station, dropping huge bombs. Below were Chinese soldiers wearing conical straw hats, perhaps newly arrived reinforcements from Guangxi. Because the distance was very close, I could see the features on each of their faces. Every time a plane dropped a bomb, they would lie flat on the ground. In an instant, with a bang, it was deafening, and splinters and dust flew up. After the bombs exploded, these soldiers immediately continued their duties calmly, as if nothing had happened.

Now, only the occasional hoarse shouts of Japanese sailors in the nearby Lianglu Building and the sound of streetcar bells in the public concession break the deathly silence. The Lianglu Building, built in 1935 and 1936, still stands tall. Windows have been installed on the second and third floors, which have been converted into barracks for Japanese sailors. This building is also surrounded by high fences, and sentries guard the gates. Other than that, the Japanese have left this building to its own devices. On the gray walls, there are still blackened holes, and the bricks loosened by the intensive three-month bombardment by the Japanese army, navy, and air force have not been removed. In some places, the steel bars in the ruins can still be seen.

The wooden buildings surrounding the Lianglu Building bore the brunt of the Japanese air raids. A group of Chinese coolies, supervised by the Japanese, are now dismantling the remaining wood. In the entire Zhabei area, I only saw three groups of coolies. One group was demolishing a half-destroyed church, neatly stacking the bricks, perhaps for the construction of buildings the Japanese want to build. Apart from these coolies and the Chinese in a public bus waving their passes to the Japanese sentries at the intersection of Shishan Road and Shixing Road, I saw fewer than twenty Chinese in Zhabei in three hours.

However, although the Chinese residents of Zhabei have decreased, they have not disappeared. On every major road, especially on Baoxing Road, a wary sentry stands every fifty yards, secretly peering at every person and vehicle passing by from behind trees, corners of houses, and obstacles. On the bridge, a small team of patrolling sailors carefully checks the passes of several farmers crossing the bridge. Why is Zhabei, which has been occupied for nineteen months, still so heavily guarded, like an armed camp? Is it because Zhabei is the front door to the Japanese military base in the concession? Or is it because of fear of attacks by the guerrilla forces known overseas? This is not difficult to understand.

If the Japanese had the funds and opportunity to start economic revitalization, then Zhabei, Shanghai's "Little Tokyo," would certainly be an ideal place for such a plan. Within a mile of Zhabei, there is a port where Japan can continuously transport in construction materials. In Shanghai itself, there are thousands of laborers looking for work, and many people are eager to return to their hometowns. In "Little Tokyo," there is unrestricted management and a supply of technical knowledge. Furthermore, Japan has concentrated a large number of army, navy, and air force soldiers, planes, and warships in the entire Shanghai area, which is sufficient to protect Zhabei from attacks by the Chinese army.

Then, how can we explain why Japan has not yet started its widely publicized plan? The answer lies in Japan's entire economic and political activities in China, which is that Japan now realizes that its "sacred mission" of conquering and pacifying China is beyond its capabilities.

Nearly two years ago, when Japan started the current war, its original plan was to strengthen its power in North China by flaunting its military strength. However, China, fighting desperately, responded to Japan's challenge, and the war spread to Shanghai. One incident led to another, and a major war broke out, which was truly Japan's misfortune. As the war expanded, Japan's required expenses increased, and today, its total amount is equal to the entire national revenue of Japan. At the same time, the funds that can be obtained are absorbed by heavy industry. The funds that could be used for the economic development of North China two years ago have now been exhausted and empty. Therefore, it has to frequently issue astonishing news, such as Tokyo hinting that it has formulated an economic plan for North China.

Even more important than this is that without the cooperation of the hundreds of millions of Chinese living in the so-called "occupied areas," no kind of revival is possible. Unfortunately for Japan, its army has not yet won the favor of the masses. The Japanese army continues to carry out terrible wars, causing China's hatred of the invaders to grow with new strength. This can be proved by the increasingly widespread guerrilla warfare and the increasing number of Japanese troops dispatched, who still shout slogans such as "pacifying the occupied areas." Alas! The devastated Zhabei is enough to make Japan realize that engaging in aggression is futile and an ominous sign of future tragic consequences!

### A Record of the "Hualian Tonglehui" (Chinese United Recreation Club)

‚Äî Xin Liang

Since the retreat of the national army in Songhu (Shanghai), Shanghai has formed a so-called "isolated island." It is indeed very difficult for young people in various professions to find a proper place to adjust their bodies and minds in this small place and in this special environment. The pre-war mass organizations have all stagnated or disintegrated due to the sound of war. Therefore, those with weak wills are confused by boring pastimes, playing and messing around in singing halls and dance halls all day and night to kill time. This is really a large number. At that time, Mr. Lu Fu, Zhang Yuanfu, Liang Jueyu and other gentlemen felt that under this situation, there was indeed a need to organize an amateur and proper entertainment group. After several preparations, the "Hualian Tonglehui" was finally created. Its main purpose is to connect feelings, research academics, cultivate body and mind, improve life, promote proper entertainment, and promote welfare undertakings.

In the short one-year history from its founding to the present, the "Hualianhui" has also encountered countless difficulties. However, it is willing to work hard and strive, so it finally survived all the storms. The members increased from more than one hundred to more than two thousand to more than four thousand. The venue changed from one wing room to the third floor of Lichang Trading Company on Jiujiang Road to No. 194 Nanjing Road. Almost every moment, it is progressing and expanding. Now, among the general people in society, especially in the "foreign company" circle, it is probably rare for people who do not know the three words "Hualianhui."

In fact, the "Hualianhui" is a good amateur entertainment venue for young people in the workplace. After you have finished a day's boring work, do you feel tired and bored? At this time, you can run to the entertainment department of the "Hualianhui" to relax. It is divided into eight categories: national music, Cantonese music, vocal music, harmonica, chess, magic, drama, and Peking opera. Do you want to improve your knowledge? The "Hualianhui" also has an academic department. In addition to a library and a "weekly academic lecture," "life symposium," and "literary lecture," there is also a "Hualian Amateur Tutoring School" attached to the Zhengxing Girls' School on Fuxu Road. If you want to exercise your body, the "Hualianhui" also has a sports department. Ping pong, volleyball, basketball and various sports are all included. In the past, because the venue had not been resolved, the work of the sports department was not very tense, but recently, its situation has been very active. In a nutshell, we can say that the purpose of the "Hualianhui" is not only to eliminate our bad habits and abolish all kinds of wasteful vulgarities, but also to try our best to provide us with opportunities to increase our knowledge and exercise our bodies.

By the way, there are three things about the "Hualianhui" that are worth mentioning here: (1) The establishment of the women's department. In most groups in Shanghai, there are very few women participating in activities, but the female members of the "Hualianhui" seem to be particularly many. Therefore, there is this women's department to specialize in the affairs of female members. Its work in education includes cooking research classes and life knowledge classes. In terms of crafts, there are sewing, embroidery, and knitting. (2) The operation of the consumer cooperative. In this department, in addition to the ordinary catering department and billiard room, the "Hualianhui" also specially provides many stores, giving members a special purchase discount and preferential treatment to reduce the burden of life for each member. (3) The establishment of the refugee relief committee. In order to share some of the responsibility of relieving refugees, the "Hualianhui" established this special committee to carry out the work.

Of course, the "Hualian Tonglehui" still has many shortcomings that have not been overcome. However, in general, the work of the "Hualian Tonglehui" is worthy of our support.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter Thirteen: Encouraging Learning and Agriculture to Store Materials for the Country; Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak to Select Seeds with a Field

Village Chief Zhu's words were like a lecture, and everyone listened respectfully. Later, they talked about the land. Village Chief Zhu said: "We only lease the land here, we don't sell it. Since the establishment of the new village, all the land in the village belongs to the village. If you want to use the land in the village, you can only lease it from the village, and you are not allowed to buy it. All the land in the village is priced by the village council. It is stipulated that a certain place should collect a certain amount of rent per mu per year. However, the land is good and bad, and it cannot be the same. Places with convenient land and water transportation are naturally more expensive. Places with only land transportation but no water transportation are slightly less. Places on the mountainside where the road has not been built are certainly less expensive. There is a booklet in the village office that has a detailed map of the entire village. It is marked in detail that a certain place is the best and the rent is the highest; a certain place is medium and the rent is less; a certain place is the worst and the rent is even less. The term of land lease cannot be fixed, probably the longest is thirty years, some are twenty-five years, some are twenty years, and the shortest is fifteen years. Generally, twenty years is the most common. However, because of the progress of village governance and the development of the environment, after ten years, a re-evaluation is allowed, which is based on fairness and does not have any prejudice. Now, you two young ladies have come here to take a look, and you have a rough idea of the situation. I think you always want a place with convenient land and water transportation. How many mu of land do you want? In addition to the factory building, do you want to build other ancillary buildings? This cannot be decided in one day. On the one hand, report to your father, is the address here suitable? On the other hand, you can ask an architect to come and take a look, which will be more thorough." He Shuangyu said: "Yes! According to the wishes of the two of us, it would be best to set up a factory on the road. I think my father will not object. Originally, when my father went north, he knew that we were going to visit Sister Airen. He told us to take the opportunity to come here, and if there is a suitable address, build a few houses to live in. Because we may not return to Guangdong for a while, and my father dislikes the Shanghai market being too noisy, which is not very suitable for living in. However, because of his professional relationship, he cannot be too far away from the seven seas. So, we initially wanted to discuss with Sister Airen to choose a place with beautiful mountains and rivers, and build a small villa, and felt that the Ziyouli (Freedom) New Village was the most suitable. Now that this silk factory plan has been initiated, the main base of Chinese silk fabrics is in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and this place is just between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. So, I think my father will definitely approve of it, and the other shareholders will also be very willing." (146)
