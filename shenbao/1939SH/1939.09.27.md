### Western Front Tensions Rise: French and German Artillery Exchange Fire Across the Rhine; German Forces Forced to Retreat Eastward in the Black Forest; A Corner of the Warsaw Defense Line Falls to German Forces

Basel, Switzerland: Residents of this city reported hearing intense artillery fire around 2 PM, originating from the Lörrach area on the left bank of the Rhine. Several squadrons of French aircraft flew eastward over Baden, Germany, despite intense German anti-aircraft fire, none were shot down. (Havas, 26th)

Berlin: This morning's communique from the German High Command stated that German forces in the east continued to advance to the designated Soviet-German demarcation line. German armored units downstream from the San River engaged in several brief skirmishes with small enemy units, capturing 2,000 prisoners. Since yesterday, German forces have continued their attack on Warsaw. Because the Polish military commander defending the city absolutely refused to accept German advice, peaceful means have proven ineffective, and military force is now necessary. The Mokotów Fort and the vicinity of Mokotów have been captured by German forces. Regarding aerial combat on the western front, German forces shot down five French aircraft, with another brought down by German anti-aircraft fire. The fact that French aircraft have violated Belgian airspace has become undeniable. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Paris: After weeks of relatively little activity, French artillery units have begun to bombard, and the French military has taken the initiative to strengthen its positions along the entire front line. While the scope of these military actions is not large, well-informed military circles believe they are of particular importance, as they enable the French forces to gain excellent vantage points in areas such as the Briey region and the rugged terrain of the Hart Mountains. In the past two weeks, German counterattacks have been met with French interception and have been discouraged, with German activity limited to artillery fire in the areas of Sarrebourg and the Gent district. Yesterday, the two sides exchanged heavy artillery fire across the Rhine for a prolonged period, markedly different from the sporadic shelling of previous days. It is reported that the aerial combat yesterday proved that French aircraft excelled in all aspects of guiding artillery, aerial photography, reconnaissance, and communication with artillery units. Fighter aircraft protected bombers soaring over German lines, engaging in several aerial battles with German fighters. The results proved the high speed and strength of French fighters and bombers, as the French bombers flew so fast that German fighters could not catch them. According to the lowest estimates, German losses in these aerial battles were at least equal to those of France. Recent French communiques state that motorized units are active east of the Saar, where enemy artillery fire is also quite intense. Yesterday, during aerial combat on the front lines, two French fighter patrol squadrons engaged in combat with a larger number of enemy aircraft, shooting down several German fighters, two of which fell within French territory. (Reuters, 26th)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 44, stating: "Our infantry outposts were active yesterday in the eastern part of the German Saar region, while the enemy used artillery to bombard heavily. Air combat also occurred between enemy and our aircraft on the front line yesterday. Our fighter aircraft encountered superior enemy aircraft while on patrol and immediately shot down several enemy fighters, two of which fell in our lines." (Havas, 25th)

Paris: Last night, artillery fire between French and German forces was intense on the western front. French forces used long-range heavy artillery to bombard German forces concentrated in the Black Forest area on the east bank of the Rhine, a front line stretching 125 miles from that area to the Swiss border. It is reported that German forces, under heavy French artillery fire, were forced to retreat east of the Black Forest late yesterday, after which the artillery fire became less intense. French shells landed on "Siegfried" fortifications near Lahr, Germany. Reliable sources claim that French aerial photographs indicate that "German defenses have been damaged and severely destroyed by the shelling." Yesterday, French forces consolidated several positions in the Saar region, especially in the Bruche and Hart Forest areas. French forces took advantage of the fact that German patrols did not attack French forces to strengthen defenses and improve observation points. French newspapers report that Chancellor Hitler and the German General Staff have disagreements, with the General Staff opposing a group attack on Allied forces before German artillery is concentrated on the western front. The French official gazette stated, "Yesterday, our infantry vanguard advanced east of the Saar, where enemy artillery fire was very heavy. During the air combat on September 4, our fighter aircraft repelled superior enemy aircraft, shooting down several German aircraft, two of which fell in our territory." (Associated Press, 26th)

Berlin: With the Eastern Front war nearing its end, large numbers of German troops have been transferred to reinforce the Western Front, and a major battle is imminent. Yesterday, German submarines sank another British ship. On Sunday night, a large squadron of aircraft bombed the Zeppelin factory in Friedrichshafen. According to a German military announcement, a total of eight French aircraft were shot down, and the Zeppelin factory was not damaged. The German High Command announced, "German submarines have achieved great success in attacking British and French ships. German forces on the Eastern Front have advanced to the agreed Soviet-German line. German aircraft bombed Warsaw several times on Sunday with excellent results. There were only small skirmishes on the Western Front, with both sides exchanging artillery fire. The French aircraft attacking the Zeppelin factory flew to Friedrichshafen at 9 PM on Sunday. According to neutral reports, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard. An air raid alarm was issued in Konstanz at 8:15 PM on Sunday and lifted at 8:35 PM. A second alarm occurred at 11 PM and was lifted after midnight." (Associated Press, 26th)

Paris: It is expected here that Germany will soon pass through Switzerland and the Netherlands to attack France, at which point the front line will be extended by another 200 kilometers. However, Germany can thus avoid the first line of fortifications in Belgium and go directly to the heart of Flanders. According to Le Petit Parisien, the evacuation of the people of Aachen, Germany, is in preparation for violating Dutch neutrality. At the same time, behind the Rhine River, from Basel to Schaffhausen, Germany's border with Switzerland, Germany has also massed a large number of troops. It appears that Germany's plan is to launch a large-scale offensive from Neuchâtel to enter the Jura Mountains. However, the Jura is a natural barrier, and France has also established strong fortifications in this area, making it easy to defend and difficult to attack, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about. According to observations from the French military authorities, Germany currently seems to be probing French strength before launching an offensive. At the same time, a German offensive may not be launched for a while, as French forward units have approached the Siegfried Line at several points and are within range of French heavy artillery. (Associated Press, 26th)

Beijing: A Belgian traveler who recently spent three weeks in Germany wrote an article after returning to Belgium for the Belgian Free Press. He stated that nineteen out of ten Germans believe that the war is now over and that France will not continue to fight after the settlement in Poland. This view is reinforced by propaganda. However, senior officials in Berlin expect a long-term war. There are suggestions to increase the convenience of the railway between Germany and the Soviet Union by several times. National control is rapidly developing, and many merchants whose businesses are struggling due to national control are selling their shops and becoming workers. German morale is still good, but people are not interested in Hitler's speech in Danzig. (Reuters, 26th)

Berlin: The activities of the German forces on the Eastern Front are focused today on the vicinity of Warsaw, because, even though the Warsaw garrison has been subjected to fierce bombardment by the army and air force, it is still striving to hold on. According to communiqués issued here, in other parts of Poland, the German forces are gradually retreating to the designated demarcation line as the Soviet forces advance. (Reuters, 26th)

Paris: News from the front has just been received here stating that French artillery units shelled the opposite bank of the Rhine near the Swiss border today, intending to inflict heavy damage on German forces transferred from Poland and concentrated in that area. It is also reported that German forces have again massed near Aachen, on the border with Belgium. According to observers here, French military authorities believe that Germany may attack France by way of neutral countries. According to a report from the French General Staff, French forces are now threatening Rheinstetten. German artillery units are continuing to bombard French positions east of that town. It is reported that in the south, German forces are massed behind the Black Forest, in an area between Lörrach and Schaffhausen, directly across from the French border. Observing the German deployment, it appears that they intend to cross the Rhine River north of Basel via Switzerland. However, senior French military circles believe that this German plan would invite disaster, as the French forces defending that area are the most elite troops of the entire Maginot Line. Today's communiqués here state that air combat between French and German aircraft was intense, and French forces used heavy artillery to bombard German mountain defenses between the Rhine and Moselle Rivers, opposite the northeastern border of France. (Reuters, 26th)

### Zeppelin Airship Base Twice Subjected to Air Raids; Germany Claims Eight French Aircraft Shot Down; British Aircraft Scatter Leaflets in Western Germany

Zurich, Switzerland: It is widely believed that the German Zeppelin airship base in Friedrichshafen, on the eastern shore of Lake Constance, was attacked twice on Sunday night by British or French aircraft. Loud explosions and anti-aircraft fire were clearly heard on the southern shore of the lake between 8:15 PM and 11 PM that night. Air raid alarms were issued twice, and searchlights illuminated the sky for two hours. A statement issued by the Swiss Army Command confirmed that loud explosions were heard and defensive artillery fire and electric lights were seen. According to reports from various points on the Swiss border, the drone of aircraft was deafening between 10 PM and 11 PM on Sunday night, and one aircraft flew over the Rhine River, having flown over the canton of Schaffhausen in the direction of Singen. The Swiss authorities are currently conducting an investigation to determine whether foreign aircraft violated Swiss airspace. (Reuters, 26th)

Paris: Regarding the air combat between French and German aircraft over the city of Friedrichshafen, Germany, on the 24th of this month, German sources issued a statement saying that eight French aircraft had been shot down. Semi-official sources here have now denied this. We only lost two aircraft in this operation, one of which had a pilot who landed within our lines using a parachute. Two enemy aircraft were also shot down and fell within our lines, and their pilots were captured by our forces. (Havas, 25th)

Berlin: The German High Command admitted today that British aircraft scattered leaflets in various cities in western Germany last night. The British aircraft were subsequently repelled. (Associated Press, 16th)

London: The Ministry of Information announced that, to date, the Royal Air Force has distributed 18,000,000 leaflets over Germany. Since the outbreak of the war, Royal Air Force aircraft have made thousands of miles of night flights over German territory, penetrating deep into Germany. The leaflets they carried were dropped only in designated areas, so most of them landed at their intended destinations. The personnel on board worked quickly and demonstrated extremely high aviation skills. These flights have proven their great value, as the leaflets distributed have given millions of Germans the opportunity to understand the true intentions of the Allied countries. These flights have also been quite beneficial for reconnaissance. (Reuters, 26th)

London: The Air Ministry stated that the Royal Air Force again flew to western and northwestern Germany on Sunday to conduct reconnaissance. Although German aircraft rose to intercept, they were repelled, and the Royal Air Force safely returned to its original defenses. Last night, the Royal Air Force again flew over Germany for reconnaissance and dropped leaflets, and all safely returned. (Reuters, 26th)

### Hitler Inspects the Front Lines

Berlin: According to an official report issued here, Führer Hitler continued his inspection of the front lines, arriving at the area east of the Bzura River, which had been recently captured. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

### Polish President Mościcki Intends to Resign; Paderewski May Succeed as Head of State

Bucharest, Romania: According to reliable sources from Polish circles here, Polish President Mościcki will likely resign soon to allow the world-renowned pianist and first Prime Minister after the Great War, Paderewski, to take his place. However, whether this can be realized immediately depends on Paderewski's health. It is also reported that Mościcki intends to establish a new government in France, with Paderewski as the head of state, and has already sought his consent. Currently, the Polish people here deeply hope that Paderewski can serve the country to the best of his ability, even in his old age. If he cannot bring himself to do so, Mościcki will relinquish his position to a prominent Polish figure currently in France, so that the Polish government can be organized and established within French territory. (Associated Press, 26th)

Bucharest: Polish President Mościcki and Polish Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz are currently being detained here. (Reuters, 25th)

### French and Swedish Merchant Ships Sunk by German Submarines; Norwegians Build Roads, Blast Obstacles; Coastal Residents Mistake for Artillery Fire

London: A French coal ship named "Follina" was attacked by a German submarine off the coast of Britain last night. After hearing the explosion, people on the shore saw a plume of black smoke rising from the French ship. Crew members were then seen escaping in lifeboats. A lifeboat from the coast arrived to rescue all twenty-four crew members. Soon after, two British destroyers suddenly appeared and pursued the German submarine, but by this time the French ship had sunk. Two crew members of the "Follina" were injured. It is said that the German submarine did not issue a warning before firing. (Reuters, 26th)

Stockholm, Sweden: The Swedish merchant ship "Sylviej", 2,850 tons, was sunk by a German submarine yesterday in the sea off the port of Stavanger. All ten crew members were rescued. The ship was fully loaded with timber and was en route from Gothenburg to Hull, England. This is the second Swedish ship sacrificed in forty-eight hours. The Swedish government will lodge a strong protest with the German government and will suspend trade with Germany. (Associated Press, 26th)

London: The Ministry of Information stated that all hope of rescuing the crew of the 4,853-ton British ship "Wang" which was sunk by a German submarine 300 miles west of the French island of Ushant three weeks ago, has now faded. The crew were forced to drift at sea in lifeboats with no hope of reaching land. This is an act of piracy similar to the base behavior of the German navy on the high seas. According to the submarine protocol signed by Germany in November 1936, warships, submarines, or other ships may not sink merchant ships unless the crew of the merchant ship have been placed in a safe place. (Reuters, 26th)

London: The Naval Headquarters has just issued a statement stating, "There is no report here of a naval battle rumored to have occurred in Norwegian waters today. It is also not true that anyone has heard artillery fire in those waters." (Havas, 25th)

Oslo: According to a message received here last night from western Norway, a large-scale naval battle will be launched off the coast of Norway. Coastal residents can see warships and hear artillery fire. Fifteen to twenty German ships arrived in Herdlefjorden yesterday. Residents of Kjelte said they heard artillery fire at 7:30 AM yesterday morning and continued to hear it until noon. (Associated Press, 26th)

Stockholm, Sweden: Newspapers in Sweden and Norway stated last night that a naval war had broken out off the coast of Norway, and residents around Bergen could hear the rumble of artillery fire all day long. The Swedish news agency has now issued a message correcting this, stating that this sound, similar to artillery fire, is the sound of building roads and blasting obstacles near Bergen. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

### Warsaw Subjected to Artillery Bombardment

Budapest, Hungary: Yesterday, Radio Warsaw broadcast that the German artillery units are conducting a planned destruction of Warsaw. The sounds of explosions are constant, and half the city is on fire. There are many casualties, including women and children, who are lying in the streets being given first aid. (According to a London cable, 1,000 residents of the city have died in artillery fire in the last 24 hours.) The radio station also broadcast that during a mass in a church, a bomb suddenly fell, so the priest asked the congregation to remain silent and continue worshipping God. The radio station made no report on the infantry fighting situation, but emphasized that the morale of the defending forces was high and had not waned, and that they still hoped for assistance from the Allied forces. In addition, according to a telegram from Warsaw yesterday, the defending forces are running low on ammunition, but in close-quarters combat in the suburbs, they once repelled the invading enemy forces. (Associated Press, 26th)

### Estonian Foreign Minister Returns Home in Haste; Discusses Trade Agreement with Soviet Authorities

Moscow: After arriving here yesterday afternoon, Estonian Foreign Minister Selter held talks with Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov and then flew back to his country's capital this morning. The reason for his haste is unknown to outsiders, but well-informed sources believe that the various demands made by the Soviet Union to Estonia have been conveyed to Foreign Minister Selter by Molotov, and that he must immediately return to report everything. According to official announcements, the purpose of Foreign Minister Selter's trip was to discuss the extension of the trade agreement with the Soviet authorities, but it is generally said that various other issues are also being discussed, including the neutralization and demilitarization of the islands in the southern Gulf of Finland belonging to Estonia, and the issue of a Polish submarine escaping from Estonia. (Havas, 25th)

Stockholm, Sweden: Estonian Foreign Minister Selter's sudden departure from Moscow yesterday morning has led to various speculations in the Swedish press. It is said that Foreign Minister Selter was invited to Moscow by the Soviet government for consultations, and was originally scheduled to stay in Moscow for four days. After arriving in Tallinn yesterday, Foreign Minister Selter went to visit Estonian President Pätz to make a report. The cabinet immediately held a special cabinet meeting. It is heard that after consulting with the government and reaching an agreement, Foreign Minister Selter will travel to Moscow again. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

### Germany Changes Eastern Border

Breslau: The border between eastern and western Upper Silesia was abolished yesterday. Traffic between the two regions is no longer subject to passport regulations. The German border has now been moved to the former border, namely the line of Lubliniec, Milowitz, Preisleybonnik. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Berlin: Germany abolished the border between Germany and Polish Upper Silesia today, and the "police border" established after the German occupation of Poland was abolished yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the industrial areas and mining areas occupied by the German army are now incorporated into German territory. (Reuters, 26th)

### Soviet Troops Continue to Advance Towards the Demarcation Line; Occupy Suwałki and Goniądz; Traffic Blocked on Soviet-Romanian Border

Moscow: The General Staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army issued the following war report on the 25th:

"On the 25th of September, units of the Red Army continued to advance towards the demarcation line and occupied the towns of Suwałki and Goniądz, reaching the line of Suwałki, Goniądz, Suraż, Wojnów (20 kilometers northwest of Brest-Litovsk), Opalin, Dubenka (24 and 30 kilometers northeast and southeast of the town of Hrubieszów), Komarów, Rawryki (15 kilometers southeast of Rawa Ruska), Pohoryce (25 kilometers northeast of Sambor), Uniatycze (10 kilometers northwest of Drohobycz), Rybnik (40 kilometers west of Stryj), and Kokijva (50 kilometers southwest of Stryj). On the same day, operations to eliminate the remnants of defeated Polish forces in the regions of Western Belarus and Ukraine continued." (Havas, 26th)

Uzhhorod, Hungary: Havas news agency's correspondent on the border between Poland and Hungary reports that heavy snow has fallen in the Carpathian Mountains, delaying the arrival of Soviet troops at the southern border of Poland, which was originally scheduled for yesterday. The area has become a no-man's land after the withdrawal of German troops. According to reliable sources, Soviet troops have arrived at the town of Turka (23 kilometers from the Hungarian border) and are scheduled to arrive at the border this morning. A large number of Polish refugees are fleeing to Hungary, and Hungarian residents are making every effort to accommodate them. (Havas, 26th)

Moscow: According to unconfirmed reports, Soviet troops have sealed off the port of Odessa and the Romanian border. Personnel from the Polish Embassy left here yesterday and were originally scheduled to go to Romania, but have now changed their destination to Finland. (Associated Press, 26th)

London: According to a Reuters report from the Romanian capital, 100 divisions of the Soviet Red Army are currently massing along the Romanian border of Bessarabia. Air raid precautions were implemented in the Romanian capital last night. (Associated Press, 26th)

Moscow: It is reported that traffic on the Soviet-Romanian border has been cut off. The railway between the two countries originally passed through the border between Tiraspol and Tighina (Bessarabia). The railway was opened in 1936. The Soviet side has not yet officially confirmed this information. It is learned that Soviet passenger ships between Odessa and Istanbul have also been temporarily suspended. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)

Budapest: According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans destroyed the Drohobycz oil wells before handing them over to Soviet forces. (Reuters, 26th)

Bucharest: Government figures here have formally denied a claim in an American newspaper that Soviet troops have entered the Romanian province of Bessarabia (which belonged to Russia before the last European war), and stated that there are no Soviet activities near the Romanian border. Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov has formally assured the Romanian envoy, Tiano, and stipulated that relations between the two countries during the European war should be based on strict neutrality. In addition, the border between Poland and Romania has also been sealed and is under surveillance until the end of the current military action. (Havas, 26th)

### Belgium: Railway Bridge Destroyed; Traffic Between Belgium and Luxembourg Severed

Brussels: A railway bridge on the line between Brussels and Arlon, located at the Stockem station, was suddenly blown up yesterday. A nearby house was also destroyed in the blast. Parts of the steel structure were thrown onto the highway connecting Arlon and Neufchâteau, disrupting vehicular traffic. Apart from a slightly injured guard, there were no casualties. Authorities have launched an investigation, but no leads have been found yet. The bridge is located not far from the border of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. (Havas, 26th)

### Germany Warns Neutral Nations: Continued Trade with Britain and France Will Be Seen as Unfriendly

Washington: Official sources here announced last night that the German government has warned neutral nations that if they continue to engage in commerce with Britain and France, Germany will consider it an unfriendly act. The purpose of the Anglo-French naval blockade is to prevent neutral countries from trading with Germany. The activities of diplomatic representatives of neutral nations in Britain and France over the past few days are related to this matter. (Associated Press, 26th)

### Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union Negotiate Resumption of Relations; Hungarian-Soviet Resumption Unconfirmed

Moscow: The Soviet side has not yet confirmed the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Hungarian government and the Soviet Union. According to informed sources here, this matter has not yet materialized; it only indicates that both countries, especially Hungary, have this desire. In addition, it is rumored that the Yugoslav government has sent a representative here to discuss establishing diplomatic relations, but the representative's whereabouts are secret. It is also possible that these negotiations have already begun elsewhere. (Havas, 26th)

Editorial

### Japan's Empty Wishes

Yesterday, the Shanghai morning and evening newspapers published a speech by the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, Mr. Tajiri, upon his departure from Hong Kong. There were slight discrepancies between the morning and evening versions; summarizing the main points, they are as follows:

"After the outbreak of the European war, Chongqing has found it difficult to obtain military supplies, so Japan is not prepared to immediately destroy it. Instead, it hopes that after the establishment of the [new Sino-Japanese political machine], it will cause internal strife. As for Anglo-Japanese and American-Japanese relations, it is believed that early rapprochement is possible; Anglo-Japanese understanding can be restored soon. Once Japan implements its so-called 'Open Door' policy in China, the American attitude will also change. If Britain and the United States wish to trade with China, then it will naturally be against their will. It is incomprehensible why the British military authorities are preparing defenses. If this is the case, it is extreme."

Given Japan's recent organizational disarray and the multiplicity of its policies, even pronouncements by responsible officials cannot be immediately regarded as accurate. Moreover, for a consul to discuss military and diplomatic matters is generally unacceptable. However, regardless of the speaker, there are points worthy of our commentary.

Mr. Tajiri's statement contains the following ideas: First, it no longer intends to "destroy" China's resistance militarily; second, it no longer intends to pressure Hong Kong or the United States; third, it plans to use Japan's so-called "Open Door" to cater to the traditional American Open Door policy and its interests, in exchange for American-Japanese rapprochement; fourth, it plans to use commercial interests to entice countries to recognize the so-called "Nanjing government"; and fifth, it intends to use the establishment of the so-called "new central government" as a tool to incite internal strife in China, replacing the military "destruction" attempt. All these five points are clearly expressed. Although his words are not a formal statement by a responsible party, and the events he envisions cannot be grasped by Japan's unilateral intentions, upon careful consideration of the overall situation both domestically and internationally, Mr. Tajiri has indeed revealed Japan's imagined desires, and the path and method it imagines for unfolding the current situation.

We have no evidence to suggest that Japan's desires today differ from those exposed in past memorials to the throne, nor from the ambitions that fueled its military aggression over the past eight years. However, after two years of arduous fighting and such heavy losses, and with such drastic changes in the domestic and international situation, in order to achieve its desires, it has no choice but to correct its path and method of "military determination of everything," to seek adaptation to what the overall situation urgently demands. Japan has at least admitted that destroying China's resistance force is currently impossible. Therefore, it has abandoned its strategy of using war to sustain war, and reverted to its pre-war traditional strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese, hoping for internal strife to lead to self-collapse and self-destruction. Months ago, this was still stalled in a stalemate of wanting to stop but being unable to, due to the impermissibility of objective conditions; now, with the local evolution of objective conditions and the inducement of the overall situation, the opportunity to gradually unfold the current situation is becoming apparent. The most serious threats are: first, isolation in the international arena due to abandonment by Germany; and second, concern that the abrogation of the Sino-American Treaty will lead to economic threats. The most significant inducements are: first, the Soviet Union's conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Japan in order to cope with the European war; second, Britain and France's hope for a relaxation of the Far Eastern dispute in order to focus on the European war; and third, the European war triggering the Japanese people's golden dream of more than twenty years ago. Because of the intensity of these threats and inducements, Japan is seeking every opportunity to end the current stage of the Sino-Japanese War. Moreover, with the imminent approach of the date for the abrogation of the American-Japanese Treaty, Japan is anxious about whether the United States will take further action after the treaty is abrogated. If this is the inevitable trend, and it is only a matter of time, then Japan will become more conciliatory and more eager to compromise. If the old treaty is to be abolished and a new treaty is to be concluded, then Japan will maintain its menacing posture towards countries other than the United States. However, because it is impossible to predict whether the United States will take other actions, Japan is determined to unfold the current situation before January of next year. Moreover, there is historical animosity and real contradictions between the Soviet Union and Japan. As the Soviet Union's internal construction gradually matures and its position in Europe becomes increasingly enriched, although it has signed a non-aggression treaty, its future attitude is unpredictable. If the Soviet Union no longer feigns cordiality towards Japan, and the friction escalates into confrontation, then Japan will face an additional constraint in achieving its desires. This is certainly unfavorable to Japan; therefore, it is also eager to unfold the current situation now that the treaty has been signed and the Soviet Union, preoccupied with European affairs, does not have time to dwell on old grievances and show animosity towards Japan. Unfolding the current situation, with ending the Sino-Japanese War as the primary goal. Without ending it, it will be unable to cope with the unpredictable actions of the United States and the Soviet Union in the future, and even less able to cope with the predictable future of the entire international community. The frequent reports of brewing peace negotiations in recent days are what Japan is striving for, not accidental.

Furthermore, is Japan's hope to end the war and seek peace insufficient to be considered evidence that Japan's desires today are different from those of the past? It is important to understand that ending the war and forming a peace in Japan's mind are one thing; curbing its war-mongering ambitions and desires is another. It seeks to fulfill its ambitions and desires through its own form of peace. Therefore, a Japanese-style peace is by no means evidence that Japan has curbed its war-mongering ambitions and desires. On the contrary, Mr. Tajiri's statement that it will "cause internal strife" is ironclad proof of Japan's ambitions and desires!

Moreover, is a Japanese-style peace attainable? Of course. Hasn't there been peace between Beiping, Nanjing, and Japan for over a year or two? The Chinese nation led by the National Government is the one resisting Japan and fighting the war; if those who do not resist make peace, can it be called peace when the state of war still exists? If this is called peace, the Japanese may use it to amuse themselves. If it is said to be adapting to changes in the world, to be used to maneuver with the international community, then it has not been seen that the international community is willing to accept deception, and it has not been seen that the Japanese can thereby change their international environment. If the name exists but the substance does not, it is a change of means without any benefit. Japan is obsessed with power and cunning tricks, and is pleased with its petty wisdom and petty operations. This is the tragedy of its exhaustion.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Arrives in Moscow; Proposes Four-Nation Pact; Eastern Europe's Fate Hinges on Soviet Attitude; US Supports Southern European Neutral Bloc

London: According to news received here today, Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, will propose a four-nation pact between the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria to guarantee the existing borders of these countries. It is believed that this trip by the Turkish Foreign Minister will have a significant impact on the European war. If Germany attacks Romania, Turkey will find it difficult to ally with the Soviet Union and will still take action against Germany. Britain and France may at this time even ask Turkey to allow their navies to pass through the Dardanelles Strait. (Associated Press, 26th)

London: British officials and the public generally believe that the Allied forces will win the current war; but the speed of victory depends on whether a battle line can be created in the East to contain Germany. If this can be achieved, it can prevent Germany from expanding its power into the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and cut off Germany's access to supplies from Eastern European countries. In short, the UK should make every effort to achieve blockade success. A review of the current issue is most critical. However, diplomatic circles assert that the current situation is more complex than at the start of the war. The Soviet Union's attitude is really to blame for the cause. As for Italy, it has recently suggested that Turkey sign a non-aggression pact. Upon inspection of its intentions, the aim is to confirm its neutrality or to weaken the battle line that Western Europe intends to establish in the East. Whether Turkey signs a formal mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France in a short time, therefore, depends on whether the content of the proposed non-aggression treaty conflicts with Turkey's obligations to Britain and France. In addition, Italy's military on the border between Albania and Greece has recently decided to withdraw. Also, part of the Italian garrison on the Dodecanese Islands in the southeastern Mediterranean will be withdrawn. Also, a preliminary discussion was made of the policies adopted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Hai Tung News Agency, 26th)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is scheduled to stay here for three days. He will go to the Kremlin this morning to meet with Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov and Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin for talks. In the evening, he will attend a performance at the opera house. The Turkish ambassador will host a banquet at five o'clock tomorrow to welcome him, inviting Soviet dignitaries to accompany him. (Havas, 26th)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu arrived here yesterday, accompanied by Deputy Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs, Yaqi Kalin, First Division Chief, Aiklin, and Counselor and Hall Chief, Boral. When the Turkish Foreign Minister arrived at the station, Soviet People's Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Polatankin, Dekanozov, and other personnel were present to welcome him. Flags of the Soviet Union and Turkey were hung on the station platform to express welcome. (TASS, 26th)

Amsterdam: According to news from London, British political figures are very concerned about Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's visit to Moscow, believing that Anglo-Turkish negotiations will continue to be held, but their value depends on the outcome of Russian-Turkish talks in Moscow. (Hai Tung News Agency, 26th)

Conclusion of a Commercial Treaty

Britain Seeks One with the Soviet Union; Negotiations Underway in London

Rome: Political figures here hold the view that "war or peace" will be revealed in a few days. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech has aroused reactions from people around the world. Apart from a minority of political figures in democratic countries, most others hold out hope for peace. Political figures in Rome are extremely interested in Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's visit to Moscow, happily claiming that Mr. Saraçoğlu's trip is to consult with the Soviet government on the issue of concluding a Soviet-Turkish mutual assistance agreement. Regarding this matter, Italy has repeatedly expressed a desire for peace, and is withdrawing its troops stationed near the Albanian-Greek border. In addition, the troops stationed near the Dodecanese Islands are also planning to withdraw. It is said that Italy's expression has given Turkey a good impression. Although this has not been put into practice, Italy has already designated this agreement as a government policy. Subsequently, Italy's purpose is to certify Turkey's relationship. It is said that Turkey values ​​an important position for maintaining peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. (Hai Tung News Agency, 26th)

London: According to various observations, Britain is currently conducting a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union to purchase Soviet goods. If the UK does not purchase these goods, the Soviet Union may sell them to Germany. Foreign Secretary Halifax has consulted with Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky on this matter. Observers here believe that the economic nature of this move by the British government is ultimately political. The British and Soviet officials have refused to publish the content of several talks between Halifax and Maisky. London newspapers have written articles calling for the government to purchase Soviet wheat, oil, and magnesium. If this move is successful, it will not completely prohibit Germany from purchasing, at least it can reduce its purchases. The achievements of the Anglo-French blockade against Germany can also be more remarkable. Many economists have suggested negotiating an Anglo-Soviet barter treaty, in which the UK can supply the Soviet Union with machinery and engineers. At present, the Soviet Union purchases 70 percent of its machinery and tools from the UK. The purpose is to build the navy. The Soviet Union also needs British products such as rubber, cocoa, and wool. (Associated Press, 26th)

German Statement: Resolute Non-Violation of Neutrality

Berlin: The German official news agency today once again solemnly declared that Germany has absolutely no intention of violating the neutrality of other countries. Regarding the London British News Agency's report that Germany will launch a fierce attack on the Western Front, and the claim that it will pass through Belgium or attack the Netherlands, this question is dismissed as a completely malicious fabrication. The purpose is to arouse neutral countries' fear and hostility towards Germany. (Hai Tung News Agency, 26th)

Chamberlain Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons

Poland Has Not Given Up the Struggle; Britain and France are in Complete Agreement

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain today gave his fourth statement in the House of Commons on the war situation, saying that the people of the world are deeply moved by the heroic resistance of the Warsaw and Hel Peninsula Polish garrisons. Despite suffering brutal and continuous bombardment, they remained steadfast and did not surrender. The Polish people have not given up the common struggle to this day. The impact of the Soviet government's actions on the Polish situation since the statement was made in the House of Commons on September 20th has become increasingly clear. Soviet troops have been advancing rapidly in various places. The Prime Minister reiterated that the German and Soviet governments have agreed on the demarcation line published in the September 23rd joint German-Soviet communique, saying that according to this demarcation line, the Soviet troops have approached the outskirts of Warsaw, and most of Galicia and the Polish oil fields have been placed under Soviet rule, which is particularly noteworthy. The Prime Minister continued to say that the Red Army communique did not state that the Soviet army had fully occupied the territory it was entitled to, and its area exceeded half of the entire Polish territory. The Polish army was attacked from both sides, and it could not maintain its position. The Prime Minister then mentioned the second meeting of the Supreme Military Council. We are pleased to welcome French Prime Minister Daladier and his colleagues to participate. The British government's opinions on the path it has followed in dealing with various developments since the last meeting on September 12th and the implementation of the agreement are in complete agreement with France. The two governments have also reached an agreement on the issue of munitions and supplies. (Reuters, 26th)

### Pittman Announces New Neutrality Law Compromise; US President Has the Right to Designate War Zones; Sale of Munitions to be Handled on a Cash-and-Carry Basis

Washington: Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Law, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has consulted the opinions of various committee members and drafted a compromise plan to win over isolated factions of senators. At the same time, the government attaches great importance to the proposal to repeal the arms embargo clause and strives to implement it. At yesterday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was unanimously decided to use the Neutrality Law Amendment Bill proposed by Pittman as the basis for discussion. The main points are as follows: (1) Repeal the arms embargo clause. All kinds of goods, including munitions, can be transported to the belligerent countries, but they should be handled in accordance with the "cash purchase, transport, and own responsibility" clause. (2) The establishment of a state of war in a certain place should be jointly determined by the President and Congress. (3) Prohibit American ships from transporting passengers and goods to belligerent countries. (4) Prohibit American ships from entering war zones designated by the President of the country. (Havas, 26th)

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced the new neutrality law proposed by the government today, but at the request of Senator Borah, the Foreign Relations Committee will take no action on this proposal before Sunday, because Borah claimed that he could not vote until after studying it. The articles of this case include the following points: (1) American ships are not allowed to carry passengers or goods to belligerent countries, and violators will be fined up to US$50,000. (2) Belligerent countries that purchase goods from the United States must obtain a certificate of ownership of the goods before the goods are loaded on the ship. (3) The losses suffered by American insurance companies on war goods shall not be the basis for claiming against the government. (4) The US President may designate war zones and prohibit American people or ships from entering. (5) Americans must not take belligerent ships except in accordance with the regulations set by the President. (6) Personnel of the Red Cross and their hired ships can be exempted from restrictions on American travel and navigation. (7) American merchant ships are not allowed to carry any weapons except for small arms necessary to maintain discipline on board. (8) Belligerent countries cannot sell their bonds in the United States. (9) Belligerent countries can only obtain ordinary commercial loans with a period not exceeding 90 days. In addition, there are provisions prohibiting the solicitation of funds for belligerent countries in the United States, and the US President has the right to issue restrictions on the use of American ports by belligerent submarines or armed merchant ships. (Reuters, 25th)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that someone asked whether the arms embargo method would be extended to the Soviet Union. According to the answer, the State Department has not made any decision. (Havas News, 25th)

Washington: According to political figures, Pittman's proposed compromise plan intends to limit the scope of powers granted to the president. Once the president designates a war zone, American ships will be strictly prohibited from entering it. In addition, the establishment of a state of war must be jointly decided by Congress and the executive branch. The "cash purchase, transportation, and own responsibility" clause will also be fully implemented, but the above clauses will not apply to American republics. In particular, if one of these republics engages in war with a non-American country, it will be treated as an exception. Most members of the Congressional rest room said that Pittman's case seemed to be aimed at the situation in Europe and Asia. The government's strategy is to use this to silence the opposition here. As a result, in addition to the abolition of the arms embargo clause becoming the focus of discussion, other points will not prolong the discussion period. Pittman himself recently said, "The bill I drafted can be passed by the Senate within 30 days." This optimistic view has been confirmed by the talks of many Democratic congressmen and some Republican congressmen. Republican congressmen originally wanted to delay matters in order to extend the term of the current special session to coincide with the date of the regular session in January of next year, but now they no longer have this hope. The party leader, Landon, the candidate for the last general election, recently said, "How the neutrality law is decided should not be based on the idea of ​​assisting Britain and France, but should be based on the idea of ​​the United States avoiding involvement in the war vortex. We do not want to assist Hitler, and there is no doubt about this." A palace spokesperson said that although domestic pacifist groups are now advocating that the arms embargo clause should be maintained, the US government does not intend to make any counter-propaganda to refute it. Texas Democratic Senator Connally said that after Pittman's case is established, there is no risk of American ships being torpedoed, which is very agreeable. (Havas, 25th)

Washington: A government spokesperson was recently ordered to make a statement saying that the Federation of Peace Organizations has written to the government regarding the issue of amending the current neutrality law, requesting that the arms embargo clause be maintained, and the government has not responded to it. The White House and the State Department are convinced that the majority of public opinion is behind it, and after directly soliciting public opinion in various aspects, they know that most people support the government's policies. For example, the results of "Fortune" magazine's test of public opinion have sufficiently proven that at least two-thirds of the total number of people oppose the isolationist advocacy and support economic assistance to various democratic countries. Another example is that the "Christian Science Monitor" has solicited opinions from 120 newspapers (regardless of party affiliation) in various places. As a result, a total of 88 supported the abolition of the arms embargo clause and supported President Roosevelt's foreign policy, while only 23 opposed it, a ratio of four to one. A certain member of Congress said that the number of letters and telegrams requesting the maintenance of the arms embargo clause in various aspects is very large. According to various estimates, the number of these letters and telegrams has broken all precedents. There are currently several powerful groups, rich in financial resources and well-disciplined, that are carrying out opposition movements. These groups can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) resolute pacifists, including about 100 pacifist groups. These groups have also formed a federation. Although it is difficult to know the exact number of members, this group is led by capable and promising leaders, and has established an agency in Washington to constantly exert pressure on Congress. (2) Quasi-fascist groups, all claiming to be true Americanism and Christianity, advocating using all methods to be unfavorable to various democratic countries, including several German-American associations, of which the association led by Nazi leader Kuhn is the most famous. (3) The Communist Party and its sympathizers, although this group has not formally decided its position on the issue of the arms embargo clause, it supports the new Berlin-Moscow axis. (Havas, 26th)

### All Nations Should Cooperate Sincerely to Protect the Security of the Americas and Jointly Maintain a Free Trade Policy; Any External Aggression Will Be Resisted —US Representative Delivers Speech at the Pan-American Conference—

Panama City. The Pan-American Conference today elected Panama's Foreign Minister, Galé, as chairman. Chairman Galé immediately delivered a speech, first expressing gratitude to the representatives of the participating countries, and then touched upon the European war. He stated that the League of Nations, the Locarno Pact, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact could originally be regarded as the triumph of spirit over matter, but now they are merely sufficient to prove the ancient Roman maxim, which is indeed a golden rule. What is the maxim? It is that only by preparing for war can peace be maintained. Chairman Galé also stated that the American continent must avoid being drawn into the vortex of war and should establish peace for the world based on truth, loyalty, justice, and freedom. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Panama City. The Pan-American Conference continued today. The chief representative of the United States, Deputy Secretary of State Welles, delivered a speech, strongly stating that the United States is prepared to assist other countries in the American continent financially and militarily to solve the various problems caused by the European war. The countries of the American continent must become strong and maintain freedom. In their mutual relations, they must strengthen the "Good Neighbor" policy and increase trade volume, but at the same time, they must not harm the interests of any neutral countries. The content of his speech is summarized as follows:

Welles began by saying, "What we are doing is creating a 'precedent'. At the Pan-American Conference held in the capital of Argentina in 1936, the representatives of the participating countries worked hard to find various methods to protect the legitimate interests of the American countries in peacetime and to maintain the peace of the American countries when wars occur on other continents. Today's meeting is actually an extension of the 1936 conference. In other words, the task of this conference is to study various individual or collective peaceful measures for the countries of the New World during this critical period to protect the national and collective interests of all countries. We must therefore decide on various appropriate measures to fulfill our neutral obligations on the one hand and exercise our neutral rights on the other. At this time, the US government is prepared to substantially increase trade volume among the countries of the Americas, maintain our normal trade with other neutral countries, and not discriminate against other parts of the world. The US government will do its utmost to maintain maritime transportation between the country and other countries of the American continent and will consider various financial cooperation and financial assistance methods to provide short-term loans to other countries of the American continent during this tense period, so that they can develop production separately to replace the production industries that have been temporarily suspended due to the impact of the war. In short, the US government is willing to cooperate with other countries in the Americas to develop the resources of those countries in accordance with sound economic plans. The US government is also prepared to provide credit loans to those countries, when necessary, through private banks or agencies affiliated with the federal government. As for various long-term credit loans, that is, those used to purchase US-made rails, machinery, textiles, and various heavy industrial products, can also be considered depending on the circumstances. However, at the same time, it is hoped that the American countries will establish agreements to ensure that exchange rate markets do not fluctuate excessively. This Pan-American commercial policy must be based on treating everyone equally and avoiding all discrimination. In other words, our trade relations should not allow various special agreements with 'exclusivity' to remain in them. Our political independence should not be constrained by the foreign policies of commercial centers. As far as the current situation is concerned, we can only maintain relative isolation, because certain powerful countries on other continents have already changed their commercial and production systems to use them as tools to pursue their political ambitions. In this regard, the most urgent thing for us to do is to strengthen our strength. We have seen many times how the weak suffer. I believe that the twenty-one republics of the Americas should issue a clear declaration to the belligerent countries, stating that the rights, normal commercial interests, and the safety of their people will not be threatened by the belligerent countries near the coast of the New World. This is the time. At a time when the European war has broken out thousands of kilometers away from the American continent, the American countries have not participated in this war. At this time, issuing a declaration of principle stating that we have the right to defend ourselves, so that the crises and consequences caused by the European war will not affect us, is a matter of course." As for the current war in Europe, "it is still possible to resolve international disputes through negotiation." "No country has any moral reason to impose war on mankind, no matter what. It must be known that the only way to establish peace is for all countries to cooperate with each other and accept international law and moral order. Otherwise, mankind will never have peace. In the countries of the Americas, we have created an American system, an American way of life. This is our main contribution to world civilization. We must do our best to protect this way so that it can last for a long time. At a time when the living standards of other countries have been completely destroyed, our living standards should be firmly maintained. The power of our restoration of world order based on law should not be shaken. All aggressive threats, whether direct or indirect, must be firmly resisted. We should do our utmost to maintain a free commercial policy for those who are prepared to cooperate with us, and we should strengthen the consensus and common goals among the countries of the Americas," he said. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Shipping Issues: Theme of the Conference

Panama City. Shipping issues between American countries are one of the themes of this Pan-American Conference. Regarding this matter, representatives from the United States and Cuba have submitted proposals. The main approach is to draw a "Great Neighbor Sea" around the American continent, which is exclusively for navigation by American countries, so that it will not be threatened from outside. The US representative advocated drawing the sea surface within three hundred miles of the coast entirely as a "continental sea" as a navigation area for ships of American countries. The proposal made by the representative of Cuba is broader and seems to be supported by most representatives. In addition, it is rumored that representatives of certain countries also intend to raise the issue of how to deal with German cargo ships anchored in ports of American countries for discussion at the conference. Those countries that still have outstanding debts from the German side believe that if they can dispose of the German cargo ships, it will not be difficult to recover the debts, and the cargo ships can be used to navigate between American countries, which has two benefits: (1) It can prevent the cargo ships from becoming pirate ships after leaving the ports of various neutral countries. (2) It can prevent Germany from nominally selling the cargo ships to third countries, pretending to be of other nationalities and continuing to operate as usual. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Berlin. More than 100,000 members of "Hitler Women" will be conscripted to participate in field cultivation work in the next few days. After completing the physical examination, they will be assigned to 1,600 work camps. As of September 30, 800 work camps have been completed. Women aged 17 to 25 will be gradually recruited. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

### General Fritsch: State Funeral; Brauchitsch Delivers Speech, Praising Fritsch's Achievements

Berlin. The coffin of General Fritsch, the former commander-in-chief of the German Army, arrived in Berlin at 11 o'clock last night. When the train arrived at the station, eight mountain officers carried his coffin off the train and placed it in the hall of the Ministry of Defense. This morning, it will be sent to the Linden Cemetery for Martyrs. The state funeral will be held at 11 o'clock. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Berlin. At the state funeral of General Fritsch, General Brauchitsch, commander-in-chief of the German Army, delivered a speech, saying that General Fritsch occupies an extremely high position in Prussian history and German history. Since he joined the military, he has been loyal, diligent, and industrious throughout his life, seeking happiness for his country, his people, and military affairs, and working tirelessly. When Fritsch was a lieutenant general, he was the first to rescue the defense of eastern Germany in 1918. At the beginning of 1934, Führer Hitler entrusted him with the important position of commander-in-chief of the army, ordering Fritsch to use his rich experience to create a modern and large people's army and cultivate a spirit of invincibility. Indeed, in this German-Polish war, the German army, with its huge strength and strong spirit, disregarded life and death, and bravely attacked the enemy, causing the enemy to flee in panic. This is all due to General Fritsch's effective training. In the future, no matter who talks about the victory of the German army's invasion of Poland, they will inevitably mention the name of General Fritsch, and General Fritsch's great spirit of creating a powerful German army will live forever in the life of the German army. What is particularly commendable is that Fritsch always set an example in his dealings with others, seeking from himself before asking others. With his spirit of not deceiving himself in a dark room, he was permanently loyal to the German Führer, the people, and the army from beginning to end. He not only sacrificed himself for the country and left his name in history, but also left behind his fine words and deeds for all time. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Berlin. The state funeral of General Fritsch, the former commander-in-chief of the German Army, who died in battle outside Warsaw a few days ago, was held at the Cemetery for Martyrs in Berlin this morning. General Göring, Minister of Aviation, presented a wreath in front of the tomb on behalf of Führer Hitler. After General Brauchitsch, commander-in-chief of the Army, delivered a eulogy, the coffin was placed in the tomb. Other important German party, government, and military figures, such as "Führer's Party Representative" Hess, General Keitel, General Milch, Admiral Raeder, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, and senior military officers of various services, paid their respects in front of the tomb. Public agencies throughout the city flew flags at half-mast in mourning. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

### British Air Force Attaché, Maule, Dies in the Line of Duty

London. The British Air Force recently published a list of casualties, which stated that Captain Maule, the former Air Force Assistant Attaché of the British Embassy in Shanghai, has been "missing." It is believed that he has died in the line of duty and is the first British person in Shanghai to die in the European war. Maule had an unusually thrilling experience while in China. In October 1937, the British Embassy car he was riding in was strafed by Japanese aircraft on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Maule escaped unscathed, but Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was seriously injured. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Fierce Battles Unfold at Key Points Between Xinqiang and Miluo on the Yuehan Railway; The Southwest Battle of Guiyi is the Most Intense; The Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Losses Crossing the Miluo River to Invade the South, with More Than 7,000 Killed and Wounded

Chongqing. According to military news from the Chinese side received here today, after the Japanese army in northern Hunan crossed the Xinqiang River on the Yuehan Railway, they have landed near the two places of Luojiao and Yingitan on the east bank of Dongting Lake. (It is reported that the Japanese army is now besieging the station on the bank of the Miluo River. The Miluo River crosses the railway at that point and flows into Dongting Lake. At present, fierce battles are taking place in Zhongjiawan, Huangshajie, and Taolin between Xinqiang and Miluo on the Yuehan Railway. It is reported that a force of the Japanese army in the north is advancing south along the railway. At the same time, the Japanese army that landed in Yingitan north of Xiangyin is reportedly advancing east, attempting to cut off the railway in Miluo.) (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Changsha. Today is rainy. The war situation in northern Hunan stabilized after the afternoon of the 26th. The Chinese army still resists the Japanese north of the Baihui line in Xiangyin. At the same time, the Chinese army in the various units of Xicha and Changlejie continuously flanks the Japanese army, causing a major threat to the invading Japanese army. (Dispatch on the 26th)

Chongqing. The war in northern Hunan is still ongoing in the rugged area between the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River. The intensity of the war is unprecedented since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. In addition to the existing 60,000 Japanese troops, the Japanese troops from Hankou are also coming to reinforce the area. It is expected that the war will become even more tragic in the future. According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese army in the first echelon in northern Hunan is clearly trying to advance towards Changsha. Their forces include two divisions and one mixed brigade. Another full division is stationed in the Wuhan area. As for those attacking the Chinese army positions in the Nanchang area, there are only three divisions. After landing in Yingitan, the Japanese army has lost 2,000 people. The Japanese side is now reinforcing the Japanese army in Yingitan. In addition, the Japanese naval gunboats originally planned to enter the Xiang River to disrupt the rear, but due to the shallowness of the Xiang River, they could not penetrate deeply. Furthermore, according to the spokesperson, generally speaking, the Japanese military strength has increased compared to before. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

Guilin. The center of gravity of the war in northern Hunan shifted to the Miluo River basin on the 25th. After forcibly crossing the river, the Japanese army in Hejiatang is now engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the area of Sanxingqiao (southwest of Guiyi on the railway line) and Dalu (east of Xinshi on the railway line). The Japanese army in Xinshi continued to attack the Chinese army fiercely on the evening of the 25th. There has been no change in the Zhongxingjie area. The attack by the Chinese army on the Yingitan road at Dongtang and its attempted eastward and westward crossing of the Japanese army has been resisted, and the war situation on this road has been extremely fierce on the 25th. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. On the nights of the 24th and 25th, more than ninety Japanese motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, arrived from Huangfangtan to reinforce the area. (Dispatch on the 26th)

Somewhere in Northern Hunan. General × met with war correspondents from various newspapers on the front lines of Northern Hunan on the 25th and issued the following statement on the war situation in Northern Hunan: "Since the Japanese army captured Wuhan in October 1938 and occupied Yueyang, the Japanese army originally intended to take advantage of the situation to capture Changsha, but they have been unsuccessful for a long time and have finally become helpless. In the past six months, the Japanese army has been attacked by us everywhere and has had to put aside its dream of marching south to Changsha. They have been exhausted by 'mopping up' our army all day long. Therefore, the enemy knows that our army and people are united in resisting the war bravely. If they want to invade Changsha, they will not succeed without concentrating their powerful forces. Therefore, they transferred the ×th Division, the ×th Division, and the ××th Division, as well as parts of the naval landing force, to reinforce Northern Hunan, together with the ×th and ××th Divisions, which were originally guarding that area. Starting from the 14th of this month, they began to attack our area southeast of ×× and the line of the Xinqiang River. With a large number of enemy aircraft, they bombed repeatedly and released a large amount of poison gas. Our officers and soldiers, holding the determination to die, calmly responded to the battle. They have the spirit of being with the enemy or being without the enemy, and gave the enemy a major blow. The enemy's deaths and injuries have been above 7,000, and 50 to 60 motorboats have been sunk. The enemy knew that it was not easy to attack head-on, so they used more than 100 shallow warships to carry more than 3,000 enemies to infiltrate Dongting Lake on the south side, aiming to attack the flanks. Under the cover of enemy aircraft, they forcibly landed at places such as Luojiao Baiyuqi, attempting to invade Xiangyin and cooperate with the frontal attack. For days, our defending soldiers have repeatedly engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, fighting fiercely to this day. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties and is currently fighting fiercely. I have the responsibility to defend the territory and will command my loyal soldiers, sharing weal and woe with our officers and civilians, and upholding the spirit of unyielding resistance to deal with the enemy to the end, so that we will not fail to live up to the heavy trust of the party and the country," and so on. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Chongqing. The Chinese military authorities do not express concern about the recent developments on the front lines of Hunan Province. It is said that Changsha is not very important from a military point of view. The Japanese army's attack this time is purely for political reasons, in order to leave an impression when Wang Jingwei establishes a new government in Nanjing. The Chinese army had announced twice after the fall of Hankou and Nanchang that it intended to abandon Changsha. A Reuters dispatch from the Hunan Province front line a year ago also mentioned that senior Chinese commanders had expressed their intention to abandon Changsha and fight a decisive battle with the Japanese army in the mountains of western Hunan, Hengyang, and Binqing. Recently, Li Zongren and Chen Cheng have both expressed the same opinion and solemnly declared that the fall of Changsha will not affect the outcome of China's resistance. Because the Chinese army is prepared to fight a decisive battle with them in areas where the Japanese army cannot use railways, highways, waterways, and plains. The Chinese military authorities reiterated the above remarks and clarified that the Chinese army will not make a strong resistance in Changsha. It is said that the Chinese army has been preventing the Japanese army from crossing the Xinqiang River for a year. The recent attacks by the Chinese army near Tongcheng and Tongshan are aimed at strengthening the Chinese army's defenses along the Yuehan Railway. According to recent visitors from the front of the Xinqiang River, many interesting things have happened in the past year when the Chinese and Japanese armies confronted each other across the river. Because the river is very narrow, soldiers on both sides often write paper notes, wrap them in stones, and throw them to the opposite bank, most of which are asking about the food and general living conditions of the soldiers on the other side. Recently, the water level of the river has dropped, which seems to facilitate the Japanese army's crossing of the river. When he passed through Changsha, he saw that the residents had actually moved out, and the situation was the same as after the big fire last year. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Chongqing. A Chinese military spokesperson said this afternoon that the Japanese army is currently attacking Changsha in three directions. The main force is advancing south along the Yuehan Railway, the second force is moving east after landing on the southeast bank of Dongting Lake, threatening the rear of the Chinese army, and the third force is advancing southwest along the highway.

Chongqing. According to a Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese army currently in Central China has a total of seven divisions south of the Yangtze River and three and a half divisions north of the Yangtze River, using Hankou as a base to threaten Yichang. From the perspective of the overall situation of the Japanese army in Central China, the Japanese army seems to be taking Changsha as the center, Yichang as the right wing, and Nanchang as the left wing. At the same time, because the Japanese military strength in Central China has increased, there may be important developments in the war in Central China this winter.

### Standards for Judicial Personnel Expenses in War Zones

Chongqing - The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in response to the large number of judicial personnel withdrawing from various war zone provinces, previously drafted and implemented the "Registration Measures for Judicial Personnel in War Zones." These personnel were registered and assigned to work in courts and prisons in non-occupied areas, with a monthly living allowance of 30 to 50 yuan to provide relief. Recently, due to rising prices, the original living allowance was too meager to sustain livelihoods. Therefore, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has revised the "List of Living Allowances for Judicial Personnel in War Zones," increasing the monthly allowance to a range of 30 to 100 yuan, divided into nine levels. The amount of the living allowance is determined by the seniority of their original position. These measures have been submitted to and approved by the Supreme National Defense Council and will be implemented immediately. It is expected that the lives of judicial personnel in war zones will be improved.

List of Living Allowances for Judicial Personnel in War Zones: Court intern clerk, 30 yuan; Court inspector, 30 yuan; Grade A new prison pharmacist, 30 yuan; Grade B new prison, Grade B branch prison, and court detention center candidate warden, 30 yuan; Grade B branch prison instructor and medical officer, 30 yuan; Court candidate clerk, 35 yuan; Grade A new prison candidate warden and teacher, 35 yuan; Court clerk and interpreter, 40 yuan; Grade A new prison warden, 40 yuan; Grade A branch prison and Grade B new prison instructor and medical officer, 40 yuan; Grade B new prison chief section warden, 40 yuan; Court detention center official, 40 yuan; Court detention center medical officer, 40 yuan; Supreme Court Procuratorate entrusted clerk, 50 yuan; High Court Procuratorate chief clerk, 50 yuan; High Court branch and District Court chief clerk, 50 yuan; Court forensic doctor, 50 yuan; Grade A physician, 50 yuan; New prison chief section warden, 50 yuan; Grade A new prison instructor and physician, 50 yuan; Grade B new prison warden, 50 yuan; Branch prison warden, 50 yuan; Court detention center director, 50 yuan; Court candidate judge and prosecutor, 60 yuan; District Court division chief, judge, and prosecutor, 70 yuan; Supreme Court Procuratorate recommended clerk, 70 yuan; High Court chief clerk, 70 yuan; Grade A new prison warden, 70 yuan; High Court, High Court branch division chief, judge, and prosecutor, 80 yuan; High Court branch, District Court president, chief prosecutor, 80 yuan; High Court prosecutor, 80 yuan; High Court chief prosecutor, 90 yuan; High Court president, 100 yuan.

### With Japan as the Hypothetical Enemy: Large-Scale U.S. Army and Navy Maneuvers in Hawaii; Over a Hundred Warships to Concentrate in the Pacific, Testing Pearl Harbor's Defense Capabilities

Honolulu - The U.S. Hawaiian Division, currently stationed in Hawaii, will begin seven days of field exercises today, focusing on practical defense strategies against a hypothetical enemy landing on the north shore of Oahu. (26th United Press dispatch)

Washington - The U.S. Navy plans to hold impressive exercises in Hawaii, with most of the warships currently stationed along the western coast of the United States participating. Last night, officials confirmed the Navy Department's plan. It is believed that the naval exercise program was prompted by the European war or Japan's intensified war against China. Informed sources indicate that the U.S. concentration of most of its warships in Hawaii may deter Japan's aspirations to seize British, French, and Dutch territories in the Far East. Currently, there are twelve battleships, fifteen cruisers, sixty-one destroyers, four aircraft carriers, ten submarines, and thirty-one auxiliary ships stationed in San Diego and San Pedro. Navy officials stated that all warships will be included in the naval exercises, with the possible exception of battleships. The Navy Department's plan to hold exercises in Pearl Harbor, the "Gibraltar of the Pacific" for the United States, was announced at the same time as the construction of the massive aircraft carrier "Hornet." Navy officials stated that the Hawaiian exercises are to test the invulnerability of Pearl Harbor. Fleets will be sent to Hawaii at any time, and while one team is practicing, another will arrive in advance to prepare to participate. Navy Department officials stated that the reason for the Navy's choice of Pearl Harbor as the exercise location is that it is "not crowded." Informed sources indicate that Pearl Harbor is heavily defended, and the naval exercises are being kept secret to prevent leaks.

Washington - An Associated Press reporter learned last night that the Navy Department is "seriously considering" dispatching several teams of U.S. warships from San Diego and San Pedro to Pearl Harbor for "practice." The Navy Department stated that the fleet's transfer to Hawaii is only a "temporary plan," and it does not seem necessary to transfer the entire U.S. fleet to enhance Pearl Harbor's defenses. In the near future, the fleet to be transferred to Pearl Harbor will consist of many destroyers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Navy officials also stated that it is still questionable whether battleships will also be sent to the "Gibraltar of the Pacific." Unofficial sources here believe that the action can indicate the U.S. government's intentions. Observers believe that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet has now received the assistance of the Air Force, as fourteen U.S. long-range bombers flew to Manila yesterday. In addition, the aircraft carrier "Langley" also sailed from Honolulu to Manila. (26th Associated Press dispatch)

### Two U.S. Artillery Units Stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico

New York - Two U.S. artillery units, carrying many anti-aircraft guns, suddenly arrived at the port of San Juan in Puerto Rico. Their purpose is clearly to protect the U.S. defense in the Caribbean Sea. This is the first time that U.S. troops have been stationed here since the Spanish-American War in 1898.

### Ambassador Gu Weijun Meets with French Premier; Content of Talks Unknown

Paris - French Premier Daladier met with Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun yesterday. The content of the talks was not announced. (26th Associated Press dispatch)

### Japan's Diplomatic Moves: Versatile; Plans to Adjust Relations with France; New Ambassador Sawada Takes Office

Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch states that former Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Renzo Sawada, held an imperial audience at the palace at 1:50 PM today for his appointment as the Ambassador to France. Prime Minister Abe also attended. The cabinet has formally decided to transfer former special envoy to China, Tani Masayuki, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sawada served as a military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in France before World War I and as a counselor at the embassy from 1932 to 1934. (26th dispatch)

Paris - Political figures here recently stated that relations between France and Japan have clearly eased since Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact. This is because the Japanese government appointed Admiral Nomura as the Foreign Minister, which is seen as a move towards closer relations. Nomura has never been hostile to Western democratic countries and has even criticized the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. This shows that the propaganda from the German side, claiming that Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union, or even Germany, Italy, Japan, Soviet Union, and Turkey, would form an agreement, is absolutely unbelievable. Moreover, the Japanese government appointed Sawada as the Ambassador to France yesterday. The position had remained vacant since the departure of the previous ambassador, Sugimura. The Japanese government once considered appointing Tani Masayuki as the successor, but the French government refused because Tani had made statements to the press criticizing the French government for allowing foreign arms to pass through Vietnam to China. After that, the Japanese government did not propose any other candidates until now. The appointment of Sawada as the new ambassador is a compromise measure by the Japanese government, which is generally welcomed here. However, all these signs of reconciliation do not mean that Japan is completely approaching Western democratic countries. The true meaning is that the Japanese government is only concerned about the Far East issue and still wants to maintain good relations with the enemies of Germany. (25th Havas dispatch)

### Soviet-Japanese Border Demarcation Work Nearing Completion; Mongolian Border Troops to Withdraw to the Boundary Line

Tokyo - The Soviet-Japanese mixed commission responsible for demarcating the border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia will complete its task today. Soviet and Japanese troops will withdraw to the boundary line in accordance with the ceasefire terms. (26th Huitong dispatch)

Chongqing - This morning, various Chinese newspapers here commented on Japanese-American relations, all stating that the United States is unlikely to change its attitude towards Japan unless Japan abandons its aggression in the Far East and maintains the Open Door Policy in China. Japan's eagerness to adjust its relations with the United States shows the effectiveness of the U.S. embargo. (26th Reuters dispatch)

### Regarding the Implementation of the National Mobilization Law: Prime Minister Abe Obtains Special Powers; A "Ministry of Trade" Added to the Cabinet; Attempts to Profit from the Opportunity of the European War

Tokyo - The Cabinet today authorized Prime Minister Abe to implement the Mobilization Law. According to Article 55 of the Japanese Constitution, the Japanese Prime Minister is on equal footing with other ministers. However, after Abe obtains this special power, the ministers must exchange views with the Prime Minister when issuing orders regarding the Mobilization Law. At the same time, the Prime Minister has the power to issue instructions to the ministers when implementing the Mobilization Law. According to observations in Japanese political circles, the Prime Minister's acquisition of this special power will not cause constitutional disputes. At the same time, the Cabinet also decided to establish a Ministry of Trade, with the following objectives: (1) To formulate a unified plan for foreign trade; (2) To formulate local plans for trade with "Yen bloc countries and third countries; (3) To strengthen the policy of foreign trade. (26th Associated Press dispatch)

Tokyo - Prime Minister Abe had an audience with the Emperor this afternoon to request a ruling on the enforcement order of the National General Mobilization Law, etc., which was decided in today's Cabinet meeting. The government authorities then issued the following statement:

Regarding the enforcement and control of the National General Mobilization Law, etc., "Article 1" Each Minister of the State, such as the Governor-General of Korea, the Governor-General of Taiwan, the Special Envoy to "Manchukuo," the Director of Karafuto Prefecture, and the Director of the South Seas Agency, shall issue orders necessary for the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law (including the National General Mobilization Order for Kwantung Province and Imperial Ordinance No. 317 of Showa 13, the same hereinafter). In the event of repeal or amendment of this enforcement order, the Prime Minister shall consult with them. "Article 2" Regarding matters concerning the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law by the Prime Minister to relevant ministries and agencies, necessary instructions may be given for control. "Supplementary Provisions" This Order shall come into force from the date of promulgation. (26th Domei dispatch)

### No Signs of German Troops Invading the Netherlands

Brussels - Regarding the news of the concentration of German troops near the border of the Netherlands, the "Belgian Independence Newspaper" correspondent in The Hague, Netherlands, recently sent a telegram denying this. It is reported that Germany has not concentrated troops near the border of the Netherlands. "The towns and cities bordering the Netherlands are prepared to receive refugees from the Rhineland, which shows that the country does not intend to take any action against the Netherlands. The military measures it is currently taking seem to be intended to prevent its soldiers from fleeing to the Netherlands. Even the border defense is not entirely undertaken by German troops. For example, the section from Aachen to Eckelenz is defended by Slovak troops. The equipment and supplies of these soldiers are poor, and there have been no escapes. Therefore, the Netherlands is optimistic about the near future, believing that the crisis of German invasion has been reduced to some extent. Germany and the Netherlands are both able to take into account the rights and obligations of neutral countries." (26th Havas dispatch)

### Mid-Autumn Football Friendly Match: Donghua vs. St. Francis Today Morning

The Mid-Autumn Football Friendly Match between Donghua and St. Francis will be played at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:30 AM. The match will be held at the Yiyuan Stadium this morning at ten o'clock. After Donghua defeated Lakers last weekend, their morale is high. It is generally believed that the team's strength has not diminished due to the departure of Jiang and Xu. The defense is partnered by veterans Chen Hongguang and Zhuang Youren, and is as solid as a rock. Under the leadership of Dai Linjing, the forwards Jia Wan on both wings are experienced, and Yu Wu is serving as the inside forward, which has made up for the team's previous deficiencies. However, the center back line is weaker, resulting in a loss of connection. St. Francis is a dark horse. In the two games played this season, they lost to Lido and defeated North West Children. Their strength should not be underestimated. A fierce battle is expected. However, Donghua, taking advantage of the remaining power of defeating Lakers, may not find it difficult to capture the victory in one fell swoop. Both sides can adjust their personnel during the game. All Donghua players will attend on time. Tickets are uniformly priced at five corners. The lineups of the two teams are recorded as follows:

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The informal market for British and American exchange rates was unpredictable, but the overall situation was initially loose, then tightened again, depending on the strength of buying and selling. The market opened with strong selling pressure due to reports that Britain and France had refused to negotiate peace with Germany, causing the market to loosen. The British pound was at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 8125. The US dollar was at 7.125 yuan. Subsequently, due to Hua Hang such as Shanghai and Hong Kong Electric tending to sell, and Chinese merchants also selling more than buying, and a certain American bank supplying more actively, although Sassoon and the Japanese bank were absorbing, the supply still exceeded demand, causing the British pound to once harden to 4 shillings, 4 pence, 4375. The US dollar also loosened to 7.4375 yuan. Later, because Western merchant Sassoon continued to absorb strongly, and Chinese speculators also turned to buying, the situation began to stabilize. In the afternoon, smaller speculators generally came to cover their positions in view of today's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Sassoon also had a buying appetite, and the banks' willingness to supply was weak, so prices gradually tightened, softening to a closing price of 4 shillings, 2 pence, 8125 for the British pound and 7.09375 yuan for the US dollar, as the banks' buying and selling prices. After deduction, both the British and American currencies loosened by 0.03125. The trend for September and October futures was the same as the spot market. Trading was brisk throughout the day.

Chinese Merchants in Hong Kong All Selling

At the beginning of the morning, London's large transactions were flat for both near and distant months. The price of the American bank also did not rise or fall. The price of London raw gold was fixed. Exchange rates: British pound against US dollar, against Shanghai, and against France were all flat. US dollar against British pound was up by 25, against Shanghai was down by 15 cents, and against France was down by 1 cent. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings, 2 pence, 8125 for the British pound and 7.125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound was down by 0.03125, and the US dollar was up by 0.0625. After opening, the Chinese bank of Shanghai first sold spot British pounds to foreign banks at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 3125. Subsequently, the Chinese banks continued to sell, and Hong Kong Electric and a certain American bank also showed a strong willingness to sell. With Chinese merchants selling more than buying, although Western merchant Sassoon and the Japanese bank still had an appetite for buying, the foreign banks' buying appetite was weak, resulting in a loosening trend. Chinese banks, Hong Kong Electric, Chinese merchants, etc., successively sold spot British pounds to foreign banks such as Youli and Hua Bi, from 4 shillings, 2 pence, 3125, hardening to 4375, and spot US dollars from 7.125 yuan to 4375. At the same time, a certain bank sold spot US dollars from 7.125 yuan to 3125 to Sassoon, Chinese merchants, and the Japanese bank. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. Around 10:15 AM, Western merchant Sassoon and the Japanese bank Zhengjin again absorbed spot British pounds from foreign banks at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 375 and 3125, and spot US dollars from 7.375 yuan, softening to 1875, so the underlying trend slightly leveled off. Nearing noon, Chinese merchants again sold spot British pounds to foreign banks at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 375 and 40625, so the situation trended to be loose and hard again. Extending to the noon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings, 2 pence, 375 for the British pound and 7.28125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the morning opening, the British pound continued to loosen by 0.09375, and the US dollar hardened by another 0.15625.

Sassoon Showed a Strong Buying Intention in the After-Market

In the after-market, Western merchant Sassoon's buying appetite became even stronger, and Chinese merchants also followed closely, and because the foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak, the situation suddenly turned severely tight. Sassoon and Chinese merchants successively bought spot British pounds from foreign banks at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 34375 and 28125, and spot US dollars from 7.25 yuan, shrinking to 125. At that time, Chinese merchants also bought Youli's October US dollars at 7 yuan, and then bought Anda's October British pounds at 4 shillings, 2 pence, 21875. Extending to the evening closing, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings, 2 pence, 28125 for the British pound and 7.09375 yuan for the US dollar. This month's prices were the same as spot prices. October British pounds were 4 shillings, 2 pence, 234375, and October US dollars were 6.96875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current British and American currencies both loosened by 0.03125.

Hong Kong's US Dollar Slightly Loosened

Hong Kong, 26th telegram: The exchange market opened stably this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 4 yuan, to 346 yuan. At 10:35, it was firm. The spot US dollar loosened by 0.0625, to 25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 10 yuan, to 336 yuan. The noon closing was stable. The Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 4 yuan, to 340 yuan. The market opened stably at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, with no changes in the market.

Tianjin's Exchange Market Also Lengthens

The spot US dollar also lengthened by 0.0625, to 5.9375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, remaining at 117.5 yuan. The "Joint Note" informal market rose slightly by 25 cents, to 86.5 yuan.

### Gold Prices Were Supposed to Fall Before the Holiday, But Instead They Rose

Yesterday's spot gold bullion informal market situation: because foreign exchange fluctuated unpredictably, market prices also rose and fell rapidly. Overall, the market was initially weak in the morning, but rebounded sharply in the evening. Market sentiment was firm, and the closing price reached the high peak of the day. At the initial opening, hearing that foreign exchange was loosening sharply, buyers were hesitant to move forward. The market opened and immediately dropped to 4,020 yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain money exchange industry pulling up, it once rebounded to 4,050 yuan, but soon, due to foreign exchange loosening, selling pressure rose again. In addition, a certain gold shop sold quite a lot, causing the price to retreat to a low of 3,970 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange tightened, stimulating buying pressure. The Hong Kong gang showed a particularly strong buying intention, and the price immediately returned to 4,070 yuan. At noon, due to foreign exchange loosening slightly, the price was pressed down slightly to close at 4,030 yuan. In the early afternoon, the situation was still stable, but later, because foreign exchange tightened, retail short sellers rushed to cover their positions. A certain gold shop also came to buy again, soaring to close at 4,105 yuan, a rebound of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still brisk, with a volume of about 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry initially fell and then rose, ultimately with no increase or decrease. Customs gold, etc., remained flat. Today, because it is the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the industry will stop meeting for one day.

Spot Gold Rebounded by 20 Yuan

Since the initial opening of each bar (10 taels) in the morning, the foreign exchange was quite loose and people's hearts were soft, lacking support. The market opened and was actually pressed down by 65 yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded 10 taels, for 4,020 yuan. After opening, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the low to absorb, immediately rebounding by 30 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 30 taels for securities businesses, for 4,050 yuan. Thereafter, due to the increasingly sharp loosening of foreign exchange, and a certain gold shop selling forcefully, the price again announced its inability to support, falling straight down by 80 yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the money exchange business, for 3,970 yuan. Soon, as foreign exchange stopped loosening and turned tight, buyers immediately became active, but no one was selling, jumping by 30 yuan. The money exchange business bought 20 taels for jewelry stores, for 4,000 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop suddenly came to purchase on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, and foreign purchases continued to gradually tighten, so the price rebounded by 70 yuan. The money exchange business bought 10 taels each for jewelry stores and gold shops, for 4,070 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange again tended to loosen, coupled with a certain money exchange business frequently coming to sell, it turned down again. Soon, it fatigued and fell by 45 yuan. The money exchange business bought 30 taels for cash gold shops, called at 4,025 yuan. Nearing noon, a certain jewelry store forcefully absorbed 100 taels, raising the price to 4,038 yuan. The money exchange business sold 10 taels to the gold shop, for 4,030 yuan as the noon closing price. The post-market initial opening was still flat, with money exchange businesses mutually trading 20 taels, still at 4,030 yuan. Then, the securities business sold 10 taels to the money exchange business, for 4,025 yuan. Thereafter, because it was heard that foreign exchange was tightening sharply, stimulating buying pressure, a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange business (on behalf of the Hong Kong gang and the local gang) competed to absorb forcefully, and those floating short were also eager to cover their positions, rising straight up, breaking through the 4,100 yuan mark. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels from its peers, for 4,105 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rebounded by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the closing, a certain gold shop again gave a certain jewelry store 30 taels, again raising the price by 10 yuan, to 4,115 yuan. The daily range was 135 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was about 40 yuan lower. The current premium gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.

Jewelry Initially Fell and Then Rebounded

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores was still 415 yuan at Datonghang. Until 9:30 AM, it fell sharply by 1 yuan. At 10:20, it rebounded by 5 yuan. At 2:50 PM in the afternoon, it again rebounded by 5 yuan. As a result, there was no increase or decrease. The price at Datonghang was still 415 yuan. The price at Xinhua ng was also the same as the above price. Buying prices all had to be reduced by 20 yuan.

### Discount Rate Slightly Increased

Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange slightly increased. Initially, it was still around 75 yuan per thousand yuan, once stepping down to 67 yuan. At noon, it suddenly rebounded to 72.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 80 yuan, eventually slightly returning down to 77.5 yuan, a rebound of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the money industry association was still listed at 20 cents.

### Foreign Currency Fluctuated Unpredictably

Yesterday's foreign currency also fluctuated unpredictably due to the rapid tightening and loosening of the exchange market. American dollar tickets were initially traded at 14.2 yuan, then gradually retreated to 13.8 yuan, rising to around 14 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, because the exchange market was quite tight after Sassoon and others made strenuous efforts to compete, people's hearts were encouraged, and the interbank trading price rose to 14.3 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 5 cents compared to the previous day. Annam tickets also rose by 5 cents. British gold tickets fell by 40 cents. Hong Kong tickets fell by 5 cents. French franc tickets were down by 0.5 cents. Japanese gold tickets were down by 3 cents. The rest remained unchanged.

### Indian Silver Plummeted

London, 25th telegram: The silver market was calm and mediocre, and even more stagnant after closing. Transactions were done according to the listed prices. Large transactions for both near and distant months had no increase or decrease. New York telegram: American spot prices were unchanged. Mumbai telegram: The Indian silver market was unstable, resulting in a hardening. Spot prices fell by 1 rupee 4 annas. October fell by 1 rupee 8 annas. November shrank by 1 rupee 7 annas. The total number of transactions was 100.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Gang Buying, Ten-Count Coarse Yarn, Market Didn't Fall with the Fine Threads

The yarn market was stable, and the situation entered a spinning state. This was because, although people's hearts were good, customer sales were flat and weak. Except for continuous demand from the south, other gangs' buying appetite was not healthy. The upward strength of 20-count yarn lacked strength. However, Hong Kong gangs' buying of 10-count coarse yarn was gradually becoming active. As for the industry's buying trend, it was also stronger for coarse yarn than for fine yarn. The original reason for this was that coarse yarn was cheap, so more people were changing their intentions to focus on 10-count yarn. However, the inventory of this cotton yarn was weak. When actual transactions occurred, of course, there was a possibility of price increases. Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market will be closed for one day.

The current yarn market in the morning was still enthusiastic, and asking prices were very high. However, customers bought dozens of bales of 20-count Double Globe, and prices rose by 5 yuan. The asking price for Double Horse was particularly high, and no transaction was made. The stack started at 755 yuan, which was good for 50 days. Bargaining in the middle was still high, and the number of customers was not large, remaining flat. By closing time, it had slightly rebounded. A survey of half-day transactions showed 1,200 bales, and the market prices were 20-count Double Horse down by 13 yuan, Heavenly Maiden down by 12 yuan, and Double Globe down by 5 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn was stable. Today, 80 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 15 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 95 pieces were shipped to Beihai, and 35 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amounts bought by each gang are listed below:

Peers 755 Hong Kong 360

Inland 85 Statistics 1,200

### Cotton: Factories Watching, Industry Buying and Stockpiling Not Lacking

The need for white cotton bales was still mostly from peers, but most factories were watching and not moving forward. The situation was relatively quiet. However, there were many who were optimistic about price increases, so there was no shortage of households buying, stockpiling, and depositing. Market prices trended upward. Today, the source of cotton from northern Jiangsu continued to be strong, with over 2,900 bales arriving again. Owners, seeing the good situation, had a strong desire to raise prices. As for stockpilers, although there were absorption measures, the storage positions were congested and there was no time to find new ones, making recruitment particularly difficult. Therefore, the asking prices remained normal and could not rise, roughly the same as the previous day. There was talk of top-quality goods opening at over 152 yuan, and there was no significant difference for less good goods. Today, 150 bales of cotton were exported to Hong Kong, and 250 bales were exported to Guangzhou Bay. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Tongzhou Flower 150.00 Peers Bought 600 Bales Scale Weight at the Pier

Also 151.00 Also 500 Bales Also Also

Also 152.00 Also 200 Bales Also Also

Also 147.00 Yifenghao Bought 300 Bales Also Also

Also 148.00 Peers Bought 300 Bales Also Also

Changyinsha 144.00 Qingshenghao Bought 500 Bales Cash Note Pier Delivery

White Lockheed 172.00 Peers Bought 200 Pieces Also Also

Another report: Yesterday's transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was due to the arrival of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all industries intend to discuss transactions again after the holiday. Also, because the exchange rate loosened, the factories' intentions also loosened. Because of this, there were no transactions heard yesterday. The market price for advanced American new specials was 190 yuan, and White Lockheed was 176 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: In the New York cotton market, due to the selling of overseas cotton merchants and the decline from India, the market situation could not be revived. Later, some industry purchases caused the market price to rebound. As a result, the closing price was not very different from the previous day, slightly rising one or two pounds. The Indian report predicted a drop of 2 rupees, the Egyptian report predicted a drop of more than 30 pounds, and the Liverpool report predicted a drop of 7 pence.

### Textiles: Suit Woolens, Popular Colors Are Vegetable Green and Evergreen

Due to the autumn sales season being in full swing and the winter sales season about to start, trading was quite brisk and deliveries were crowded. Although suit flannel prices were expensive, sales were still largely active. Due to a lack of inventory, department stores have all skyrocketed in price. Buyers were already accustomed to this and were not surprised. Recently, in the new suit woolens, the most popular colors are vegetable green and navy blue. A close look at the incoming goods shows that, regardless of flannels, shammies, Harris wool, smooth wool goods, overcoat wool, etc., these two colors had already been cut and sold out, indicating the popularity and strong sales of navy blue and vegetable green. Customer demand was specified and prosperous.

On the 27th, 47 pieces of textiles were exported to Haikou, 3 pieces were exported to Beihai, 36 pieces were exported to Guangzhou Bay, 205 pieces were exported to Hong Kong, and 85 pieces were exported to Xiamen.

### Securities: Internal Debt Spinning

Yesterday's informal securities trading was thin, and the fluctuation range was small. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, trading was stopped in the afternoon, so both long and short positions watched each other. There were a few scalp trading transactions to embellish the market. Market prices also floated between one or two cents. This brewing situation seemed not easy to break for a while. Yesterday, there were no transactions in Type D and 96, and the market was very quiet. As a result, except for Type E being down by a small 5 cents, the rest were slightly better by 5 cents to 20 cents. The number of transactions was about 200,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category High Low Closing Compared to the Previous Day

Unified A 52.95 52.80 52.90 Up 0.20

Unified B 45.85 45.75 45.85 Up 0.05

Unified C 45.50 45.30 45.40 Up 0.05

Unified D -- -- -- --

Unified E 44.60 44.35 44.55 Down 0.05

In stock trading, 30 shares of Chunghwa Book Company were traded at a price of 26.75 yuan.

Also, the General Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's stock market continued to be quiet, and the turnover was relatively small. Shanghai Yarn Mill shares rose again to 157 yuan. At closing time, there were sellers at that price. Other stocks changed very little. A small number of rubber stocks were traded, and prices fell slightly. There was demand for China Enterprise Corporation shares at a price of 28 cents. Someone offered 54 yuan to buy the latter's bonds. If this is calculated based on the value of the upcoming new shares, it is still very cheap, because the value should be 74 yuan.

London, 25th telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks have not yet fully opened. The stock prices are stable, and there are basically no increases or decreases.

London, 25th telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt still include the four types: French, Chinese, and American currencies. The market is stable and there are no changes.

### Grains: Japonica Rice Settled, Customers and Sen Rice Fell Sharply in the Afternoon

Domi and Hexia: A total of 3,000 to 4,000 packages of car-transported buns arrived for the southern port gang No. 5. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival closing day, and the rice market is closed for one day. Also, the market announced that, since the summer season has passed, starting from October 1st, it will be open as usual every week. Therefore, the early market opened, and this street bought more. At the same time, customers had a voice to shout prices high. However, until midday, the store appetite loosened, and the situation fatigued again. The market saw small results and appropriately became fixed. However, broken japonica rice was tight due to scarce goods and insufficient supply. Hexia early and late rice had been out of stock for many days, and yesterday's arrival was only five loads, so it was sold out in a flash. Customer traders hoarded and opened at 34 or 35 yuan. The rest, such as special ordinary japonica rice was 40 yuan, middle-market goods were 37 yuan, special tin japonica rice was 39 yuan, high-quality goods were 37 or 38 yuan, middle market was 35 yuan, Su Tong was 35 yuan, Fengjing original package was 37 yuan, Kunzhuan Zhoupu new japonica rice was 27 or 28 yuan, Xin Yangjian was 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan, Lujian was 26 yuan to 25.5 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian was 24.3 yuan to 23.5 yuan, Wuhu Jian was 25 yuan to 24.3 yuan, middle was 24 yuan to 23.5 yuan, Chen Jian was 23.4 yuan to 23 yuan, Bianyuan was 33.5 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous was 33.5 yuan to 33 yuan. The number of transactions was about 6,000 packages in the unified market.

Customer Sen Rice: The morning market transactions were lively, and the market was once lifted by the rising prices of japonica rice and Yangjian. The market once rose by 50 to 60 cents. However, because the market's inventory was full, and the source was continuously flowing. In addition to the fact that Japanese merchants continued to ship 3,000 to 4,000 packages, Jiangbei Sen and others were also shipped from Hongkou. With so much supply, the market trended down with people's hearts. As a result, each Sen was 30 to 40 cents less than the previous day. Nanjing Special Sen was 25 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Sen was around 24 yuan, and Wu Sen was 23 or 4 yuan.

### Flour Market Spinning, Mid-Autumn Festival Market Closed for One Day

Wheat Flour: Yesterday's spot flour trading continued to show lively signs. After the north and south gangs' customer sales were active the day before, new transactions continued. The retail transactions on this street were also due to the Mid-Autumn Festival mooncake season, and various pastry shops had a complex need, so the actual sales on this street were quite busy. However, the market was ultimately affected by the large dumping of the Japanese factory's future flour and the factory's urging customers to pick up goods, and was unable to expand for a while. The total number of transactions in the unified market, including Benke, was over 50,000 packages. The factory's plate for No. 2 flour was still 7 yuan in cash, and returned goods were 7.05 yuan to 7.156 yuan. The Mid-Autumn Festival market will be closed as usual for one day today.

Wheat: Yesterday's source of wheat was not much. Due to the festival edge, the number of peddlers decreased, and the warehouses had a thick inventory, mostly in the hands of traveling traders, and did not rush to accommodate late hands. Because each factory had a large amount of flour, the need for raw materials was very flat. The turnover of traders was also limited, so the market was stable. Yesterday's buying appetite in the market warehouse was not asked about due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, so transactions were quiet and there were no transactions.

Exports: 5,500 packages of wheat flour were shipped to Xiamen, 14,000 packages were shipped to Hong Kong, 150 packages were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 160 packages of wheat were shipped to Xiamen. Yesterday, 150 packages of wheat were shipped from Beisha.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Bean Sales Market Bustling, Market Price Increased by Another 20 to 30 Cents

Among the miscellaneous grains, the sales market for broad beans is more extensive than other grains. Regardless of high, medium, or secondary goods, people's coarse grains, or livestock feed, there is no interruption in the four seasons, and foreign exports are also lively. Therefore, since the release of new broad beans, its process has always been in a superior position. Recently, the north and south oceans have been in urgent need of going to road, and market prices have frequently risen. However, because the transportation route is inconvenient, and the cost has heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes, high-quality goods arriving in Shanghai are scarce. Yesterday, the market in Wujiang chose green (upper and middle goods) at 9.5 yuan to 5.5 yuan, and more than 170 packages were transacted. Other kinds of green-skinned broad beans were taken away by this street at more than 700 packages. Traders from Shandong bought 250 packages of Jiading white-skinned broad beans. Foreign Zhuang traders asked about Chongming Sha silkworm for more than 4,000 packages. Today, the market will be closed due to the Mid-Autumn Festival order for one day.

Exports: Today, 1,630 packages of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, 80 packages were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 85 packages were shipped to Xiamen. 600 pieces of fork bean cake were also shipped to Xiamen. 1,350 packages of raw peanuts, 470 packages of peanuts, and 280 packages of sesame seeds were all shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 370 packages of beans were transported from Beisha.

### North-South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Have Already Arrived

The Zhangzhou-produced orchid bamboo branch U branches, etc., had their sources blocked due to traffic blockades for nearly two months. Now it has been approved for accommodation. Currently, there are eight civilian ships coming and going to transport goods. Therefore, the Meinan Wheel imported yesterday, and a total of 734 boxes of orchid bamboo branches, etc., have been transported in. Large ones can be opened in the next few days.

### 五金二十四號　大馬口鐵　銷滯價軟
Tinplate No. 24: Sales Slow, Prices Weak

Tinplate, which had been rising wildly for a long time, has been quiet recently. Sales to customers have stalled, and business for local manufacturers is also sporadic. It is said that many in the industry are selling off due to the poor environment, resulting in an unusually soft price environment. No. 24 goods are particularly affected. The current market price is only around 700 yuan per box. It is noted that the highest price for these goods had previously fallen to 1,000 yuan plus change, representing a significant drop of 300 yuan. While there has been no further decline in No. 26 products, there has also been no increase. American goods, packaged with 56 sheets per box, are selling for 465 yuan, while British and Italian goods, packaged with 50 sheets per box, are selling for 430 yuan.

Black Steel Billets Enjoy Strong Sales
The trading of black steel billets remained lively yesterday. Local mirror factories, can factories, and printing factories are all purchasing. Demand from customers such as those in Tianjin is also strong, making the market quite bustling. However, the market currently has ample supply, and overseas orders are constantly arriving, leading to overcrowding in Shanghai and inevitably impacting the standard market prices. The current market price is 94 or 95 yuan per box (200 pounds), a drop of four or five yuan from before.

English Military Zone Forbids the Presence of Puppet Police
Puppet Police Driven Out of the Tianhou Palace Yesterday
Japanese Troops Continue to Erect Three More Boundary Markers

Inside the Tianhou Palace at the northern end of the Henan Road bridge, there was a puppet "Social Affairs Bureau Office." Yesterday (the 26th) at 6:15 PM, a patrol of British soldiers passed by and discovered two armed puppet police officers. Since the area was part of the British military zone, they questioned the presence of puppet police. They entered the palace, expelled the puppet police, and conducted a search. All other puppet police were forced to withdraw. At the time, refugees at the Ci Lian General Association's Ci Lin refugee shelter inside the Tianhou Palace were unaware of the situation and panicked, fleeing in droves and disrupting traffic. Upon hearing the news, the police immediately dispatched two red armored vehicles carrying a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to restore order. According to investigations, the British military has stated that they will not allow puppet police to be stationed in the Tianhou Palace. Whether the Japanese will exploit this situation remains to be seen.

Japanese Troops Continue to Erect Boundary Markers
Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, another Japanese military truck carrying over ten soldiers arrived on North Henan Road. They continued to erect boundary markers at the intersections of various side roads on the east side of North Henan Road, including: (1) the entrance of the Gong Tai store next to the small vegetable market at the intersection of Wenjian Shi Road; (2) above the traffic police command post at the southern end of Haining Road; and (3) next to the postal box on North Bazilu. Combined with the four markers erected the previous day on North Suzhou Road, Tiantong Road, Qipu Road, and the south side of the small vegetable market on Wenjian Shi Road, there are now a total of seven markers in the area.

Schools in the Area Move Classes
In recent days, Japanese soldiers have frequently patrolled the area, either on foot or by bicycle, and have been repairing the barbed wire fence on North Jiangxi Road. There have been no other unusual activities. The Japanese military has not yet occupied the railway hospital on Bazilu. The British military continues to be stationed and guarding the bunker at the end of North Henan Road. Shops and residents in the area remain calm as there have been no restrictions or inconveniences. However, most schools plan to relocate. Peiben Elementary School on North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu moved its classes to a new location on Aierjin Road yesterday.

Forced Injections Temporarily Halted
Next to the Japanese-built tents outside the Shanghai Telephone Company at the western intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, there have been no sentries since the 22nd, except for one Japanese soldier. Under the tents, local residents were forced to receive preventative injections, between 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. The forced injection continued yesterday morning. However, yesterday afternoon, the injection site suddenly announced that the medicine was used up and halted injections. It was not stated whether they would continue today.

Fuxin Flour Mill Urgently Demands Pickup
Flour and Wheat Piled Up Like Mountains
Indirectly Affecting the People's Food Supply

Since the outbreak of the European war, prices have soared, causing great alarm. Speculation and hoarding have become increasingly rampant, with daily necessities being the primary target of speculators. Flour, which is related to the people's food supply, has also been subject to hoarding and speculation. Recent market surveys show that there are over five million bags of flour and one million bags of wheat currently stored in the city. Combining flour and wheat, this is enough to feed the city's residents for nearly two years. From a supply and demand perspective, the market appears small and should not be subject to risky speculation. While there is a shortage of rice and prices are soaring, wheat flour, which supplements the people's diet, is reportedly piled up in large quantities, nearing spoilage and waste. This seems contradictory. Recent reports have noted that the Fuxin Flour Mill is urgently demanding pickup of stored goods, which appears to be for good reason. Investigations at the factory confirm that wheat is piled up outdoors with almost no space left. A factory representative stated that the warehouses are full of customer's flour, which has caused the raw materials to be stored outdoors and exposed to waste. The factory cannot do anything about it and has been forced to reduce operations, causing double the losses for both the factory and its customers. Holders of warehouse receipts are certainly aware of this, but the reason for delaying pickup is either due to being misled by rumors of currency inflation or other factors. They believe that real goods are more secure and reliable, and they are willing to engage in hoarding and speculation. They do not realize that the need for flour is determined by the availability of rice. The highest price of white rice has exceeded 40 yuan per shi, and flour can be used to adjust the people's diet. However, a large amount of flour is stored in factory warehouses, causing direct and significant losses for the factory and its customers. The people's diet is also indirectly and invisibly affected. At a time of food panic, it seems that it would be wise for hoarders to stop at a reasonable point, without requiring the attention of the authorities. The factory is currently taking measures to urge customers to pick up their goods, which can indirectly reduce the risk of speculation and hoarding.

Military Attachés from Various Countries to Meet with Japanese Representatives
The United States, Britain, and Italy Discussed Results
Proposals Difficult to Accept

The Continental Daily News reports that a Japanese naval spokesperson stated yesterday (the 25th) at a press conference that the military attaché of the Italian defense force commander stationed in Shanghai will hold a meeting with Japanese officials "within a few days." It is reported that on September 14th, the Japanese Navy convened a meeting of the defense force commanders of Japan, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States. French military officers were also present as observers. During the meeting, the Japanese side requested revisions to the defense plan for the International Settlement, stating that the existing plan "is outdated and has lost its reason for existence." The foreign defense force commanders agreed that their military attachés would formulate a practical plan to revise the defense system, then hold meetings with the Japanese side to continue discussing the matter.

Japanese Plan is of Great Importance
Regarding the adjustment of the defense zones of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai, the Japanese side presented a specific proposal at a meeting of military attachés from various countries on the 22nd. However, the contents of the proposal, as determined by the Japanese side, may not be disclosed. Therefore, the outside world has no way of knowing the details. However, reporters from the Da Zhong News Agency learned from highly reliable sources yesterday that the commanders of the defense forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy, after discussing the Japanese proposal, believe that it is extremely detrimental to the interests of the settlements held by various countries and cannot be accepted. Therefore, they plan to convene a meeting of the defense force commanders of various countries within a few days to formally submit the matter for discussion. However, it is reported that the meetings of the military attachés (i.e., the working group meetings) are still in progress.

Admiral Hart to Return to Shanghai Next Month
Admiral Glassford to Go to Hankou

Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, left Shanghai aboard the private yacht "Isabel" at 3:00 PM on the 19th of this month to handle important matters in North China. Before his departure, Admiral Hart indicated that he would return to Shanghai at the end of the month. It is now learned that Admiral Hart has decided to adhere to his original plan and will return to Shanghai on October 3rd aboard the flagship "Augusta," which is conducting summer patrols in North China. His private yacht "Isabel" will also return to Shanghai at that time. The U.S. Navy ship "Marblehead," which is currently docked at the U.S. naval pontoon, recently received orders from the U.S. Navy Department to prepare everything. According to a U.S. naval officer on the ship speaking to reporters, if the situation in Shanghai eases, the ship will set sail for Qingdao on October 4th after meeting with Admiral Hart. Otherwise, it will remain stationed in Shanghai. Additionally, the U.S. ship "Luzon," which has been docked in Shanghai for a long time, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hankou to fill a defense position. Admiral Glassford, commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, will travel to Hankou aboard the "Luzon" to inspect the Yangtze River defenses.

Public Buses Operating in Western Shanghai
Obstructed by Puppet Police
Puppet Police Caused Trouble Twice Yesterday
Assaulting Drivers and Ticket Sellers, Halting Traffic

Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the settlements, the Municipal Council has submitted a report on its negotiations with the Japanese side to the Consular Body for handling. However, as of yesterday, there have been no new developments. Meanwhile, the activities of puppet police in western Shanghai are becoming increasingly rampant, with the potential to create a serious situation at any time. The authorities must not delay in resolving this issue any further. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:

One Wave Subsides, Another Arises
Since the kidnapping of driver No. 390 of Route 10 public bus at the Wujiaochang intersection in Caojiadu a few days ago, he has not yet been found. Incidents of thugs running rampant in the Caojiadu area continue to occur. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a Route 10 public bus (license plate No. 1) departing from the Wujiaochang intersection in Caojiadu collided with a rickshaw as it approached the first stop at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Conty. The Route 10 bus sustained minor damage. The driver and ticket seller, No. 612, got out of the bus to reason with the rickshaw puller. As they were arguing, police and puppet police gathered to investigate. Suddenly, a man in Western attire stepped forward to intervene. The ticket seller told him that he did not need to get involved. The man became angry and slapped the ticket seller in the face. At the same time, several thugs arrived and, without asking questions, severely beat the driver and ticket seller, shouting, "Take them to the station!" The driver and ticket seller realized the situation was bad and took the opportunity to escape into the crowd. Soon after, a large number of puppet police arrived and searched the area, but found nothing. The public bus company dispatched other drivers and ticket sellers to continue working, but they were stopped by the puppet police, who said that they would have to wait until the company brought the escaped driver and ticket seller to them. As of 6:00 PM, the driver and ticket seller had not yet returned to the company, and their whereabouts were unknown.

Residents Panic and Relocate
Since the incident a few days ago when U.S. sailors were detained by puppet police on Yuyuan Road, the police have increased patrols. In addition to stationing six puppet police at the intersection of Difeng Road, two puppet police officers with automatic rifles led a formation of six armed puppet police officers on patrol. As a result, the situation became tense again. Furthermore, around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Japanese military police conducted a census in Zhaofeng Village (near Zhaofeng Park), informing residents that they would begin collecting rent from October 1st. Upon hearing this, residents became uneasy and began relocating in greater numbers. There were also reports that several puppet police officers were stationed in front of the British military headquarters on Difeng Road yesterday morning. When reporters inquired with the British military headquarters, they denied the rumors.

The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Definitely Become Abnormal
The Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Municipal Council stated yesterday (the 25th) in response to inquiries that negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "City Government" regarding the dispute over roads beyond the boundaries of the settlements have not progressed. In recent days, residents in the areas outside the settlements have felt uneasy due to the presence of both Settlement police and "City Government" police along the roads outside the settlements. Currently, every Settlement traffic police officer is accompanied by a "City Government" police officer, either standing side by side or one in front of the other. There have also been reports of them opposing each other while directing traffic. Officials from the Municipal Council and the Police Department acknowledge that the situation in the area has become abnormal. However, it has been stated that they have taken all possible actions to alleviate the difficulties. The Police Department continues to manage the roads outside the settlements.

Puppet Police Not Stationed at British Headquarters
The English-language Great Evening Post reported that rumors circulating this morning (the 26th) that "Da Dao" police had been stationed in front of the British military headquarters on Difeng Road were investigated this afternoon. The British military headquarters denied the rumors. Reporters then visited the area and found that the rumors were untrue.

Autumn Festival Celebrated Peacefully
Financial Situation Exceptionally Stable
Interbank Lending Rates Unchanged

Yesterday was the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival account settlement day. There was a surge in receipts and clearing of bills at various firms, and businesses were able to recover their outstanding debts in full and make considerable profits. Therefore, payments owed to various firms were also paid off as scheduled. Although banks and financial institutions did not handle account settlements during the Mid-Autumn Festival, they extended their business hours due to busy collections and clearings. Various industries also extended their business hours due to the Mid-Autumn Festival. There were no unfortunate incidents in the city.

Lending and New Transfer Increased Significantly
The joint lending committee of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as the reserve treasury of the Banking Association, made every effort to regulate interbank lending. (1) Lending by the interbank lending committee increased slightly in September due to the Mid-Autumn Festival account settlement day, totaling over 18 million yuan. (2) The amount of new transfers used by various firms totaled over 22 million yuan at the end of August, and increased sharply in September to over 25 million yuan. The Shanghai financial market was extremely stable after regulation, and interest rates remained unchanged. The foreign exchange lending rate in the money market remained at two jiao yesterday, so various industries were able to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival account settlement day peacefully.

Banks and Financial Institutions Take One-Day Holiday
Member firms of the banking and financial industries' associations, as well as the reserve treasury, bill clearing house, and market, the foreign exchange market of the Central Bank, and foreign banks will all be closed for one day today. Business will resume as usual tomorrow. The banking, financial, foreign exchange, and foreign banking associations have all announced that Wednesday, September 27th, will be a customary holiday for the Autumn Festival, and the clearing of bills due on that day will be postponed to tomorrow (the 28th). All trading markets, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn, cotton, and miscellaneous grains, will also be closed for one day.

Traditional Customs Not Avoided
Shanghai residents cannot avoid traditional customs for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and every family is preparing to celebrate the holiday. Businesses are thriving, and mooncakes and incense burners are being purchased in large quantities. Residents often burn incense burners and buy mooncakes to celebrate the holiday. Mid-Autumn Festival gifts are also exchanged, resulting in significant expenses. Spending on mooncakes alone amounts to tens of thousands of yuan. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, sales of chicken, fish, vegetables, and other food items have tripled. It is expected that all entertainment venues will be overcrowded today. This abnormal situation is not appropriate during the war of resistance. It is reported that there has been an enthusiastic increase in donations to refugee relief organizations, with money saved from celebrating the holiday being donated to aid refugees.

High Tide Expected Today
High Tides in the Morning and Afternoon
High Water Levels

Today (the 27th) is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, a high tide is expected on the Huangpu River, with a predicted water level of around 12 feet. There will be high tides in both the morning and afternoon. Low-lying roads may flood again, which deserves attention.

Polish Embassy Receives Official Telegram
Polish Government Moves to France
Similar to the Belgian Government in Previous Years
Possessing Full Sovereignty and Extraterritoriality

The North China Daily News reports that the Polish Embassy in China received a telegram from Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck yesterday (the 25th) stating that on the nights of September 17th and 18th, Soviet troops pressured the Romanian border aggressively, attempting to cut off the narrow, unoccupied strip along the border. Polish President Mościcki and the Polish government were forced to enter Romanian territory. The Romanian government granted them the right to enter and pass through the country with the understanding that President Mościcki and others would respect Romanian neutrality. The French government has invited President Mościcki and the Polish government to France on a similar basis as the invitation to the Belgian government in 1934, to establish a Polish government with full sovereignty and extraterritoriality.

Japanese Planes and Warships Attack Aojiang
British Ship Suffers Minor Damage to Deck
Passenger Injured by Shrapnel
Shipping on the Line Will Be Disrupted

Japanese Spokesperson Denies Permitting German Ships to Sail Along the Coast

The Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping line was previously disrupted by repeated harassment from Japanese planes and warships. It was blocked by Chinese military authorities, resulting in the stagnation of traffic between Shanghai and Wenzhou for a long time. At the beginning of this month, the British ship Xin Anli was granted permission by Chinese authorities to test the line. After successfully returning to Shanghai, other ships followed suit. However, the Japanese side announced that it would reimpose a blockade of the Ou River from the evening of the 17th of this month, hindering the navigation of foreign ships. The Shen You, owned by the British company Yilong, changed its route to Aojiang, more than 100 miles from the mouth of the Ou River, to load and unload passengers and cargo. The British ships Kai Si Deng and New Beijing also followed suit on the line. However, shipping circles received a telegram yesterday stating that on the morning of the 26th (yesterday) at 9:00 AM, Japanese planes bombed Aojiang, and Japanese warships also fired artillery at the shore. Chinese troops returned fire, resulting in heavy fighting. The Kai Si Deng ship suffered minor damage to the deck from shrapnel, and the New Beijing ship sailed away from the area and headed back to Shanghai to avoid danger. It is expected that shipping on the line will again be disrupted. The Shen You, owned by Yilong, remains in its original position. According to the company, they have not received any telegrams from the captain.

Japanese Block German Ships from Sailing Along the Coast
The Continental Daily News reports that a Japanese naval spokesperson denied yesterday (the 25th) at a press conference reports that the Japanese side would allow German merchants to sail along the coast to Ningbo and other ports, saying that he had reason to believe the reports were false, i.e., "German ships can travel in Chinese territorial waters, within the three-mile limit."

Only Sailboats Allowed to Enter and Exit Jiaojiang
Reports State That Zhejiang's Seventh District Commissioner's Office Opened Haimen and Jiaojiang, Permitting the Resumption of Navigation. It Is Learned That the Blockade of the Haimen Route Was Entirely the Action of the Japanese Navy, Which Sank Hundreds of Sandboats at the Mouth of the Jiaojiang River to Obstruct the Navigation of Foreign Ships. Zhejiang Province Decided to Open Jiaojiang, Permitting Navigation, But Only Sailboats Are Allowed to Enter and Exit. Merchant Ships Are Still Unable to Navigate, Because the Customs Office Refuses to Clear Foreign Ships Bound for Haimen. Therefore, No Foreign Ships Currently Sail on the Shanghai-Taiwan Line.

Moufu Shortens Shanghai-Ningbo Sailing Time
The Moufu ship, owned by the Lihe Foreign Company, set sail for Zhenhai outside the port on the 24th and arrived safely yesterday morning. Due to the unusually large number of passengers traveling to Ningbo in recent days, the company is attempting to shorten the schedule. It has been scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 29th and depart from Shanghai to Ningbo on October 1st. Starting today, it will begin issuing letters of guarantee and selling tickets. A notice has been posted in front of the ship's ticket agent, the Dalai Bank at No. 77 Ningbo Road. In addition, the Gaodeng ship successfully tested the route to Shipu, Jianwan Songmen, and departed from Shanghai again yesterday, but focused on loading cargo and did not carry passengers.

Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Line Vigorously Maintained
The Shanghai-Fujian shipping line, which was blockaded by the Japanese military on June 21st, has been disrupted for a long time. Recently, the British companies Yilong and Huitong have dispatched ships to maintain the line. Although Japanese planes have been attacking various counties in Fujian, the Shenhua, owned by Yilong, and the Tongyun, owned by Huitong, set sail on the 24th and 26th of this month.

Japanese Authorities Monopolize Cotton in the Interior
Purchasing with Huaxing Currency
Forcing Unloading in Hongkou

The North China Daily News reports that, according to well-informed sources in this port yesterday (the 25th), the Japanese authorities are currently monopolizing cotton in the interior and forcing sailboats carrying cotton to unload in Hongkou, rather than at the docks along the Bund as in the past. It is also heard that all cotton in the interior is being purchased by the Japanese at a price of 60 Huaxing yuan per dan. When the Japanese side hosted a press conference yesterday, the spokesperson was asked whether he knew that sailboats carrying cotton were unloading in Hongkou and were not allowed to dock at the Bund. The spokesperson replied that he had not heard of the matter.

Foreign Goods Imported as Usual
Market Prices Decline
Source of Supply No Longer Lacking
Foreign Needles Have Already Fallen Sharply

Since the outbreak of the European War, prices in Shanghai have soared, and general speculators believe that the time has come and are competing to hoard goods, disrupting market prices. However, the import of foreign goods has not been disrupted by the European War, and there are sufficient stockpiles, so there is no immediate shortage. Therefore, market prices have not been as unrestricted as before. For example, foreign needles managed by Lihe Foreign Company were priced at over 200 yuan per case before the outbreak of the European War. The price rose to over 800 yuan shortly after the outbreak of the European War, and then gradually increased to 3,500 yuan per case. Now, because there is sufficient inventory on the market and the source of supply is not disrupted, the price has recently fallen to 1,700 yuan.

Polish and French Nationals in Shanghai Provide Assistance
French Organizations Established
French Red Cross to Meet Today

The Continental Daily News reports that Polish and French nationals in Shanghai will separately carry out assistance work for Polish and French soldiers in the port. Polish organizations have already been established, with Pei Erci serving as chairman, and will soon begin raising funds. The local branch of the French Red Cross, which is engaged in assisting wounded soldiers, is scheduled to meet at 4:30 PM tomorrow (the 27th) at No. 11 Huanlong Road, with Madame Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador to China, serving as chairman. The association has also scheduled elections for a male and a female committee today (the 26th) to guide work in Shanghai. Those joining the organization will be divided into three levels: members, donors, and associate members. Members pay 30 French francs or less than 500 French francs annually, donors pay 10 to 29 French francs or less than 150 to 500 French francs annually, and associate members pay at least 1 French franc annually.

American Ship Schedule Delayed
Reason Unknown
Chang and Other Ships Operate as Usual
Ship Schedules and Routes Kept Secret

The American President Lines' President Coolidge, which was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai from Little Luzon to return to the United States, was delayed by one day due to events in Hong Kong. Therefore, the date of arrival in Shanghai was also delayed. It finally arrived at the port at 11:00 AM yesterday and docked at buoys 11 and 12. It is scheduled to depart for the United States at 7:00 AM this morning. The company's President Taft, which is coming to Shanghai from the United States, has also been delayed by two days. It was originally scheduled to arrive in port today, but will now arrive in Shanghai on the 29th. The company has not announced the reason for the delay, so the details are unknown.

The British India Line's Wang Ship Elifau arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday morning and docked at buoys 14 and 15. It is scheduled to depart for Mumbai this afternoon. If it cannot load cargo in time, it may be delayed until tomorrow.

The French postal ship Ados arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It has been decided that it will not go to Japan and will stay in Shanghai for two days. It is scheduled to return to Marseille from Shanghai on the 28th.

Due to the European war, the postal ships of Changxing Company are operating as usual, but ship schedules and routes are being kept secret to avoid accidents. Passengers and cargo will be notified by the company on an ad hoc basis.

Rice Market Transactions Still Strong Yesterday
Prices Unchanged
Market Closed Today

The Rice Market Management Committee opened yesterday. The rice registered by cargo owners for sale totaled 3,061 bags. Market transactions were still strong. Although goods from various places poured in, prices did not change. The highest price for white japonica rice was 37 yuan per shi, the highest price for Changxi new indica rice was 26 yuan per shi, and the highest price for Jiangbei indica rice was 24 yuan per shi. The Rice Market Management Committee has announced that the market will be closed for one day today for the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. The announcement is recorded as follows: "According to the 40th decision of the Management Committee meeting, the summer Mid-Autumn Festival will be closed for one day as usual. The weather has cooled down, and starting from October 1st, normal business hours will be resumed on weekdays. This announcement is hereby made."

Funding for Relief Efforts is Difficult
Relief Organizations Limit Accommodation
Currently, There Are Still More Than 65,000 Refugees
Monthly Relief Costs Still Require More Than 300,000 Yuan

The problem of refugee relief in Shanghai has recently entered a difficult stage due to rising prices. Charitable organizations such as the Cilian General Association are preparing to close their shelters. The six major shelters of the International Relief Committee, after a large number of repatriations and job referrals, have now merged.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the huge amount of supplies required, has decided by the Board of Directors to limit the number of refugees accommodated by various charitable organizations to a minimum. At the same time, it will promote refugee production and encourage self-sufficiency. According to reliable statistics, the total number of refugees remaining in Shanghai is as follows: (1) The Public Concession currently has 30 large and small shelters, accommodating a total of 39,415 refugees; (2) The French Concession has two large shelters: the International Relief Committee shelter on West Yiaierjin Road, with 3,919 refugees, and the Xujiahui shelter, with 2,853 refugees; (3) The Nanshi refugee area has 88 shelters, accommodating a total of 19,209 refugees. In total, the city has 120 shelters with 65,396 refugees. With an average monthly allowance of 5 yuan per person, the monthly cost of living is 326,980 yuan. In addition, the cost of adding winter clothing and quilts, assuming half of the items are replaced, is estimated to be at least 200,000 yuan at current high prices for cloth and cotton.

Qingdao Ships Must Undergo Quarantine

The Shanghai Customs Port Affairs Department issued Announcement No. 8 regarding the requirement for all ships arriving in Shanghai from Qingdao to undergo quarantine: "It has been found that there is a cholera epidemic in Qingdao. All ships arriving in Shanghai from the port must undergo quarantine in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Announcement No. 4 of this department on June 29th of this year. This announcement is hereby made for the information of all merchants."

The August 13th Anniversary Passed Peacefully
No Incidents Occurred South of the Suzhou Creek
However, Several Pro-Japanese, Anti-Communist, and Anti-National Government Gatherings and Parades Were Held in the Areas of Binbei and the Northern Section of the Public Concession

As of the end of August, the total number of workers employed by factories in the settlement (including the area outside the Western District roads) reached 214,099.

There were 8 strike incidents, affecting 1,732 workers. The factories that experienced strikes were the Commercial Press and silk reeling factories (2 each), and flour mills and cotton mills (1 each). There are currently 37 refugee shelters in the settlement, accommodating 39,076 refugees, and 8 temporary hospitals, accommodating 845 impoverished patients. Three Chinese-language tabloids were fined by the court for publishing obscene content. Four Chinese-language newspapers and one news agency were warned for publishing inappropriate content. In addition, 11 tabloids were warned for publishing obscene advertisements.

The Shanghai Times, which had been published for many years, suddenly ceased publication at the end of last month, reportedly due to heavy losses in previous years. Thirty-eight Chinese and Western publications that had reapplied for registration were approved.

The Police Department's Guard Force was dispatched five times, including one bombing, one case of resisting arrest with gunfire, and three armed robberies. The various police stations continued to crack down on idlers, hawkers, and beggars obstructing traffic.

Shanghai After the Mid-Autumn Festival
May Find It Difficult to Maintain Prosperity
Allowing Foreign Exchange to Drift Naturally Will Not Improve the Situation Easily
Prices Will Not Return to Their Original Levels, and Returns to Hometowns Will Increase Significantly

After the fall, Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange has been manipulated for profit by speculators. Therefore, today's exchange rate can no longer represent the external value of legal tender. The chaotic situation in the speculative market can no longer be judged by ordinary rules. Although there has been a lot of trading in the exchange market recently, it is all speculative in nature. Legitimate merchants are rare. Although importers have been placing orders overseas since the sharp decline in foreign exchange and the outbreak of the European War, the legal foreign exchange of the Central Bank has remained unchanged. All industries that need to import necessities can apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee, and the committee still provides as much as possible. In the past, attempts were made to maintain Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange and were authorized by the British bank HSBC. After considering the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, it was believed that Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange was unrelated to China's wartime finance and was not beneficial to China, but instead created opportunities for Japan. Therefore, after deciding to let it drift naturally, it is difficult for Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange to improve in the short term. However, the lives of Shanghai people have been greatly affected. For example, prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased. This is especially true for those who rely on wages to make a living. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in those who cannot maintain their livelihoods and plan to return to their hometowns after the holiday. Therefore, Shanghai's unnatural, abnormal state of prosperity may not last long.

Chinese Representative Returns to Shanghai After Attending World Youth Conference

This year's World Christian Youth Conference was held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, from July 24th to August 2nd. Twenty-seven Chinese representatives attended the conference, nine of whom were elected as conference officials, and they gave detailed and accurate reports on the situation in the Far East. After the conference, some of the Chinese representatives went to study in various countries in Europe and the United States, some returned to various provinces in southwest China, and the other five returned to Shanghai on the French postal ship Ados II. Liang Xiaochu, general secretary of the National Christian Youth Association of China, was also one of them. Due to the outbreak of the European War, the ship schedule was delayed by 11 days, and it finally arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 26th) morning.

Clothing Industry Asks Western Clothing Association to Mediate Wage Increase

Due to the high prices, clothing industry workers in Shanghai unanimously agreed to request employers to increase wages in order to compensate. Yesterday, the workers' association sent a letter to the Western Clothing Industry Association, scheduling mediation. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, Due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange and soaring prices, the cost of living is increasing day by day. The wages agreed upon in last year's mediation have not been able to restore the old situation, so they are even more unsuitable for the current environment. Our association, in order to promote mutual benefit between labor and management, only seeks wages that are suitable for the cost of living and has no other ideas. We hereby request that your association, in response to the environment, uphold justice, notify member stores, schedule mediation, express sincerity, and strive to relieve the suffering of both labor and management.

### Coal: Hokkaido Coal Seizes the Opportunity to Thrive

Regarding various grades of bituminous coal lumps, although they have been arriving continuously in recent days and inventories are quite sufficient, unfortunately, the owners intentionally manipulate the market by hoarding and speculating. They are temporarily unwilling to readily sell, leading to a market with offers but no transactions, and very few deals are made. However, Japanese trading houses and foreign firms still sell to domestic merchants at the original prices, so the quoted prices remain low. Consequently, some are actively peddling the coal elsewhere. It is reported that Hokkaido coal is being offered at eighty-four yuan per ton for the No. 2 lumps, seventy-eight yuan for small lumps, and sixty-nine yuan for dust, ex-warehouse at Pootung, with transportation arranged by the buyer.
