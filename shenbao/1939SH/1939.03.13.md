### Fourteenth Anniversary of the Premier's Death: Chairman Chiang's Telegram to the Nation Announces the Implementation of Spiritual Mobilization, Hoping that the Transformation of the Spirit Will Be Reflected in Practical Actions to Comfort the Soul of the Premier and the Martyred Heroes in Heaven; Li Zongren Says Chiang's Leadership in the War of Resistance Has the Support of the Whole Country and Should Be Recognized as the Guarantee of Achieving Final Victory

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the entire nation on the 12th, announcing the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The full text is as follows: To the Commanders of all War Zones, Commanders-in-Chief, Pacification Commissioners of all Provinces, Chairmen of Party Headquarters in all Provinces and Cities, Governors of all Provinces, and to be forwarded to all officers and soldiers, and all compatriots across the country: Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the Premier's death. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, with the utmost sincerity and solemnity, announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. All the outlines, methods, and national covenants have been published in full and printed in newspapers. The Premier said, "Man has the use of the spirit, not relying solely on the material body." He also said, "Weapons are material, and the ability to use these weapons depends entirely on the spirit. Comparing the two, the power of the spirit accounts for nine-tenths, and the power of matter only accounts for one-tenth." The Premier devoted his life to the revolution and experienced battles. All his teachings were based on personal experience and trustworthy words. Examining the historical facts of the revolution, we initially overthrew the Qing Dynasty with bare hands and established the Republic of China. Later, we swore to launch the Northern Expedition, removed the obstacles of warlords, and completed national unification, all relying on the triumph of the spirit to lay this foundation. Unfortunately, the revolution was not completed, the mentor passed away early, the national crisis deepened day by day, and foreign aggression became increasingly urgent. Now the War of Resistance has entered its second phase. Looking north to Yanyun and east to Jingguo, the fierce edge of the bandit's aggression has not been curbed, the pilgrimage to the mausoleum is not possible, countless compatriots are awaiting rescue from suffering, and the lifeline of the nation and the people is in the balance of life and death. The success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is still extremely distant. Tracing the reasons for this, it is purely due to our failure to vigorously embrace the Premier's doctrines and teachings, our failure to invigorate the spirit, and our failure to concentrate our will. Or, although we were temporarily inspired, we failed to be strong and persistent, so that the enemy and bandits still harbored the idea of attacking our spirit and winning over the hearts of our people. Self-insult invites insult, and there is a reason for this. Thinking of this shame, we can understand it. The current peril of the national destiny and the rampant arrogance of the powerful bandits are due to our past spiritual and behavioral decadence and laxity, which have led to these adverse results. Now, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the stakes of victory or defeat and survival or demise are extremely high. If we still do not strive to improve, catch up quickly, jointly restore the inherent morality of our nation, and consistently develop the revolutionary spirit of the Premier, and unite under the three common goals of national supremacy, national interest supremacy, military first, victory first, and concentrated will and concentrated power, eliminate the obstacles of decadence and corruption, cultivate a vigorous and enterprising spirit, each exert their ability, and each fulfill their common duty, and work together to strive in the great cause of the War of Resistance and nation-building, how can we save ourselves and the country, and how can we face our national ancestors and the descendants of future generations? I, Chiang Chung-cheng, mourn the loss of the Premier, remember the teachings that can be followed, and recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is the foundation for building the army, building the country, and overcoming the enemy. Following this path, one can equal one hundred, and ten can equal one thousand. I sincerely hope that all officers, soldiers, men, women, and compatriots from all walks of life in the front and rear, in all provinces and cities across the country, will be sincere and faithful, deeply understand and consistently implement the points revealed in the outline and promulgation of regulations, pledge to implement the National Covenant, establish the will to resist the war, transform the spirit, and embody it in practical actions, to make a concrete commemoration of the fourteenth anniversary of the Premier's death, to comfort the soul of the Premier and the martyred soldiers and civilians in heaven. This is where we, as those who survive, can fulfill our duty to be loyal to the country, and this is where we can wash away the great shame of the Chinese nation being invaded, trampled, raped, burned, and killed by the brutal enemy. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." It is imperative to be consistent inside and out, and do not treat it as commonplace. Chiang Chung-cheng respectfully serves in the Secret Bureau, Chongqing. (Telegraph of the 12th)

(Hong Kong) Li Zongren, in a certain place, formerly told a reporter from this newspaper that Chiang is wise and decisive in leading the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians of the whole country are united in supporting him to the end. We should recognize this as the guarantee of achieving the final victory. After the war situation turned to a new stage, the Japanese army is already in a position of being besieged on all sides. However, they are still trying to fight like a cornered beast. In the future, there will still be local offensives, but it is impossible to take anything more than a few points. The situation in the second phase of the War of Resistance is expanding day by day, and Japan's resources, military strength, and finances are all extremely difficult. The result is to squeeze the people and incite anti-war actions. He estimates that Japan's war of aggression will fail in a maximum of two years. We have already determined a plan to continue fighting for five or ten years. When talking about the weaknesses of the previous phase of the War of Resistance and the adjustment of domestic affairs, he said that because the War of Resistance is intensifying, sweeping away all corrupt phenomena can achieve twice the result with half the effort. He deeply regretted Wang's initiative to negotiate peace with Japan. (Special dispatch at 11:00 PM on the 12th)

(Hong Kong) Guilin telegram: Bai Chongxi and Xu Yongchang, on the evening of the 10th, gave speeches separately at the closing ceremony of the military conference. Bai instructed all generals to pay attention to training soldiers, leading soldiers, and using soldiers, and all political and staff members to work hard to serve, enhance party power, and implement the political training of one party, one doctrine, one country, and one nation. Army Commander Du Yuming, on behalf of the whole body, replied that he would resolutely follow Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Nanyue Conference and the instructions of Director Bai and Minister Xu, work hard to reorganize and train the troops, and accomplish the mission. All the generals then returned to their defenses. Xu Yongchang spoke freely on the 11th about the situation of the northern and southern war situations, saying that after the Battle of Wuhan, it was extremely difficult for the Japanese side to find the main force of China. They had no choice but to expand and organize puppet troops, and the actual crisis was even greater because the puppet troops could revolt at any time. The military actions in Ji, Jin, Su, and Lu provinces were swift, and they specifically sought to win battles against the Japanese army and avoid defeats. If Japan's attempt to oppress failed, it would be equal to failure. Yan insisted on resisting the war in Jin province and worked hard to strengthen the political work of the army. As for the entire reorganization and replenishment work of the Chinese army, it has been largely completed, and the troops have long been replenished. The material equipment has also been strengthened, and in terms of morale, since the July 7th Incident, the morale has been rising day by day. (Special dispatch at 9:00 PM on the 12th)

Editorial

### Further Discussion on National Mobilization

A week ago, this newspaper discussed the matter of spiritual mobilization, and commented on its outline and implementation measures; in particular, it hoped that social leaders and youth, as well as leaders in various circles and institutions, would practice what they preach. Now, the Chongqing telegram transmits the full text of the outline and implementation measures of spiritual mobilization, as well as the National Covenant Pledge and its organization, which are published in yesterday's and today's newspapers. After reading this, it is found that there are some points that were not only not covered in the previous discussion, but also not clearly stated in the original text. Please elaborate on them.

So-called mobilization, of course, has no exceptions. However, if it is military mobilization, it is limited to matters related to the military, and nothing else is involved. Economic mobilization is limited to matters related to the economy, and nothing else is involved. Even in terms of the implementation of military or economic mobilization, it may be divided into several phases or several parts. In its phase and in its part, an order for general mobilization must be obeyed and acted upon immediately, needless to say; those that have not reached their phase or are not in their part are only preparing, and it is not a hasty move; moreover, from the point of view of discipline, organization, and order, it can be said that hasty action is not allowed. Therefore, the so-called no exceptions in various mobilizations is still a relative principle. Spiritual mobilization is different. All citizens must accept it uniformly and act as one, and there is absolutely no exception. This is the first thing that should be recognized.

All gatherings take faith as the center and volunteerism as the driving force; therefore, the so-called freedom of association, freedom of thought, and freedom of speech are applicable. In short, freedom is the principle; only with freedom, there is not complete agreement, nor is agreement forced; those who share the same path and the same aspirations form a society. Today's spiritual mobilization is also called a society in terms of organization. From the central government to the provinces and counties, all are called societies, and the chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee is also the chairman of the society. However, its nature is completely different from that of all other gatherings. In other words, citizens' participation in the Spiritual Mobilization Society is by no means limited to volunteers, nor is it permissible to have citizens who are so-called not sharing the same path or the same aspirations; if one were to say that they do not share the same path or the same aspirations in spiritual mobilization, then it is by no means a question of whether or not they are members, but fundamentally a question of whether or not they are citizens. Therefore, all citizens are naturally in the ranks of spiritual mobilization, and are naturally in the Spiritual Mobilization Society; there is no exception, and it is absolutely not allowed to stand aside. This is the second thing that should be recognized.

Mobilization: is a fact, is an action, must be concrete, must be active; only spiritual mobilization is slightly different. The National Covenant has only the following twelve articles:

(1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People;

(2) Do not violate government laws and decrees;

(3) Do not violate the interests of the nation and the people;

(4) Do not be a traitor or a submissive subject of the enemy;

(5) Do not participate in traitorous organizations;

(6) Do not be an officer or soldier of the enemy or the traitor;

(7) Do not lead the enemy and the traitor;

(8) Do not spy for the enemy and the traitor;

(9) Do not work for the enemy and the traitor;

(10) Do not use the enemy's and the traitor's bank notes;

(11) Do not buy the enemy's goods;

(12) Do not buy food and all items for the enemy and the traitor;

All say "do not," which are negative restrictions, and are not provisions for action. We do not need to annotate the positive significance of all these restrictive provisions, nor do we need to mention their possible effectiveness; however, the simplicity and ease of implementation of these restrictive provisions must be recognized by any country or any citizen in wartime. In terms of what the country needs from its citizens during the War of Resistance, and in terms of the responsibilities and obligations that citizens should bear to the country during the War of Resistance, they are all far above these twelve restrictive provisions; therefore, if citizens are loyal and faithful to this covenant, it is still not enough to say that they are not ashamed to be citizens during the War of Resistance; now, under spiritual mobilization, what is expected of citizens is only these twelve items, then the citizens' faithful acceptance can be said to be the minimum obligation. This is the third thing that should be recognized.

The matters involved in the covenant, or someone sells, or earns a living through labor, and thus gains profit; although this person may be forced by the needs of food, clothing, and children, and has no other intention, how can their objective results be understood! As for the general public, some may think that the prohibitions of the covenant are indeed beyond reproach, but that absolute faithfulness to the covenant may be inconvenient or disadvantageous, but because it is inconvenient and disadvantageous, there is a slight deviation, and it is still considered understandable. But where does the distinction between good and evil lie? Where does the distinction between the virtuous and the unworthy lie? The boundary between what is understandable and what is not is also easy and beneficial for the individual and for the present. This is what everyone can do, what everyone is happy to do, and what everyone will strive to do; how can there still be evil, unworthiness, or what is unpardonable in the world? The so-called good and the so-called virtuous must not consider the immediate petty interests of the individual, but only distinguish between right and wrong and choose accordingly; knowing that it is wrong, even if it is convenient and beneficial to oneself, one will not do it; knowing that it is inconvenient and disadvantageous, one will never be perfunctory and deviate, but must adhere to what is right; only in this way can one be good, only in this way can one be virtuous. In other words, the distinction between good and evil, virtuous and unworthy, lies in whether or not one can sacrifice the convenience of the individual, obtain the renunciation of what is wrong; one cannot sacrifice the convenience and benefit of the individual and perfunctorily do what is wrong, and there is no room for understanding. Therefore, one must not calculate gains and losses in what is prohibited by the covenant, and must be loyal and faithful to it. This is the fourth thing that should be recognized.

### National Spiritual Mobilization Outline: Gathering National Spirit Towards a Common Goal, Establishing a Unified National Salvation Ethic for Oneself, and Firmly Believing in a Unified Nation-Building Faith for the Country

(Chongqing) National Spiritual Mobilization Outline (Continued)

(V) Transformation of the Spirit

Now that the unified morality and unified faith that the people should establish have been clarified, we will then proceed to explore what kind of sound spirit is suitable for the military interests of the country and nation today, and is sufficient to achieve the goals of resisting aggression and building the nation. We will then cultivate or eliminate them separately to create a good, consistent environment and thoroughly transform the spirit of our nation's people. To list them by category, there are the following:

(A) The Dazed and Dreamlike Existence Must Be Corrected

Life is the foundation of the spirit. Without a rational life, there is no sound spirit. Therefore, the dazed and dreamlike existence of indulging in sensual pleasures and material gains must be thoroughly corrected, and the creed of a new life must be practiced. Otherwise, not only will the individual's energy be depleted and their spirit scattered, harming both themselves and the country, but it will inevitably become a common practice, causing the entire society to suddenly exhibit the phenomenon of national subjugation, inviting the world's contempt and the enemy's deepening intrusion, which is not only harmful to the country but also affects the military.

(B) An Aspiring and Vigorous Vitality Must Be Cultivated

Following the dazed and dreamlike existence, that which acts as a parasite on the national spirit is the atmosphere of despondency and decadence. The existence of this atmosphere is actually caused by both psychological and physiological reasons. On the psychological side, it is due to the lack of national self-confidence and individual self-improvement. People do not believe that the nation can be revived, or they view the cause of national revival as unrelated to themselves. If these two kinds of psychology are not corrected, the aspiring and vigorous vitality of the people cannot be cultivated. On the physiological side, exercise, hygiene, orderliness, cleanliness, and even the habit of getting up early must all be promoted and practiced. Only then can the national spirit be enriched, and vitality be radiated, to undertake the extraordinary revolutionary cause.

(C) The Habit of Living for the Moment and Seeking Personal Safety Must Be Eradicated

There is a spiritual phenomenon in the war of resistance that cannot be ignored, namely, the lack of determination to swear revenge among the people at the front, and the prevalence of private plans to avoid hardship and seek ease among the personnel in the rear. The former phenomenon will lead to an increase in the enemy's compliant subjects, and the enemy's influence will spread. The latter phenomenon will lead to a decrease in the nation's soldiers and weaken the will to fight. The motivation for both is due to the lack of a firm concept of national supremacy and the persistence of the habit of living for the moment and seeking personal safety. To correct the former phenomenon, it is necessary to clarify the principle of great revenge from the Spring and Autumn period, which is, "Even after a hundred generations, revenge for the country is permissible," so that the people in the lost territories will never forget the concept of national supremacy and national supremacy. To correct the latter phenomenon, it is necessary to promote the atmosphere of "offering one's life in the face of danger," and commend the loyal and righteous who have died for their duties. It is also necessary to strictly enforce discipline and promote justice, so that everyone regards avoiding duty and secretly seeking safety as the greatest shame. Only then can the spirit of revolution be established.

(D) Selfish and Self-Serving Attempts Must Be Shattered

Only seeking to preserve one's own life and property, and increase one's own fame, position, and rights, without regard for the interests and survival of the entire nation, is the same as those who have military power wanting to preserve their strength and territory, with the same selfish motive. If this selfish psychology is allowed to develop, personal opinions will inevitably be placed above all else, private reconciliation will be placed above all else, and even the expansion and satisfaction of individual fame, position, rights, and desires will take precedence over everything. Pushed to the extreme, it will inevitably sacrifice national interests and undermine the war of resistance plan. Now, when the war of resistance is fierce and survival hangs in the balance, if one is still not aware of this, it is not only unwise but also unkind. Under the purpose of national spiritual mobilization, this kind of ingrained habit must be eliminated. The authority of public opinion should be promoted and fully corrected, so as to eliminate selfish views, contribute wholeheartedly, and return to the utmost impartiality and sincerity.

(E) Conflicting and Confused Thoughts Must Be Corrected

Since the war of resistance, although the thoughts and opinions of the entire country have fundamentally formed a unity, there are still many branches and leaves that are divergent. If they are allowed to coexist in a mixed manner, they will inevitably lead the people's minds away from the principles of national and national supremacy, military victory first, and concentration of will and strength mentioned above. Therefore, it is necessary to establish standards, correct them separately, so that the foundation of unity can be further consolidated. It is especially necessary to actively guide and create a common national opinion, so that our people and youth can embrace the same ideal for the country's future in their understanding, that is, to overcome the enemy and win victory with one heart and one mind. This is also to create a permanent unity throughout the country after the war and avoid divergences and conflicts. This standard should be based on the current factual needs and national interests, which all the people of the country should and willingly accept. Briefly, they are: 1. The Three Principles of the People that do not violate the supreme principles of the National Revolution; 2. Speeches that do not advocate ideals that transcend the nation and harm the absoluteness of the country; 3. Not to undermine the unity of military and political orders and administrative systems; 4. Do not use the situation of the war of resistance to achieve any attempt other than the interests of the country and nation. All thoughts and opinions should follow this yardstick. Those that violate this meaning should be corrected and rejected together. Those that conform to this meaning should be promoted in many ways, so that from this foundation, they can be enriched, developed, and become a general trend.

The above five are only a brief overview of the main points. If we want to achieve a thorough transformation of the national spirit, we must further expand it. First, we must seek the enrichment of the national spirit, then the concentration of the national spirit, and even more the revolutionization of the people. The so-called enrichment means to make it vigorous and vibrant, strong and firm, and have the power to overcome the environment and resist difficulties. The so-called concentration means to seek its close unity, with one heart and one mind, turning the people's will into a fortress, so as to reach the state of absolute sharing of weal and woe and never being separated. The so-called revolutionization means to dedicate oneself to the revolutionary cause based on the supreme concept of loving the nation and loving the country, to be loyal to the government and doctrine internally, and to resist the enemies of the nation externally. One must be incorruptible by wealth and honor, immovable by poverty and lowliness, and unyielding by force. Furthermore, one must use this spirit to influence compatriots, and even further use this spirit to defeat enemy countries. If the transformation of our national spirit can truly reach these three standards, then the purpose of national spiritual mobilization can be said to be completed.

(VI) Mobilization Leadership

Although the target of spiritual mobilization is the entire nation, the following types of personnel are the first to bear the responsibility of advocating and implementing it:

1. Party Members and Civil Servants

Our Party, inheriting the legacy of the Leader, is implementing the National Revolution. Before the revolution's fate is achieved, our Party bears the responsibility of administering the government. Now, many provinces and regions have fallen into enemy hands, and tens of millions of people have suffered devastation. How should our Party members blame and encourage themselves, and earnestly examine whether their public and private actions are models for the general public? At the beginning of implementing spiritual mobilization for the general public, the spiritual mobilization of party members must first be carried out. Every party member must have the moral practice worthy of the heavenly duty in this extraordinary period. Compared with the general public, they must be more hardworking and diligent, more frugal and honest, and more courageous to sacrifice. This is in terms of party members. As for civil servants, especially administrative officials at all levels and local self-government personnel, they bear the heavy responsibility of implementing government orders, coordinating the military and civilians, and enriching military preparations. Their spiritual actions must be sufficient to gain the people's faith and be worthy of being models for the people. Therefore, in the implementation of spiritual mobilization, in addition to party members, it must first be implemented by civil servants in order to advocate for the general public.

2. All Military Personnel

All of our military personnel should unanimously recognize the duty of a soldier. It is not only to fight against enemy troops, but also to know that the army represents national authority and that soldiers should represent the national spirit. Moreover, in China today, when all the people's organizations have not yet been fully established, the national army is the center of the country's strength. Therefore, soldiers must become the center of the people's faith in morality. Today, the great responsibility of saving the country and the nation rests entirely on the shoulders of our soldiers. Therefore, all our officers and soldiers must first implement the spiritual mobilization of soldiers. All our soldiers should absolutely have the national salvation morality and nation-building faith, possess the sound spirit necessary for resisting aggression and reviving the nation, and never forget loyalty and filial piety. They must also be benevolent to their compatriots, trustworthy to their superiors and subordinates, and above all, respect human rights and discipline, so as to promote our nation's inherent lofty ideal of peace. If all the military personnel in the country unanimously strive to carry out spiritual mobilization and promote the glory of China's inherent morality, then the power of this will be immeasurable in its manifestation in the military, and there is no doubt that all the compatriots in the country will be unanimously moved and unanimously respond.

3. Leaders from All Walks of Life Across the Country

Before implementing spiritual mobilization among the general public, we also eagerly hope that the leaders of the national cultural, industrial, religious, and various professional organizations, as well as the backbones of society, and the respected elders in various places, will all sympathize with the purpose of national spiritual mobilization and personally act as its leaders. Since the war of resistance, the virtuous and talented people across the country have done their best to be the rear support for the country's military, and their contributions have been great, and the destruction of various cultural undertakings and industries in the war zones, and the sacrifices they have suffered, are also enormous. However, the difficulties and hardships of the country in the future will be further deepened. So far, the spiritual strength shown by all walks of life across the country is not enough to meet the needs of the country's wealth. We deeply hope that they will take a further step, take the lead in implementing spiritual mobilization, with one heart and one mind, and contribute all their strength to the country and the nation. If leaders and backbones from all walks of life can personally practice and advocate for it, then the people in various localities and professional departments will have a greater chance to follow suit and the trend will rise. As for the cultural world, the media world, and the writers, we hope that they will examine the responsibility for the safety of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. The misfortune and fortune of hundreds of generations, and the rise and fall of thousands of years, depend on whether the leaders of all walks of life can accept the meaning of spiritual mobilization at this time and fight together.

4. National Youth

Youth are the lifeline of the country. We have special expectations for the youth across the country who have received or are receiving education, regardless of whether they are out of school or unemployed. The fate of the country and the nation will certainly depend on the youth in the future, and today it also depends on the youth's efforts and dedication. Japan wants to conquer our China, and what it hates most is the youth of China. Therefore, in the enemy-occupied areas, countless youths have lost their lives and suffered misfortune. Since the military campaign, many youths in the front and rear have endured hunger and cold and worked diligently. This is something that the country should especially cherish and supervise. Today, as we implement national spiritual mobilization, we earnestly hope that the youth across the country will unanimously participate and take the lead enthusiastically before the general public. We especially hope that the youth of our country will unanimously practice China's inherent national salvation morality, and unanimously believe in the Three Principles of the People. Do not be divided, do not be doubtful, do not be decadent, do not be reckless. Unanimously believe in the supreme truth of national supremacy, national supremacy, military first, and victory first, and work together to engage in the struggle for resisting aggression and reviving the nation.

(VII) Mobilization Implementation

The implementation of spiritual mobilization largely depends on the self-awareness of each citizen's conscience, and mutual encouragement and enlightenment are the means to help them become self-aware. As for legal discipline, it should only be used to supplement the enlightenment and encouragement that is lacking. Therefore, the main work focuses on the appropriateness of advocacy, propaganda, and education. When implementing it, we must first measure the effectiveness of each work, whether it can be as we expected, and then set the goal to seek, and devote our efforts to it. Choose economical methods to seek simplicity, speed, and certainty. Avoid official articles and cumbersome procedures. Use the existing organizations and natural methods, guide the situation, so as not to disturb the people and waste time and hinder the cause. Now, the implementation aspects are divided into the subject of implementation, the steps of implementation, the methods of implementation, and the matters of implementation, which are described separately.

(A) The Subject of Implementation

The work of spiritual mobilization should be carried out by the entire party, government, military, and people, working together and jointly, in order to be thoroughly implemented. (1) On the party side, on the one hand, supervise the party members under its jurisdiction to unanimously implement spiritual mobilization, and conduct assessments and training. On the other hand, lead party departments and members at all levels, and connect with cultural institutions, using various propaganda methods to publicize the essentials of spiritual mobilization to the entire nation, negatively correct the discrepancies in the people's thoughts and opinions, and actively provide the theory to promote spiritual mobilization. (2) On the government side, on the one hand, reform the decadent and lax bad habits in society, and crack down on the life of drunkenness and dreams. On the other hand, supervise the civil servants and local self-government personnel under its jurisdiction to implement spiritual mobilization and popularize it among the entire people. At the same time, guide schools at all levels to implement spiritual mobilization education. (3) On the military side, on the one hand, political departments at all levels stipulate that spiritual mobilization is the main subject of spiritual education for soldiers, and also take the lead in promoting spiritual mobilization among the people. On the other hand, commanders of all levels of troops implement the implementation of spiritual mobilization level by level to all soldiers. (4) On the social side, various cultural groups, people's groups, professional groups, and various magazines and newspapers should unanimously use the essentials of spiritual mobilization to assist the work of spiritual mobilization by the party, government, and military, so as to be able to implement it effectively and thoroughly. (5) On the family side, on the one hand, create an environment for promoting the main points of spiritual mobilization (such as practicing thrift, diligence, hygiene, and getting up early). On the other hand, use the method of mutual encouragement by fathers, mothers, and brothers to urge all members of the family to strive for the great purpose of resisting aggression and reviving the nation. It is also necessary to universally cultivate the concept that national interests are higher than family interests. (6) Responsible Mainstay: The people responsible for promoting spiritual mobilization should be the leaders at all levels in the government and troops, the parents in the family, the principals and teachers in the school, the chairman in the group, the editors in the newspaper and magazine, and the county magistrates, township chiefs, and baojia chiefs in the county, district, and village. These are all the leaders of the group and the mainstays of the cause. On the one hand, they must be required to set an example, transform the wind, and move the wind. At the same time, they must also regard spiritual mobilization as their necessary duty, and carry it out throughout their entire cause.

(B) Implementation Steps

The steps for implementing spiritual mobilization, in addition to the planning, assessment, and interpretation of the outline for the entire spiritual mobilization work, and the supplementation of methods, etc., should set up a spiritual mobilization guidance and promotion agency to implement it. All party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should conduct the following steps in a practical manner: (1) Formulate Specific Plans: The supervisors and those in charge of party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should formulate systematic and orderly specific plans in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual mobilization outline, according to the nature of the matters listed, which belong to their own powers or business scope, and implement them in a practical manner. (2) Penetrate Subordinate Members: On the one hand, party, government, military, and civilian high-level agencies or groups should first supervise their direct subordinates and all lower-level agencies, and use opportunities such as small group meetings to formulate appropriate methods according to the actual environment, and implement them in a practical manner. They must supervise layer by layer and use methods such as competition and inspection to learn from each other, and truly penetrate every member of their subordinates to popularize it among the general public. (3) Utilize Inherent Groups: In addition to the people's groups and cultural agencies directly led or managed by the party and government agencies, other inherent groups in society, such as religious groups, hometown groups, and trade groups, should also be utilized as much as possible to help promote the work of spiritual mobilization. (4) Pay Attention to Liaison and Conduct: The promotion of spiritual mobilization in various places should be based on the principle that party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should do their best to promote it in accordance with the established plans. Those that involve the general public or multiple aspects depending on the nature of the matter should be linked and cooperated with each other.

(C) Implementation Work

The work of spiritual mobilization can be divided into the following four types according to its nature:

(1) Propaganda and Creation: For example, the suggestion of the main points of spiritual mobilization, the establishment of national concepts, the promotion of national morality, the establishment of confidence in victory, the refutation of wrong remarks, the transformation of absurd psychology, and the development and explanation of the theory and practice of spiritual mobilization, etc. This work should be carried out by the propaganda department of the party, the political department of the army, and various newspapers, schools, and cultural agencies and groups. (2) Training and Improvement: Propaganda and creation are only the first step in spiritual mobilization. What follows is training and improvement. For example, if the error of the people's thoughts has been enlightened by the method of propaganda, it must be further used to gather and other training methods to hone the revolutionary personality, establish the awareness of resisting aggression, discuss the general trend of the world, and study the historical facts of the rise and fall of the country and the prosperity and decline of the nation and foreign enemies, so as to progress together in the enrichment and unity of the spirit. Also, if the decadence of the people's will has been pointed out through publicity, it must be further promoted to expand military training and the study of hygiene, and the implementation of the new life, etc., to improve the people's physical and mental work. This work should be implemented by the social department of the party, the political department of the army, and educational institutions and schools. (3) Supervision and Persuasion: The promotion of spiritual mobilization, although it originates from top to bottom, but in order to make its effect real and not deceptive, it must also rely on the mutual supervision and encouragement of the people. In the family, family members and brothers should warn and encourage each other. In agencies and groups, all members should encourage and learn from each other. In society, regardless of the status of the people, they should supervise and persuade each other in the relationship of comrades and compatriots to promote their reform. (4) Research and Promotion: The work of spiritual mobilization is neither a perfunctory matter, nor is it enough to proceed with common sense in peacetime. It must have the spirit of research and creation. Today is an extraordinary period, so there must be extraordinary work to adapt to it. To have extraordinary work, there must be extraordinary research and design. Therefore, if we want to seek long-term progress in all aspects of spiritual mobilization, it depends on the party, government, military, and people from all walks of life to wholeheartedly research and strive to promote it.

(D) Matters of Implementation

The matters of implementing spiritual mobilization are based on the aforementioned improvement of the spirit, and the following matters are shown as a brief example, so as to touch the other things of the same kind. Detailed sub-items need to be supplemented. The following is described in detail: (1) Regarding correcting life: 1. Rectify the daily life of the people, and crack down on all inappropriate entertainment; 2. Ban luxury and falsehood and all unnecessary waste; 3. Limit consumption and reduce the import of luxury goods; 4. Persuade the people to reduce their living standards and implement universal austerity. (2) Regarding Cultivating Vitality: 1. Cherish time, cherish human resources, and material resources; 2. Expand wartime production and increase the working hours and efficiency of the whole country; 3. Organize and train the people and give them appropriate wartime work assignments. (3) Regarding Eradicating Bad Habits: 1. Publicize the failure of the enemy's strategy and the fact that our army is getting stronger and stronger in battle; 2. Expose all idle and lazy elements, and force them to serve in wartime; 3. Eliminate the dependence on international countries, fluke psychology, and the illusion of a compromise in the middle. (4) Regarding Shattering Attempts: 1. Resolutely eliminate corruption; 2. Encourage the people to destroy their homes to help the country and donate personal property to the war effort; 3. Collect all military supplies and contribute to the national government; 4. Resolutely promote various movements to contribute to the country spiritually or materially. (5) Regarding Correcting Thoughts: 1. Rectify the organization and training of people's groups; 2. Unify the organization and work policy of cultural groups; 3. Ban disputes and illegal activities that hinder the war of resistance; 4. Correct the tendency of opinions in various newspapers and magazines.

(VIII) Conclusion

As mentioned above, the content and implementation outline of spiritual mobilization have been briefly described here. Finally, there are still three meanings that must be told to those responsible for implementing spiritual mobilization, namely: (1) The implementation of spiritual mobilization must seek its thoroughness inside and out, and the entire renovation. Do not allow it to grow due to small details, so as to harm the spirit of the people. Therefore, we should examine our body and mind and strive for governance, and we must focus on the initial germination of wrong habits, and we must also start with the small details of life. (2) We must seek the persistence of its effect. Spiritual mobilization is by no means just an encouragement of temporary blood and emotion, generating a five-minute national salvation fervor. It is necessary to deeply instill the supreme concept of the country and nation in the minds of the people, and it must be verified in daily life and behavior, so that there is no guilt in the heart, and then the event can not exceed the yardstick. (3) The establishment of national spirit must seek its perseverance and steadfastness. If it is swayed by external pressure and temptation, then this spirit is not enough to complete the extraordinary cause. Therefore, the theory of the revolutionary outlook on life must be thoroughly promoted. This is also what needs to be paid attention to during implementation. In short, national spiritual mobilization is the main condition for resisting aggression and winning victory, and also the latest weapon for saving the country and building the country. Today, if the people of China are not absolutely emotionally numb, there is no one who does not deeply feel the grief and indignation of the precarious national situation and the suffering people. Therefore, it is to identify the goal and strive forward in unison, not only to fulfill one's national duty, but also to seek the highest comfort in life. And the future destiny of the nation and the nation for thousands of years will surely begin here. We hope that our compatriots will rise up together. (11th telegraph)

### Navigation on the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River: Restrictions are Getting Stricter

(Hong Kong) According to today's news, the restrictions imposed by the Japanese on foreigners' navigation on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are becoming stricter than before. The Japanese are not only inspecting passengers and cargo on foreign merchant ships more severely, but also, from March 1st, foreign ships without a Japanese procurement certificate will not be allowed to handle or transport goods. However, last week, when Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship went to purchase rice not far from Shanghai, the Japanese refused to issue a procurement certificate. When German merchant ships went to purchase rice and cotton, they were also refused by the Japanese and were only allowed to carry passengers and other small amounts of goods. The only reason given by the Japanese for refusing foreign merchants to handle goods and navigate is that the right of inland navigation in the southeastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been transferred to the Japanese Nisshin Company for exclusive operation.

### Communist Party in Madrid Attacks Suburbs; City Reportedly Cleared

Burgos – It is reported that the Communist Party is attacking the Salamonga residential area in the outskirts of Madrid and has occupied part of it. Fierce fighting is underway around the radio station of the National Defense Committee. It is also reported that Republican troops have been driven out of the three towns of Murcia, Alicante, and Cartagena by Communist forces. Several actors and actresses, identified as secret advisors to former Prime Minister Negrín, are said to have been arrested in Barcelona. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Madrid – The remaining Communist Party members in this city were completely expelled yesterday evening by the troops of the National Defense Committee. The strongholds they occupied in the eastern and northeastern districts have been abandoned, and they are retreating to the outskirts. The whole city is as peaceful as usual, but gunshots and artillery fire can still be heard from time to time in the outskirts, as government troops are still pursuing the remaining Communist forces. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Madrid – The Communist Party's provincial headquarters was originally located in the "Ritz Hotel" in this city. After the party launched its uprising, it stubbornly resisted there. Government troops immediately opened fire, causing the building to catch fire after being hit. When the remaining Communist forces retreated to the suburbs yesterday, they burned all files and documents, causing the hotel to burn down to rubble by this morning. According to a lieutenant of the government army, the fire brigade has successively retrieved a large number of new-style firearms and a large amount of food, such as sardines, meat, condensed milk, and even soap, from the hotel, which have been extremely scarce in the city since the outbreak of the war. They have been transported away in batches in as many as five military trucks, indicating that the Communist Party had been stockpiling military supplies for more than just a day. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Valencia – Several members of the Communist Party attempted to drive into the city in four tanks today, causing a rebellion. They were immediately intercepted by the detection team of the National Defense Committee. As a result of the engagement, all the Communists were arrested, and several were injured. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Madrid – The Central Committees of the Communist Party in various provinces surrendered unconditionally to the National Defense Committee this afternoon. However, the "civil war within a civil war" has not stopped immediately. Some Communist Party members are still entrenched in buildings, resisting the enemy. For example, the northeastern part of the city is still the focal point of Communist resistance. Republican troops have now recaptured the Salamanca district and the famous Alcalá Street. The trenches there are in a mess, and bloodstains are still visible. Acts of ambush from various locations have not ceased. However, the city center is relatively peaceful, and the fighting is currently limited to the eastern district. The National Defense Committee has obtained the support of newspapers and the management rights of radio stations. It is now accusing the Communist Party of colluding with Franco, saying that the Communist Party suddenly rebelled when the country was in crisis, helping Franco's momentum and weakening the Republican army. At the same time, the Communist Party retorted, saying that Colonel Casado intended to cede the territory currently held by the Republican army to Franco, and that the Communists had seized the vehicles used to transport milk for the elderly and the weak. Although transportation in dangerous areas is difficult, the authorities are still distributing food. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Vienna) – Slovak Minister of Public Works, Ďurčanský, recently made another speech, attacking the Czech government, saying that its dissolution of the Tiso cabinet was illegal, because the cabinet could only be dissolved after the Slovak Parliament passed a vote of no confidence. Therefore, the Tiso cabinet has the right to continue to administer. He also criticized the Czech government for detaining General Ťuka, leader of the Hlinka Guard, and Ďurčanský, director of Slovak propaganda. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Vienna) – An official of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) left here tonight for Bratislava. The purpose of his mission is not yet known.

(Berlin) – The German government authorities are closely watching the conflict between the Czech and Slovak ethnic groups. The former Prime Minister of the Autonomous Government of the Slovak Province, Tiso, is said to have sent a note to the German government, stating that the Czech central government's reorganization of the provincial government was a violation of the constitution and requesting that Germany uphold justice and act as protector to restore a legitimate political system. As of now, the German government has not responded. Although German newspapers say that the country does not intend to recognize the new cabinet of the Slovak Province, observers believe that the German government is unwilling to take a clear position on the "protection" of the Slovak ethnic group, so as not to cause unease in countries with minority ethnic groups, especially Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Warsaw – Foreign Minister Colonel Beck made a speech yesterday at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, involving the political situation in Czechoslovakia, briefly stating that the national concept of the Slovak ethnic group has gradually crystallized over the past twenty years. Since the Polish nation has many similarities with that ethnic group, it fully understands the wishes of that ethnic group. As for the issue of colonial land, our country's desire is difficult to achieve, and the only way to find a solution is through friendly cooperation. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Telephone communications between this city and the capital are now managed by the military authorities and are effectively cut off, but calls to Berlin and the capital of Hungary are still normal. Rumors that martial law has been declared in the province have been denied by the provincial government's information office, which also said that the provincial government will not change the legal status of the various ethnic minorities in the province. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### American Dock Workers Refuse to Load Scrap Metal for Japan; U.S. Authorities Ignore Japanese Representations; Another Aid China Rally Held in London; All-India Congress Condemns Japanese Aggression

(Washington) – According to news here today, the Japanese Embassy has asked the U.S. government to assist in obtaining wrought iron and other military raw materials in the U.S. The five ships worth of scrap iron that Japan currently intends to load in the three ports of Portland, Astoria, and Oregon have been unanimously rejected by dock workers, preventing them from being shipped out. Therefore, they have asked the U.S. government to facilitate this. The Japanese Embassy stated that this was a request, not a protest. Afterwards, when reporters interviewed State Department officials, the State Department declined to comment on the Japanese request, but its attitude seemed unwilling to take any action that would benefit Japan. The dock workers and overseas Chinese vigilantes on the West Coast of the United States have been refusing to load scrap iron for the Japanese for several weeks. To date, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the dock workers has become increasingly pervasive, with a great tendency to spread throughout the entire West Coast. (United Press dispatch, 11th)

(London) – An Aid China rally was held this afternoon, chaired by Dr. Wang Jingchun of the National Government Purchasing Commission.

The loss of Chinese schools in the first fourteen months of the war exceeded 217,000,000 yuan. China is now in urgent need of books. Oxford University intends to donate books worth between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds to China in the coming years. Someone in the meeting suggested that the cooperative movement within the United Kingdom could increase financial assistance to Chinese industries and encourage plans to export to the United Kingdom. (Reuters, 11th)

### Chamberlain Plans to Initiate World Conferences; Roosevelt Reportedly Fully Agrees; to Resolve Issues Such as Arms Limitation

(London) – The Evening Standard recently reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain plans to convene a world peace conference in London, followed by a world disarmament conference. The detailed plan includes four items: (1) resolving disputes between Germany and Italy; (2) Western European countries establishing a new Locarno Pact, ending the arms race in air forces, and prohibiting bombing civilians by airplanes; (3) convening a world conference to resolve Germany's colonial demands and other issues; (4) convening a disarmament conference. U.S. President Roosevelt is said to have fully agreed to this plan. According to government officials, the international situation is clearer than at any time in the past year. Foreign Secretary Halifax had talks with the Italian Ambassador Grandi and the French Ambassador Corbin yesterday. In the weeks following the meeting, further talks are expected to be held to discuss ways to resolve the disputes between France and Italy. Although the Italian Embassy issued a statement, saying that Ambassador Grandi's visit to Foreign Secretary Halifax was for ordinary matters, most people still believe that this trip was related to the French-Italian problems, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had asked Britain to mediate between France and Italy. Italy has decided not to formally make any demands on the French island of Corsica and the port of Nice. (Havas, 12th)

### Stalin's Report (Continued)

"The most important event that occurred during the period we are now reviewing is sufficient to show that a new imperialist war has already begun. I will describe it as follows:

In 1935, Italy attacked and occupied Abyssinia. In 1936, Germany and Italy began armed intervention in Spain. Germany established its rule in northern Spain and Spanish Morocco, while Italy established its rule in southern Spain and the Balearic Islands. In 1937, after occupying Manchuria, Japan further invaded North and Central China, occupied Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and began to squeeze out competitors from the occupied areas. In early 1938, Germany occupied Austria, and in the autumn, it seized the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. At the end of the same year, Japan occupied Guangzhou. In early 1939, it occupied Hainan Island. This gradually spreading war has gradually brought more than 500 million people into its circle, extending from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou through Abyssinia to the Strait of Gibraltar. After the First Imperialist War, the victorious countries, mainly Britain, the United States, and France, established a new international relations system, namely the post-war peace system. The main pillars of this system were the Nine-Power Treaty in the Far East, the Treaty of Versailles in Europe, and other treaties. In this system, the League of Nations should adjust relations between countries based on the principle of a united front of countries and collective security. However, individual aggressive countries and the imperialist wars they launched have completely overturned this post-war peace system. Japan has torn up the Nine-Power Treaty, and Germany and Italy have torn up the Treaty of Versailles. In order to act freely, they have also withdrawn from the League of Nations. Thus, a new imperialist war has become a reality.

It is not easy to suddenly join the war today, regardless of any treaties. Bourgeois politicians know this well, as do the fascist leaders. Therefore, before launching the war, these fascist leaders tried to instigate public opinion, deceive it, and lead it astray in order to achieve their own goals.

"If they say, do the German-Italian military groups oppose the interests of Britain and France in Europe? How can this be? 'We' do not have any military groups. 'We' only have a harmless 'Berlin-Rome Axis,' which is just some kind of geometric formula about an axis (laughter). Do the German-Italian-Japanese military groups oppose the interests of the United States, Britain, and France in the Far East? How can this be? 'We' have absolutely no military groups, only a harmless 'Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Triangle,' which is just a matter of geometric inclination (whole audience laughs). A war of aggression against the interests of the United States, Britain, and France? Absolutely not. 'We' are only engaged in the anti-Comintern war, and have absolutely no intention of antagonizing the above-mentioned countries. If you don't believe it, you can read the 'Comintern Pact' concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan."

"When the aggressor countries deceive public opinion, what they think and say is as described above. The clumsiness and boredom of this kind of disguise are extremely easy to see through. Searching for the 'center' of the Comintern in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, the mountains of Abyssinia, and the wilderness of Spanish Morocco is absurd and outrageous (laughter). War is a stubborn and persistent thing, and it can never be hidden behind a veil. Any 'axis,' 'triangle,' and 'anti-Comintern pact' cannot conceal the following facts: during this period, Japan has seized large areas of China, Italy has seized Abyssinia, Germany has seized Austria and the Sudetenland, and Germany and Italy have jointly seized Spain. All of this is in violation of the interests of non-aggressive countries. War is still war, a military group of aggressor countries is still a military group, and an aggressor country is still an aggressor country.

"The characteristic of the new imperialist war is that this war has not yet been generalized. The war of the aggressor countries infringes upon the rights and interests of non-aggressive countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, while the latter retreat step by step. Open actions of redistributing the world and dividing spheres of influence are underway, attacking the interests of non-aggressive countries, while the latter not only do not resist, but even indulge in such behavior. It can be said to be strange, but it is also a fact."

"How can this strange and special phenomenon of the new imperialist war be explained? The non-aggressive countries originally have all the capabilities, but they have no resistance and give up their original positions in order to please the aggressor countries. How is this situation possible? Is it because the national strength of the non-aggressive countries is insufficient? Of course not. The combined power of the non-aggressive countries undoubtedly far exceeds that of the aggressor countries, both economically and militarily. If so, how should their systematic concessions to the aggressor countries be properly explained? They may be afraid that the outbreak of a large-scale war will spread globally, and that after being thrown into the vortex, revolutionary movements will erupt. Bourgeois politicians know that the First World War caused the revolutionary victory in one of the largest countries in the world. They are very afraid that the Second World War will cause the revolution to break out and succeed in other countries.

"But at present, the above explanation is not the only and not the main reason. The main reason is that the non-aggressive countries, especially Britain and France, have abandoned their collective security policy and adopted a policy of non-interference and neutrality. Formally speaking, the policy of non-interference can be explained as follows: 'Let each country work hard to protect itself and resist aggression. We don't have to intervene. We may as well trade with both the aggressor countries and the invaded countries at the same time.' In fact, the policy of non-interference is equivalent to condoning aggression and encouraging war. Therefore, it is equivalent to changing aggression into a world war. The policy of non-interference includes the desire to allow aggression, not wanting to stop the aggressor countries' robbery, not wanting to stop Japan's war against China, or better, the war against the Soviet Union, not wanting to prevent Germany from creating European incidents, or the war against the Soviet Union, letting the warring countries sink into the quagmire of war, encouraging them to go this way, letting them exhaust their own strength, and then intervening with all their strength after they have exhausted themselves, 'maintaining peace,' and freely controlling the exhausted warring countries, gaining more profits and saving effort (to be continued)."

### American Munitions No Longer Shipped to Japan; British and French Purchases Predominate; American Isolationists Increasingly Lose Ground

(Washington) The United States' active aid to various democratic countries can be clearly seen in the figures for munitions and aircraft exports for February of this year. According to official statistics, the actual number of munitions and aircraft exported in that month was worth a total of $6,425,077. Of this, $1,920,551 was shipped to France, $1,871,000 to the United Kingdom, and $1,239,709 to the Netherlands. Smaller amounts went to Peru, Colombia, Brazil, China, and Czechoslovakia. Also, in that month, munitions merchants applied to the State Department for export licenses for a total value of $16,239,396. Of this, aircraft destined for the United Kingdom accounted for $7,115,600, aircraft for France accounted for $5,000,000, and munitions for China accounted for $17,299. However, none were destined for Japan. (Havas, 11th)

(New York) The idea that the United States should aid the democratic countries in a concrete way should they be at war with totalitarian countries is gaining increasing approval in American public opinion. This can be seen in the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute. The institute posed several questions, including: "If war breaks out in Europe, should our country sell food to Britain and France?" The number of affirmative answers accounted for 76 percent of the total. The second question was: "If war breaks out in Europe, should our country sell arms to Britain and France?" The number of affirmative answers accounted for 52 percent. The third question was: "Should our country send naval and ground forces to aid the democratic countries?" The number of negative answers accounted for 83 percent. However, those advocating aid to the totalitarian countries accounted for only 1 percent. Prior to the Munich Agreement, half a month ago, the majority of Americans were unwilling to sell arms to the democratic countries. Now, those who favor it are in the majority, which shows that President Roosevelt's current policies are supported by the majority of the people. (Havas, 11th)

### Large-Scale Killing of Chinese in Guangzhou

(Guangzhou) The Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have strengthened street patrols, intensified searches of pedestrians, and suddenly searched residents' homes. According to reliable sources, more than a hundred people have been arrested in recent days. Among them, forty-one were convicted of armed robbery or theft. After being paraded through the main streets in military trucks, they were subjected to the first group execution since the fall of Guangzhou. Japanese sentries search pedestrians, feeling all over their bodies regardless of gender, women included, receiving no better treatment than men. Even items in pockets must be taken out for inspection. The authorities have recently announced the levy of a "police tax" to maintain the city's increasing police force. All shops must pay this tax according to the nature and scope of their business, with higher turnover resulting in heavier taxes.

(Guangzhou) In order to stabilize public morale, the Japanese side has issued a semi-official explanation for the artillery fire frequently heard at night, stating that the Japanese army is test-firing heavy artillery left behind by the Chinese army during its retreat last year to see if it is still useful, hence the artillery fire. The Japanese side also denies that the Japanese army in the outskirts of Guangzhou is under heavy pressure from Chinese guerrillas, saying that the area around the city is safe, as evidenced by the many Chinese who travel by water and land to and from neighboring villages. (Reuters, 12th)

(Guangzhou) The Chinese police here carry only batons and no firearms, and are therefore unable to cope with armed bandits. The Maintenance Association has now decided to add 500 police officers and has issued a public notice instructing former police officers to register. It is reported that the newly recruited police officers will be trained by the Japanese. (Reuters, 12th)

### All Teachers and Students of the Sichen School Participate in the War of Resistance; Their Loyalty, Bravery, and Heroism are Unprecedented

(Chongqing) A truce. During the recent Japanese invasion of southern Hebei, the staff and students of the "Sichen School," as weak and scholarly youths, fought a desperate battle against the Japanese army. Their deeds are enough to move ghosts and gods to tears and terrify the Japanese army. At 2 PM on the 15th of last month, about two or three hundred Japanese and puppet troops, consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked the Zhao Jiaquan and Li Jia Dian area of Hengshui, where the "Sichen School" was stationed. The staff and students of the school immediately engaged the Japanese army with rifles. The Japanese army then infiltrated the villages, and the school staff threw hand grenades from the rooftops, killing fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers and destroying three vehicles. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated to outside the villages, and the school staff and students immediately chased them down, resulting in fierce street fighting. Although the Japanese army relied on superior weapons to launch a fierce attack, they were ultimately repelled by the generous and courageous spirit of the students. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce artillery attack on the students. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, the students ran out of ammunition and launched a charge. Most of the students in the school were underage youths, and some of the younger ones were unable to follow the charge. The staff and students who did break out returned to charge and kill, and finally broke out completely at 12:30 AM. The staff and students, due to their strong blood and energy, often snatched guns with their bare hands, but the disparity in numbers was too great, and the equipment was too inferior, so the casualties were quite heavy. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed and five Japanese vehicles were destroyed. Five teachers, including Wang Jieliang, and thirty-two students were injured. Two teachers and eleven students were killed in action. Since the July 7th Incident, there have been very few schools in the country that have participated in the War of Resistance as fully as the "Sichen School." Furthermore, their loyalty, bravery, and heroism are worthy of being a model for teachers and students across the country. The government has given preferential treatment to the school's teachers and students in terms of awards and pensions. (12th Dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Frenziedly Bomb Luoyang Twice

(Luoyang) From 11 AM to 11:30 AM this morning, Japanese planes frenziedly bombed Luoyang twice. The first time, there were seven Japanese planes, and the second time, there were nine. After the Japanese planes entered the city airspace, they dropped bombs on densely populated areas, obviously targeting innocent people. A total of 89 bombs were dropped in the two attacks, killing more than 40 people and destroying more than 400 houses. When the Japanese planes dropped bombs today, they also dropped 40 or so stones the size of washbasins. This action is not only shameless on the part of the Japanese, but also a testament to the fact that the Japanese are running out of bombs. (12th Dispatch)

### Creating Aircraft Personnel; The Far East Aviation School is Well-Equipped; The Flight Department Accepts Both Men and Women and Does Not Limit Nationality; Graduates Can Obtain British Pilot Licenses

Special Telegram from our Newspaper in Hong Kong. In today's age of aviation, military national defense certainly requires the construction of air defenses, and economic national defense also requires the development of aviation transportation. China is currently in a period of resistance against Japan, and the authorities are catching up in the construction of military air defenses. The later stages of the war of resistance have begun, and future victories are drawing closer. In the near future, a newly emerging China will need to alleviate transportation difficulties and establish close ties with the business communities of various countries around the world. Currently, international air routes of companies such as China National Aviation Corporation and Pan American Airways have already connected with China, and transportation between Europe and the United States is instantaneous. Aviation business will naturally play a very important role in transportation in the future. Chinese entrepreneurs who want to gain a foothold in international commerce in the future must prepare in advance, and the cultivation of aviation talent should be undertaken at this time. Chinese youth should also devote themselves to this promising career. Yesterday, the reporter visited the only fully equipped Far East Aviation School in Hong Kong and learned about the various conditions of the school, which can serve as a reference for China's aviation industry and as a research topic for aspiring young people. The situation is recorded as follows:

Sino-British Cooperation. The school site is located at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, covering approximately 150 acres, located on the Kun Lian Bay between Hong Kong and Kowloon, making it an excellent seaplane base. The aviation school was established in the spring of 1934, with the aim of providing aviation training to people in the Far East. It is stipulated that this training is the same as that received by pilots and mechanics in the British Royal Air Force, and that they have the opportunity to take the British government-issued aviation license. The students recruited are of all nationalities. The school has contracts with the Chinese National Government, the British Aviation Department, the Hong Kong Government, and Imperial Airways (Far East), and is organized as a limited company.

Well-Equipped. The directors of the school are Messrs. Dunson, Smith, Morrison, and Smithers. The director of the Flight Department is Major Smithers, an officer of the American Royal Air Force. The director of the Mechanical Department is Mr. Nero of the Royal Air Force British Aeronautical Engineering Society. The school's curriculum focuses on ground training, and classrooms and local repair work are all carried out on campus. Therefore, students can personally see the engine and various parts of the aircraft they are riding in, which is a kind of training that is not easily obtained by general aviation trainees.

Admission Qualifications. The admission procedure requires that applicants be at least 17 years old, have received considerable general education, and those applying for the Mechanical Department will be given an oral test by the Director of the Mechanical Department. If they do not have sufficient academic discussion, they must also take introductory arithmetic in the first semester. Those applying for the Flight Department can apply for admission at any time. A physical examination is conducted first, and female students are also accepted. If students do not have sufficient English proficiency, they can also take the exam in Chinese. The school employs Chinese assistants and interpreters to translate and assist with lectures during class. Those who have a little English proficiency will not find it difficult to understand. In the event that there are flight trainees who are not proficient in English, the Chinese assistant can re-explain after the flight is completed.

Class Arrangement. The Mechanical Department divides the year into four semesters: January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. Classes are usually held from 8 AM to 1 PM. Flight Department classes are held from Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 12:30 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM, and Saturday, 9 AM to 12:30 PM. While in school, trainees must strictly abide by school rules, especially flight orders, which must be carefully observed.

Flight Training. A. Flight Department. The first course is for those preparing to obtain a British private pilot's license, and stipulates 12 hours of primary and advanced variable person training and 3 hours of solo flight. The second course is the primary military flight course, with a training period of four to six months. The training is exactly the same as that of the British Air Force. The teaching procedure includes passenger flight, taxiing techniques, and methods of using aircraft, straight flight, upwind takeoff, medium turn, gliding turn, sharp turn, primary and advanced forced landing, actions in the event of a fire, aerobatics, passenger testing, blind flight, and other 27 items. The third course is the blind flight course, the fourth course is the light aircraft flight instructor course, the fifth course is the intermediate aircraft and aerobatic aircraft instructor course, the sixth course is the advanced aerobatics course, and the seventh course (preparing to take the British Class B pilot's license) seventh course A, commercial pilot and full mechanical course.

Mechanical Learning. B. Mechanical Department. The eighth and ninth courses are the aircraft mechanical courses, with a longer learning time of about two years. The first semester is a three-month internship in primary wood construction, the second semester is a three-month internship in real metal construction, the third semester is a three-month internship in advanced wood construction, the fourth semester is a three-month internship in advanced metal construction, the fifth and sixth semesters are a six-month internship in internal combustion engines, and the seventh semester is a three-month internship in airframe storage methods. The tenth course is the handling of parachutes, and the eleventh course is the high-pressure aircraft... mixing.

Equivalent to Studying Abroad. If one can complete all the courses in the Flight Department or Mechanical Department, it is the same as spending a lot of money to go abroad to an aviation school in the UK, and their academic ability is almost equal to that of British Air Force personnel. The school also makes every effort to help graduates find employment after obtaining their licenses. The tuition fees are as follows: A. Flight Department, the first course is HK$ (hereinafter, all amounts are in HK$) 750, the first course is HK$4,260, the third course is HK$600, the fourth course is HK$500, the fifth course is HK$900, the sixth course is HK$600, the seventh course is HK$7,000, and the seventh course A is HK$9,800. B. Mechanical Department, the eighth course is HK$100 per month, the ninth course is HK$100 per month, the tenth course is HK$200, and the eleventh course is HK$350. If there are exchange rate fluctuations, the amounts will be calculated and confirmed temporarily.

### Puppet Troops of Yangzhou Carry Weapons and Surrender

Taixian Dispatch. The puppet troops of the Yangzhou Pacification Army, suffering too much oppression from the Japanese army, have come to realize their mistake. On the night of February 22nd, a group of about a hundred of them escaped with their weapons and headed northwest. It is reported that they have surrendered to the Hua Army × Unit and returned to the right path. The Japanese army in Yangzhou is now afraid that the puppet troops will escape again, so they have recently increased their defenses.

### Zhejiang Province Establishes a Trade Bureau to Manage Goods

Yongkang Dispatch. In order to manage the import and export trade of the province and increase financial income, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government Meeting to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Trade Bureau. Huang Zupei, Director of the Department of Finance, is concurrently the manager, and Xu Enpei, Director of the Zhejiang Local Bank, is concurrently the deputy manager.

It is reported that it will start with the management of imports.

### Zhejiang Construction Department Formulates Measures to Manage Spring Silkworm Eggs

Lishui Dispatch. As Zhejiang Province is a silk-producing area, and since western Zhejiang, including Hangzhou and Jiaxing, has fallen into guerrilla areas, there are still many sericulture counties in eastern Zhejiang. With the end of winter and the approach of early spring, the time for sericulture is approaching in the blink of an eye. In order to consider adjusting the needs of silkworm farmers for silkworm eggs in the spring of the 28th year, the Zhejiang Construction Department has specially formulated management measures for spring silkworm eggs, which are managed by the Silkworm Egg Inspection Office established by the affiliated Agricultural Improvement Institute. The silkworm eggs produced in various egg-producing places for the spring of the 28th year will be purchased by the institute at a price, which is set at sixty cents per silkworm egg sheet. Sixteen million sheets have been ordered from various fields. One ocean and one corner will be paid first for each sheet, two corners and seven points will be paid after the silkworm eggs are handed over, and the remaining two corners and three points will be paid after the orchid collection is completed. Silkworm farmers in various places who need silkworm eggs must order them from the various silkworm industry improvement areas or the county governments of each county. The price per silkworm egg sheet is set at four corners. The seed money will be collected at three corners when the seed is ordered, and the remaining one corner will be paid when the seed is issued. Those who sell silkworm eggs will receive a handling fee of three points per sheet, which will be deducted from the number when the ordering unit submits the seed money for distribution. The number of silkworm egg sheets ordered and the seed money in various places must be sent to the designated location of the Improvement Institute before March 25. Silkworm egg farms that wish to sell their silkworm eggs directly to various silkworm areas must first report to the Improvement Institute for record. The seed money shall be handled by the farm itself. When silkworm eggs from other provinces are imported, they must also be reported to the Improvement Institute in advance, and they can only be distributed to silkworm farmers for breeding after being verified. Currently, various counties have separately requested to register, including 60,000 sheets in the guerrilla area, 60,000 sheets in Zhuji, and 42,000 sheets in Sheng County, totaling more than 230,000 sheets, which are still waiting for overall planning, distribution, and issuance.

### Charity Football Match Ends: Donghua Loses to Portugal Yesterday, 1-3; Donghua's Left Wing Too Weak; Zhu Hongyi Purchases Third Ball for 600 Yuan

After days of continuous spring rain, the sun shone brightly yesterday morning. The third charity football match, organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, between Donghua and Portugal, was held at Yiyuan at 10:30 AM. The French Army band came to the field to play music, and the fans were enthusiastic about the charity, with no fewer than 5,000 people attending, making the atmosphere more lively than the second match. The Portuguese team had a well-organized lineup, with many veteran players, making their victory expected. Donghua, on the other hand, suffered a great loss in left-wing strength due to the absence of key player Wan Xianghua. As a result, they were defeated by the Portuguese, losing 1-3. They were behind 1-2 in the first half. Donghua's defeat was undeniably due to the weakness of the left wing, Wan Jin and Sun Huizhang. They missed countless good opportunities, and Dai Linjing repeatedly passed the ball to the left wing, which was a huge mistake. Portuguese defender Masan'er was incredibly strong, and Donghua frequently ran into a wall against him. Costa's center back played both offense and defense, which was quite formidable. For Donghua, Dai Linjing and Jia Youliang performed the best, but unfortunately, they lacked coordination. The team's effort was commendable, but playing football in the mud was not easy. Zhou Dayun was injured in the hand shortly after the start of the game, which hindered his movements, making it difficult to cope. Fa Fanxiao scored the first goal after contact, and Dai Linjing equalized. Fa Fanxiao scored again, and the Portuguese team took the lead 2-1 in the first half. After switching sides, the competition was fierce. Donghua was slightly negligent and Remy Di scored a goal. In the end, Donghua had many good chances, but they all missed. As a result, they lost 1-3. Yesterday, Mr. Pan Lidi, the commander of the French Army stationed in Shanghai, came to the field to kick off the game and, during the break, presented the previous match ball to Mr. Pu Zaiyuan, who bid 500 yuan. After the game, the third ball was auctioned off and purchased by printer Zhu Hongyi for 600 yuan. Yesterday, 2,498 yuan was sold in temporary tickets, and about 3,000 yuan was obtained including pre-sales. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's game are as follows:

Donghua Association

Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Xu Chengdong, Cai Shengsen, Shu Shigeng, Wan Jin, Sun Huizhang, Dai Linjing, Shen Shiyan, Jia Youliang

Portugal

A. Rocha Liao, Masan'er, Victor Tai, Su Ruo, Costa, Oliveira, Laurel, L. Rocha Liao, Fa Fanxiao, Kola Sha, L. Remy Di

French Commander Kicks Off

When the time came, the referee Zhang Le and Mr. Pan Lidi, commander of the French Army stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by Mr. Li Guiyong, a member of the Standing Committee of the International Relief Committee, entered the field to the sound of military music and kicked the ball, starting the battle. Donghua got the ball and attacked first. Wan Jin went deep but was blocked. Sun Huizhang got the ball from the back and passed it to Dai Linjing. Dai kicked the ball towards the goal, but Rocha Liao caught it and threw it out. Oliveira passed the ball far forward, but Fa Fanxiao and Rocha Liao both missed. Zhuang Youren calmly kicked it out. Soon after, Sun Huizhang and Dai Linjing advanced side by side, but due to the wet and slippery ground, they were unable to shoot and were saved by Victor Tai, with no success. Fa Fanxiao attacked from the middle, and Zhuang Youren rushed to the rescue without error. Remy Di then attacked from the right and passed to Kola Sha, who crossed the ball. Fa Fanxiao headed the ball, but it went over the crossbar. After fifteen minutes, Rocha Liao attacked the goal. Although Zhou Dayun saved the ball, he injured his hand. The game was suspended for a moment, and then continued. Both sides remained evenly matched, with no score after twenty minutes.

Portuguese Lead 2-1

After twenty-two minutes, Laurel hooked the ball from the left. Zhou Dayun pushed it out not far enough, and Fa Fanxiao rushed up and shot hard. Dayun was unable to save it, and Donghua conceded the first goal. In less than two minutes, Jia Youliang received a pass from Sun Huizhang and crossed the ball. Dai Linjing saw an opportunity and swept the ball from fifteen yards away, equalizing the score. What was gained easily was also lost easily. Two minutes later, Fa Fanxiao scored again on his own, and the Portuguese team took the lead again. Donghua counterattacked. Wan Jin dribbled the ball deep, but Victor Tai blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Wan's kick was ineffective. After Rocha Liao shot wildly, Su Ruo committed a foul. Jia Youliang took a free kick, and Mayuer headed the ball out. Fa Fanxiao's attack was caught, and he came back again. Dayun caught and patted the ball, turning the danger into safety. Wan Jin's attack was unsuccessful. Remy Di dribbled and hooked the ball, fortunately hitting the goal post. Wan Jin rose again, passed Victor Tai, and crossed the ball. Ah Dai missed his footing, and Shen Shiyan passed the ball to Jia Youliang. Jia shot angrily, but Rocha Liao dived and saved it. Sun Huizhang rushed up to meet it, but unfortunately, the ground was slippery and he could not control it, losing a good opportunity. Everyone stomped their feet. Xu Chengdong passed the ball far. Ah Dai headed the ball, and Huizhang kicked it towards the goal but it was caught. Kola Sha shot twice, but both were ineffective. As a result of the first half, the Portuguese team led 2-1.

Another Goal Lost

After the break, Costa passed the ball to Kola Sha. Jiang Zhaoxiang blocked his path. Fa Fanxiao rushed forward, but committed a foul. The ball was then passed out from Donghua's position. Linjing passed the ball to Wan Jin, who kicked it towards the goal, but Rocha Liao jumped and caught it. Su Ruo shot the ball far, but Dayun pressed it down. Ah Dai rushed into the enemy camp and shot from the right. The ball passed in front of the goal. Wan Jin pressed it down and swept it, but Rocha Liao knelt down and saved it. Kola Sha dribbled the ball and rushed over. Zhuang Youren blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Remy Di kicked it very well, and Xu Chengdong headed the ball out of danger. Laurel attacked the goal, Dayun caught it and slid down, fortunately no one rushed in. He picked it up again and threw it out. After twenty-one minutes, Kola Sha scored with the help of Fa Fanxiao, but he was offside and the goal was disallowed. The Portuguese team was unwilling to give up and launched another fierce attack. Five minutes later, Fa Fanxiao broke through in the middle, but Zhuang Youren failed to block him. The ball fell to Remy Di's feet, who shot quickly and scored a goal. Donghua tried hard to counterattack, with great momentum. Jia Youliang continued to pick the ball up, but Sun Huizhang and Wan Jin both shot wide, missing good opportunities. Finally, Fa Fanxiao shot over the crossbar, Costa hit the goal post, and the silver whistle blew for a long time. The Portuguese team defeated Donghua 3-1, and the charity match ended.

### Education News: The Puppet Regime Falsely Uses the Name of the Youth League to Privately Recruit Students from Various Schools; School Authorities Have Strictly Paid Attention

Since the Central Government promulgated the organizational methods of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, various places have successively proceeded with its organization. In this city, because of the large number of student youths, the Central Government also plans to send personnel to Shanghai to organize it. However, at present, it is still in the preparation stage and has not actually started working. Recently, various schools have suddenly discovered that the puppet regime is also using the name of the Youth League to privately contact and recruit students from various schools, which is obviously for other purposes. The schools have already strictly taken precautions. Once the Central Government officially sends personnel to Shanghai, they will naturally strive to promote it.

### Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education in the Past Year (3): The Ferocity of Destruction Has Fueled the Courageous and Diligent Efforts of This Year, Laying a Solid Foundation

(E) Other Reforms and Progress (1) "The Ministry of Education Added Various Educational Design and Research Organizations." The Ministry of Education added various committees in the morning, such as the Wartime Education Problem Research Committee, the Agricultural Education Research Committee, the Industrial Education Research Committee, and the Music Education Committee. These are all important design and research organizations. For the planning and improvement of various educations, indelible achievements have been demonstrated in this year. (2) "The New Facilities of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee," such as subsidizing scientific workers, subsidizing education in the Northwest, and rewarding scientific research, are all far-sighted measures. (3) "The Organization of the Three Principles of the People Youth League." In June of last year, President Chiang led the organization of the Three Principles of the People Youth League for the training of a large number of youths, and served as the leader of the League. Now it has a thorough and strong meaning. (4) "The Implementation of Concentrated Military Training for Female Students." In the past, high school students and above were concentrated for military training, and female students were allowed to be exempt. Since the morning's concentrated training, female students have also participated across the board. Therefore, female students in high schools and above have since obtained specialized skills such as military affairs and nursing. (G) Furthermore, in terms of social dynamics, there are also many reforms and progress as follows: (1) "The Booming of Wartime Education Publications." Wartime education publications have sprung up everywhere this year. In terms of magazines, educational magazines, teaching and learning, and educational research are all magazines that publish articles on wartime education. In addition to this, there are new magazines such as Education Newsletter, This, Balance, and Wartime Education, which were all produced during this year. In terms of books, there are countless pamphlets published this year, especially popular educational readings. The Popular Series for the People in the Emergency Period by the Zhengzhong Bookstore (compiled by the Popular Reading Materials Committee of the Ministry of Education), the Anti-Japanese War Education Series by the Commercial Press, the Wartime Popular Readings by the Life Bookstore (edited by the Popular Readings Compilation and Publication Society), and the Farmers' Anti-Japanese War Series by the Ping Church are only the authors. (2) "Unprecedented Progress and Unity of Chinese Educational Academic Groups." The work of Chinese educational academic groups last year saw unprecedented progress, and there was also unprecedented unity between the various academic groups. (3) "The Establishment and Development of Wartime Education and Cultural Groups." Many wartime education and cultural groups were established last year, such as the Wartime Children's Protection Association, the National Wartime Education Association, the China Wartime Children's Relief Association, and the National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Enemy Association, all of which were established last year, and developed practical and urgent wartime education work. (4) "The Flourishing Development of Mass Training and Women's Training, and the Vigorous Development of Singing and Drama." Everywhere last year, various mass training and women's training activities, as well as the rise of singing and drama groups, could be seen. (5) "The Conduct of Academic Research." Although in the difficult environment of the War of Resistance, academic research was not slackened. All of this is enough to prove the progress of education last year and the greatness of its strength. (To be continued)

### Promoting Family Education: Various Schools Form Promotion Associations

In order to improve the lives of the general public and increase the strength of the War of Resistance and national construction, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for middle schools and below to promote family education, and has ordered the education authorities of various provinces and cities to instruct all schools to comply. It is reported that after receiving this instruction, the principals of various schools in this city discussed the promotion measures a few days ago, and decided that each school should establish a Family Education Promotion Committee based on the circumstances, and a general office should be jointly established by each school to exchange opinions at any time. The promotion measures will not only be handled in accordance with the special rules promulgated by the Ministry, but the general office will also formulate detailed rules and distribute them to various schools for implementation. It is heard that the promotion is being carried out very actively these days.

### Soochow University School Buildings Returned to Owners: Huge Losses; Jinghai School Buildings Also Returned

The Mainland Newspaper reported that Soochow University in Suzhou was returned to its original American owners last Thursday after being occupied by the Japanese military authorities for 17 months. It was discovered that the property losses were huge. This time, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church regained control of the school. A large number of equipment in the school, except for those that had been shipped out, had been destroyed. Not only was the valuable laboratory equipment stolen, but also the heavy furniture and pianos were stolen. The above was stated by Dr. William, a staff member of the school, when he met with reporters last night. He was also present at the scene when the school buildings were taken over. Dr. William also said that the Academy of Sciences of Dongda suffered the greatest losses. Medical equipment was completely stolen, and very little equipment was left in other parts. Most of the scientific equipment was ordered from the United States, and the cost of replacing it was huge. Suzhou Yinghai Women's Normal School was also returned at the same time as Soochow University. The losses of the two schools were quite similar. Six staff members of Dongda and one representative of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church, the original owner of the property, went to Suzhou last Sunday to prepare for the takeover of the school. The Japanese army finally handed over the property with a very good attitude and cooperated with us. They and a group of Japanese soldiers inspected the entire school on Sunday to determine which property belonged to the school and which belonged to the Japanese army. This work went smoothly. The representative of the Japanese army was Captain Takahashi. On Tuesday and Wednesday, they repeatedly entered the school buildings to arrange everything, and on Thursday, the Japanese army completely withdrew. Dr. William also said that although there were no problems during the takeover, the property had been gradually damaged since Suzhou fell and the property was occupied, mostly because the buildings were not repaired after being damaged. Water was still accumulated in the classrooms that had been hit by bombs. Only two buildings were actually hit during the air raids. In addition to the quite valuable and lighter equipment being stolen or destroyed, a large amount of heavy property such as furniture was also transported away. After the fall of Suzhou, Dongda was occupied almost immediately. Even if some local Chinese stole the equipment in the school before it fell, they would not have stolen things like pianos. It will take a long time to repair the damaged property now, and the cost of replacing the equipment is huge. Professor Xilai is now staying in Suzhou to assist in the repair and cleaning of the school buildings. According to reports, Dongda was occupied in November 1937. During the 17 months that the Japanese army controlled the school, it was mostly used as a military hospital. On January 15 last year, Bishop Moore of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church and several other Americans were allowed by the Japanese army to visit the property. At that time, it was discovered that the school had suffered losses and damage. Thereafter, it was not until August 30 that foreigners were allowed to visit the library and the Academy of Sciences and transport out many books. The remaining scientific equipment was all stored. After that, the original owner of the school could occasionally visit. Last autumn, the Japanese army agreed to return the school by the end of February, which was implemented last Thursday. According to reports, Dongda was founded in 1930 by the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. After the outbreak of the war, it moved to Tunxi, Anhui Province, and then returned to Shanghai. It is now holding classes in the Cishu Building.

### Wartime Shanghai Financial Market

— Zhu Boquan

Regarding Shanghai's wartime finance, numerous commentators in this publication have already expressed their views. Now, we are pleased to receive a learned article from Mr. Zhu Boquan. Mr. Zhu's position in the domestic financial world is, I believe, well-known to our readers. His observations on the dynamics of Shanghai's wartime financial market, seen through the eyes of an industry insider, are naturally more profound than those of the average person. The comprehensiveness is only secondary. Therefore, without concern for repetition, we are publishing it with haste, hoping it will capture the readers' attention. — The Editor

I. Introduction

Shanghai is the great port for foreign exchange in our country, holding the financial heart of the nation. According to various statistics, as of the end of June 1937, the banks in Shanghai accounted for over 32% of the total number of banks in the country (excluding branch banks). Among them, the paid-up capital of the 41 member banks accounted for 45% of the total paid-up capital of all banks in the country, and their total assets accounted for 44.5% of the national total. Various deposits also accounted for about 76% of the total bank deposits in the country, excluding the Central Bank and other non-member banks. In addition, there were also foreign banks, native banks, trust companies, silver companies, savings societies, and other financial institutions. Among them, foreign banks and native banks have a long history and deep influence in the Shanghai financial market, forming a tripartite balance with Chinese banks.

In recent years, the Shanghai financial community has endured many hardships, so it has strived to improve. For example, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Shanghai banking and money industries successively formed the Joint Reserve Board. Later, the banking industry established the Clearing House and the Acceptance House, making the unity firmer and the strength more abundant. In November 1935, the currency system was reformed, concentrating the nation's economic lifeblood of silver and unifying the issuance of currency, making the financial foundation more stable. This achievement had already demonstrated its effectiveness before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and its value was fully proven during the war.

II. The Financial Market Before and After the Outbreak of War

In the first half of 1937, the general domestic economic situation showed a booming atmosphere. Since the currency reform in 1935, general prices began to rise. Stimulated by rising prices, industry and commerce were thriving. Transactions in various markets were frequent, which was rare in recent years. In the first half of 1937, the total amount of Shanghai bank note exchange increased by about one-sixth compared with the same period last year, and the financial situation was also extremely stable. The interbank lending rate hovered around 10% consistently. The foreign exchange market has always been controlled by government banks, with exceptional stability. The public debt market price reached over 89 yuan in June. The deposit and loan business of the financial industry also increased consistently. Unexpectedly, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, shocking the market. The Shanghai Hongqiao Airport incident followed, and a full-scale war between China and Japan was launched.

After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, the first to be affected was the financial community in Shanghai. The public debt market price dropped sharply after July 7th. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Until the settlement period in July, the government stipulated a minimum price of 70 yuan, and it was then calmed. At that time, those who suspected legal tender were already withdrawing their deposits one after another, purchasing foreign exchange or transferring them to foreign banks. The number of capital flight was huge. In early August, the situation in Shanghai became more serious, and the trend of withdrawals became even more intense. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, Shanghai suddenly became a war zone, and people's hearts were panicked and uncontrollable. All exchanges were the first to suspend trading, and the banking and money industries were also ordered to suspend business for four days from August 13th. In order to maintain finance, the Ministry of Finance specially announced measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals and deposits. At the same time, the banking and money industries formulated supplementary measures, utilizing the exchange system to determine the method of bill remittance. The financial panic began to be alleviated. From August 17th, the banking and money industries resumed business uniformly. Although there were still many people who asked to withdraw deposits, they were limited to a certain extent. Moreover, since the four government banks and the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry had methods to regulate the industry, they were able to cope with ease, and people's hearts also became more stable. By the end of the year, many depositors in various banks and native banks had re-deposited the money they had previously withdrawn. According to the financial stabilization measures of the Ministry of Finance, those who deposited legal tender into banks and native banks or established new accounts after the war could withdraw legal tender at any time without restriction. At the same time, wartime current deposits could be circulated through interbank remittance bills in addition to the withdrawal limit. Therefore, the deposit amount of each bank did not decrease significantly. At that time, the general situation in the market showed a deflationary trend, and credit was stagnant. Due to the obstruction of transactions, commercial exchanges between various places and Shanghai were on the verge of collapse. Almost all industries and commerce were in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to the blockage of the source of goods, prices soared, especially for necessities such as fuel and food. However, the government has always maintained the foreign exchange rate, so it is not superficial to consolidate the credit of legal tender.

III. Evolution of the Wartime Financial Market

Since the outbreak of the war, various financial conditions in Shanghai have generally changed with the environment, and they all have a related relationship or are mutually causal. It is not easy to analyze them. For the convenience of narration, I will try to describe the main evolutions of the financial market in the past year below:

(1) Interbank Remittance and Discounted Cash Exchange: Before the war, the payment tools of the Shanghai banking and money industries, in addition to legal tender cash, included two types of bills: one was a payment bill, which could be cashed on the same day and was no different from cash, and the other was a remittance bill, which could only be cashed the next day. The measures to stabilize finance stipulated that for wartime deposits of more than 300 yuan, withdrawals were limited to 5% of the deposit balance per week, with a maximum of no more than 150 yuan. At the same time, the Shanghai banking and money industries were approved by the Ministry of Finance to stipulate: "In addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, current deposits of each bank and native bank may be paid with interbank remittance bills for commercial needs beyond the limits stipulated by the Ministry." This kind of interbank remittance bill was only allowed to be transferred between Shanghai banks and native banks, and no legal tender was paid, and no foreign exchange could be purchased. It was completely different from the remittance bill that could be cashed the next day before the war. Its purpose was to facilitate the circulation of commercial funds and to avoid capital flight. During the January 28th Shanghai Battle, the promissory notes issued by Shanghai native banks were once suspended from being cashed the next day and were only allowed to be remitted between banks, which was similar to the current situation. According to Shanghai's industrial and commercial transactions, transfers are usually paid by transfer, and payments in legal tender are a minority. After the war, remittance bills were only allowed to be transferred between banks and could not be paid in cash, which had no impact on commercial needs. However, some foreign banks in Shanghai were unwilling to accept this kind of bill because they had no dealings with Chinese banks and native banks. In addition, general importers of foreign goods gradually became discriminatory because they could not convert foreign exchange, and some even lacked legal tender funds. In order to facilitate the use, they were often willing to exchange 100 yuan of remittance bills for 98 or 99 yuan of cash, which led to the beginning of discounted cash exchange for remittance. Generally, speculative merchants saw that there was profit to be made, and they scrambled to engage in cash exchange as a business; therefore, remittance bills became an object of trade. Initially, the discount for each thousand yuan was about 4 or 5 yuan to 10 or 20 yuan. Later, the circulation of remittance bills in the market increased, and the number of people exchanging discounted cash also increased. In addition, the population of the concessions suddenly increased, and the daily necessities needed legal tender cash. Also, after the foreign exchange control, the black market was active, and the impact was that the discount increased. By June of last year, the discount for each thousand yuan had once reached more than 70 yuan. Later, the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry came out to maintain it and made a large number of adjustments, which stabilized the discount at about 50 yuan. In November of last year, Guangzhou and Wuhan were lost one after another, and people were uneasy. Many people also exchanged remittance bills for cash to purchase foreign exchange or cash. The discount rate once rose to more than 60 yuan. Soon the war situation stabilized, and it returned to about 45 yuan. In January of this year, after the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry officially managed it by announcing the buying and selling market price every day, the discount rate has stabilized at about 35 yuan per thousand yuan, with only a few cents of rise and fall every day. In early March of this year, due to the influence of the foreign exchange and cash market, and at the same time, there was a saying in North China that the currency system would be disrupted, the discount rate announced by the Quasi-Government Association was increased to 40 yuan per thousand yuan, and soon rose to 50 yuan. At present, the market discount rate is still around 48 yuan.

(2) Interbank Discount and Interest Rates: After the currency reform in 1935, the government originally planned to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. However, the preparations were not yet mature when the Shanghai War broke out. In addition to restricting withdrawals and deposits, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four government banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, to organize joint offices and joint discount associations in major cities in order to unify affairs and jointly assume the responsibility of regulating finance. The Shanghai Four Bank Discount Association specializes in interbank mortgage loans and discounting of commercial bills, mainly discounting the amount of payment bills. The discounting of interbank remittance funds is entrusted by the Four Bank Discount Association to the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry to be handled together with the original various interbank lending of the association. As of the end of September of the previous year, the loans of the Discount Association totaled more than 18 million yuan, and the interbank remittance funds lent by the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry also reached about 10 million yuan. After the war, the banking and money industries were in great need of funds to prepare for withdrawals and deposits. With this assistance, they were able to cope with ease. According to the statistics at the end of June of last year, the total amount of discounting by the Four Bank Discount Associations in various places was more than 50 million yuan. As of the end of last year, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of funds discounted by the Four Banks was 89 million yuan, of which about 16 million yuan was discounted in Shanghai, accounting for about 20% of the total, which was 1 million yuan less than in September of the previous year. The amount of interbank remittance lending by the Joint Reserve Association of Shanghai Banks. As of the end of last year, it was about 5 million yuan, which was about 5 million yuan less than in September of the previous year.

There are two types of interbank lending rates in the Shanghai financial market: one is the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association, which is the interest rate for lending between native banks, and the other is the interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry, which is the interest rate for interbank lending and discounting between banks. Since the establishment of the Four Bank Discount Association, it also announces the interbank lending rate and discount rate every day, and there are three different interest rates in the Shanghai financial market.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.1% per thousand yuan per day in June and July of the previous year. In early August, due to the tightening of the situation in Shanghai, it increased every day, reaching 1.9% on the 13th, and then stabilized at 2% after the banking and money industries opened on the 17th. It dropped to 1.5% in November and December, and then dropped to 1% in January of last year, and there was no major rise or fall after that. It once rose to 1.4% in October, and then returned to normal. At present, it is hovering around 1.2%.

The interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry are divided into remittance and national currency. In July of the previous year, the remittance and national currency interbank lending rates were both 1.1% per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate was 1.2%. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13th, the national currency interbank lending rate and discount rate were 3%, and remittance also reached 2%. In October and November, the remittance interbank lending rate and discount rate dropped to 1.8%. In December, it rose to 2%. In early August of last year, the interbank lending rate and discount rate of national currency dropped to 2.5%, and there has been no change since then.

The discount rate opened by the Discount Association in August of the previous year was 8% per week, and the lending rate was 3% per thousand yuan per day. From August of last year, the discount rate was changed to 7.5% per week, and the lending rate was changed to 2.5% per thousand yuan per day, which was equal to the interest rate opened by the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry.

From the movement of the interbank lending rate of the banking and money industries, it can be seen that the financial situation in Shanghai has gradually become relaxed from being tense. However, the above-mentioned interbank lending rate of the Money Industry seems to be lower than the interbank lending rate of the bank after the war, with a difference of almost half. The reason for this is that remittance has always been the accounting standard of the Money Industry. All remittance positions of banks have always been concentrated in the Money Industry, and the Money Industry calculates the interest rate on interbank deposits according to the interbank lending rate. If the interbank lending rate increases, then the Money Industry must increase the interest rate on interbank remittance deposits accordingly, which is equivalent to increasing the burden on the Money Industry. Moreover, after the war, remittance bills cannot be paid in cash, and the Money Industry's remittance position is more abundant than before, and it is even more unwilling to raise the interbank lending rate and increase the burden. In fact, the Money Industry's external loans are calculated at an interest rate of about 8% per month, including the average interbank lending rate per month (for example, in February of this year, the monthly difference of the Money Industry's interbank lending rate is 3 yuan plus the sitting plate of 4.5 yuan is 7.5 yuan, which is a monthly interest rate of 7.5%), which is not much different from the bank's loan interest rate.

(3) The Amount of Legal Tender Issued: Since the currency reform, the right to issue currency in the country has been exclusively assigned to the four government banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and the issuance reserves of each bank have also been concentrated under unified management. After this unprecedented reform, the financial foundation has become more sound, so after the outbreak of the war in the previous year, although people's hearts were extremely panicked, there were no problems in terms of currency.

At the beginning of the war, some people were mindful of the events of the European War, and they were quite concerned about inflation. However, judging from the figures in the inspection reports of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee after the war, although the total amount of issuance has been increasing, it does not seem to be an inflationary phenomenon compared with before and after the war. According to the inspection report of the committee, the total amount of issuance at the end of 1937 was 1,639,098,000 yuan, and it increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan at the end of June 1938. The rate of increase was actually not as fast as in the early days of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the amount of legal tender issued increased by a total of 56.8 million yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, it increased by a total of 37.9 million yuan. In the first half of 1938, it increased by only 87 million yuan. The committee has not formally announced the number of occurrences after June 1938, and there is currently no way to count it.

As for the amount of legal tender circulating in Shanghai and its speed of circulation, general observations show that there is no significant increase. On the contrary, after restricting withdrawals and deposits, a part of the currency has become locked accounts, and the stagnation of industry and commerce has greatly reduced the speed of currency circulation.

(4) Foreign Exchange Control and the Foreign Exchange Black Market: Before the currency reform, our country's foreign exchange rate was allowed to rise and fall naturally. After the currency reform, the purchase and sale of foreign exchange was centrally managed by the national bank, and the foreign exchange rate became stable. At the beginning of the war, domestic funds once fled. At that time, commentators believed that controlling foreign exchange was a necessary measure during wartime. However, the government authorities believed that our country's environment was special and were unwilling to deal with it rashly. Until the beginning of March of last year, the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank" was established in North China to issue inconvertible paper money in an attempt to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. In order to prevent this, the government had to announce the Foreign Exchange Application Rules on March 14 of last year, stipulating that when banks need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they may apply to the Central Bank to purchase it. After being approved by the Central Bank, the foreign exchange will be sold at the statutory exchange rate. Applications for goods imported without legitimate purposes or unnecessarily will not be approved. In July, the government continued to stipulate the types of goods to be restricted from import, and stipulated that banks should provide the same amount of legal tender cash when applying for foreign exchange to prevent the abuse of deliberately applying for excessive amounts. At the same time, in order to increase foreign exchange funds, the foreign exchange of export trade was also centrally managed by the national bank. All foreign exchange received by merchants from the export of goods should also be sold to the national bank. From August 8 of last year, it was stipulated that the Central Bank would no longer accept applications for foreign exchange for imported goods shipped after January 1 of last year. However, imports of necessities would still be supplied in appropriate amounts, and foreign exchange control became increasingly strict.

Before the foreign exchange control, the Shanghai foreign exchange market price was generally based on the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank, and all foreign banks also abided by the gentleman's agreement and followed the Central Bank's quotation. After the implementation of the control, this gentleman's agreement was virtually cancelled. At the same time, general importers could not purchase the full amount of foreign exchange from the Central Bank and had to purchase it at a high price outside the Central Bank to meet their needs. In addition, people in the concessions who were good at worrying about the future purchased foreign exchange for the insurance of their personal property. Therefore, although the Central Bank still supplied the approved foreign exchange at the original exchange rate, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai was far more expensive than the statutory exchange rate.

The existence of the foreign exchange black market has a negative impact on Shanghai's trade and finance. The remedy depends on the cooperation of foreign banks and friendly countries. Recently, a new loan of 10 million pounds from China and the United Kingdom has been established and designated for balancing the foreign exchange of legal tender. Therefore, the international conditions for stabilizing our country's foreign exchange have been secured. In the future, we only hope that the people of the country will practice thrift, purchase fewer imported goods, and not seek private interests or speculate, so that the decline in foreign exchange will not increase. Not only can the black market gradually stabilize, but it is not difficult to achieve the fundamental goal of elimination.

(5) Over-the-Counter Trading of Public Bonds: The public bond market also occupies an important position in Shanghai's financial institutions. The purchase and sale of public bonds by banking and money industries is not only regarded as a reliable investment, but also can be used as a method to adjust funds. When there is a lot of floating capital, public bonds are purchased and stored, and when there is a shortage, they are sold. The market has the nature of a second-tier business reserve. In the past, there were more than 30 types of domestic public bonds. After the reorganization in 1936, they were merged into a unified public bond with an annual interest rate of 6%, which was issued in five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In order to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure and revive the economy, a Revival Public Bond was issued. This public bond has no transaction in the market. After this reorganization, the financial foundation became more sound, the credit of debt was transformed and stabilized, and the price gradually increased. In June 1937, the market price of each debt reached a maximum of about 89 yuan. After the outbreak of the war, the situation suddenly changed.

After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out in early July of the previous year, the Shanghai public bond market showed a sharp downward trend. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Finally, the Ministry of Finance limited the minimum price of unified public bonds to 70 yuan, and it was then calmed. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai-South China Stock Exchange suspended business, but over-the-counter transactions were still active. The daily turnover increased from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Later, it gradually became a semi-open market. Initially, the over-the-counter market price was around 40 yuan. At the end of January of last year, in order to eliminate capital flight, the government changed the principal and interest of the unified public bond to interbank remittance funds, and the over-the-counter market price fell below 40 yuan. The lowest price in February reached a new record of 37 yuan. From March to June, the lowest price was 40 yuan and the highest was 60 yuan. By the end of July, the principal and interest of the maturing public bond were still paid in legal tender by the government, and the over-the-counter market price stabilized at around 54 or 55 yuan. At the end of September, the European situation was tense, and securities prices fell all over the world. Shanghai was not immune to this. Each debt had a rise and fall of a few cents every day. After the peace news came out, it returned to its old appearance. Afterwards, because the foreign exchange market was stable and there was no profit to be made from hedging foreign exchange, a part of the floating capital went to the public bond market. The market price of each debt rose consistently. In January of this year, the Unified Jia Public Bond created a high price of 63 yuan. However, at the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because our country had lost a large amount of tariff revenue and the funds paid by the government for debts guaranteed by tariffs had accumulated to a huge amount of 175 million yuan, it would no longer pay for the long-term debts before the war in the future. When the news came, the public bond market caused a huge wave, and in one day, the decline was more than 6 yuan for many. Later, the government announced that the principal and interest of the domestic debt due at the end of January would still be paid in legal tender, but the payment would be made in Chongqing. The Shanghai side could receive it from the three banks of China, China, and Communications in six installments, which would be paid off within six months. Then people's hearts were slightly settled, and the debt market recovered. Recently, a new loan from China and the United Kingdom has been established, and the market situation is more active. At present, the market price of each debt has fallen by about 30 yuan compared with the market price before the war. The market price of the National Salvation Public Bond issued after the war has always been around 36 yuan. There has been no change so far. (To be continued)

Summary of Famous Works

### American Economics Popular Today

— Fan

According to the London "Economist" magazine published on January 21 of this year: Recently, there are four concepts that are extremely popular in American economic thought. Moreover, their theories have a tendency to evolve into new doctrines. The following is a summary translation of their main points:

Purchasing Power Compensation Theory　This theory is closely related to the "excess accumulation theory," especially the tax theory of "redistributing national income by increasing tax revenue." They believe that purchasing power must exist for demand to exist; and that demand must exist to stimulate increased production. Therefore, rather than saying that "purchasing power is the result of production," "it is better to say that the possibility of production lies in the stimulating force of demand; that is, in the existence of purchasing power." They believe that the decline of the American railway industry last year was due to wage cuts. Wage cuts led to a decline in purchasing power, thereby making it difficult to restore the economy. At the same time, they also believe that raising tariffs can maintain higher wages, thereby increasing purchasing power. This theory is not only popular in the United States today, but also resonates with many thinkers in other countries, especially France. However, its prevalence is not as widespread as in the United States.

National Treasury Adjustment of National Economy Theory　Even if the national treasury is poor, the state can adopt methods of increasing currency or other methods that can increase national savings, thereby creating national income. Transferring national treasury funds to the people will indeed cause the national treasury to suffer a deficit, but national income (not the gross national product, but the total amount of individual income) can be expected to increase. Similarly, increasing national treasury funds has the possibility of increasing national income. If, due to adhering to the principle of balancing the national budget, national income is limited to the so-called general "normal" level, it is a great mistake from the perspective of the national economy. Due to this view, the national treasury is regarded as a "pump" for adjusting national income; and because a national treasury deficit can increase national income, it is further advocated that this "pump" must "spray water"; and it has evolved into a "credit expansion policy."

Shortening Working Hours to Restore Economic Prosperity Theory　Generally, based on the health of workers, it is advocated that weekly working hours should not exceed forty-eight hours. Now, for the sake of restoring economic prosperity, it is further advocated that weekly working hours be reduced to below forty-eight hours. The U.S. National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 stipulated a 40-hour work week. Although it was later abolished, in the industrial sector, many people have become accustomed to this 40-hour work system and continue to maintain it. Some even uphold it as a traditional right. Because reducing working hours can increase the employment rate of workers, that is, increase general purchasing power. Based on the purchasing power compensation theory, it can be regarded as a means of restoring prosperity.

Theory of Providing the Elderly, Weak, and Unemployed with a Minimum Living Allowance　The unemployed and the elderly should be recognized as having the right to enjoy a minimum living allowance; that is, they must be given purchasing power. The principle of this theory can be found in its attitude towards pensions. According to the current U.S. pension law, it is stipulated that a monthly government pension of $30 should be given. Half of it is paid by the federal government, and the other half is borne by the local government. In addition, the Social Security Act also has provisions for old-age pensions. During last year's general election, increasing the amount of old-age pensions temporarily became the center of American public opinion. And paying $200 per month may not necessarily be more than the actual income two years ago. This theory has a tendency to spread throughout the United States. It is generally believed that the pension system can increase purchasing power, thereby stimulating general consumption, and even stimulating increased production. The increased burden of national treasury payments for pensions will easily cause a deficit in the national treasury. However, this deficit is just the "spraying of water by the pump." Therefore, this theory is actually an extension of the "National Treasury Adjustment of National Economy Theory." It is also an extension of the "Purchasing Power Compensation Theory."

### Grain　Nearly 10,000 Bags of National Rice Arrive Again, Market Price is Clearly Stable but Secretly Weak

Yesterday, the source of national rice, the lower reaches of the river, did not arrive. However, there were quite a few bags of rice transported by rail, nearly 10,000 bags. Since the previous rumors in the market that the price would be lowered by one yuan, the situation seemed to be falling, but this effect was inevitably self-defeating. The Rice Industry Association repeatedly stated that the price was strictly limited and should not exceed 14 yuan. Therefore, although it was a bluff, the result was ultimately difficult to violate the facts. Yesterday, the market opened and people's hearts were relaxed. Most of them returned the goods they had received the day before, and the source was also strong. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice and Duyang sharp-tip rice did not rise or fall, but in fact, they showed a clear stability but a secret weakness. The price of bianyuan rice was flat at 19.5 yuan.

### Sugar Market　Taikoo Granulated White Sugar Rises by Two Corners

Yesterday, Taikoo granulated white sugar also rose because the opening price increased. B spot price: 24.6 yuan at the dock, 24.96 yuan at the west dock, CW brand 24.55 yuan, CX brand 24.42 yuan, DY brand 24.35 yuan, HX brand 24.15 yuan, H brand raw red sugar still 16.6 yuan, and the near-term price of 24 Dutch coarse white sugar was once 5.17 yuan. Yesterday's call plate increased slightly, but there were no transactions. The association's plate was flat at 24.7 yuan outside the dock and 24.85 yuan at this dock. The price of the Da Jinqian brand was 25.15 yuan, the price of Taikoo XA brand was 24.7 yuan, the spot price of Dutch red sugar was 16.6 yuan, and the price of transit goods was 11 yuan. As the price of coarse white sugar rose, the price of the local factory's cotton white sugar also followed closely. The price of Zhenji No. 1 was 24.8 yuan, the prices of No. 2, 3, and 4 remained unchanged, and the price of No. 1 ice sugar was 33.3 yuan. There were sporadic transactions of domestic sugar, with only a few dozen bags of Qi white sugar opened, priced at 19 yuan. Xinghua white sugar was called at 23.5 yuan, and Hainan red sugar still held the original price. It was found that the goods previously opened at 13.9 yuan were still in the hands of the firm, so although the source was scarce, the receivers were extremely rare.

### Hardware　High Costs (Continued)　Sales Plates for Various Goods are All Increased, but Customer Sales are Reduced

Local Nails　Since the factory increased the price, the association's negotiated price also increased accordingly. Therefore, the market price for each barrel of Bessemer steel nails is 17 yuan, but there are still many secret transactions at a price of 16.89 yuan. Recently, transactions have been smoother with Sichuan and Fujian merchants, while other merchants only have sporadic transactions.

Purple Copper Ingots　Transactions with local customers are all quiet. However, the Ordnance Factory and Copper Bureau still have purchases, so the market situation is still good. The market price is affected by the sharp increase in the fixed price and the increase in the association's red plate, so the opening price is always around 90 yuan and 92 yuan.

Tinplate　Sales are the widest with Shaoxing merchants, because the tin foil produced there is sold throughout the country. Currently, affected by the war, transportation is blocked, and the market for tin foil is sluggish, so sales have stagnated. However, the market price in Shanghai is very strong as decided by the red plate, with an opening price of 370 yuan per dan, but there are few real transactions and a lack of large quantities, so the market atmosphere is quiet.

Lead　Since overseas fixed prices have skyrocketed and the local port's shilling exchange rate has increased, the market price has suddenly risen to 37 yuan. However, real transactions are only sporadic, so the market is very quiet. It is heard that mixed lead firms are only selling for about 26 yuan, but real sales are still sluggish, making it even more difficult to develop transactions in foreign lead (i.e., imported goods).

Pure Antimony　Due to the impact of the war and the active expansion of armaments by various countries, the pure antimony produced in Hunan, China, is being absorbed as much as possible, so the transactions are quite large. The opening price of spot goods is also very considerable, with the highest market price opening at 1,400 yuan, and the market atmosphere is unusually stable. (End)

### Chinese Troops Concentrated in Northern Jiangsu Awaiting Orders　To Form an Arc-Shaped Encirclement of Japanese Troops　Residents Along the Ports Flee to the Interior One After Another Japanese Attempts to Block Various Ports Cannot be Realized

The Chinese troops in the five counties of Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu have been ordered to station themselves at the various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of the Japanese troops at places such as Tiensheng Harbor and Qinglong Harbor, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. Residents along the river are evacuating to the interior. The Japanese side's original plan to blockade the ports from March 10 will be difficult to realize. The following is a report from the modern press reporter:

Troops from All Sides Stationed Along the Ports　The Chinese troops originally stationed in the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong in northern Jiangsu have been ordered by the General Headquarters of the 24th Army Group of the Third War Zone to advance from the interior to the ports for defense starting on the evening of March 9. Currently, about 70,000 to 90,000 Chinese troops are densely deployed within a distance of approximately 150 nautical miles from Songji Harbor in Haimen to Xinsheng Harbor in Rugao, and have established contact, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of the Japanese military bases along the coast, such as Qinglong Harbor in Haimen, Tiensheng Harbor in Nantong, and Xinsheng Harbor in Rugao. Strong defensive fortifications and trenches for attacking the Japanese troops have been built.

Port Residents Evacuate to the Interior　The military authorities, considering that the general counteroffensive is about to begin, and in view of the past brutal acts of the Japanese army, indiscriminately bombing with planes and artillery, harming the lives and property of innocent civilians, have ordered the residents of all ports along the river to evacuate to the interior as soon as possible in order to reduce or avoid such tragic events. Therefore, in recent days, the situation of congestion everywhere due to the migration of various ports has entered a state of war. Various businesses are also winding down in order to evacuate when necessary. Although the ships are still sailing as usual, the cargo volume has decreased sharply.

Japanese Blockade of Ports Difficult to Realize　The Japanese side originally planned to implement a blockade of all ports on the North Jiangsu line that are not stationed by Japanese troops starting on March 10, cutting off the transportation and communication of the Chinese troops. Unexpectedly, this plan was foreseen by the Chinese troops, who moved their troops to the ports before the Japanese blockade. If the Japanese side takes any action, they will be severely attacked. According to the authorities, although the Japanese army has the superior position of naval bombardment along the coast, the Chinese troops have strong deployments and troop deployments on land. In fact, it may not be possible to recover all the lost territory, but at least it can consume a large amount of Japanese ammunition.

### Zhuanqiao Tense Situation Japanese Casualties Quite Heavy Villagers Flock to Shanghai

After the Chinese army moved west, Shanghai County became a guerrilla area. Zhuanqiao, Beiqiao, Maqiao, Tangwan and other places are controlled by the Chinese guerrillas. Yesterday, according to a Zhuanqiao villager who came to Shanghai, recently, a small puppet of the Zhuanqiao puppet organization, Yao, used to be an employee of Toyota Spinning Factory. Recently, in order to please his "master," he went to various villages and towns to widely collect cotton, arbitrarily lowering the price of cotton and exploiting the good people. Therefore, the general farmers all hate him. Yesterday, he was attacked by the 47th Tourist Detachment of Baima Mountain. Yao reported to the Japanese side for revenge and surrounded him. However, the guerrillas were prepared. On that day, the fierce battle lasted for a day and a night. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the guerrillas suffered slight casualties. Therefore, in recent days, the situation in Zhuanqiao, Beiqiao and other places has been very tense, and the villagers have been leaving their homes to avoid Shanghai.

### Yesterday, Various Circles Commemorated the Passing of the Premier; Today is Industry Propaganda Day; Various Trade Unions Issue Letters to Fellow Workers; The Industrial Sector Voluntarily Formulates Endeavor Guidelines

Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of the passing of the Premier. Various circles in the city flew flags at half-mast for the entire day. Various organizations held commemorative meetings and observed a moment of silence at noon to express their condolences. Entertainment venues also voluntarily closed to express their sorrow. Yesterday was the commercial sector propaganda day for the first publicity week of the second phase of the war of resistance in the city. Various commercial organizations issued letters to fellow members of the business community, encouraging them to strive to promote domestic goods and to vigorously develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest. Today is industry propaganda day. The following is a record of the letters from various trade unions to all workers in the city and the industry's endeavor guidelines:

Fellow workers of the city, today, as the war of resistance has surpassed twenty months, we see the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers at the front, the increasing depletion of the enemy's strength, and the approaching of final victory. At this juncture, we need to intensify our efforts and strive to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete the great task of resistance and nation-building. In the past, the efforts of all Shanghai workers in resisting the enemy and saving the nation have had great manifestations. Now, the second phase of the war of resistance has already begun, and we should continue the spirit of the past, and more widely and deeply intensify our efforts. First, since Shanghai fell, most of our country's factories have been destroyed by the enemy, while the enemy's factories are trying to recover, attempting to use the low wages of our workers to dominate the markets of the Far East. Our patriotic workers who understand the righteousness of the matter should voluntarily not work in the enemy's factories. Workers who are already working in the enemy's factories should immediately and voluntarily withdraw. At the same time, we hope that the workers working in our country's factories can embrace the spirit of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, and self-sacrifice, and voluntarily increase working hours to promote the production business, or voluntarily reduce wages, shorten hours, and other methods, to accommodate workers who withdraw from the enemy's factories, as well as the general unemployed workers. Second, most of our country's factories have moved to the interior, so there is an urgent need for skilled and technical workers in the rear. Among the unemployed workers in Shanghai, there are many skilled and technical workers. If they stay in Shanghai and suffer the pain of unemployment, it is better to summon up the courage to find work in the rear. On the one hand, the country's needs and supplies can be coordinated, and on the other hand, production can be strengthened, national strength can be enhanced, and at the same time, personal life can be solved, so that human resources will not be wasted. Third, the workers of Shanghai have always been rich in the spirit of loving the country and loving the nation. Especially in this great era of national resistance, we should embrace the meaning of "everyone is responsible" to participate in this sacred war. Therefore, we warmly hope that the workers of the city will actively rise up and go to the interior to serve in the military as much as possible. Looking at the past wars in European countries, overseas Chinese living abroad have all automatically returned to their countries to participate in the military. Could it be that our compatriots living in the country cannot go to the interior to serve in the military? We must know that being idle in this isolated island of Shanghai is the most cowardly and shameful thing. Fourth, the workers of Shanghai have always been organized, and their strength and greatness have a glorious history in the Chinese revolutionary movement. At this critical moment of life and death for the country and the nation, this organizational force should do its utmost for the country and the nation. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has repeatedly instructed us, "Before the country and the nation, we should sacrifice all private opinions, selfishness, private interests, private gains, and even sacrifice personal freedom and life." Therefore, at this juncture, all labor-capital disputes should no longer occur. Labor and capital should work together in the spirit of sharing the same boat and being like hands and feet, and make the best efforts for the country. The above four points are deeply hoped that the workers of the city will be of one mind and one heart to promote their realization. Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions

### Saving Two Dollars a Month Can Save a Life; The Variety Show Broadcasting Committee Issues a Letter to All Circles

The Variety Show Broadcasting Committee of the Citizen Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to appeal to all circles to participate in the refugee adoption movement, specially issued a letter to all circles, saying that people in the city, when going out to play, eat, dance, watch a movie, or play a small game of mahjong, spend two dollars, which is not considered a big deal, but from the perspective of the poor refugees, these two dollars are enough for them to maintain a month of life. Therefore, the committee has the slogan "Saving two dollars a month can save a refugee's life," appealing to all circles to participate in the refugee adoption movement. At present, there are still many refugees in the city, and they are still increasing. At the same time, the date of maintaining their lives is much longer than the dates of relief after previous natural disasters. Therefore, a large amount of funds is very likely to be used up in a very short period. As for improving their lives, there is no need to talk about it, but our purpose is not only to maintain their lives, but also to use their spare labor so that they can also use their own labor to supply their own daily needs within the possible range, so that the burden on our citizens in the future can be reduced. The group has a broadcasting fundraising committee to handle broadcasting publicity matters. Now, with the enthusiastic support and participation of the leaders of the variety show industry, the owners of various radio stations, and charitable people from all walks of life who care about the future of society, the scope of the committee has been expanded and the Variety Show Broadcasting Committee has been established. In the future, the variety show broadcasting method will be used to promote to all circles, please pay more attention to the future of the refugees, and have more pity for the suffering of the refugees. Therefore, take out more money to help them, and strive to raise more funds in the shortest period, in addition to prolonging their lives, but also to purchase some production tools to gradually put them on the road to self-sufficiency. Shanghai opera also sings, "The poor are not poor forever, and the rich are not rich forever." Especially in this painful period, all unpredictable environments can make great changes in life. Therefore, relieving refugees can also be said to be for one's own future. It is hoped that all circles will work hard to cooperate with the committee in the future to benefit the refugees and create safety for all our citizens.

### A Batch of Pseudo-"Troops" Stationed in Western Shanghai; Guerrilla Forces Will Painfully Suppress Them; Pseudo-"Troops" Equipped With Inferior Weapons and No Ammunition; Western Shanghai Farmers Fearing Harassment Retreat Together

The Zi Lin newspaper reported that yesterday (the 11th), it was learned that the pseudo-troops of the "Reformed Government" had been transferred to the area outside the concession defense zone in western Shanghai, and together with the Japanese army, they were sentries at railway intersections and important bridges and intersections in the Hongqiao Road and Robogen Road areas. Last night, according to Chinese sources, the guerrilla forces, which have been active in these areas in recent months, vowed to wipe out these pseudo-troops. The villagers in a certain place near Hongqiao Road and the golf course all retreated last night. Residents in the Hongqiao area have seen pseudo-troops and Japanese sentries appear at railway intersections. These people seem to be inferior soldiers, and their equipment is inferior. Although they carry rifles, they have no ammunition. West of the railway intersection, a part of the pseudo-troops has replaced the Japanese sentries. A certain bridge, which is often stationed by two Japanese soldiers, was seen yesterday with two Japanese soldiers and pseudo-troops stationed there, and only one Japanese soldier. Even the pseudo-police station is defended by pseudo-troops. According to observers, a certain town next to Hongqiao Road seems to have established the headquarters of the pseudo-troops. Pseudo-troops can be seen throughout the town, but it is impossible to guess how many there are. Yesterday afternoon, several gunshots suddenly rang out, causing rumors that the guerrilla forces attacked the pseudo-troops in the vicinity, but it could not be confirmed. According to inquiries from the villagers, the guerrilla forces have declared that they will eliminate the pseudo-troops, so the farmers in the area have retreated together. However, until late last night, no gunshots were heard nearby, nor did any events that could prove the rumors occur. It is still recalled that several weeks ago, it was rumored that the pseudo-"Reformed Government" decided to send pseudo-troops to Shanghai to assist in the so-called "silent war" in the concession, which has been proven to be bluffing. It is said that only thirty or forty newly trained pseudo-police officers in Nanjing came to Shanghai. These people caused speculation from the outside world yesterday when they arrived in Shanghai. According to the mainland newspaper, the Japanese mainland newspaper in the city revealed yesterday (the 11th) that the Japanese side intends to establish 3 million pseudo-troops, with a cost of five jiao per person. The "army" will be composed of young people, and the movement will be started by the pseudo-"Reformed Government" in Nanjing. The cost of this plan is 1.5 million yuan. The "army" will be dedicated to "establishing peace and order in the three provinces and developing a new China."

Its urgent purpose is to contain the "threat of the Reds." However, according to Chinese sources, the Japanese military authorities are attempting to use their "supplementary soldiers" to deal with the increasingly active guerrilla forces that have caused serious concern to the Japanese army. According to the translation of the mainland military newspaper, the "graduates of the Reformed Academy" in Japan will form the core of the "army." After special guidance, these young people will return to various places in the occupied areas to compile the proposed "army."

### American Newspaper Reporter Observes the Future of the War; Japan Cannot Launch a Major Offensive in the Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Areas This Year; Chinese Military Strength is Strengthened; Garrison in the Taihu Lake Area is Important

According to the Mainland News, American newspaper reporter Belden, who traveled through Central and South China, has just returned to Shanghai. It is said that the general view of Chinese army officers is that the Japanese army will not launch a major offensive until next year. Although they have not been able to determine Japan's future actions, they believe that what Tokyo is mainly concerned about today is to exert pressure on Britain and France to force China to end the war of resistance. If this move fails, the Japanese army may begin to invade Guangxi in order to cut off China's communication with the outside world. Now, one hundred divisions of the Chinese regular army and guerrilla forces, totaling one million people, are waiting in battle in the third, fourth, and ninth war zones on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, although a large army is stationed in these areas, there has been no major military action on the south bank of the Yangtze River for many months. If the Japanese army invades Guangxi, the province may become the "second Shanxi." In addition to the difficult terrain of Guangxi, the Japanese army will also encounter the resolute resistance of the people. The people of Guangxi are now preparing to deal with any eventuality. For the sake of precaution, most of the important highways in the province have been damaged, and the highways have been flooded with water where possible. This move may not be able to stop the Japanese army, but it can slow down their invasion. Another method taken by the province is to relocate the people within five miles of the highway to other places and fully prepare for a second relocation when notified. Mr. Bell became slightly ill in Shaoguan, Guangdong, and had to stay in a British hospital. It is said that the hospital is busy treating refugees and poor civilians. The guerrilla forces and regular troops in southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized, and it is estimated that the number has reached 150,000. It may soon be seen that they are becoming more active, especially around the Taihu Lake area. The area is under the command of General Gu Zhutong. When the Chinese army withdrew in the winter of 1937, Gu unified his army. Although the area under Gu's command is currently not strategically important, the area may be of greater importance as the war progresses. During the Taiping Rebellion, Zeng Guofan also retreated into the area to reorganize his army. Ten years later, he led his troops again and dealt a fatal blow to the rebel army. In view of the fact that the Japanese army's economic and military base and the location of the puppet regime, Nanjing, are not far from the area, the area is even more important.

Mr. Bell believes that Gu Zhutong is one of the most capable and loyal subordinates of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The famous 87th Division, 88th Division, and the later 36th Division were formed by Gu's old troops and are one of the most elite units of the Central Army. After Gu and his troops retreated to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, many officers were sent to the interior for special training. During this period, they participated in combat exercises, received strategic training, and used the training ground as a battlefield laboratory.

Some of Gu's troops have entered the guerrilla area. There are currently about 150,000 guerrilla forces stationed on the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and new troops are joining and gradually strengthening. The commander of all the guerrilla forces in Jiangsu Province is Leng Xin, a graduate of Huangpu, who soon served as a division commander of the Central Army. He is now also the civil administrator of the area managed by his army. Leng told Mr. Bell that the reorganization of the guerrilla forces has been completed, and a significant increase in mobile warfare in the area can be expected. He also invited Mr. Bell to inspect the area under his administration. Mr. Bell declined because he had other appointments. Mr. Bell criticized the situation of the guerrilla forces, saying that it is a mistake to assume that all Chinese troops are now fighting guerrilla warfare, and it is not in line with the facts. According to his estimation, no more than 150,000 of the 1 million soldiers in the third war zone he passed through have been reorganized into guerrilla forces. Most of the guerrilla forces are led by officers who have received special training for half a year in the rear. The reorganization of all the guerrilla forces is also carried out by these officers. Therefore, Mr. Bell believes that the activities of the guerrilla forces in the guerrilla area will be increased.

### Japanese Military Police Intrusion into US Military Defense Zone; Surrounded in Front of Shao Shijun's Residence; Retreat After Explanation by US Military Officer; Evidence of Intensifying Infighting Among Pseudo-Officials

According to the Zi Lin newspaper, just after 10:30 yesterday morning, a truck of armed soldiers from the Fourth Marine Corps of the United States stationed in Shanghai, led by two officers, drove to No. 39 Nanyang Road, the residence of Shao Shijun, the "Director of the Unified Tax Bureau," and stopped. Several detectives from the police station and four plainclothes personnel from the Japanese military police department were surrounded. Then, two US military officers were seen approaching the Japanese. It was heard that they explained that the Japanese were not allowed to take independent action in the US military defense zone. According to witnesses, the Japanese left after hearing this. Inquiries were made with the headquarters of the US Marine Corps last night, but nothing was revealed. When asked by one of the personnel, it was said that he had nothing to tell. No information about this matter was obtained from the General Patrol Room and the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room. The nature of this matter cannot be determined at present. Judging from the phenomenon, the police station and the Japanese military police department are currently investigating separately, but the presence of Japanese military officers seems to indicate that this matter must be of a political nature or a semi-political nature. It has not been heard that the Japanese military police department has investigated criminal cases in the Public Concession before. This statement seems to be able to prove the rumors that have been circulating for several weeks that the infighting among the Chinese pseudo-officials of the "Reformed Government" is quite fierce, and they have even accused each other. If yesterday's events were also in this category, it seems that someone accused Shao Shijun, and the Japanese and police station personnel investigated at the same time. Roughly, the two sides met by chance in front of his residence. According to witnesses, there was no break-up situation after the US soldiers arrived. At that time, the officers of the US Marine Corps and the Japanese military police did not hear any threatening tone in their conversation. According to the usual practice, if the Japanese police personnel want to investigate cases in the Public Concession, they should ask the police station for assistance, and then allocate some detectives as usual and go with the Japanese. But judging from yesterday's events, the Japanese did not seem to follow the previous practice. The "Unified Tax Bureau" is one of the most important parts of the "Reformed Government," and Shao Shijun is the "Director" of the bureau.

### The Municipal Council Reconsiders British Election

According to the Zi Lin newspaper, the British in Shanghai have arranged to pre-select five British people as candidates for the Municipal Council election according to the procedures of last year. The British Chamber of Commerce, the China Association (Shanghai Branch), and the Overseas British Association have all issued ballots, listing the names of ten tax-paying British people who are willing to serve as candidates for the council. The tax-paying British people will cross out the names of five people who they do not wish to recommend, and send the ballots to the voting inspector, Wilkinson, before March 16. Then, five of them will be selected as candidates for the council. The Municipal Council election is scheduled to be held on April 12 and 13.

### Various Organizations Mourn Zhang Tuaian; The Ceremony Was Grand and Extremely Sad

The late Nantong industrialist Zhang Tuaian passed away in Shanghai last year. More than 20 organizations, including the textile, salt reclamation, education, and charity undertakings operated by Mr. Zhang during his lifetime, held a memorial service and public memorial at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road yesterday in memory of Mr. Zhang's legacy. The ceremony was grand. The weather was sunny and beautiful on this day, and there were many guests. The organizations that attended included Nantong Dasheng Textile Company, Dada Shipping Company, Kenmu, Dafeng, Dayoujin, Dayu, Huacheng, more than 20 salt reclamation companies, Nantong College, Nantong Women's Normal School, Nantong Middle School, Textile Alumni Association, Nantong charitable organizations, Tongruchonghaiqi Five County Fellow Association, etc. Celebrities included Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Li Bako, Wu Yunzhai, Li Qiqing, Xu Jingren, Wang Dankui, etc. There were more than a thousand guests in total. The scene was unprecedentedly grand. For a time, on Binlang Road, plain cars and white horses were connected endlessly. In particular, the elegiac couplets and poems sent by various celebrities were dazzling and extremely sad. From 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., leaders of various organizations held public memorials in order. In terms of arrangement, a plaque with the words "Memorial Service for Mr. Zhang Tuaian of Nantong" was hung high at the entrance. Mr. Zhang's portrait was hung in the central hall. From the main hall to the corridor of the temple gate, more than a thousand elegiac banners and couplets from various celebrities were hung everywhere. For example, Mr. Zhu Qinglan's couplet said, "Counting the great industrialists, Hu Lian's virtuous name is passed down to Wei Ci, mourning the lifelong best friend, Jiang Huai's noble character admires the fields." Mr. Han Guojun's couplet said, "Opening a new era for the industrial world, being full of worries until the highest years, getting great relief in times of great chaos, fortunately seeing the latecomers rising." The sons and daughters paid their respects, and dozens of condolences from various dignitaries such as Dean Kong and Minister Zhang from Chongqing were received one after another, which shows that Mr. Zhang's engagement in industry during his lifetime was deeply admired by the Chinese people.

### Rice Industry Stabilizes Market Price; Establishes Evaluation Committee; Market Management Methods Seem to Lack Thoroughness; Rice and Grain Have Not Yet Reached a Serious Period; It is Necessary to Ban Speculation, Manipulation, and Hoarding

The Shanghai rice market is affected by direct purchases from the production area by the Japanese puppets, resulting in soaring prices. Since the association stipulated a price limit, the underground market has exceeded the price limit. The bean and rice, rice shop, rice milling, sales, and other rice industry associations, as well as the South Gang Guild Hall, Changshu Guild Hall, etc., are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss and stabilize the market price. It is decided to organize an evaluation committee to ban hoarding, speculation, and manipulation. The details are as follows:

Rice Industry Sends Representatives to Explain Everything; In addition to sending letters to the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Public Board of Directors, asking them to take precautions and quickly prepare good policies, the Bean Rice Industry Association also sent members Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Qiangeng to the two concession authorities to explain everything together with Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Shop Industry Association. He De Kui and others received them and exchanged opinions on stabilizing rice prices. It is heard that the concession authorities believe that it is not yet time to order foreign rice and should first find ways to dredge the sources, so as to prevent the panic of lack of food for Shanghai citizens.

Joint Meeting to Stabilize Rice Prices; In addition to advising merchants from various places to resume transportation, the Market Management Committee also invited various firms to maintain the price limit. Now, because the prices of various rice in the market have risen to the price limit, and the general hoarders are unwilling to sell at the price limit, merchants dare not transport in large quantities due to cost reasons, resulting in underground transactions. The Bean Rice Industry Association believes that the price of rice in the underground market exceeds the price limit, which is a matter of great importance to the food of Shanghai citizens, so it has been decided to convene the Rice Shop, Rice Milling, and Business Associations, as well as the South Gang Changshu Guild Hall, at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss stabilization methods.

Decision to Organize Evaluation Committee; According to news from rice industry organizations, in accordance with the regulations on food adjustment during the extraordinary period promulgated by the government, "If the local food prices fluctuate abnormally due to speculation and manipulation by unscrupulous people, the local government or food adjustment agencies should take appropriate measures to stop them, and they may carefully stipulate the highest or lowest prices of food in important food markets, taking into account the actual situation, to prevent manipulation. Therefore, it is decided to organize an evaluation committee to assess rice prices. The candidates for the committee will be nominated at today's joint meeting. In the future, the rice price will be assessed weekly or daily first, and then the market will announce the market transaction, and it is planned that the market customers must use transaction orders before the transaction to avoid hoarders or empty-headed brokers from spreading rumors and affecting the market."

Municipal Council Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss; In view of the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days, which is related to the livelihood of the common people, in addition to supervising rice industry organizations to properly stabilize the market price and monitor the situation in the trading market and find ways to stop it, in order to regulate the food of Shanghai citizens in the future, the Municipal Council will hold a board meeting this week, and then submit it to the Food Joint Management Committee to be responsible for planning everything.

Banning Speculation, Manipulation, and Hoarding; The underground market price of rice in the Shanghai Bean Rice Market has exceeded the price limit of 14 yuan per stone. The main reason is that the direct purchases from the production area by the Japanese puppets have raised the price of rice in the interior, and merchants dare not transport in large quantities due to cost reasons, but it is inevitable that there will be hoarding and speculation. It is now decided to send members to thoroughly investigate whether there are unscrupulous merchants monopolizing and manipulating, and deal with it in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the Wartime Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations promulgated by the government, and ask the two concession authorities to provide full assistance.

Proposing to Order to Prevent Lack; The government stipulates that if there is a lack of food and it is considered necessary to transport foreign rice with tax exemption or tax reduction to adjust it, it should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economics and then to the Executive Yuan for approval before purchasing and transporting it. Now, the rice industry organizations, in view of the fact that there is sufficient reserve in Shanghai at present, there will be no panic of lack for the time being, but there will inevitably be a lack in the future when the old and new crops are not connected. Therefore, it is hoped that the two concession authorities will follow the methods of the winter of 1937 and order foreign rice, transport it to Shanghai in batches, and hand it over to the rice industry organizations for equal distribution, and ask the government to specially approve tax-free imports and provide foreign exchange.

Food Has Not Reached a Serious Period; According to Zhang Nianxuan, a rice industry tycoon, told the Modern News reporter yesterday, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days have caused a lot of complaints from all parties. Tracing the reasons, it is not the source of rice in the interior and the amount of storage in Shanghai, but it is due to the market operation and management methods, which seem to lack thoroughness. According to the current amount of storage in Shanghai, it is enough for three or four months of food for the people, and there is no serious period at all. Even in the future, there is no worry of lack and panic. According to personal opinion, (1) dredge the source, (2) assess the market price, (3) the benefits that the industry should get, proceed according to these three principles, then the hoarders will have no way to use their skills, and the rice price can also tend to be stable.

### Public Benefit Fees for Shanghai-Ningbo Ships to be Paid According to Net Cargo Tonnage; Coal Bunkers and Water Tanks Not Included in Calculation

The shipping lines operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, including the "De Ping," "Mou Fu," "Tang Sai," "Shan Tai," and "Xin Beijing," sent a letter yesterday to the Shipping Association, which was then telegraphed to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Finance. The letter stated that the public benefit fees for imported goods paid by the ships should be calculated according to the net cargo tonnage, as per regulations. However, the "De Ping" and other ships had mistakenly included the tonnage occupied by coal bunkers and water tanks in their reported tonnage. The letter included a detailed table of the tonnage occupied by each part of the ship and requested permission to correct the error and pay public benefit fees based on the net cargo tonnage of the ships, to alleviate the burden.

### Catholic Action Society Held Prayers Yesterday for Pope Pius XII; Mass Attended by Many Catholics

After the death of Pope Pius XI, the College of Cardinals elected Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli as Pope Pius XII. The Catholic Action Society, the sole Catholic organization in this city, led by Lu Yin Geng and Zhu Ziyao, sent a telegram to Rome congratulating the new Pope. To express their congratulations, they held a Mass at 7:30 AM yesterday at the Sacred Heart Church on Avenue Joffre, praying for the health and well-being of the new Pope. Father Xu Zongduo presided over the Mass, and many members of the society attended, making the occasion very lively.

### Puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an Makes Demands to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Uttering Delusional Requests

According to the *North China Daily News*, the Japanese-backed "Mayor" of Shanghai, Fu Xiao'an, lodged a protest yesterday (the 11th) with the Shanghai Municipal Council (Chairman Fessenden and Secretary General Feester) and the consular body. He demanded improvements in policing methods to curb terrorism and communist crimes in the International and French Concessions, and the return of the "Avenue Road" police station in the western district, which had recently been closed by the British military authorities. In addition, he demanded house-to-house searches for terrorists and communists in the International Settlement, the immediate handover of the Special Court to the new municipal government, the surrender of all official documents and archives of the former Land Office, and the prohibition of the Kuomintang flag in the International Settlement. He warned that if the Council refused to accept his protest and fulfill his demands, it would be responsible for any losses and consequences that might arise.

### Japanese Boat Carrying Munitions Intercepted in Zhagang; Over Forty Japanese Soldiers Annihilated in Tangwan; Martial Law Imposed and Electric Fences Installed in Coastal Areas

On the 10th, four Japanese gasoline boats loaded with munitions were sailing near Zhagang when they were spotted by Ding Xishan's guerrilla forces. The guerrillas fired shots to stop them, and the Japanese soldiers on board returned fire, attempting to provide cover for the boats' advance. The guerrillas bravely charged forward, surrounding the boats and detaining them. They seized over thirty boxes of bullets and twelve boxes of hand grenades, and captured eight Japanese military police hiding in the cabins, who were taken to headquarters for interrogation.

Fierce Battle in Tangwan. In Tangwan Town, Shanghai County, traitors Wang Fugen and Gu A'bao forcibly abducted women on the evening of the 5th. Guerrilla forces killed Wang Fugen, but Gu A'bao escaped. The next day, Gu led a Japanese company of about forty soldiers from the direction of Beiqiao, surrounding the town and setting it on fire. Qian Bin, the leader of the guerrilla forces, upon hearing the news, led his troops to attack. A fierce battle ensued for over three hours, resulting in the annihilation of all the Japanese soldiers and the capture of thirteen alive. Over thirty civilian houses in the town were burned down.

Martial Law in Coastal Areas. The atmosphere in Pudong has been extremely tense recently. Yesterday (the 11th), the Japanese military imposed martial law.

Several streets have been blockaded, and there are very few pedestrians on the streets.

### Income Tax Refund Procedures

The Ministry of Finance announced that the process of refunding income tax in provinces and counties, which originally required submitting requests level by level, was time-consuming due to the back-and-forth of documents. To expedite the process and provide convenience to taxpayers, the Income Tax Administration has revised the "Provisional Measures for Tax Refunds," consisting of fifteen articles, which have been approved by the Ministry and are now being implemented. According to the new regulations, tax refunds of less than 100 yuan can be approved by the provincial administration, while refunds of 100 yuan or more must still be submitted to the Ministry and the Administration for approval. These measures will be effective from July 1st of this year, which is the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).

Japanese and Puppet Regime Attempt to Seize Southeastern Electricity and Water Utilities

All Companies Under the Control of Central China Water and Electricity Company Firmly Refuse Cooperation

Since the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, the Japanese have established the so-called "Central China Water and Electricity Company," with the intention of seizing all water and electricity utilities in the Southeast. The Japanese government directed the "Central China Government" in Nanjing to formulate regulations entrusting the "Central China Water and Electricity Company" with the management of various water and electricity plants in the Southeast. The Japanese had already seized the assets of plants in Shanghai and the surrounding area, treating them as their own. However, most water and electricity companies in other regions were still staffed by employees, making it difficult to seize them without a pretext. Although the Japanese had repeatedly requested cooperation from these companies, they had been firmly refused. Last month, the puppet "Ministry of Industry" in Nanjing suddenly published an announcement inviting representatives from major power plants and water companies along the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to attend a meeting to discuss the so-called cooperation. The announcement stated that if they failed to attend, the "reorganization measures" stipulated by the Ministry would be implemented. Major power plants in Nanjing, Wuxi, and Hangzhou ignored the announcement and refused to attend, causing the meeting to fail. Seeing that their attempts to acquire the utilities through trickery had failed, the Japanese have decided to disregard everything and order the puppet authorities to directly assign the water and electricity plants to the "Central China Water and Electricity Company."

### True Love After Marriage Must be Forged Through Health

— By Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

Although many people reach the goal of marriage, it is not easy to maintain love after marriage forever. The union of two sexes is by no means a small matter, but the supremely important event of life. If one can only take care of the wedding ceremony and cannot give play to the spirit of cooperation in married life, it will ultimately create a great tragedy.

There are often many tragedies of divorce played out in society. Although there are many reasons for these tragedies, the main point is mostly due to the failure of love to merge. Because the love between men and women must be forged from health. If you lose this healthy body and soul, then no matter how superior the living environment you have, it is in vain!

To keep our health from being lost due to married life, the first question depends on cherishing virginity before marriage and avoiding self-abuse. After marriage, it is especially important to restrain sexual desire, so that the love between both sexes will not be abandoned due to a temporary lack of reproductive power. However, if there is a true abnormality in reproductive power, you must not avoid medical treatment. In addition to paying extra attention to reproductive hygiene, you should also use the most effective German youth glandular preparations for men, "Bokang", so that reproductive power will be rejuvenated and love will be as new as ever.

Although reproduction is a natural human instinct, there is no guarantee that the enjoyment of marital pleasure will not be lost due to pathological symptoms of sexual sensitivity. In medicine, this is called sexual dysfunction, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and female frigidity. Those who suffer from this are indeed a symptom of their own physical weakness. People over forty years of age have a decline in reproductive energy due to physiological factors. This is because the youth gland that governs sexual power changes from strong to weak. This is because a person's libido gradually disappears with age. This is not only true for libido, but also for the spirit, skin, and other parts of the body. Now that we understand that the health of sexual power lies in the prosperity of the youth gland, "Bokang", the male and robust animal youth glandular endocrine preparation invented by German venereal disease expert Dr. Meulen, is indeed a great invention of 24th-century medical crystallization. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is uplifted, the complexion is ruddy, the appetite is increased, and the sexual function is very healthy. There are absolutely no symptoms of premature ejaculation or impotence, and it can promote reproductive function and help the sexual organs develop. It can restore the sexual power of middle-aged people, nourish the brain, kidney, and blood, all of which are its outstanding effects. It is a sacred tonic product for the old and young. The female "Bokang" is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy, treating anemia and breast atrophy, especially for frigidity that occurs after marriage. One dose of this medicine will immediately turn you into an affectionate person.

### New Treatment for Leukorrhea

— By Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA

The difficulty of treating gonorrhea and the lack of effective and rapid cures have long been known to patients with chronic gonorrhea. They have suffered from gonorrhea for three to five years and taken many medications without being cured. Even in Europe and the United States in the past, the word gonorrhea was often talked about with fear.

Now, thanks to scientific advances, scholars are constantly studying gonorrhea treatments and have invented a non-specific therapy to increase the anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect, making it stronger and suppressing the fierce attack of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is best at escaping and scurrying around. If one place is cured, another place will be attacked and cause trouble. Therefore, no matter which part of the organ, it can penetrate, such as the joints, deep internal organs, and even the two major organs of reproduction and the urinary system. However, if this method of eliminating gonorrhea can be put into practical effort, it will not be difficult to eradicate it. Because non-specific therapy can resist and eliminate the function of gonorrhea, German Dr. Peter devoted more than 30 years of research and, based on this theory, adopted a special mixture of egg yolk pigment to create the medicine "Kelinong." Thus, gonorrhea, which no one has conquered for thousands of years, is now conquered by the medicine "Kelinong." The characteristics are analyzed as follows: (1) "Kelinong" has anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effects. This effect is distributed to all cells. Wherever gonorrhea is, the bactericidal effect of "Kelinong" will be fully exerted. (2) "Kelinong" is purely refined and manufactured by scientific methods and has absolutely no adverse side effects, which is very different from general membrane-permeable sterilization and sandalwood oil preparations that have side effects. (3) "Kelinong" has the functions of relieving pain, diuresis, and clearing turbidity because of its anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effects. All the above-mentioned effects are fully equipped for the conditions for radically curing gonorrhea. If you can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" as an external medicine, and use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" for women as vaginal suppositories, then all acute and chronic gonorrhea can be quickly and radically cured.

### Thinking about the Future of Young People Who Self-Abuse

— By German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Due to the physiological maturity of young people, many are addicted to self-abuse due to weak will. Speaking of the causes of the harm of self-abuse, it is caused by excessive damage to the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center, often causing nocturnal emission and neurasthenia, leading to a haggard appearance and decadent spirit, and everything is negative and pessimistic. Even though the harm of self-abuse has loosened the sperm gate and lost its astringent function, causing symptoms such as spermatorrhea, patients often shy away from seeing reputable doctors and secretly treat themselves. As for treatment, the first step is to diagnose the cause of the disease, and then treat it according to the pathology, which is easy to cure. However, the treatment must be continued for several weeks without interruption, and life must be taken care of at all times, so that the symptoms of spermatorrhea can be cured.

To treat spermatorrhea, you must first quit self-abuse, and then take the spermatorrhea medicine "Nailesi Spermatorrhea Tablets." This agent has the function of consolidating the sperm gate and relieving the hypersensitive state of the ejaculation center. If spermatorrhea has been going on for a long time, combine it with the testicular sperm preparation "Bokang" for men. All symptoms of neurasthenia can be completely cured. Otherwise, if you still ignore it at this time, you will not only lose your health and happiness, but it will also have a great impact on your life.

### How to Eradicate Tuberculosis Bacteria

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Everyone knows that the prognosis of lung disease is terrible, but how can lung disease be so terrible? Regarding this question, we must first have a detailed analysis of the pathology of lung disease, and then we can have a correct understanding and treatment method for this disease. Originally, lung disease is caused by extremely small tubercle bacilli. Its volume must be observed under a high-power microscope after staining. Moreover, its reproductive power is extremely rapid. Therefore, to eradicate lung disease, it is necessary to have the ability to completely search for and eliminate tubercle bacilli, and the only drug that has this effect is "Bufei Naer." I have been in the clinic for lung diseases for decades, and I often feel the lack of internal medicine. But since the invention of "Bufei Naer," this kind of regret has been filled.

### Rapid Treatment of Gonococcal Arthritis

Gonococcal arthritis is originally one of the systemic infections of gonococcus. There are many causes of this disease, but to get to the bottom of it, it is nothing more than patients with gonorrhea who are delayed in treatment, and the remaining poison is dormant inside. Due to alcohol and sex labor and other irritations, this cunning gonococcus circulates throughout the body with the blood. If the gonococcus stays in the joint, it becomes arthritis. Patients have alternating chills and fever, swollen joints, sudden sharp pain, tension and fluctuation. Tiredness, loss of appetite, the range of gonococcus is increasingly expanded, so it is unpredictable, and it cannot be effective with general local surgery and membrane-permeable sterilization agents.

Since there are so many gonococci entrenched in the systemic joints, it is impossible to drive them away one by one. We must take overall planning and solve the problem fundamentally. Therefore, it is necessary to make all the cells in the body have antitoxin and bactericidal effects. The realization of this ideal therapy has now been achieved through scientific research. That is, in physical therapy, the German X-ray electricity and electrostatic therapy are used alternately, and in terms of serum injection, the German anti-gonorrhea serum also has great efficacy. And in terms of internal medicine, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" is indeed indispensable.

Because the medicine "Kelinong" is a mixed preparation using protein and yolk pigment. Therefore, taking it can produce anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. After taking "Kelinong", this anti-gonococcal bactericidal effect will occur in the body in a short period of time. One side assists with anti-gonococcal serum and electrostatic X-ray therapy to help the internal medicine, so that its bactericidal effect can be fully exerted, and the gonococci hidden in the deep parts of the joints are completely eliminated. On the one hand, it also has the effects of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antiseptic. Therefore, joint swelling and pain, such as those that have not suppurated internally, taking "Kelinong" can prevent and eliminate them. This is also something that other gonorrhea internal medicines cannot hope to achieve. And this kind of gonococcal arthritis that makes people disabled will be quickly cured and restored to its original health. There is no bad legacy at all. Diagnosis time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 numbers will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each number will only cost 5 jiao.

Notice: Each bottle of Bokang for men and women is 5 yuan, Nailsi Spermatorrhea Tablets is 2 yuan per bottle, Bufei Naer is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Kelinong is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Anti-Gonorrhea Water is 2.5 yuan per bottle, all are sold in pharmacies. For out-of-town purchases, please remit money directly to Haimi Deng Pharmacy, 9 Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai and it will be sent immediately.

### Dispute Over Unloading Sand and Gravel: Three Defendants Sentenced to Detention and Ordered to Pay Over 500 Yuan in Damages

Since the war, there has been a shortage of sand and gravel for construction, causing prices to skyrocket. Shanghai is in the midst of a construction boom, creating a high demand for sand and gravel. Zheng Chunfang and others formed a company called Wan Tai and rented barges at the Kenye Building on Beijing Road to purchase sand and gravel from Sijiao and transport it to Shanghai. The sand and gravel needed to be unloaded by laborers, so they invited bids. Xia Zhiji won the bid with a price of 1.4 jiao per ton, but Wan Tai Company had not joined the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association. This led to various disputes. Some people claimed that Wan Tai Company was organized by traitors and local bullies who were using special powers to control the industry. The Sand and Gravel Industry Association also issued a notice to all sectors to boycott the company. On the 12th, when Wan Tai's goods arrived at Suzhou Creek and Xia Zhiji ordered the laborers to unload them, a large group of laborers forcibly intervened and prevented the unloading, leading to a clash. The police were dispatched to the scene to suppress the situation and arrested the leaders, Fang Jinxiang, Liu Chunqing, and Zhou Fuqing, on charges of obstructing freedom, etc., and prosecuted them in the military criminal court of the Special First District Court. The court sentenced each of them to 30 days of detention. Wan Tai claimed that due to Fang's obstruction, the goods were delayed for more than a day, resulting in a loss of 511.50 yuan in handling fees and guarding fees. They submitted various pieces of evidence and hired lawyer Jin Ximin to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Special Court against Fang and the other two, seeking compensation for damages. The Special Court, presided over by Guo Wei, announced its judgment yesterday, ordering the defendants to jointly compensate Wan Tai Company 511.50 yuan and bear the litigation costs. Wan Tai Company has also entrusted lawyer Jin to file a lawsuit with the Special First District Court against Lu Gui, Fang Changgen, Xu Yongde, and others, the chairman of the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association, accusing them of being traitors and instigating the disturbances. They are seeking to have them punished according to the law for defamation and inciting obstruction and are requesting that the judgment be published in full in prominent advertisements in major newspapers for three days. The Special Court has accepted the case and will schedule a hearing soon.

### Manager of Huadong Coal Briquette Factory Accused of Damaging Creditor Rights; Concealing Assets and Fraudulently Applying for Bankruptcy; Hengrun Coal Company Sues to Recover Debts

Zhang Fuchang, a native of Ningbo, worked as a delivery clerk at the Shengren Coal Company on Guangfu Road in Zhabei. Wu Xiaoqing, the current owner of the Hengrun Coal Company, also served as an assistant manager at Shengren. Wu saw that Zhang was diligent and honest, and he wanted to help him. He encouraged him not to be a hired hand and promised to assist him if he aspired to start his own business. Zhang was inspired by Wu's encouragement and soon established the Huadong Coal Briquette Factory in Hongkou, and his business flourished. Over the years, he made considerable profits. Wu's Hengrun Coal Company then conducted business with Huadong, providing a large amount of coal on credit to fulfill his promise of assistance. After Zhang went from being a poor man to a capitalist, he felt no sense of gratitude to Wu. Taking advantage of the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai War, he used the excuse of fleeing the war to abandon his business and return to his hometown with his assets. At that time, he owed Hengrun more than 20,000 yuan in coal payments. Although he had given several checks before the war, they were all bad checks with no funds. Wu later learned of the whereabouts of Dong Jinguan, the accountant of Huadong, and obtained Dong's consent to properly preserve all the factory's books for future liquidation. When the war in Shanghai subsided, Zhang assumed that Huadong's books had been destroyed and that he would not have to worry about debts to the company. Last year, he came to Shanghai from Ningbo and filed a petition with the First Special District Court, applying for bankruptcy. His application was approved, and accountant Pan was appointed as the bankruptcy administrator. However, the balance sheet submitted by Zhang was largely false and incomplete. Wu then submitted the preserved accounting records to the court, which were handed over to the administrator. The liquidation is still underway because the accounts were mostly fabricated and the assets were concealed. Wu Xiaoqing, believing that Zhang intentionally harmed the interests of his creditors, has hired lawyers Yan Hongxiang and Zhu Ya Kui to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Zhang Fuchang, detailing the defendant's fraudulent application for bankruptcy and listing the facts of his concealment of assets: (1) An examination of the books shows a profit rather than a loss. (2) The factory's income was not deposited into the bank that the factory dealt with but was deposited into his personal bank. The repayments were made with checks from a bank where Huadong had no deposit. (3) There were only 50 tons of coal dust in stock, but the balance sheet falsely listed 300 tons. (4) Huadong's deposits were withdrawn and deposited in another name, as evidenced by his account book. (5) During a search of the defendant's home by local authorities, more than 1,500 yuan in cash, 2,000 yuan in passbooks, and 500 yuan in bank drafts were found, as well as a large number of real estate properties, none of which were listed in the bankruptcy statement. Such fraud and concealment constitute a crime under Articles 153 and 254 of the Bankruptcy Law. The judge opened a court session yesterday to investigate the case and then adjourned the court for a further hearing at a later date.

### 美文綢廠怠工　工人要求復戰前工資迭經交涉廠方拒不接受

Meiwen Silk Factory Goes on Strike: Workers Demand Restoration of Pre-War Wages; Repeated Negotiations Fail as Factory Refuses to Accept

Over three hundred workers at the Meiwen Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road went on strike because, when work resumed on the first of this month, the factory forced workers to sign guarantee forms, causing opposition from all workers. At the same time, the cost of living in Shanghai for workers is increasing daily. After "August 13th," the factory reduced wages by 30%, and they have not yet been restored. The factory's operating surplus last year reached over ten thousand, so an all-workers' meeting was immediately convened, unanimously passing six demands: restoring pre-war wages, improving hygiene and equipment, and canceling unreasonable guarantee forms. Representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory, but without satisfactory results, leading to a strike. Later, personnel from the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council were dispatched to persuade the workers to resume work first, and the six demands would be mediated again. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, the workers set a three-day deadline for the factory to respond and resumed work at the factory on the 8th of this month. The deadline expired the day before yesterday. When the day and night shifts changed over at 7 PM, all the workers gathered at the factory to await the factory's reply. Because the factory director was out, no one could act as a proxy to answer the factory director's opinion, saying that a reply would have to wait several days. All the workers felt that the factory was deliberately prolonging the time and could no longer endure this, so they immediately began a go-slow strike. Currently, the workers are all sitting quietly in the workshops, awaiting the factory's reply and urgently requesting assistance from all sectors of society.

### 靑年倉皇奔逃　巡捕開槍恐嚇　不料適中要害移時斃命

Young Man Flees in Panic: Constable Fires Warning Shot, Accidentally Hits Vital Organ, Dies Shortly After

At 8:35 PM last night, Chinese Constable No. 33 from the Shanzhong Road Police Station in the French Concession was on duty at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Shanzhong Road when he suddenly saw a young man, about twenty years old, wearing short clothes and resembling a worker, coming towards him. Seeing the constable, the young man looked flustered. The constable became suspicious and ordered him to stop, intending to search him. Unexpectedly, the young man panicked and fled. The constable chased closely from behind to the left, loudly warning that if he did not stop, he would shoot. However, the young man continued to run wildly. At this point, the constable drew his pistol, aimed at the young man's lower body, and fired a shot. Unexpectedly, when the bullet was fired, the muzzle was shaken upwards, hitting the young man in the back, striking a vital organ. He immediately fell to the ground and was apprehended. The constable immediately reported to the police station and sent the young man to Guangci Hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The body was then sent to the coroner's office to await a report to the Second Special Court for examination. The police station is currently investigating the young man's name and origin.

### 傀儡邵小愚　拘解虹口　任偽「統稅局」庶務股長肥職在手專事搜刮舞弊

Puppet Shao Xiaoyu Detained and Sent to Hongkou: Serving as Head of General Affairs Section in the Pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau," Holding a Lucrative Position, Specializing in Extortion and Malpractice

Shao Xiaoyu, the younger brother of Shao Shijun, the pseudo-"Director of the Unified Tax Bureau," was suddenly arrested by the Japanese the day before yesterday. The detailed circumstances are recorded below.

Arbitrary Extortion: Since assuming the position of pseudo-"Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau," Shao Shijun has arbitrarily installed private individuals and filled positions with unqualified people. Therefore, almost all of the senior officials in the pseudo-"Bureau" are his personal associates. Later, he appointed his younger brother, Shao Xiaoyu, to the pseudo-position of Head of the General Affairs Section of the "Bureau." After taking office, Shao Xiaoyu, believing that this was a lucrative position, arbitrarily extorted money, accumulating a significant amount of wealth to date.

Arrogant and Overbearing: However, Shao Xiaoyu is only twenty-four years old. Having achieved success overnight, he is arrogant and overbearing, causing considerable dissatisfaction among the puppets. Recently, rumors have spread everywhere, and someone has reported his misdeeds to the Japanese, causing Shao to feel uneasy. Consequently, he took sick leave last week and hid at No. 23, Lane 1355 (i.e., Zhaofeng Village), Yuyuan Road, to temporarily avoid the storm.

Detained and Sent to Hongkou: At 6:50 AM the day before yesterday (the 11th), the Japanese suddenly dispatched personnel from the military police in a car to the village. They went directly to the house. Unexpectedly, Shao received the news upstairs, realized the situation was bad, and tried to escape over the roof. However, it seemed that the people who came knew he would try to escape, so they secretly deployed personnel around his residence. As a result, Shao was still apprehended and taken to Hongkou.

Soon, the poison took effect and could not be controlled. People summoned Street Patrolman No. 255 and urgently hired a car to rush her to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### 華方游擊隊　注意西區烟賭　期一舉肅清為社會除害

Chinese Guerrillas Pay Attention to Opium Dens and Gambling Houses in the Western District, Hoping to Wipe Them Out in One Fell Swoop to Eliminate Harm for Society

Opium dens and gambling dens in the Shanghai West Outlying Areas have become increasingly rampant since receiving protection from a certain party. The harm to society is not insignificant. Petty criminals and lawbreakers regard this as a paradise, frequenting the area and repeatedly committing crimes, causing unrest and difficulty in maintaining public order. The Public Concession Police Authority, in order to maintain order and tranquility within the concession, has specifically sealed off the main roads in the border area and strictly inspects pedestrians entering and exiting. As a result, criminals have disappeared from the concession. However, those addicted to gambling and opium are still stubborn and pursue it madly, leading to all kinds of tragic incidents. The reports in the newspapers are too numerous to count. The owners of gambling dens and opium dens have been repeatedly warned, but they remain unrepentant. According to rumors yesterday, it is said that these dens that poison people's livelihood have been noticed by the Chinese army guerrillas in the Western District, who are extremely resentful and are planning effective measures to wipe them out in one fell swoop, eliminating harm and creating benefits for society.

Correspondence between Elementary School Students and Refugee Children

— Qin

This time, we are raising funds for refugee production and education expenses, and promoting the Charity Badge fundraising campaign. Elementary school students in this city have enthusiastically donated, providing 100,000 refugees with the opportunity to participate in production and education training. It is truly beneficial to the people, helps those in need, and is immeasurable virtue!

In various refugee camps, there are many "refugee children." They heard that they will also have the opportunity to study and work in the future, and they are all overjoyed and extremely happy, forgetting the pain of hunger in their stomachs.

Elementary school students should know about the living conditions of refugee children in the camps, and refugee children should also know about the living conditions of elementary school students in schools. In order to promote mutual understanding between the two parties, we propose to encourage correspondence between elementary school students and refugee children.

The following are simple methods for elementary school students to communicate with refugee children:

1. Elementary school students and refugee children who like to correspond can submit their names to their teachers. Print a directory of correspondents and distribute it to various refugee camps and elementary schools.

The directory format is as follows:

Name Age Gender Where are you from At what school/camp Address

2. Students from each elementary school and refugee children from each camp can contact each other as soon as they receive the directory.

3. The scope of communication, in addition to reporting your own situation and investigating the living conditions of the recipient, you can also schedule visits, and schedule joint performances to increase interest.

A Refugee Child's Reflections

— Yi

It has been two winters since I left my hometown, and sorrow and pain fill my heart. My future is dark, it is disappointment, and I am the most unfortunate child in the world.

Yesterday, I happened to take a walk on the road. I saw many children about the same age as me. They were supporting their mothers' hands and holding cakes, biscuits, and balloons. They also revealed a kind of proud look. It suddenly reminded me of myself two years ago. Wasn't I the same as them? I was happily spending the New Year. But now? They are the darlings of heaven, the happy people. What about me? I am an orphan without parents or a home. Can my parents be resurrected? Can my sisters reunite? My home has become a pile of rubble, and where can I find my happiness? All the happiness in the world is not something I can enjoy... No, my previous thoughts were completely wrong. I should not be negative. My new life is in the future. Use my own ability to create the various aspects of the future. Now, although my home has been destroyed, the camp is my current home. Although my parents were killed and my sisters are scattered, my fellow refugees are my only relatives. Although my school has been burned down, the education in the current camp can increase my knowledge. We don’t need to be depressed and pessimistic. Use our full power to fight the environment!

Refugee Children’s Rhymes

### （一）莊家漢

(1) Farmer

— Xiao Sheng

The farmer is in a terrible situation,

Wandering in a foreign land without support,

Rushing back to his hometown to plant rice,

The new gentry want rice and grain,

Leaving himself only a few handfuls of grass.

The farmer is really worried,

Afraid of airplanes and cannons,

Hearing that the coolies have to carry burdens,

Flying away high in a gust of wind.

The farmer is really unlucky,

Sneaking back to his native land,

Wife and children cry first,

Shamefully saying, "You hurt me..."

### (II) Eyes Full of Tears

— Liu Lang

The night is still, the hours long,

I dream of my parents,

But when I wake, they are nowhere to be seen,

My eyes full of tears.

In the old days, family gathered together,

But the sound of cannons echoed, and we fled our home.

We fled until we reached Wangjia Village,

Wangjia Village was in utter chaos,

Our whole family scattered.

I searched for my father, you searched for your mother,

We searched until we reached the roadside,

By the roadside, we recognized our parents.

Father died carrying a heavy load,

Mother died with nothing on her body!

### (III) Good Children

— Dong Qinyu

I am a good child, unafraid of rain,

Unafraid of wind, full of vigor I charge forward.

I am a good child, unafraid of hardship,

Unafraid of poverty, endurance and patience are my creed.

I am a good child, I love to read,

I love to work, using both hands and brain brings endless joy.

I am a good child, I love babies,

I love old people, my face is kind and full of smiles.

I am a good child, I strive more,

I work harder, bury myself in hard work and show my worth.

I am a good child, I temper myself more,

I exercise more, serving the country by joining the army.

I am a good child, I must be diligent and cautious,

I must be thrifty and respectful, treating others with a smile.

I am a good child, I must respect,

I must obey, strictly adhering to discipline and never relaxing.

I am a good child, for the country,

For the people, sacrificing myself for glory.

I am a good child, for liberation,

For the Great Harmony, uniting as one to be pioneers.

### Refugee Children Listening to Lectures on Mats

### Correspondence Campaign

— Shunjiang

Dear children! Now I sincerely initiate this "Correspondence Campaign," hoping that everyone will implement and promote it!

The purpose of advocating this campaign!

(1) Is to enable you to connect with refugee children, to understand their lives, and to guide their education.

(2) Is to practice your writing skills.

(3) Is to arouse your enthusiasm for the "Save the Refugees Through Thrift" movement.

Its content can be broadly divided into two categories:

(1) Reporting on life facts—including personal, family, and social life, as well as thoughts and feelings, etc.

(2) Exchanging knowledge—including knowledge from books and other practical knowledge.

This campaign is tentatively open to senior children for free participation. If junior and middle-level children are also happy to participate, they are naturally welcome, but they must have perseverance and work hard.

As for the method of communication:

(1) Take a primary school and a refugee school as a unit, and each side appoints an appropriate number of people.

(2) The refugee school compiles a list, allowing the children to choose a person as their partner.

(3) The communication period is tentatively set at once every two weeks—or the frequency can be increased or decreased at any time depending on the needs of all parties.

(4) Manuscripts should be written outside of class. It is best to have them reviewed and corrected by the instructor first; if you don't like to do this, then it's up to you.

(5) The postage for letters sent by refugee children will be borne by the children—because the refugee children have lost their source of income and have no strength to bear this economic burden.

In addition, I hope the instructors and children of each school will take note of the following points:

(1) I hope that the directors can encourage or help the children more, provide more materials, or hold temporary meetings for discussion, so that this movement can develop quickly.

(2) I hope that the children will borrow more books for the refugee children so that they can have books to read outside of class.

(3) I hope everyone can make personal or collective visits at any time, or hold various competitions, friendship gatherings, etc.

### Mulan

— Zhang Mengfei

The story of Mulan joining the army was originally a very great and glorious one among women in ancient China. The poem "Mulan," with lines like "Chi chi fu chi chi," is known to almost everyone, men and women alike. Now the author has adapted it into a ballad and put it in the Popular Weekly for readers to sing, or for ballad stations to broadcast, so that it can be more widely popularized. It is expected that the public will welcome it.

(Mulan's Introduction) The male rabbit kicks and thrashes, the female rabbit's eyes are blurred. When two rabbits run on the ground, it's hard to tell male from female.

(Mulan's Dialogue) I am Mulan. For ten years you joined the army, and endured so much hardship. Now that the border bandits have been quelled and you have returned home, it can be considered a great blessing. Now I will go outside the door to see my comrades.

(Song) Mulan's filial piety led her to join the army,

Serving the country and enduring hardship,

Dressed as a man, who recognized her?

Now the border bandits have been pacified.

Returning home with a joyful heart,

She becomes a beautiful woman in her boudoir again,

Taking off the battle robe,

She puts on her old clothes again,

Her hair is styled in a fashionable bun,

A flower is inserted into her cloud of hair,

Her willow-leaf eyebrows are divided into eight strokes,

Her autumn-wave eyes are clear,

Her jade nose,

Red lips,

Indeed, she is more charming and graceful,

The heavily made-up beauty,

Is not as imposing as when she was killing on the battlefield.

Going out, she specially looks for her companions,

Who are shocked when they see her.

(Companion A) Oh my! My brother, come quickly and see, is that General Hua coming out of there?

(Companion B) The face is exactly the same, but she is wearing women's clothes. I'm afraid it's not right! Could it be General Hua's sister?

(Mulan's Dialogue) Greetings, everyone. I am indeed Mulan.

(The companions show a look of panic) Oh my! Oh my! You are General Hua, how are you dressed like this? General Hua,

(The companions sing) We went to join the army together, ate and slept together for twelve years, like blood brothers. We didn't know that you were a woman. If we had known that you were a woman, we would have dissuaded you from going, and not let you go. Since ancient times, daughters have stayed at home, and should not show their faces in public. Moreover, it is not easy to join the army thousands of miles away. Why did you, a daughter, go on a long expedition, enduring all kinds of hardships? Tell us, what was your intention? Isn't it just inviting suffering upon yourself? Didn't you read the "Daughters' Classic" in your boudoir? You can be considered the number one person who doesn't guard the boudoir.

(Dialogue) The companions are using these absurd words to criticize Mulan, but Mulan is not angry. She only smiled coldly at them and said calmly to them,

(Mulan Sings) Your knowledge is too shallow,

You shouldn't come here today to ridicule me!

Do you know that this time I went to join the army thousands of miles away,

It was only because my old father is old and frail.

Taking my father's place is fulfilling my filial piety,

What's so strange about dressing as a man?

Moreover, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country,

Holding weapons to defend the country, like Wang Qi in the past,

Now the border bandits are eager to attack us,

I am sacrificing myself for the country, as it is my responsibility.

It's laughable that you are so narrow-minded,

Actually sticking to the distinction between men and women,

Pitifully clinging to the old ways and not knowing how to change,

And treating daughters like playthings,

Resulting in a generation of daughters being ruined,

Without any patriotic spirit at all,

Without any national consciousness,

That's why I break the old habits of the past,

And showed my face in public to join the military,

Knowing only that when the country is there, the people are there,

Annihilating the border bandits to secure the foundation of the country,

If all the daughters in the country were like me,

Why would the country be weak and the people poor and bullied?

Therefore, loving the country does not distinguish between men and women,

We must unite with one heart to fight against the enemy.

(Narration) After Mulan finished speaking these words, the companions all admired her and said,

(The companions all say) General Hua is right. We know that we are wrong. Please forgive us, General.

### "Life" and "Living"

— Refugee Reporter

To support refugees is to enable refugees to "live," but if they are supported for a lifetime, the refugees are still refugees.

To teach refugees productive skills is to enable refugees to "live." When every refugee has productive skills, the refugees are capable citizens.

Educating refugees not only enables them to make a living, but also enables them to live a "meaningful life." In this way, refugees become good citizens who are both capable and knowledgeable.

People who have previously contributed money and effort to help refugees, please make another effort for the Refugee Association's fundraising for production education funds, and complete the thorough "saving people" merit!

Scientific Knowledge

### The Greatness of Levers

Scientists say: "Without levers, there would be no machines." From this sentence, the importance of levers is self-evident. The lever is the origin of machines!

But what is called a lever? This term is a bit bookish, but in terms of the literal meaning, it is not very difficult to understand. A lever is a lever, a pole is a pole, it is a kind of stick. A hand tool can be called a lever, and a carrying pole can also be called a lever, but its shape is not necessarily straight, and it changes according to its use.

People first used levers in the same way as using machines. When a woodcutter goes to chop firewood, how does he use an axe? How does he use a carrying pole? And then how does he pick up that load of firewood? This fully demonstrates the function of levers, so people use levers to replace labor and increase production. Its meaning is not much different from that of people using machines now, because the lever can also rotate freely around a fixed point, and can exert the function of a machine in terms of work efficiency.

Now let's take a look at the structure of the balance. The arm of the balance is a lever, and a pan is hung on each end, which can be applied. The center of its arm is supported. When the weights on both pans are equal, it is considered balanced. If an object is placed on one end, then this pan immediately descends due to the earth's gravitational pull, but if an equal object is placed on the other end, then the two pans will return to balance. Therefore, the earth's gravitational pull on the two pans is equal. The arm of this balance is the lever, and the point that supports the pivot of the arm is called the "fulcrum."

In addition, the seesaw used by school children is also a lever. It is a long board supported on a wooden frame. This point of support is also called the fulcrum. Children sitting on both ends can push up and down. If the center of gravity is different or equal, the phenomenon of up and down balance will be immediately seen. Therefore, the principle of levers is "the product of a small force and a long arm is equal to the product of a large force and a short arm."

The force applied to one end of the lever is called the "effort," and the other end that resists its action is called the "load." Every lever, no matter what its shape, has three points, namely "effort point," "load point," and "fulcrum."

But these three points are not fixed, and sometimes they also change according to their function. For example, the effort of the balance seesaw, or the force is at one end, the load or resistance is at the other end, and the fulcrum is in the middle. But things of the same kind, such as scissors and bell pullers, are all like this—the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Therefore, we call this type of lever the first class lever.

But sometimes the fulcrum is at one end, and the load and resistance are in the middle, so the effort is at the other end. Under these circumstances, we call it the second class lever. For example, a wheelbarrow on land, the wheel is the fulcrum, the body is the load, and the carter is the effort, just like rowing in the water, the oar in the water is the fulcrum, the hull is the load, and the boatman is the effort.

In addition, there is also a third type of lever, where the fulcrum is at one end, the load is at the other end, and the effort is in the middle. For example, a person's arm is an example. Holding an object in the hand is the load, the connection of the elbow is the fulcrum, and the muscle strength on the radius is the effort.

But the lever is not fixed in one form. Sometimes it can change from the first class to another class of lever. For example, if a person wants to lift a ladder against a wall or a stone from the ground, the wall or stone is the fulcrum, the ladder itself is the load, and is also the arm; the person's hand is the effort.

When a person starts to lift the ladder, using his hand to support one end, the weight is between the fulcrum and the effort, so it belongs to the second class. But as the ladder is gradually lifted, the person's hand moves downwards, and most of the ladder's volume is transferred to the person's hand, that is, the effort is between the fulcrum and one end of the ladder, so it is a third class lever.

Knowing the principle of levers and the examples of their daily application is an interesting thing, because it can enable you to use a small force to overcome a large resistance, and to move heavy objects with light objects. Its principle is that the force on one side of the fulcrum, multiplied by its distance to the fulcrum, is equal to the force on the other side multiplied by its distance to the fulcrum. If a child weighs thirty kilograms, the stick is three meters long, and the fulcrum is half a meter from one end, then it can move a stone weighing about one hundred and fifty kilograms.

In recent years, with the development of science, the function of levers has been widely used in railway machines, motorcycles, movable bridges, printing presses, cranes, and other kinds of advanced equipment.

Readers may wish to appreciate the principle of levers, understand the structure of levers, and use the function of levers. This is the intention of this article.

### The Newsboy's Words

Yuan Xiangsheng, Tenth Newsboy School

Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, I was unemployed in Suzhou. I rushed to Shanghai to find something to do and lived in my brother's house. About a month later, the war broke out, and life after the war became more difficult. Everything was expensive, my brother was under economic pressure, and the family was in a difficult situation to maintain. I wanted to reduce my brother's burden, so I started the life of a newsboy. At first, I found it very hard, but later I gradually got used to it and didn't feel anything. Now I get up at five o'clock every morning, before dawn, when some people are still in the midst of good dreams, and walk on the road with many workers. When I arrive at Wangping Street, I wait for the newspapers to be published. Around six o'clock, various newspapers are published one after another. (To be continued)

### A Week of War

Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Advance Westward

The war in central Hubei has been quite active this week. It is said that the Japanese army recently wanted to open up the situation. They transferred troops from Wuhan to Ganzhou, and from Hebei to Guangdong, attempting to invade Beihai in the south and attack Nanchang in the north. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese army has been attacking the Hanshui River in three directions, advancing step by step along the Han Highway. One is advancing in front of the old mouth of Yonglong, and another is attacking in the Yingcheng area. Due to the full-scale attack by the Japanese army for more than ten days, Zhongxiang has been captured by the Japanese army. The Chinese army is fighting the Japanese army with all its strength, and at the same time, it has obtained the greatest price from the Japanese army when Zhongxiang fell. It is said that the Japanese army that invaded Zhongxiang suffered losses of over ten thousand. At that time, the war was fierce and there were several days of mixed battles. The Japanese army used a large amount of gas to force the Chinese army to retreat, and attacked the Chinese army with fierce artillery fire. The Chinese army fought bravely, one after another, and the positions were destroyed, so they changed to defend favorable areas. According to reports, the Japanese army that invaded Zhongxiang is still attacking fiercely north along the highway. As of now, although some of the important strongholds in the east of the Hanshui River have been occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese army on the west bank has strong troops and solid fortifications, and the Hongshan Mountains in northern Hubei are still under the control of the Chinese army. Therefore, it is difficult for the Japanese army to cross the river and attack the west. Also, the Japanese army that advanced north from Jingshan, after attacking Zhongxiang, attacked north along the highway, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese army in the Xihe area to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng, important towns in northern Hubei. After a counterattack by the Chinese army, they have retreated to Zhongxiang.

(Note: The purpose of the Japanese army's attack is obviously to cut off the transportation line between Xiangyang and Shashi. The ultimate goal is to occupy Yichang and Shashi, because Shashi is a transportation hub, and Yichang can be used as an air force base, thereby bombing Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other cities in western China).

The Guangdong War Situation

The Japanese side transferred troops from Taiwan and North China to South China for reinforcements. Therefore, the number of Japanese warships in Kure Island and Tokyo Bay has increased sharply. They are concentrated and do not leave, and their attempt to invade Guangxi is quite urgent. According to reports, the Japanese army plans to attack Nanning Longzhou from Qinzhou County in order to cut off the transportation between Guangxi and Vietnam. The reason for this is that for several months, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been under close surveillance by the Chinese army's three-way army and has made no progress. The suburbs of Guangzhou are also frequently attacked by Chinese guerrillas in an elusive manner, so they have changed their plans and are directly approaching Nanning. However, the Chinese soldiers are excited and have been prepared. Now the Japanese army in eastern Guangdong is fiercely attacking east in two directions. One is attacking Boluo from Zengcheng via Fushan, and the other is attacking Huiyang east along the Guangzhou-Shantou Highway, slanting out of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shilong. Shima, east of Zhangmutou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, has been lost. Also, six Japanese warships jointly attacked Huilai, and the atmosphere in Lufeng is also tense. The Chinese army in Shima is now guarding the Masi Longjiao new position and continuing the resistance. The Japanese army attacking Dagangling is also in a stalemate. The Chinese army has been continuously increasing its defenses recently. It is expected that although the war situation in eastern Guangdong is tight, the Chinese side is still confident of victory.

Hainan Island

The Japanese army that invaded Hainan Island suffered considerable losses due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army and civilians. The Japanese troops who landed were originally only the Hata unit, with only one brigade in number, which was already insufficient. Now they are transferring three regiments of reinforcements from Taiwan to Hainan, which are ready to depart. Japanese aircraft frequently bomb civilians. There has been contact since the beginning of the month. Recently, all highway bridges and culverts have been destroyed by the Chinese side. The Japanese mechanized units feel that there is no place to use their strength. Moreover, the area is densely forested and has natural terrain to defend. Some of the Chinese troops have adopted guerrilla tactics and are engaged in stubborn resistance against the Japanese army.

### Recover Our Northeast

— Maolie

Perhaps it is out of excessive humility, or perhaps it is out of unnecessary timidity. Recently, some people have actually said, "Restore the original state before July 7th," "Quickly withdraw troops from central and southern China." What are these words!

Although these words are not the proposition of our highest authorities, nor are they the belief of the majority of the people, their influence is quite large and quite bad. We cannot but repeatedly refute them and denounce them as absurd!

The enemy's greed, inch by inch, has been fully proven throughout history. In the beginning, didn't someone say one after another: We only need to hold Jinzhou; we only need to keep the Great Wall; we only need to protect Hebei; we only need to stabilize south of the Yellow River? And what was the enemy's action? If we now say that we will restore the original state before July 7th, they will certainly not even restore the original state before August 13th; if we quickly withdraw troops from central and southern China, of course they will only send more troops to the northwest. To curb their greed, although we don't have to sing loudly about attacking Korea or Taiwan, we must at least recover our Northeast.

This is not to say that we are asking a high price in preparation for the other party to bargain. This is to say that we can only achieve the ultimate goal of the War of Resistance: to preserve our territory and sovereignty, and to completely destroy the enemy's greed, by setting such a goal and going all out for it.

Not long ago, our central government had already dispatched the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces. This is really good news: it shows that our central government has not abandoned or forgotten our Northeast, and that there is now a special responsibility for things. The hope of recovering the Northeast is easier to realize.

According to yesterday's Associated Press report, in the Northeast there is the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Association" presiding over the guerrilla force of "200,000 people divided into ten armies," and there is also news that Ma Zhanshan "has arrived in western Jehol" and that his "target is Qiqihar," which makes us even more excited. Only in this way can there be a comprehensive war of resistance and a thorough solution. Excessive humility and unnecessary timidity are of no use!

Now, if we want to talk about conditions, we must at least say: restore the original state before September 18th; quickly withdraw troops from all parts of our country! In other words: we want to recover our Northeast!

### Zhang Abing

— Li Shaozhong

I have moved into the dormitory for more than a week. Every morning, when we are still asleep, this old man quietly runs into the dormitory to sweep the floor and wipe the tables. The first day I glanced at him, I felt very familiar. I wanted to ask him several times, but was interrupted by the melancholy and silent expression on his face. At noon today, this old man suddenly staggered upstairs to notify me that I had a phone call. As soon as I heard his Hangzhou accent, I asked him. Sure enough, this old man is "Zhang Abing." Zhang Abing also widened his old, presbyopic eyes in great surprise, looking at me, with hot air coming out of his mouth, and he could hardly speak for almost five minutes.

Really, it's been four years. The wrinkles on his forehead have deepened, and his gray hair has turned completely white. Now he suddenly met a young friend he hadn't seen for four years. What a rare opportunity.

That year, the first group of students began centralized military training. We were concentrated in a large military camp at Nanxingqiao in Hangzhou, and trained for three full months. There was a small grocery store next to the side gate of the camp. This store also sold "wonton noodles," a large bowl for five cents, which tasted good. The store owner was an elderly couple, and they had an innocent and beautiful little girl.

Although we only stayed for three months, at least half of the more than a thousand "student soldiers" were familiar with this grocery store couple, especially everyone knew that there was a little girl named Alan in the store.

Whenever our district team was on duty at the gate, after I finished my mission, I would always ask the district team leader for a short leave, run to the store to eat a bowl of wonton noodles, and smoke a few cigarettes. Each time, the old man would drag his thin, long-stemmed pipe and come over to chat with me.

He told me that his name was Zhang Abing. He had also been a soldier when he was young. After retiring from the army, he set up a grocery store next to this camp, specializing in the business of soldiers. It wasn't too bad. He and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law could make a living. Later, his son followed the army, and there was no news for three years. The young daughter-in-law also died soon after, leaving behind this granddaughter, Alan.

When I reminded him that I had received military training in the Nanxingqiao barracks four years ago, he couldn't help but come closer and grab my hands, shouting loudly:

"Mr. Li, it's really rare that we met here again."

"I really didn't expect that you would come here to work. Are your family all in Shanghai now?"

When Zhang Abing heard my question, he suddenly lowered his head, and his voice became even more hoarse: "Mr. Li, it's a long story: the ×× people captured Hangzhou in the winter before last. We didn't expect it to be so chaotic, and we didn't have any money, so we didn't escape. I didn't expect the ×× people to be so fierce. Alan was dragged away by them to do ××. My old wife wailed and rushed up to fight them, but what's the use? In the end, both of them were dragged away. As an old man, I had no way to go to heaven, no way to enter the earth, and no way to do anything. I followed a large group of refugees and fled to Shanghai. Alas! It's really…… Oh, that's right, Mr. Li, didn't you have a phone call downstairs?……"

"Okay, I'll answer the phone first, and then talk to you in detail."

I turned around and prepared to step out of the door, only to see Zhang Abing standing there motionless, with two lines of hot tears hanging on his lowered face. I didn't dare to look back and hurriedly ran downstairs.

Fox: Brother Rabbit, take me across; we will forever cooperate peacefully.

### On "His Mother's" (Part 1)

— Chi Qiang

When one cannot write a good article, one often thinks of engaging in some practical work to save the nation. But once on the battlefield, one immediately remembers that even with a gun in hand, one cannot abandon the pen. The moderate faction advises: one should do both. Let them say what they will, we'll provisionally accept that.

I originally wanted to write about topics like "The Great Wall and Diligent Practice with Bricks," but then "A Discussion on Whether or Not Adultery is a Matter of Personal Choice" rushed headlong into the line of my thoughts. So I put down my pen, lit a cigarette, and realized that voluminous ten-thousand-word essays are largely meaningless; they're not as effective as the phrase "his mother's," which is all the rage, rhythmic and forceful, both firm and substantial.

It is said that "one can entrust a seven-year-old orphan, one can entrust a hundred-li of territory" to a capable person. But if this is decoupled from the spirit of "his mother's," it will all be in vain. Generally, "orphan" and "territory" require someone with a bit of "initiative" before you can talk about "entrusting" them. Otherwise, how can you talk about a "gentleman who cannot be swayed in the face of great adversity"?

As soon as I pick up the pen, I seem to be entering the "Temple of Loyal Ministers" to talk about ghost stories. So I quickly withdraw, "worrying about the world before the world worries," and before I can "rejoice after the world rejoices," someone says, "Hurry!" At that moment, I found a sound: "his mother's."

The "his mother's" that I am discussing here is a curse, but I consider it to be good. It's not about using "his mother's" to knock down or whip the world. It's truly because after this "no small matter" of "his mother's" rolls out, if we use foresight and hindsight, what kind of fresh things will be produced between them that are worth writing about in detail and commemorating once!

Mentioning this "well-deserved" "national curse," it naturally has its lineage and history. However, in the past, there were mostly "miscarriages." After the two lips burst out with a "his mother's," judging by the momentum, although there was a posture of "if I don't go to hell, who will?", in the end, more than once, they "hastened away with makeup still on," probably expecting something, or appeasing people, which may be the supreme "way of hygiene." Indeed, "why worry about mediocrity"!

Based on this, the discerning call it a misstep, the speakers call it a success. Let's hold off on criticizing for now, and as the "his mother's" itself returns, feeling that contemporary gentlemen are neither worth standing with nor worth passing on knowledge to, and that in this vast land, there are few who understand, who can one share with to thoroughly plan a great undertaking? So this very complete "order to strive" is wrongly and unjustly hung on the corners of the mouths of peddlers and laborers, covering up their "hand-to-mouth" existence, and succeeds, but the literati class considers it unbearably vulgar. The fact that it vividly descends into the tone of heroes among the common people can still be seen in many articles outside of "fame and accomplishments."

However, it is not so. "His mother's" has actually dominated the contemporary era! Decisively laid the new foundation of China!

Is this a new thing in the period of national character transformation?

### Records of the Defense of Jiangyin and Others

— Zou Xiao

——Chatting about National Novels

According to "Novel Chats," "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin is a type of Record of Lost History of Jing Tuo, made into a popular novel." Sun Kaidi's "Chinese Popular Novel Bibliography" includes it but notes "Not seen." It should be noted that the character 遺 (yi, "lost") is a mistake for 逸 (yi, "lost, escaped"). "Novel Chats" also says: "The four kings and eight generals in the book all have surnames, but when compared with other records, they are almost nonexistent. Moreover, among the kings who died in battle at the beginning of the dynasty, there were only Nikan and Kong Youde, whose events were in Yunnan and Guangdong, not in Jiangyin. Presumably, the so-called kings are military nicknames. During the Su Prefecture rebellion, there were so-called Eight Great Kings, which are similar."

The author of "Novel Chats" had seen "Lost Writings of Qifeng," because the fifteenth chapter of that book is "Instigating Rebellion in Suzhou Prefecture for Shaving Hair, Deceitfully Burning Incense to Assassinate the Eight Great Kings," so he cited "Eight Great Kings" as an example. Little did he know that in the classical Chinese "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin" (written by Han Tan of the Qing Dynasty) on which the popular novel is based, there are the following records: "Lost three kings and eighteen generals." "(August) 11th, the Qing soldiers attacked the north gate, and seven kings died." "12th, the Qing soldiers still attacked the north gate, and two commanders died." "14th, Jiangyin feigned surrender, and King Xue died." "29th, the Qing soldiers attacked the south city, and ten kings died." According to "Records of Loyalists on the River," there was another so-called Eight Kings who died by gunshot on August 12th. The deaths of other kings are the same as recorded in "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin." The author of "Novel Chats" seems to have been slightly negligent here.

"Records of Two Loyalists" (with Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui, who resisted the Yuan soldiers, as the main characters), "Records of Snow Cellars and Ice Heavens" (a revision of Aji's Journey South), and "Records of the Battle of Caishi" (mainly about Yu Yunwen's military achievements), which "Novel Chats" also mentions, are, like "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin," novels that I yearn for and eagerly want to read, but unfortunately, they all seem to have been lost.

Speaking of Records of the Defense of Jiangyin reminds me of "Unofficial Biographies of Righteous People of Jiangyin." A friend of mine said after reading the unofficial biographies:

"As long as all the people are willing to resist, the country will never be lost to foreign races! If everyone is willing to resist, political corruption will not occur, any heresy will not be heard, there will naturally be no traitors, and it will especially arouse international sympathy and gain assistance. The power of the people is great, far beyond any other power. If you don't believe it, we can look at the resistance of the people of Jiangyin to the Manchus at the end of the Ming Dynasty. They used a small place and a disorganized crowd to resist hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers for as long as eighty-three days, and inflicted heavy damage on them. If you don't believe it, we can also look at the achievements of the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi and Hebei now, and see what kind of blows they have given the Japanese army.

"I hope that those who read this book will have such an imagination: the Qing soldiers and Tartars are what today? Liu Liangzuo is the traitor in the puppet government, the Seven Kings and Two Commanders are what someone Jing and someone Chuan are; and Jiangyin, which resisted them, is any county or city in the country: Xu Yong is a student in our modern school; Gao Rui and Xu Yuyang are our current rural farmers; Huang Mingjiang and Tang San Lao'er are the mechanics and laborers we see every day; Cheng Bi and the He brothers are businessmen doing ordinary business in our cities. All the wars written here are modern wars. The cruelty of the enemy and our struggle are also facts before our eyes. I hope that our compatriots will all have the determination to be Xu Yong and even Zhen Erlang and Huang Yuqi, and that our wise officials will all have the wisdom, courage, loyalty, and valor of Magistrate Yan Zhen Er. The ultimate failure of Jiangyin in the past is not surprising, because at that time there was no second Jiangyin. Now we are Jiangyin everywhere, and we will never fail. Therefore, we don't have to be discouraged by the failure of Jiangyin in the past, but instead, we should be inspired by its failure to arouse our common hatred. In this way, we will surely succeed and avenge our national hatred."

Because his words were very insightful, I copied them here for readers to refer to.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Everyone listened carefully, and sure enough, the alarm bell was still ringing wildly, and they couldn't help but shout and swarm out of the door. Many women and children were knocked to the ground, and cries and screams mixed together. Regiment Commander Ye was about to yell at everyone to maintain order when the enemy planes had already flown overhead. He was, after all, more experienced, and knowing that this was the target, he immediately jumped off the stage and crossed the large well in three steps. Just as he ran to the temple gate, the bomb had already fallen, and with a "boom," a corner of the Great Hero Hall, along with the stage, collapsed with a crash. Then, an incendiary bomb was dropped, and a ball of fire and smoke quickly rose from Bao'en Temple.

Regiment Commander Ye didn't have time to look back carefully and just kept running towards the township office. Before he reached the entrance of the township office, he heard a burst of machine-gun and rifle fire from the southeast. Then there was a "poof" sound of a small mortar.

"This is terrible! They actually took the opportunity to attack!" Regiment Commander Ye was anxious and rushed into the township office, where Battalion Commander Liang was also running out. The two collided head-on, and because of the momentum, they almost fell to the ground.

Regiment Commander Ye held onto the door, panting. Before he could speak, a sentry ran over in a panic and reported:

"Reporting, Regiment Commander, One-Eyed Li has joined forces with the x army and is attacking here from the southeast. Now Battalion Commander Zhao is blocking them at Qilidun."

"Quickly pass my orders, and send the first battalion, second company to reinforce them." Regiment Commander Ye waved his hand at the sentry, then turned to Battalion Commander Liang and said, "Quickly tell the people in town to prepare to flee. I'll take care of everything here."

At this time, enemy planes were still dropping bombs, and the sounds of explosions and collapsing houses never stopped. Flames soared everywhere, and the people were screaming and running around in chaos. Paradise was instantly turned into hell on earth. Regiment Commander Ye gritted his teeth and immediately began to arrange street fighting. He had carefully studied the terrain in this area in detail, without tiring himself, and knew what favorable conditions would lead to victory. He wouldn't let go of a single blade of grass or a single tree. He first used the woods that One-Eyed Li had escaped back to as a position to cover the entire town. In addition, there was a tributary of a small river in the town, and many buildings were built along the river. He ordered soldiers to ambush in the buildings and fire down on the enemy. He also used the houses and trees on the riverbank to separately ambush soldiers and build machine-gun positions.

Everything was arranged, and Regiment Commander Ye was about to go to the front line to inspect when he suddenly saw his younger brother, Fang Ying, running on the road with a rifle on his back. He quickly stopped him and said:

"Fang Ying, go home quickly and tell everyone to get on the boat."

"No, I want to go to the front to fight the enemy." Fang Ying said stubbornly.

"You can go back first and come back later. There are many opportunities to fight the enemy. We must take care of both loyalty and filial piety."

Fang Ying unwillingly walked towards home, and Regiment Commander Ye also began to inspect the front line, giving this speech to a unit waiting in ambush:

"Brothers, One-Eyed Li and the x army have taken the opportunity to attack this time. We must not be afraid of them. When we come into contact with them, we must be absolutely calm! Remember, be calm!" (31)

### Save the Apprentices

— Liang

We should pay attention to the apprentice stage - Hoping to implement the measures formulated by the Child Welfare Association

The word "apprentice" probably wouldn't seem unfamiliar to us. In countless old-fashioned shops or factories in China today, there are mostly these so-called "apprentices." Their lives are quite pitiful and tragic: their parents, because of poverty and hunger, have no choice but to send their lovely, lively, and clever little children into shops and factories to "learn a trade" and become "apprentices."

Each apprentice is like a "servant" or a "worker," only younger in age; generally, they are over ten years old, about twelve or thirteen. When we walk into those shops in Shanghai, we are sure to see one or several apprentices of twelve or thirteen years old, wearing a set of old, patched-up clothes, busy doing various chores.

Speaking of apprentices, their lives really make people sad and mournful. Every morning, just as the sky is dawning, when others are still in sweet sleep, they have to get up. After that, they start working, and they must wait until the other "shop assistants" and "teachers" have gone to sleep before they can sleep. Any difficult or heavy work will be pushed onto the apprentice. They don't have enough time to rest or relax; nor are there any holidays that can allow them to "enjoy" a day—with great difficulty, only during festivals, such as the lunar New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, do they have the opportunity to brush their shoes, tidy their clothes, take a breath, and "play" for a day; other than that, it is simply impossible to find a second day to provide them with "play," "relaxation," and "rest." In short, their daily life is just "busy" and "strenuous."

On the contrary, if things get busy, they still have to do night work, and if they accidentally do things wrong, they will be severely punished, such as being forced to stand, forced to kneel, slapped in the face, spanked, hit on the palms of their hands... all of which make their lives feel unbearable. Even when it's hot and sweat is dripping down their bodies, or when it's cold and their hands are frozen red and cracked, they still have to do chores such as cooking, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots—this inhuman life must last for three or five years before the apprenticeship is considered complete, and the "apprentice life" ends. "Completion" is such a good and happy word for every apprentice! Even their parents, hearing that their son is now a "journeyman," feel infinitely happy and joyful—their son has "made a name for himself," and after being promoted to "shop assistant" or "manager," people must at least call their son "teacher"! And on the shop and factory side, they must officially allow you to use wages only after you become a teacher. During the apprentice stage, there is usually no salary. Even if there is, it is only a very, very small amount of money for shoes, socks, haircuts, and baths.

Dear readers, after reading the above description of the life of an apprentice, you can't help but feel uneasy and pity them. In fact, there are countless apprentices leading such tragic lives in Shanghai and in China. We know that the people who are apprentices now may well become managers of large shops and factories in the future, and those who are managers now were indeed those apprentices in the past. Therefore, the apprentice period is important, and the stage of learning a trade is worthy of our attention. Only by cultivating rich experience and supreme morality in advance during the apprentice period can we hope to have excellent and outstanding industrial and commercial managers and employees. Then, why should we make apprentices live such pitiful lives?

Now, the Shanghai Child Welfare Association has formulated several measures to help apprentices for the research and reference of people who care about industry and commerce. The intention can be described as excellent. Now I will copy them below and offer them to the readers.

(1) Our government should urgently revise the "Apprentice Regulations" and set low minimum standards to limit apprentices' working hours, with eight hours per day as the standard, and not exceeding ten hours at most.

(2) The minimum age of apprentices should be over fifteen.

(3) Apprentices' work should be within the scope of learning, and apprentices should not be called upon to do things such as cooking meals, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots.

(4) The term of apprenticeship should not exceed three years at most.

(5) In addition to providing apprentices with food and lodging, employers should give them a reasonable living allowance of at least three yuan per month.

(6) Every morning and evening, employers should give apprentices the opportunity to continue their studies, such as attending night school or remedial school. All tuition fees should be borne by the employer.

"Employers - save the apprentices!" I can't help but utter this cry.

### Skillful Hands Heal Hearts

— Ru Hua

"Young Dr. Kildare"

Produced by MGM - Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater

The responsibility of a doctor can determine the life of a patient. We have a saying, called "the doctor has the heart to cut flesh," this really accepted the error that "cutting flesh" can treat diseases, but also shows that the doctor should bear great responsibility for a patient. In Shanghai, (naturally everywhere, every country has them.) because it is close to us, we often see and hear the tragedy of doctors "neglecting their duties," this should be organized from the doctors themselves to be sound, and society should also correct it. In the film, we will naturally not forget "The Story of Louis Pasteur," the great French doctor Louis Pasteur, who suffered ridicule in order to invent the microbe and eventually benefited later patients.

"Skillful Hands Heal Hearts" also tells the story of a young man, named James Kildare, how loyal he is to his responsibilities. After graduating from medical school, his parents, his lover, all hoped that he would serve in his hometown, but in order to seek further study, he joined the New York Civil Hospital as an intern. In the middle of this, because of the carelessness of his assistant, a patient died, and he was attacked by society, and even the hospital was going to dismiss him. At the same time, he also treated a wealthy woman who attempted suicide, a psychiatrist Dr. Nambodioth diagnosed her with mental illness, Kildare disagreed alone. In order to understand the condition of this wealthy woman, he naturally suffered many difficulties, but he finally proved from all sides that she was not mentally ill, and "skillful hands healed hearts," even that "fiery" lame old doctor was willing to pass on his skills.

This is a Hollywood film, we will naturally not demand that every doctor also be a part-time detective, but for a patient's condition, it can not be diagnosed and treated based on the surface seen, this often leads to death. Like that psychiatrist, because he is an expert, he treats the patient's life as a child's play; at the same time, it is because he is an expert that there are constant tragedies. I hope this film can achieve its intended effect.

Lew Ayres' James Kildare plays with calm and strength, especially his inner joy when he sees the wealthy woman's illness, performed very profoundly. Lionel Barrymore's lame doctor, as described in the instructions "fiery, irritable," with his superb acting skills, to play this role, is naturally easy.

As for the director, not being able to handle this film in a light and lively way is naturally his failure. The scene where Kildare returns after graduation is very good

### Impressions of "Suez" (Part 2)

— Li Zhihua

Sitting under the screen, the film flashed frame by frame before my eyes, "The great project of the canal was finally completed, Mr. Lesseps rode his horse to the top of the mountain, overlooking the ships sailing in the canal, recalling the past, like smoke and dreams, but Tony's words of encouragement seemed to still linger in his ears." Yes, I was moved by the people in the play, returned home, sat at my desk, in order to write this post-viewing feeling, I repeatedly searched my impression, I could not help but immerse myself in this complex emotion, and the big scenes in the "Suez" film, it was just a guest to quickly bring up in my mind when thinking about the plot, I thought about it carefully, I only remembered that there were many big scenes in "Suez", but most of these big scenes used distant shots, which could not handle it very well in the straight weave, the atmosphere was not enough, and it did not give us a very deep impression.

What the director is good at is still in "leaning against red and embracing green" and "life and death parting," such as Mr. Lesseps' envoy to Egypt and the parting of the princess, Mr. Lesseps and Tony's first meeting, Mr. Lesseps' return to France to see that the princess had married Napoleon, Mr. Lesseps' father's death, etc., in these scenes, not only the acting of several actors, but also the weaving is particularly lovely, for example, Mr. Lesseps and the princess say goodbye, one of the scenes is connected like this: (1) The princess looks down from the window (close-up) (2) Mr. Lesseps gets on the carriage (medium shot, bird's eye view) (3) Close-up of the princess' original position, gradually turning her body, (indicating that Mr. Lesseps is leaving, until he can't be seen) then turning around, walking to the sofa, sitting down, unable to suppress her parting feelings, lying on the sofa and sobbing. This scene, the weaving is lively and natural, and the atmosphere is rich, and Loretta Young's acting is also very lovely.

Loretta Young has several such lovely scenes, Tyrone Power also has two scenes, (1) When he marries, it is obvious that the princess is sitting next to Napoleon, (2) His father dies; as for Annabella, she is even more lovely, from the so-called "clear stream naked bath" to her death, her unrestrained, passionate personality is played very prominently

Perhaps this is my pet love, because such a passionate and unrestrained personality is really the best explanation of the spirit of youth. But, who can not be moved by that kind of personality

(Four lackeys enter) (A) As long as we can eat our fill, (B) it doesn't hurt to be a bandit. (C) Although we get a bad name, (D) it's better than starving to death. (A, speaking) Brothers—we are ordered to patrol, everyone beware of strangers hiding in the dark. (Young man hastily enters, sings a quick rhythm) To relieve famine, it turns out, the people suffer. Golden words, can't wake up, the hearts of bandits. (Speaking) Alas—I really hoped that good words and kind speech could persuade the king to surrender to the Song Dynasty.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Five: Spring Arrives, Green Vines Fragrant, Snow Sea Floating; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake

The Shijia Restaurant isn't large, but it's quite secluded. After being seated, Zhu Ai'ren asked, "What would the two Miss Hes like to order?" The two Miss Hes replied, "We're both novices here, but luckily we eat anything. Please, you two locals are more familiar, just order a few dishes and we'll be happy." Wu Junsu said, "I already asked, they have Squirrel Fish Soup. What else shall we get?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "Since we're in a water town, the fish and shrimp are very fresh here. I remember when I first came back from America, I was very careful about what I ate, and didn't dare eat anything. When I saw the locals eating those drunken crabs and drunken shrimp, it scared me to death, because I thought, how could anyone eat such unsanitary things? But now I'm used to it. Still, I advise people to cook those things before eating them. If you listen to us doctors, nothing is good to eat, and there would be too little left to eat." As Zhu Ai'ren spoke, Wu Junsu had already ordered a few dishes and handed the list to Zhu Ai'ren, saying, "Please let the sanitation expert take a look!" It was only five or six dishes, naturally with more fish and shrimp. She also said, "There used to be two lines of poetry praising the scenery of Suzhou: 'Shrimp dishes, Li Lake moon; Orioles and flowers, Tiger Hill spring.' We admire its perfect parallelism, and it also shows that the shrimp dishes here have long been famous." Zhu Ai'ren laughed, "A literary person is always a literary person. As soon as you open your mouth, it's all poetry and lyrics. Sister Junsu, you truly speak like a book, so different from us common folk." Wu Junsu said, "Don't scold me! After the menu has been approved by the sanitation expert, we'll eat. After eating, I'll need to borrow your car to take me to school." At this time, He Shuangyu asked, "Just now, Sister Junsu mentioned Tiger Hill in those two lines of poetry. I know that's Tiger Hill, but where is Li Lake? Is it near this Stone Lake?" Wu Junsu said, "Li Lake is just a name from a story. Because there was a Fan Li who, according to legend, carried Xi Shi and sailed away on Tai Lake. Later generations used this classical reference and called it Li Lake. Now, several towns in Suzhou use the character 'Li' in their names, such as Li City, Li Kou, and so on. In short, Chinese people have always liked to put the names of famous people on place names. You two sisters came from Shanghai this time. Shanghai has many other names, such as Shenjiang, Huangpu, Xiebin, etc. Aren't all these names derived from the historical events of Huang Xie during the Warring States period?" Hearing that, Liyu looked at Shuangyu, remembering that yesterday we had discussed this very thing in the car on the way to the martyrs' cemetery. We even said that putting people's names on place names was imitating Westerners, but now we know that the Chinese have had this custom for a long time. (59)

### Continued Discussion on Kun Opera: Differences and Similarities Between the "Crying at the Portrait" and "Picking Up the Painting" Scores

— Ji An

The "Crying at the Portrait" scene from *The Palace of Eternal Life* is poignant and touching, widely sung in the opera world. In reality, it is derived from Wang Shifu's *Romance of the Western Chamber*. Not only are the tune sequences identical, but even the tones and filler words follow closely. After "Kuai Huo San," it immediately follows "Chao Tian Zi," with no other tunes in between. In Yuan Dynasty tune sequences, "Kuai Huo San" is often followed by "Bao Lao Er" or "Chao Tian Zi." This is very common. Generally, when the tune sequence reaches "Kuai Huo San," the play is already halfway through. After the tension, it is necessary to relax the atmosphere. "Kuai Huo San" is a tune that goes from fast to slow, and "Chao Tian Zi" is a slow tune. When the plot reaches "Chao Tian Zi," it is another stage, and "Kuai Huo San" is the link between the previous and the following. Therefore, in my humble opinion, I have never seen another tune inserted between the two. Now, "Kuai Huo San" and "Chao Tian Zi" are both tunes in the Zhonglü mode entering the Zheng Palace mode. "Dian Qian Huan," however, belongs to the double-corner mode, a tune of the Shuangdiao mode. Although it is also sometimes borrowed into Zheng Palace tune sequences, such as "Duan Zheng Hao," the tune "Dian Qian Huan" is rarely seen. Furthermore, in opera music, the rhyme usually doesn't change from beginning to end. The only Southern opera that changes rhyme is "Crying of Longing," and the only Northern opera is "Peddler." The entire "Crying at the Portrait" uses the Jiangyang rhyme, but inserting the Jiama rhyme "Dian Qian Huan" is also rare. What Chan Weng Jun mentioned must have a basis. I sincerely hope he can clarify to dispel my doubts.

In the *Peony Pavilion* "Picking Up the Painting" scene, the young male character first sings the introductory tune "Jin Ma Er," the first three lines before "Jin Long Cong": "Who is like me in admiring spring? I don't ask about anything else on my journey. The wind blows open the grapes." Then follows the last three lines after "Feng Ma Er": "Rain soaks the crimson apricots. Today it is sunny and warm. Drying the quilt, there are still remnants of clouds." Then the Taoist nun enters and sings "Bu Suan Xian," with the lyrics: "What can a nun do? Recognizing the poor scholar. Knowing he has many dreams. Every day he yawns a thousand times." Then, he is led to the painting. The young male character sings the three main tunes "Yan Zi Le," "Jin Chan Dao," and "Qian Qiu Sui." After picking up the painting and returning to view it, the Taoist nun re-enters. The young male character sings the closing lines: "All my life, I've been a traveler, full of emotions. I pass by the desolate garden at midday... (Old nun, you say I'm not allowed to be sad.) Where can you find me another one who definitely won't be sad?" Only then is it a complete "Picking Up the Painting" scene. Unfortunately, people in the opera world insist on singing the unconnected "Wan Zhen" (now commonly called "Jiao Hua") and arbitrarily shorten "Picking Up the Painting." The introduction is only sung for two lines, and "Jin Chan Dao" and the ending are completely deleted. The Taoist nun also does not appear. Only the soloists who sing "Picking Up the Painting" still often sing "Jin Chan Dao" and the ending to preserve its authenticity. However, the introduction is usually only sung for two lines, and the Taoist nun also does not appear. This is just like the "Crying at the Portrait" scene from *The Palace of Eternal Life*, where there is a "Man Ting Fang" before "Kuai Huo San," and "Shua Hai Er" and "Wu Sha" after "Chao Tian Zi" and "Si Bian Jing." Now, they have been deleted and are not sung, becoming the norm.

### Film Industry News

Four Theaters to Show Domestic Films Simultaneously

Strange things happen every year, but this year is especially numerous. Who would have thought that in post-war Shanghai, the domestic film industry would have such a meteoric rise? The New China Film Studio, supposedly an American company, is producing blockbusters one after another and is now about to occupy four first-run theaters. Starting from the 15th of this month, the Da Shanghai Theater will open with "Wu Zetian," completing the new situation of four first-run theaters exclusively showing New China's new films. This is an unprecedented grand event. The New China films being shown in the four theaters are as follows:

Hu Guang: "Mulan Joins the Army"

Xin Guang: "The Young Mistress's Fan"

Jin Cheng: "The Ape-Man"

Da Shanghai: "Wu Zetian"

At the same time, the number of theaters showing first-run Western films has decreased to three: Da Guangming, Nanjing, and Guotai.

"Film City" Breaks into Da Guangming

The Art China's newly filmed blockbuster "Film City," starring Lu Ming, is now planning to open in a luxurious first-run theater. It is reported that they are currently in negotiations with Da Guangming. In this way, the trend of domestic films continuing to encroach on Western film theaters is becoming increasingly apparent.

"Wen Su Chen" Seeking Male Lead

The old-established film studio, Lianhua Company, will also start work soon. It is said that the capital is being raised by Wu Xingzai, and the film "Wen Su Chen" will be produced under the name of United Pictures Company. This "Wen Su Chen" is adapted from the old novel *A Rustic Old Man's Idle Talks*. The script is written by Fei Mu, and it was co-performed by the famous Peking opera actor Qilin Tong Wang Xichun at the Carlton Theatre to great success. Now it will be brought to the screen and will mostly use new actors. The most difficult thing now is the male lead, so United Pictures Company has published an advertisement seeking actors. Young people (aged 18 to 35) who aspire to be on the screen are welcome to apply.

Studios Compete to Film Dance Halls

Following "Meng Jiangnu," Wu Cun's new film "Tears of Song" filmed dance scenes at the Paramount Ballroom the other day, and new songs were played and sung. The scene was very grand. At the same time, Yue Feng's "Fairy in Cloud Garments" is also filming grand dance scenes at the New China Film Studio. This film is a modern-dress tragic blockbuster starring Chen Yunshang after "Mulan," with a new script by Huang Jiamo. It has grand song and dance scenes. The fact that both Guohua and New China are filming dance hall scenes this time shows the importance of dance hall sets in films.

Two New Directors to Enter the Market

The development of the domestic film industry has resulted in a situation where the supply of directors exceeds demand. Therefore, two new directors are already in the works. One is the technical expert Chen Yiqing. Chen has worked in the film industry for ten years and has devoted himself to photography, editing, and cartoons. He has rich experience. He will be filming Huang Jiamo's script "The Three Musketeers," starring Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and Liu Jiqun. The other is Wang Yin, who is an experienced male star. He will now try his hand at directing for the first time. The film is tentatively titled "The New Outlaw," starring Yuan Meiyun.

Hu Die in Hong Kong, Yu Huan Obese

According to filmmakers who recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, they recently saw Hu Die. Her body is even fatter than before. Although she refuses to announce her weight gain, she is definitely getting plump. It really fits the saying "A broad mind makes a fat body." It is said that Hu Die has agreed to star in New China's new film "Yang Guifei." Such a plump body is just like our Sister Yu Huan.

### An Account of Wang Jingyan

— Wang Hongni

Wang Jingyan, a Kun opera dan (female role) player, is from the former capital. Her father, Shengkui, was a martial arts actor, but without much fame. Jingyan specializes in playing flirtatious, licentious dan, huashan (elaborate female roles), and also daoma (female warrior roles). She is skilled in stage combat. She excels in walking on stilts and is stable, which is rare among female actors. She was with Xin Xin for many years, and worked with Yang Jusheng and Wang Yunsen for a long time, but was not noticed. Later, she joined the Hangzhou Grand Stage and won the top billing. In the summer of 1936, she came to Shanghai and joined the Xin Shijie Grand Peking Opera Troupe, where she became a pillar. Now, one can see the depth of her artistry, and Yu Sulian and Zhang Wenqin are no match for her. Wang Jingyan is now with You Er Geng. The picture shows Jingyan as Fan Lihua in *Moving Mountains and Overturning Seas*.

### A Feast for Jin Suqin: Ouyang Yuqian Discusses Reforming Traditional Opera

— Nie Ge

After Jin Suqin arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th, Ouyang Yuqian, Gu Wuwei, Lu Cuilan, and a dozen members of the China Art Troupe held a feast at Guiyuan the following day. During the feast, everyone freely expressed their opinions, forming a small symposium. Jin Suqin first said, "In Shanghai under the enemy's occupation, it is not easy to carry out any work of saving the nation under the enemies’ constant stare. Most compatriots are living a life of extravagance and depravity. Ever since I performed plays such as *Liang Hongyu* and *The Peach Blossom Fan*, the enemy has been watching me. After Mr. Ouyang was forced to leave, I felt even more embarrassed, and even the freedom to persuade others was lost. When Mr. Ouyang returned to Hong Kong from Guangxi, I had the motivation to come to Hong Kong, but it was delayed again and again, until today when I was finally able to come south. Perhaps I can breathe a freer air. In the future, I plan to work hard to carry out my own work and participate in more charity performances."

Ouyang Yuqian then discussed the topic of reforming traditional opera. He said, "Reforming traditional opera causes a lot of resentment because the taste is different, just like the old eight-legged essay opposing the vernacular. A struggle between the Romantic and Classical schools. But over time, it will get better. Generally speaking, any meaningful work is bound to be difficult at the beginning. As long as we are determined to work hard, we will definitely have good results. There will be a glorious page in the history of theater. Although others say that Miss Jin was the first to be fooled by me, she was also the first to succeed. Now there are many enlightened women in the opera troupes, but for the sake of their livelihoods, they don't have the courage to come out. I hope they can keep up with the times."

Then, Gu Wuwei said that traditional opera at this time has reached its end. Every progressive artist is no longer interested in it, but it also has its own strengths. We should take its strengths and abandon its weaknesses, and perform it in accordance with modern requirements. Therefore, we must reform it, but spoken drama workers have abandoned it, so for decades, they have not been able to support it, and it has even gradually declined. We must move forward along this goal in the future.

### "The Story of the Pipa" and "Zhao Wuniang"

— Yu Sheng

The two companies are producing them simultaneously without prior consultation, which will create a confrontation on the silver screen.

Because of the "craze" for period dramas, it is obvious that the material being taken is becoming stale. This can be evidenced by the fact that China New Film Studio is producing "The Story of the Pipa," and Guohua Film Company is also producing "Zhao Wuniang."

China New's "The Story of the Pipa" is Yang Xiaozhong's new work after "Ape-Man." Yang Xiaozhong has never directed a period drama before (except in the silent film era), so this is his first attempt. The script was specially commissioned to be written by Chen Dabei, and the costumes were designed by Lu Shihou. The role of Zhao Wuniang is played by Chen Yanyan, who has been away for a long time, and Cai Bojie is played by Liu Qiong. China New is preparing to win in terms of cast.

Guohua is also preparing to produce "Zhao Wuniang" at the same time. This can be said to be a "coincidence" with China New, and they have the same ideas. Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang" will probably still star Zhou Xuan, the leading actress of "Meng Jiangnu." The story of Zhao Wuniang doesn't seem to have much to recommend it in terms of ideas, but the "plot" is extremely sad and touching. The reason why the two film companies are competing to use it as a subject is nothing more than this. Guohua is currently recruiting actors for "Zhao Wuniang," so it will probably start filming soon. Perhaps it will be completed at the same time as China New's "The Story of the Pipa." China New's productions are usually shown at the Xin Guang Theater, while the premiere rights for Guohua's productions belong to the Jin Cheng Theater. When the time comes, both sides will show their skills, and a confrontation will inevitably form.

### Anecdotes of Yanmen Pass, a Song No Longer Heard for Twenty Years

— Wu Jiangfeng

The play *Yanmen Pass* is a secret script of the inner court Nanfu, and the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing created and staged it twenty years ago, and it is still praised as a good story. In the past ten years or so, the play world, north and south, has long gone silent. The truth is, the "singing," "recitation," and "acting" of this play are extremely demanding. Moreover, the entire play has as many as two hundred scenes. If it were to be performed in one go, there would definitely be difficulties in terms of time. Recently, Ms. Zhang Eyun will be performing this play at the Golden Dew. According to what Eyun said, this play has been slightly modified from the original eight-volume outline. All the lengthy transitions have been deleted, and interesting interpolations have been added to complete a valuable masterpiece. The complete list of the play's scenes is recorded below for the information of those who care about this play.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City Opera in the Former Capital (118)

— Xu Muyun

When Zhu Guangzu entered the mountain to steal the hooks in *The Linked Rings*, he really took a great risk, using all his skill, and luckily he got his wish. He drugged an invincible hero of the green forest with medicated wine, inserted his sworn brother Huang's saber at his neck, and stole Dou Erdun's tiger-head double hooks. If Dou Erdun woke up the next day and saw the saber inserted at his neck, and then discovered that his handy weapon was missing, he would know without guessing that Huang Tianba was night-raiding the linked rings. This could first show the Dou fellow a bit of skill, let him know that the Huang fellow was not only highly skilled, but also respected him as a green forest hero who never molested women, so he was unwilling to harm him in the dark. He only inserted a saber next to his neck to show that he was temporarily reserving his head. Although the two sides had agreed to a duel the next day, the Dou fellow had already lost his handy weapon, and he was also old, while Tianba was young. If the Dou fellow was defeated by the Huang fellow a second time, wouldn't he lose all his reputation? Therefore, after being questioned face-to-face by the eloquent Zhu Guangzu, who said, "How many heads do you, Dou, have? You don't appreciate the kindness of our sworn brother Huang, but instead really want to fight? Aren't you too unfeeling?" Dou Erdun felt he had nothing to say, so he used the lines, "Inserting a saber and stealing the hooks, the kindness is heavy; the blood feud is canceled." to end this case. Just imagine, such a catastrophic disaster, such a difficult major event, did not kill a single person or soldier, but retrieved the imperial horse and captured the perpetrator. Doesn't all the credit for this go to the Zhu fellow? But things are not so simple. Zhu Guangzu not only did not want to take credit, but suffered a great grievance. That day, after working hard all night, he finally stole the double hooks and returned to his residence. He ran into Tianba and others who came out to look for him. Without allowing him to explain, they grabbed his collar and said that he had stolen his own weapon and the waist badge of the linked rings. They didn't know what kind of mischief he was up to. After this bucket of cold water was poured over his head, no matter how tolerant a friend was, he would have to make his position clear and seek another path. Therefore, after Zhu Guangzu narrated the whole story of entering the mountain, he wanted to leave. The last two sentences were also very beautiful. He said, "The matter was done by the Zhu fellow, to let sworn brother Huang show his face this time. Sigh! Isn't this what friendship is all about?"
