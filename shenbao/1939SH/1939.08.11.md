(Chongqing) According to well-informed Chinese sources today, the strategy adopted in Shanxi Province of evacuating all residents and food from areas threatened by Japanese troops has been quite effective for two years. In the future, China may adopt the same strategy in all theaters. Once it is certain that the Japanese troops intend to attack a certain town, the residents there will retreat with the troops to the center, all food will be moved away, and water sources will be cut off. When the Japanese troops run out of supplies and are forced to retreat, the Chinese army will ambush them along the way. A Soviet military visitor recently returned from the battlefield in Jiangxi Province and stated today that during his two months in Gaoan, he only saw one old woman in a town on the southwest highway of Nanchang.

The inspection was completed in mid-month, and they have returned to Chongqing one after another. Although this trip was full of dangers and hardships, because they visited all parts of Sichuan and Xikang and collected a wealth of material, it is a major contribution to the future construction of Sichuan and Xikang.

### English "Chu Pao" Engages in Written Battle with German Reporter

(Chongqing) The English "Chu Pao" recently published an editorial mentioning "rogue states." Hinke, the visiting correspondent stationed in Chongqing of the German Intelligence Agency, sent a letter to the newspaper yesterday, refuting the editorial. The editor of "Chu Pao" also replied, retorting with sarcasm. It is not uncommon for Chinese and German figures to exchange opinions in an extremely frank manner. Hinke's letter to "Chu Pao" stated that the strongest group of nations in the world, Germany and Italy, would never pay attention to rogue newspapers barking, etc. "Chu Pao" replied, "The reporter in this article did not mention Germany and Italy. Why does the letter believe that rogue states must belong to Germany and Italy? Why is the letter so suspicious, or is it self-aware? We ask this question not to say that the conclusion of the letter is wrong; in fact, it may be very true. We believe that the sender must at least have ordinary knowledge. It is very interesting for the sender to call Germany and Italy the strongest group of nations in the world. This statement may or may not be true. Only time can tell whether it is true or not. If the sender does not forget history, he will know that the Triple Alliance in 1914 was indeed the most formidable group of nations at the time. However, as the war drew to a close, it proved that this group was not as formidable as most people initially believed. Germany and Italy have concluded a military alliance in addition to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Whether they have become the most formidable group of nations in the world today depends on whether Italy will not change its mind as it did during the last war. Of course, history may not repeat itself, but it may not repeat the old events. We sincerely hope that a second world war will never break out. However, before the future second great war is over, no one should be too optimistic about the formidability of the group formed by his country and other countries." The exchange of these letters is of particular interest because Mr. Hinke is the representative of the German official news agency stationed in Chongqing, and "Chu Pao" is generally believed to be closely related to the Chinese officialdom.

Editorial

### The Future of Chamberlain's Policy

This newspaper published a dispatch from the London correspondent yesterday, describing Chamberlain's foreign policy. Based on various viewpoints, it summarized several profound conclusions. The information listed therein was mostly disseminated by overseas dispatches in the past but not in detail. We believe that readers who read newspapers carefully will be able to gain something from this correspondence.

There are three noteworthy points in the correspondence: (1) Chamberlain's policy is not sufficient to represent the ideas of the British government and people. Only because Chamberlain is in power today, although those who oppose it have modified it, Britain's recent actions are still based on Chamberlain's policy. (2) Chamberlain's policy is to make as many concessions as possible to Germany and Japan, and Chamberlain is not reluctant to sacrifice gold pounds to bribe Germany, and he is even more generous in sacrificing the interests of others and preparing to abandon China, the Soviet Union, Africa, and South America. (3) Those who oppose Chamberlain's policy are not only the opposition parties in Britain, but also clear-headed conservatives are working hard to restrain it. Not only the countries that are prepared to be abandoned by Chamberlain's policy and those that have already been sacrificed, but also the United States does not want to see Chamberlain's policy misleading himself and others. As far as Germany is concerned, it knows that there are immediate benefits to being courted by Chamberlain, but it has other long-term considerations, so it is not willing to fall into his trap. Therefore, due to various oppositions, it is asserted that Chamberlain's policy will backfire and ultimately fail. The points pointed out in this correspondence are all based on evidence and are not mere speculation or malicious misinterpretation. I still remember that in late last month, when the preliminary agreement of the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks had not yet been established, this newspaper said that "Britain's international policy has always been untrustworthy to the world. Therefore, in recent years, in the midst of wind and rain, there are many who encourage Britain in the world, but very few who rely on Britain." Now, as evidenced by the description in the correspondence, we know that the previous argument was not wrong.

However, the shape of Chamberlain's policy is like a polyhedron. A planar observation is not enough to describe its true appearance, and even a few observations are difficult to see its full picture. The correspondence published yesterday made several observations, so the portrayal of the outline of Chamberlain's policy is valuable. However, in the promotion of the policy, the unexpected encounters and the endless evolution of reactions will change the center of gravity of the policy's movement and the shape and direction of its development at any time, making the harvest of the policy different from what it expected, or even the opposite. Chamberlain is said to have a strong personality and tenacity. He is persistent in dealing with affairs. He does not have the great talent to adapt to changes, but his old-fashioned calculations are enough to cover up his shortcomings. He has the courage to try difficult things, but he does not have the courage to ignore encounters and reactions, so he will not act perversely. Simon, who assists him, is gloomy and narrow-minded, and has become Chamberlain's dark shadow. The umbrella that he never leaves is like Chamberlain's compromise and appeasement that he is unwilling to give up, although it can be opened and closed, it is not enough to resist the wind and rain. This person and thing are actually the symbols of Chamberlain's personality and politics. This is what Chamberlain has reflected in our eyes and hearts in the past two years, and it is also the impression we have gained of Chamberlain in the past two years. Only because of this, Chamberlain's policy has its original appearance, as the correspondence published yesterday said, but it still changes according to encounters and reactions. It is indeed inevitable that he will be criticized by historians, but at this time, it cannot be said that Chamberlain's policy has no future!

If Chamberlain and the original appearance of his policy are as analyzed above and not wrong, then for the sake of the overall international situation and for the sake of cherishing the power of the world's great power like Britain, we should prevent him from going deep into the wrong path. Moreover, there is the possibility of correcting the deep wrong path. The key is to clearly show Chamberlain what he will encounter and his inevitable reaction. As far as the Far East issue is concerned, we do not think that the so-called "befriending Japan and dividing China" are completely correct. If we rely on Japan, then what he will encounter and react to are Japan's monopolistic attempts, anti-British movements, China's determination to resist, self-reliance, and the sympathy and assistance of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. All of these have made negative annotations to these two words. At the end of last month, the United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty. This new situation created is the object that Chamberlain's policy will contact when it is promoted. Yesterday, the United States and France made firm and frank representations to Japan on the issue of Tianjin silver reserves. This momentum is also sufficient to provide momentum for the transformation of Chamberlain's policy. The Chinese army has recently inflicted a serious blow on the invaders at the foot of the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi. This at least provides new information for those who doubt the future of China's resistance and those who believe in the omnipotence of Japanese military force to re-evaluate and awaken the dream of compromise and appeasement. In short, Chamberlain's policy is probably not as bad as it is said to be, but the current situation is indeed moving towards brightness and does not allow all evils to grow. If we follow Chamberlain's policy and push forward in a straight line, we cannot imagine its future, but the current situation has indeed created a smooth path for Chamberlain's policy to turn towards brightness.

### Anti-British Behavior in Various Places Is Purely Instigated by the Japanese Side with the Purpose of Eliminating British Interests in China

(Chongqing) Wang Shijie, the former Minister of Education and current chairman of the Sino-British Cultural Association, today entrusted Reuters to publish a statement: The anti-British movement in North China and other Japanese-occupied areas is purely instigated by the Japanese side, aiming to exclude British interests from China and force Britain to accept Japan's excessive demands. This should not be misunderstood. In the past decade, Sino-British relations have become increasingly harmonious, and the Chinese people have a friendly feeling towards the British. The current situation arising from the Tokyo talks has caused those who are deeply concerned about Sino-British friendship to feel a little anxious. This is a fact, but I am confident that if British responsible politicians implement the guarantee that they will continue to support China economically, as advocated by some influential newspapers in London, then these anxieties will disappear completely, and Sino-British friendship will become even stronger. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hankou) The Wuhan newspaper run by the Japanese side today stated that on the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Hankou will hold a large-scale anti-British demonstration, and the Japanese side will also participate. The Japanese expatriates will first gather at the shrine, then go to the British consulate to submit a resolution, and then go to the city to participate in the Chinese demonstration. It is generally believed that the Chinese will not necessarily march in the former British concession. Anti-British slogans have been posted everywhere today, but no one pays attention to them. There will be anti-British speeches everywhere tomorrow. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tianjin) Jameson, the British Consul-General in Tianjin, submitted a written protest to Japanese Consul-General Tashiro yesterday regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, demanding that the Japanese authorities suppress the continued anti-British activities in the occupied areas and protect British property. As of the dispatch, the Japanese side has not yet submitted a reply. (10th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

### US Transportation Experts Will Arrive in Hong Kong Soon

(Chongqing) According to sources here today, the Ministry of Communications has now sent Mr. Pan as a representative to fly to Hong Kong today to welcome seven American transportation experts who will arrive here on the 22nd. It is reported that these seven transportation experts were sent to China after Chen Guangfu, the Chinese economic representative in the United States, and US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau discussed it. Their task is to guide China to accelerate the methods of highway transportation. Dr. Baker, the financial advisor to the National Government who went to the United States last month, will also come with the seven people. It is reported that after the seven people arrive in Hong Kong, they will go to Haiphong to Kunming to inspect the highway situation by car, three cars and two trucks, so that after arriving in Chongqing, they will submit an opinion to the National Government. After that, they will go to the northwest to investigate the highway traffic situation. (10th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Xiamen Northern Seaport Is Blockaded by Japan

(Hong Kong) According to sources here today, the port of Xiushui (transliteration), 100 miles north of Xiamen, was blockaded by the Japanese Navy with mines and other objects on Sunday. (10th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Resolutions of the Party and Government Committee in the War Zone: Establish Branch Committees in Four War Zones and Guerrilla Commanders Are Responsible for Both Party and Government Affairs

(Chongqing) According to Shao Lizi, the secretary of the Party and Government Committee in the war zone, told the Huitong News Agency reporter that the Party and Government Committee in the war zone held a meeting the other day, chaired by President Chiang, and made important resolutions on promoting cooperation between the party, government, and military in the war zone: (1) Establish "branch committees of the Party and Government Committee" in the four war zones, and the chairman will be appointed by the President. (2) In the guerrilla areas, the guerrilla commanders will be responsible for both party and government affairs, so as to achieve cooperation. (10th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Li Jiasen (transliteration), vice chairman of the Party and Government Committee in the war zone, the committee has recently drafted new rules for unifying military power in the war zone as a result of the general meeting. These rules also apply uniformly to party, government, and military affairs in the guerrilla areas. The committee has established four district committees in the war zone and guerrilla areas, and others are still being organized. The committee is seeking to adjust the relationship between the government and the guerrilla areas and to seek cooperation between the various guerrilla areas. The committee recently dispatched guerrilla economic teams to the rear of the Japanese army to destroy the Japanese military's economic institutions and various economic enterprises of the Japanese side. At the same time, it also tried to persuade the Japanese New Army to surrender, improve the military equipment of the Chinese people, and train guerrillas. In the war zone and the guerrilla areas, there is no cooperation with the Japanese side to prevent the Japanese side from gaining a foothold in the occupied areas and using Chinese resources. Li said that these new rules were completely in accordance with the wishes of Chairman Chiang. According to Li, the Japanese side's plan was originally to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in the occupied areas and replace them with their own troops and to use Chinese collaborators. In short, the Chinese guerrillas are constantly expanding and improving, and the Chinese people will never cooperate with them economically. The Japanese side's plan will never be implemented.

### Tianjin Currency System and Silver Reserves Issue: US and France Express Concern; Tokyo Negotiations Stalled, Japan Quite Anxious; British Statement: Unwilling to Negotiate Under Threat

(Tokyo) The French Chargé d'affaires in Japan delivered a note to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, stating that France has a shared interest with Britain in the Tianjin currency and silver reserves issue, and requested Japan to acknowledge this fact. It is also reported that the American Chargé d'affaires in Japan, Dooman, also visited the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and firmly stated that the United States also has an interest in the same issue. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Foreign Ministry, in its reply to the French and American representations, expressed its determination to continue negotiations solely with Britain and rejected French and American involvement, considering it unreasonable. (10th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government has not yet issued instructions to its ambassador to Japan, Craigie. Government circles have not received information that Japanese military representatives in North China intend to leave Tokyo next week if the Tokyo negotiations do not resume. According to sources here, the British government's attitude remains that it is unwilling to conduct negotiations under pressure. As for the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin, it is completely outside the scope of a political settlement. The evidence presented by the Japanese side regarding these four individuals is currently being studied by legal experts here. (10th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) The chief Japanese representative at the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference, Kato, today asked British Ambassador Craigie to declare whether Britain is making a "genuine preparation" to resume the Tokyo talks. He stated that if new British instructions do not arrive, the Japanese military representatives will decide to return to Tianjin early next week. It is reported that Craigie replied that Britain is not deliberately delaying the meeting, but he cannot say for sure when he will receive instructions from the British government. Kato stated that if the instructions arrive after the Japanese military representatives have departed, the Japanese government will have to decide whether to reconvene the meeting. Craigie visited Kato at the Foreign Minister's residence at 11:30 AM at Kato's request. Prior to this, the Foreign Ministry and the military held a joint meeting yesterday, at which it was decided that if Britain continues to delay, representatives of the Japanese diplomatic and military authorities in Tianjin may return to Tianjin. Today, anti-British demonstrators marched to the British Embassy to submit a resolution. The Anglo-Japanese conference has been stalled for ten days due to the failure of instructions from London to arrive. Observers here believe that the procedural issues have almost been resolved and that there is sufficient hope for a compromise on the Tianjin economic issues. Therefore, Britain's delay has another purpose: to use the delicate international situation to exert pressure on Japan. Observers here also predict that if Britain persists in its "delaying policy," the Japanese side may terminate the Tokyo conference and allow the Japanese diplomatic and military representatives in Tianjin to return to Tianjin. If Britain hopes to reopen the conference in Tianjin, then the conference will be reopened in Tianjin. Therefore, the fate of the Tokyo conference will be determined by developments in the next few days. The Asahi Shimbun states that if Britain adheres to its "delaying policy," the Tokyo conference will inevitably break down. However, if Britain and Japan can reach a genuine compromise, then a few days' delay is unimportant. British Prime Minister Chamberlain is a statesman with foresight, hence the result of the Arita-Craigie compromise on July 22. The statesmanship and sincerity displayed by Britain in handling the various issues of the Tianjin incident should inspire trust. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun states that if Britain delays, resolving the Tianjin dispute will become more difficult. It hopes that Britain will fulfill the assurances it gave in the Arita-Craigie compromise regarding the general issues that created the background to the Tianjin situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun states that the Tokyo conference was convened at Britain's request, and now Britain is repeatedly delaying, which is a lack of sincerity. The Miyako Shimbun states that Britain is evidently very concerned about the anti-British movements in China and Japan, but it would be mistaken if it believed that the anti-British uproar would not be greater if the Tokyo conference breaks down than it is now.

### Japan's Next Fiscal Year Wartime Budget: Approximately 7 Billion Yuan

(Tokyo) The compilation of next year's budget must be accelerated as a result of the early adjournment of the Diet. The army, navy, and various ministries' requested budgets were all released on the afternoon of the 10th. It is understood that the fourth year's wartime budget is 7 billion yuan.

### Extradition Issue of Four Chinese in Tianjin: British and French Jurists Express Opinions

(London) Two prominent British legal authorities recently telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Halifax, expressing their dismay at the rumors of the extradition of the suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin to the Japanese side. The telegrams were sent by Bentwich, Professor of International Relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Miss Fry, Director of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The telegrams stated: "We have heard with dismay that the Chinese suspects in Tianjin may be extradited to the Japanese side. We believe that this action is illegal and that it should be proven using habeas corpus. We now propose to invoke this law and request assurance that no extrajudicial action will be taken to deprive us or the accused of the right to apply for this law within fifteen days."

### British Foreign Secretary Receives Chinese Ambassador

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax received Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi at the Foreign Office this morning for a discussion lasting three quarters of an hour. (10th Havas dispatch)

(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, is preparing to visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax today to inquire about the British views on certain issues in Sino-British relations. Naturally, the fate of the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case who are rumored to be about to be handed over to the Japanese side will also be discussed. The Chinese side here is quite pessimistic upon hearing the news that the British government has decided to hand over the four suspects to the Japanese side. It is said that the British judge in the British concession in Tianjin has completed his review of the evidence presented by the Japanese side regarding the four Cheng assassination suspects, so the fate of the four will soon be decided.

### Japanese Ambassador to Italy Visits Ciano: Studies Alliance Issues

(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, visited Foreign Minister Ciano today. Although the Japanese side has remained silent about the content of the talks, foreign observers believe that the two men studied various issues that could arise from Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. This is related to Foreign Minister Ciano's upcoming trip to Salzburg, Germany, to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition to the issue of Japan's accession, the two foreign ministers may also discuss the issue of how to "clarify" the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Hungary. This can be seen in the fact that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky will meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg. (10th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) Regarding the issue of Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance, although Fascist Party figures here say that the Japanese government, at the request of the military, has actually decided to proceed, experienced observers believe that the Italian government, under the current circumstances, is not eager to conclude an alliance with Japan. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, if this were to happen, Italy would inevitably take a clear anti-British stance in China to support Japan, but Japan may not allow Italy to cooperate in developing China as compensation, which would not be worthwhile for Italy. Secondly, after Japan joins, the attitude of the Japanese military towards Britain will inevitably become more assertive. This is something that Italy, which does not want to block the path to understanding, would not want to do. In short, Italy will not take any initiative and will let Japan do it. If the issue of Japan's accession becomes a reality, it will not happen until after the delegation led by former Army Minister General Terauchi and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi arrives in Europe, and then the signing ceremony can be held.

### China Purchases Thousands of Transport Vehicles from the US; When the US-Japan Commercial Treaty Expires, the US Navy Will Conduct Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Pacific

(New York) Ren, the Deputy Manager of the Universal Trading Corporation, confirmed yesterday that the company is purchasing "thousands" of transport vehicles to be transported to the Chinese interior, and said that it will "purchase more vehicles," but a concrete plan has not yet been drafted. Sheehan, the Deputy Manager of the Chi-Hsin Company, will submit his report to the Chinese government after inspecting China. (10th AP dispatch)

The Chicago Commercial Journal reported yesterday that the Chi-Hsin (transliteration) Transportation Company here has signed a contract with the Chinese government to transport American high-speed motorcycle transport vehicles to the Chinese interior for use. However, the manager and other staff of the Chi-Hsin Company made no comments. Several months ago, the Universal Trading Corporation, which was established to manage the 25 million US dollar Sino-American loan, ordered 6,000 freight vehicles from American factories for use in inland transportation in China. Sheehan, the Deputy Manager of the Chi-Hsin Company, will travel from San Francisco to China on the Pan American Airways clipper on August 16 to investigate road transportation conditions in China. (10th AP dispatch)

(Washington) Naval circles here observed last night that the US Navy will conduct exercises in the Pacific in January next year, which coincides with the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty (January 26). Naval officials stated that they are studying two naval exercise plans for 1940 for selection. The final decision will depend on how the international situation changes, so the location of the naval exercises will not be announced until the autumn. However, it is reported that the exercises will begin at the end of January and end in February. A naval spokesman dismissed the news that the navy would conduct exercises in the Hawaiian area as "speculation," and pointed out that the news was based on last year's exercises, which were held in the Caribbean Sea. However, he admitted that naval exercises, according to custom, would not be held in the same location for two consecutive sessions. The location of the next exercise will be decided by President Roosevelt. Naval sources recalled that the President changed the plan to send the US fleet to New York this summer and ordered the fleet to return to the Pacific coast to adapt to the international situation, so the possibility of conducting exercises in the Pacific in January next year is considered high. (10th AP dispatch)

(Moscow) It is rumored that the Soviet Union has lent China 750 million gold rubles. Chinese and Soviet sources here have not confirmed this. However, observers claim that after the Sino-Soviet trade agreement was signed on June 16 by Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, and Mikoyan, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will certainly provide the Chinese government with a huge line of credit.

### Shantou Incident: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

(Hong Kong) On Sunday, an anti-British demonstration was staged in front of the British Consulate in Shantou by rioters directed by an unknown party. The British warship "Tenedos" immediately dispatched troops to land and maintain order. It is reported that a Chinese person was injured as a result. The Japanese consul exaggerated the incident and presented five demands to the British consul, including a thorough investigation of the perpetrators, compensation for losses, and prevention of similar incidents from happening again. According to Japanese sources, British Consul in Shantou, Brandt, and the captain of the "Tenedos," Duncan, visited the Japanese consul yesterday and stated that the British side had nothing to do with the incident. However, they expressed regret for the unfortunate incident in which a Chinese person was injured as a result of the landing of British troops. The Japanese side is still demanding that the British side punish the perpetrators and compensate for the losses, and their attitude is very strong. (10th AP dispatch)

### German and Italian Foreign Ministers to Meet Soon

(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive in Salzburg tomorrow to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, may also attend. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to stay in Salzburg for one day and then return to Rome. (10th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) According to official sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will meet in Salzburg shortly to discuss various diplomatic and political issues. It is reported that the Danzig issue will be at the top of the list, but the issues of Spain, Yugoslavia, and Japan joining the Axis alliance are obviously issues related to the entire Axis, but they are ultimately of immediate concern to the German side, with Italy taking a secondary role. It is expected that the German and Italian foreign ministers may also discuss a number of events directly related to Italy, such as the status of Hungary and the South Tyrol resettlement issue. The German Foreign Minister met with the Hungarian Foreign Minister two days ago. This meeting of the two foreign ministers may be seen as another expression of the unity of the Axis powers under a policy of encirclement. The recent rumors that Hitler and Mussolini will meet at the end of August to discuss the Danzig issue were largely caused by this meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers. It remains to be seen whether Hitler intends to convey an impression that he must consult with Mussolini on the surface before delivering a speech in Tannenberg on August 27 and speaking at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Peace Congress. Those familiar with the matter are skeptical about this. (10th Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency has released a message stating that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is currently spending his vacation in Salzburg, Austria, and will meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in the coming days to review the common policies of the two countries.

### Germany and Poland Clash at the Border; Three German Soldiers Cross into Polish Territory; Polish Soldiers Open Fire, Wounding One German Soldier

Warsaw: A communique issued here today states that armed German patrol members who crossed the Polish border in the corridor engaged in a conflict at the border, during which one was injured. This patrol, numbering three, penetrated 300 yards into Polish territory, ignoring warnings. Polish border guards fired warning shots, also ignored. According to official sources, the incident occurred two days ago. (Reuters, 9th)

Warsaw: Officials have announced that at 6 PM on the 6th of this month, three German soldiers crossed the border into Polish territory, several meters into the town of Kamienica, located at the junction of the Polish Corridor and Germany. A Polish border guard immediately shouted a warning and fired a shot into the air as a warning. When the German soldiers continued to advance, the guard opened fire, wounding one. The wounded soldier was then carried by the other two back into German territory and driven away by car. German newspapers have not disclosed a single word about the incident. (Havas, 9th)

Danzig: According to reports received here from Gdynia, Poland has begun transporting its gold reserves abroad. It is also reported that Polish forces have further tightened border defenses along the Polish-Danzig border. In the Polish town of Konitz, bordering Germany, some transportation routes have been cut off. Local authorities have also notified the public that police passwords must be obeyed immediately, or they will be shot dead without warning. (Haitong, 10th)

(Berlin) Regarding the sudden visit of Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Csáky to Salzburg to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the official press here has not provided an explanation. It is claimed that both foreign ministers are on vacation, so the meeting was purely private. However, it is possible that the two foreign ministers exchanged views on the Polish issue, as Germany's current foreign policy is centered on the Polish issue. (Haitong, 10th)

Danzig: According to information gathered here, a large amount of foreign-shipped arms has arrived at the Polish port of Gdynia in recent days. According to eyewitnesses, the crates are marked with the words "London" and "Paris," indicating that they were shipped from England and France to Poland. (Haitong, 10th)

(Berlin) Regarding rumors that Germany will take new action before the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress, Weiss of the "People's Observer" today refuted these claims in an article in the "Nazi Party News," declaring that the Nazi Party Congress is a "peace congress." Germany is preparing to celebrate this congress, which demonstrates German unity, while others are calling it "German war preparations" or "Hitler's vicious plan." These are simply nervous reactions or fabrications. (Reuters, 10th)

The British Foreign Secretary Meets with the German and Polish Ambassadors

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with German Ambassador to the UK Dirksen this afternoon, during which he reportedly told him that the UK and France share the same views and a united position on the issue of the Free City of Danzig. Any attempts to sow discord will fail. He also stated that the UK has provided guarantees to Poland and will implement them if necessary, without hesitation. In addition, the authorities of the Danzig Free City Council and the Polish High Commissioner are reportedly discussing customs issues, which observers here welcome, but they say that this conversation is of a local nature. Some have advocated holding an international conference, with the participation of the UK, to resolve the dispute between Germany and Poland, but this has not happened. (Havas, 9th)

(London) Polish Ambassador Raczyński recently returned to his country to report on his duties and held important talks with the government authorities. He returned to London yesterday evening and met with Foreign Secretary Halifax at noon today to discuss the Free City of Danzig issue. (Havas, 10th)

Forster Delivers a Speech in Danzig

(Berlin) Danzig Free City Nazi Party leader Forster, after visiting with Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday, has returned to Danzig and plans to deliver a speech yesterday. Political figures here are paying close attention to this and say that German newspapers are using the term "Polish provocation." Forster's speech is likely a response to Poland. Although Forster holds no official position in the Free City, Nazi Party newspapers refer to him as the "responsible leader for implementing the Danzig Free City policy." He was raised by Hitler's sister, so he enjoys the Führer's trust. Forster will likely visit Berchtesgaden again early next week to see the Führer. (Havas, 9th)

### Germany and Italy Concentrate Troops, Threatening Southern and Hungarian Nations; Germany and Italy Likely to Demand that the Southern Nations' Governments Allow Axis Forces to Use Roads and Railways

(London) The news chronicle correspondent in the Yugoslavia capital recently reported that the news from the Yugoslavia border has caused concern that the European crisis will center on Yugoslavia. According to reliable information, Italian forces inside Albania and German forces inside the border of Slovenia are currently deploying heavy troop concentrations and stockpiling military equipment, ready to make a move. Key military and political figures in the capital of the southern nation now fear that the Axis powers will soon put pressure on the southern nation to comply with a pro-German-Italian neutrality in wartime, such as allowing the southern nation's roads and railways to be used by the Axis forces. The southern nation naturally cannot agree to this. Therefore, it is expected that German and Italian newspapers will begin to publicize accusations of disloyalty against the southern nation in the coming weeks, followed by more dangerous actions. (Reuters, 10th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondents for the Daily Herald and the Daily Telegraph both stated today that Hitler is not satisfied with Hungary merely declaring friendship with the Axis powers. He is now putting pressure on Hungary, so large numbers of German troops are being deployed on the Moravian and Slovakian borders. The Daily Telegraph also reported that German troops are now advancing south. The Daily Herald reported that Hitler originally intended to visit the Hungarian capital in June, but soon gave up because Hungary firmly refused to allow thousands of German secret police to enter Hungary to protect Hitler's safety. (Reuters, 10th)

### German Army Commander-in-Chief Encourages Workers: Resolves Never to Rashly Sacrifice a Single German Life

Dusseldorf, Germany: General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, recently delivered a radio address to the workers of the "Rheinmetall Borsig" metallurgical plant here and ordered all military factories across the country to convene all workers to listen to it together, in order to boost the workers' morale. His essential words were: "I now offer you, with the qualifications of a confidant of Führer Hitler, a sacred guarantee: the Führer will never rashly sacrifice the life of a single German. If we must make the ultimate, supreme sacrifice in the future, it will be necessary to preserve our nation." Excerpts from the speech are as follows:

General Brauchitsch first expressed his gratitude to all German workers, stating that German workers are the best workers in the world, manufacturing the best weapons in the world for the best soldiers in the world. The German nation allows them to be German soldiers, and I express my gratitude to you. The workers and soldiers of Prussia are all rich in comradeship. I invite workers to visit army exercises so that they can clearly see the efficiency of the equipment they make. At the same time, army soldiers should be sent to visit various military equipment factories to see the manufacturing process of military equipment, so that the spirit of comradeship can be further developed. As for the position of workers in military factories during wartime, it is as important as the soldiers fighting on the front lines. To this day, our country still needs to expand its military equipment. Rather than being despised and exploited, it is better to maintain a strong force that people fear. We do not need to threaten the countries of the world, but we cannot allow other countries to threaten us. A certain country's generals have already extravagantly spoken of victory, predicting that Germany will be forced into an alliance under the city and sign the Treaty of Versailles for the second time. Little do they know that the unity of the German people and their leaders is unmatched by any country in the world except Italy. Once the situation becomes serious, we will rely on this spirit of unity to achieve victory. (Havas, 10th)

### The British King Inspects the Reserve Fleet; Air Force Exercises Continue

Weymouth, England: King George VI recently inspected 133 naval reserve ships in the rain. French Naval Chief of Staff Admiral Darlan also participated in the ceremony. Afterwards, the King gave a warm consolation to the commander of the reserve fleet and all officers and soldiers, stating that it is commendable that all the warships can be placed in a state of war within a few days, which doubles the strength of the national navy. He then returned to port by yacht. As the yacht passed the warships, the sailors cheered and paid their respects. (Havas, 9th)

(London) The largest air force exercise in British history is still underway today. At the same time, the King inspected 133 reserve fleets gathered in Weymouth Port. The ships were arranged in the port, and the King inspected them in order. The royal yacht traveled 14 miles to complete the inspection. The sailors of each ship cheered loudly as the King passed. The King stood on the boat, not avoiding the wind and rain, to receive the cheers of the ships. The weather was bad that day, with occasional showers. Before leaving the yacht tonight, the King issued an edict to the Commander of the Reserve Fleet, Lieutenant General Horton, stating that he was very happy to inspect the fleet and asked him to inform all the officers and soldiers of this sentiment. More than a hundred warships can be lined up for inspection within a few days, ready for maritime service. This alone shows the proper peacetime organization. The crew members have only been enlisted for a short time, but they already have this effect. If it were not for the enthusiasm and close cooperation of all, how could this be achieved? I am certain that this fleet will soon reach the highest standard of combat effectiveness. Many retired officers and reserve marines have left their homes to join this fleet to strengthen the navy and serve the country. I am well aware of their great sacrifice, and I extend my congratulations and respect to all the officers and soldiers. Horton then wrote a letter on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Naval Reserve to express his gratitude. (Reuters, 9th)

(Paris) The British Air Force exercise and the British King's inspection of the reserve fleet have made a great impression in France and are regarded as clear evidence of British war preparations. The Paris Evening Post stated that the British Air Force and Reserve Fleet exercises are being conducted at the same time as the Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster is shuttling between Danzig and Berchtesgaden. This is not a coincidence, but a symbol. The French "Strong Will" newspaper stated that the British General Staff has worked hard to prepare as much as possible for a real war. France knows it can rely on Britain, just as Britain can rely on France. (Reuters, 9th)

(London) Regarding the British Air Force exercise, according to a public announcement from the Air Force Department today, there were no fewer than 160 "air raids" last night, including 100 in the southern defense zone and 60 in the northern zone. (Reuters, 9th)

### Mussolini's Illness Confirmed; Famous Swiss Doctor Consulted

(London) News from diplomatic circles here confirms the illness of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. A famous Swiss internist, Dr. Zellweger, has been summoned to Rome to treat Mussolini's illness. It is said that Mussolini's stomach problems are caused by not following the diet prescribed by the doctor. (Associated Press, 9th)

### A True Record of a Southwest Journey (Continued) 7. Impressions of Guilin

Some say, "The Hunan-Guangxi Railway is the main artery of the War of Resistance." If this is indeed the case, then Guilin can be said to be the heart of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. It is responsible for the exchange and circulation of all human and material resources between Hunan and Guangxi provinces. At the same time, given the stagnant situation in the southeastern part of Guangdong Province, it also serves as a supply station for northern Guangdong, thus deserving the name of a junction for the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Assuming Guilin as the center, there is a highway to the south, passing through Pingle and He County, and a waterway passing through Pingle and Zhaoping to Cangwu. To the southwest, it is possible to pass through Lipu and Liujiang to Liuzhou. In the future, when the Guilin-Southern Guangxi section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway is open to traffic, it will also be possible to take the shortcut through Yongfu. To the northeast, it is possible to follow the completed Guilin-Hengyang section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to Hengyang, connecting to the Guangdong-Han Railway north to Yuezhou and south to Qujiang. The waterway can also utilize the upper reaches of the Xiang River to absorb agricultural products from along the river, Lingling, Qiyang, and other areas, in order to communicate the freight of southern Hunan.

The branch road from Liuzhou to Guilin, after passing through Liujiang, turns southeast and must reach Lipu before heading north again, so it is also 270 kilometers. The car travels for seven hours, but there are many crossings along the way, so the time must be calculated more generously. There are two crossings from Liuzhou to Luzhai. There is another crossing past Liujiang. At noon, you arrive at Lipu, the center of the eastern Guangxi highway. Many travelers have lunch here, so the market on both sides of the highway is very prosperous. A long bridge has been built on the river north of Lipu, which saves a crossing. But after arriving in Yangshuo, it was discovered that the original bridge had been destroyed by mountain floods, so another crossing was added. The Yangshuo River is famous for its clear water. The origin of the saying "The mountains and rivers of Yangshuo are the best in Guilin" lies in the contrast of the river water. We took advantage of the time spent crossing the river to fully appreciate the scenery, which we felt was enough to compensate for the waste of time.

After passing Liangfeng, the highway gradually deteriorated, especially the section near the south gate of Guilin, which was simply full of scars. The car bumped violently as it passed. If you drive faster, there is a real danger of the car overturning. It is said that this is because too many heavy vehicles of five tons or more have passed through.

The car stopped outside the south gate. After being checked by the military police, it was allowed to enter the city. The scene inside the city was completely different from that outside the city. The streets were crowded with pedestrians, while the sides of the streets were ruins and ruins, forming a very strange contrast. Guilin's main streets originally had only two. One is the main road from south to north, divided into four sections. The southernmost and northernmost are called Guinan Road and Guibei Road. The two middle sections are called Zhongnan Road and Zhongbei Road. A cross street passes through the center. The west section is called Guixi Road, which meanders out of the city from Lizemen. The east section is called Guidong Road, which exits the city from Dongjiangmen. These roads all have traces of bombing. Except for Guidong Road and Zhongnan Road, which are relatively intact, most of the others were bombed to pieces, especially Guinan Road, which was almost completely burned down.

The caves of Guilin are all natural shelters. The air defense department has detailed maps, clearly marking where the people in that area should go when an air raid occurs. As soon as there is an air raid warning, the whole city is empty, so although many houses have been burned down in previous bombings, there are very few residents killed or injured, which must be attributed to the caves. Some time ago, the Japanese side threatened to bomb the caves, but according to estimates, it would take twenty 1,000-kilogram bombs, dropped in the same place, to open a skylight on the top of the cave. This is really easier said than done.

The Guixi Road area is Guilin's emerging cultural district. Lequn Society on Lequn Road is where cultural people gather. Recently, to commemorate the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, a war trophy exhibition was held here, sponsored by the Military Affairs Commission. War trophies from various war zones in Jiangnan were sent to Guilin for display, including aircraft wreckage, parachutes, medium tanks, various machine guns and other weapons documents. In addition, there were also self-made maps of the anti-Japanese war situation and various statistics. Tens of thousands of people visited every day.

### Japanese Troops in Dinghai Search Jintang Island; Self-Defense Forces Bravely Fight Back

Dinghai Communication: Jintang Island, which belongs to Dinghai County, is located in the southwest of the Zhoushan Islands, isolated in a remote sea area, adjacent to Zhenhai and Chuanshan. The island is divided into three townships, Jinyi, Jin'er, and Jin'san, with a population of six or seven thousand people. It is a large island in Zhoushan, famous for its plums, called "Jintang Plums." Since the fall of Shenjiamen in Dinghai, the residents have crossed the sea to Jintang to take refuge, or transferred from Jintang to Zhenhai Ningbo to take temporary refuge, resulting in a sharp increase in the population and the island is very prosperous. Suddenly at dawn on the 5th, a Japanese First Fleet No. 4 ship sailed to the sea off Ligang on the island and anchored. Then, three motorboats were lowered, carrying 64 Japanese soldiers, who landed in Ligang. They swept the sky and mountains with machine guns and slowly searched the entire island. When the local self-defense forces heard the news, they divided into four groups and ambushed in the mountains and valleys to strike head-on. However, due to the disparity in strength, they retreated to various mountain peaks to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. After searching, the Japanese troops, fearing that the Chinese self-defense forces would take the opportunity to attack, did not dare to stay for long and fled back to the ships and escaped towards Dinghai.

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Land in Xiangshan; Police Team in Shipu Town Resolutely Resist; Japanese Troops Retreat Without Disturbing

Ningbo Communication: Shipu Town, which belongs to Xiangshan County, is located on the coast and is the only fishing market in Zhejiang Province. At about 7:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, a Japanese plane flew over and hovered to observe. Soon, seven Japanese warships arrived, seemingly with the intention of landing. Upon receiving the report, the Xiang County government strictly ordered the local police team to resist to the death and dispatched a company of self-defense forces to provide reinforcements. At about 9:00 a.m., two more Japanese planes arrived and began bombing. At the same time, three small Japanese warships and five motorboats sailed into Shipu Port and opened machine gun fire on the shore. At about 10:00 a.m., two more motorboats sailed in, and the Japanese warships began shelling. The gunshots continued until 1:00 p.m. A Japanese warship approached the pier. The Chinese police team had previously set up defenses on the mountain, taking a high position. The Japanese troops failed to succeed. At about 2:00 p.m., the Japanese planes left. At about 3:00 p.m., the Japanese warships looted 12 civilian sailing boats and left reluctantly. In this battle, six Chinese soldiers and civilians died and seven were injured.

### Trends of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia; Three Thousand Yuan Remitted Back in Two Years; Technical Workers Return Home to Build Railways

Regarding the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia after the War of Resistance, Li Qiaoguang and Pan Zhihui recently came to Shanghai from Singapore and Medan to purchase domestic goods. According to the conversation below:

Singapore is the capital of the British-ruled Malayan Federation. The Federal Government includes the islands of Malacca, Johor, Kelantan, Perak, Penang, Selangor, and Negeri Sembilan. This is the largest military base of the United Kingdom in the Far East, built as a military port, and maintains close military ties with India and Hong Kong. Medan is the capital of the eastern part of the Dutch-ruled Sumatra Islands. From Shanghai to these two places, Singapore (i.e. Singapore) limits the import of 500 people per month. The procedures are relatively simple. To go to Medan, you must obtain a passport and, if you are going to engage in industry and commerce there or take other jobs, you must also obtain the approval of the Dutch East Indies government, find a local guarantor, and pay an import tax of 150 guilders (each guilder is about 15 yuan). The procedures are more complicated. The cost of going to Singapore is about 12 pounds for a second-class cabin on a mail ship, and 30 pounds to Medan. Singapore is 500 nautical miles from Medan.

Singapore has a population of 890,000, of which 600,000 are overseas Chinese, 12 are white people, and the Malay natives are mostly scattered in the hinterland. Sumatra (i.e. Sumatra) has 230,000 overseas Chinese, of which 23,000 are in Medan. The climate in both places is subtropical. The temperature is often around 80 degrees. In Singapore, the British have established a Federal Government to rule the Malay Islands. The various territories are governed by the Sultans. The Federal Government has a Chinese Civil Affairs Secretary, who specializes in handling overseas Chinese affairs. The current Chinese Consul General in Singapore is Gao Lingbai. Sumatra is ruled by the Dutch government, which established the Dutch East Indies Governor to govern everything. The Governor's Office is located in Batavia. The Chinese Consul in Medan is Ji Yifan.

The overseas Chinese in both places are mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. Singapore is a tax-free port, and its nature is the same as that of Hong Kong. Overseas Chinese are very developed in industry and commerce, with the most shops selling wood, cloth, foreign sundries, and porcelain. The local products are mainly rubber, coffee, tea sugar, betel nut, pineapple, coconut citrus, and palm oil, as well as tin and iron ore. The investors in planting are mostly from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. The cotton textiles shipped to Singapore are subject to considerable restrictions. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been happy to buy domestic goods.

Regarding cultural undertakings, Singapore has two universities, one is Raffles College and the other is the Medical University, both run by the British government. The Medical University is very famous. The schools run by overseas Chinese include the Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Nanyang Girls' High School, the private Chung Cheng High School, and many public and private primary schools, all under the management of the Department of Education. Medan has the Sudong Middle School and 20-30 primary schools, which are managed by the Sumatra Education Association. There are five types of newspapers in Singapore, including the Sing Chew Daily, the Xing Zhong Daily, the General Summary, the Nanyang Siang Pau, and the New National Daily. Medan has the Sumatra People's Newspaper and the New China Newspaper. Both are run by merchants. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese has reached its highest point. Regardless of industry, commerce, or academic circles, they have worked hard and traveled around every day to promote the War of Resistance and refugee relief work for the motherland. Fund-raising organizations have been established everywhere. The funds raised are either remitted directly to the Central Ministry of Finance or transferred to the Guiyang Red Cross Society through the fund-raising association. In the past two years, more than 20 million yuan has been remitted to the motherland from Singapore, and nearly 10 million yuan from Sumatra. Overseas Chinese also pay national salvation donations on a monthly basis and have made great efforts to promote domestic goods and resist Japanese goods. There are more than 1,000 technical workers in Singapore who have returned to China to participate in the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and hundreds have returned to China to participate in the army's War of Resistance. The British and Dutch governments, sympathizing with China's War of Resistance, have not excessively suppressed the patriotic movement of overseas Chinese. There are organizations of overseas Chinese in various places, united to engage in the national salvation movement.

### 2/3 of the Suzhou Province Canal Embankment Repair Project is Complete

Taixian Communication: The Suzhou Provincial Government, in order to prevent the Yellow River from entering the canal, ordered the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to rush to raise and thicken the eastern embankment along the canal and ordered the county magistrates of the relevant counties to assist in the process as much as possible. It was recently reported that, since receiving the order, the River Engineering Bureau has supervised the various engineering offices to step up the repair, and all the current projects have been completed by two-thirds. Its height can defend against two zhang of water, and a sub-weir of two chi is added to the top of the dike, for a total of two zhang and two chi of water. Recently, the water level of the canal has reached one zhang and three cun according to the Yumatou water level gauge as of the 2nd of this month, which is two chi and seven cun lower than the same day last year. The lake water level must be particularly high during the flood season, but this year's water has not been too strong. It is reported that the water level on the 3rd was one zhang and eight and a half cun, which is also much lower compared to that day last year. Moreover, the bottom water of the lower river this year is extremely small. The autumn harvest has been launched one after another. Even if the Yellow River comes south, if the amount is not too large, there are various precautions taken to prevent it. It does not seem to be a great danger.

### Rogers' Visit to Shanghai Amidst a Sharp Contraction in Foreign Exchange Attracts Attention; Meets with British Ambassador, HSBC, and Others; Rumor Has It that This Trip Has Yielded Preliminary Conclusions; Rogers Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday

Rogers, the British representative of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, visited Shanghai to understand the situation of the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai and the use of Chinese legal tender in British trade with China. He held a three-day meeting with British officials and businessmen in Shanghai. The meeting has now concluded, and he left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday. It is reported that Rogers paid close attention to the trends in the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai during his visit. It is said that he reached preliminary conclusions during his meeting with the person in charge of HSBC Mercantile Bank. British business leaders also made statements to Rogers. As for the Chinese business and financial community, he did not meet with them due to the limited time. It is generally expected that he will use the findings of this trip to go to Hong Kong and exchange views with Song Ziwen, Bei Zuyi, and others. However, many believe that this trip will result in favorable planning for the Chinese legal tender. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:

Rogers Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Rogers, the British representative (committee member) of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, has made significant contributions to the reform of the Chinese monetary system. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong three days ago. His whereabouts have been kept quite secret, and very few outsiders know about it. However, Rogers visited HSBC and Mercantile Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons this week to meet with managers Hosumin and McLaughry, and to discuss everything with British Ambassador to China Kerr and British business leaders in China. Although the content has not been announced, it is said to be related to the Chinese legal tender and the black market foreign exchange.

Discussions Concluded; Left for Hong Kong Yesterday

After Rogers came to Shanghai and held separate cordial talks with British officials and business leaders in Shanghai, he generally understood the foreign exchange, legal tender, and the general financial situation in Shanghai. Because he still needed to have discussions with the Sino-British financial community in Hong Kong, he hurriedly left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the Victoria liner yesterday. When he left, Rogers' friends in Shanghai went to see him off.

Stabilization Committee Maintains Foreign Exchange

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from Chinese and foreign banking circles yesterday morning that Rogers' visit to Shanghai was related to the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai and the value of the Chinese legal tender. It is said that although the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has tried its best to maintain foreign exchange, making the statutory foreign exchange always stable at one shilling and two and a half pence for the British pound and 30 US dollars for the US dollar, it has provided as much statutory foreign exchange as possible for the import of necessities. Therefore, there has never been a so-called black market foreign exchange in various cities in the non-occupied areas. The so-called black market foreign exchange only exists in occupied areas such as Shanghai.

Sharp Contraction of Black Market is Beneficial to China

The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has been repeatedly hyped up by speculators, creating a distorted situation. Yesterday morning, the exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank shrank again, with the British pound at three and a half pence and the US dollar at 6.8125 yuan. It is said that the trend rebounded slightly in the afternoon. The HSBC quoted the British pound at three pence five nine three seven five and the US dollar at seven yuan yesterday afternoon. This contraction of the black market is undoubtedly beneficial to China as a whole, allowing Chinese native products to be exported steadily, and the import of luxury goods and non-necessities has been greatly affected due to the contraction of the black market foreign exchange. China's import surplus is expected to decrease, and the international balance of payments can be balanced. The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has decided to let the black market foreign exchange fluctuate naturally.

Gold Rises Again, Bond Prices Fall

Yesterday, as the black market foreign exchange continued to contract, the black market price of gold rose again, and finally advanced rapidly towards a peak. The opening price was 4,220 yuan, then the buying momentum increased, rising to 4,350 yuan, then it fluctuated again. At noon, it rose again to 4,340 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 4,350 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan compared to yesterday. As for the stock market, the closing prices yesterday were: Unified Class A 48.4 yuan, Class B 41.6 yuan, Class C 39.55 yuan, Class D 38.5 yuan, and Class E 39 yuan.

Rogers' Mission Cannot Be Ascertained

The Continental News reported that the Shanghai financial community has attached great importance to the visit of Rogers, the British representative of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, namely the Bank of England, to Shanghai for three days to meet with various financial leaders. It is said that Rogers visited HSBC and Mercantile Bank on Tuesday afternoon and revisited them yesterday (9th). It is also heard from reliable sources that Rogers did indeed have lengthy meetings with personnel from the two banks. According to well-informed financial circles in this port, Rogers has met with several British business leaders in this port and Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, but this statement has not been directly confirmed, and the nature of the talks has not been disclosed. As far as continuing to support the legal tender is concerned, it was not possible to ascertain last night whether Rogers' visit to Shanghai had any special significance. However, the fact is that his talks with HSBC and Mercantile Bank in this port had no impact on the market price of the legal tender. It was not until last night that the public learned that his arrival in this port was indeed a fact, but the financial community was already familiar with his activities.

### Increased Security in Both Concessions: Strict Searches Yesterday; French Concession Found Nothing in Hotel Searches; Curfew Enforced as Usual, Without Slackening

Since the police authorities of both concessions began special security measures the day before yesterday morning, yesterday was the second day. The security situation was even tighter, with troops from various countries mobilized to assist in patrols and strict enforcement of curfew regulations. Japanese troops in the Nantao area conducted armed patrols yesterday morning. Detailed information is recorded below:

Strict Enforcement of Curfew Regulations

The curfew regulations in both concessions are nominally from 12:30 AM to 6:00 AM. However, normally, passage is allowed around 4:00 AM, effectively shortening the curfew. Nevertheless, during revolutionary anniversaries, the curfew is strictly enforced. With the current implementation of special security measures, the French Concession did not allow pedestrian traffic after 4:00 AM yesterday morning until 5:45 AM, when freedom of movement was restored.

Bridge Blockades and Traffic Control

The bridges along the Suzhou Creek, including the Garden Bridge, Szechuen Road Bridge, and North Szechuen Road Bridge, have been under Japanese control since the war. With the approaching anniversary of August 13th, the Japanese continue to block access to the North Szechuen Road, Szechuen Road, and Sinza Road bridges, leaving only the Garden Bridge open to Hongkew. The Kiangse Road Bridge, Denton Bridge, and Tibet Road Bridge are blocked by the International Settlement. The Old North Gate Bridge is only open to pedestrian traffic, while the Chekiang Road Bridge is only open to vehicles. Both vehicles and pedestrians can pass over the Tientsin Road Bridge. Armed detectives are stationed at the north end of each bridge to conduct searches.

Heavy Security on North Kiangse Road

North Kiangse Road, from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to Avenue Road in the north, and the shops, residences, and alleys on the east side, have been barricaded by the Japanese with wooden poles and barbed wire fences, leaving only three gaps at the Chongming Road intersection, the Vincent Road intersection, and the Haining Road intersection. Since the authorities of the concession increased security measures the day before yesterday, the gaps left by the Japanese blockade are still open as before. On the west side of the road, the concession authorities have set up barbed wire fences, leaving gaps only at Haining Road and Chapoo Road, where Japanese detectives are stationed to guard and inspect pedestrians. All other transverse roads and alleys leading to North Kiangse Road are blocked. The southern end of North Kiangse Road, near North Soochow Road, is also blocked, allowing access only through the gap on the west side of Chapoo Road.

Public Bus Searched, Gun Found

According to the English-language *China Press*, police and defense forces in the International and French Concessions conducted the second day of security measures according to the special security plan. No terrorist activities were discovered in either concession. However, yesterday (the 9th) and this morning, police continued to arrest suspicious individuals in various districts of the city. Over a thousand people were arrested today. Yesterday, French Concession police searched a French-owned Route 21 public bus on Avenue Edward VII and found a pistol on a young Chinese man, who was arrested. Although the man refused to reveal his identity to the police, the police believe he is connected to a terrorist group or a criminal gang.

French Concession Searches Two Hotels

Yesterday at 6:00 AM, the French Police Department dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives in police vehicles to the Ta Fang Hotel at No. 33 Chen Chia Mu Chiao Road and the Niu An Hotel at No. 14 Chu Pao San Road to search the rooms, guests, luggage, and boxes. All guests were questioned in detail. The search yielded nothing.

Foreign Troops Assist in Security

In addition to prohibiting various gatherings and blocking some roads, the two concessions also mobilized all armored vehicles, patrols, plainclothes squads, and mobile patrols to conduct patrols and inspect pedestrians and vehicles along the way. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement is also assisting in maintaining order. British troops are maintaining order east of Yu Ya-ching Road, American troops are guarding the area west of Yu Ya-ching Road and south of Robison Road, Italian troops are protecting the area north of Robison Road and the extraterritorial roads, and French troops and Annamese soldiers are responsible for the security of the French Concession.

Japanese Troops Parade in Nantao to Intimidate

The Shanghai War Memorial Day is the day after tomorrow. The Japanese are deeply afraid that patriotic elements will take the opportunity to attack. Therefore, they have been intensifying their defensive work in the occupied areas of Hongkew, Western Shanghai, Nantao, Pudong, and Zhabei for several days. In addition to being covered with sandbags and barbed wire, each bridge is guarded and searched by four Japanese soldiers and two puppet police officers. The docks along the river have also increased their posts, and passage is only allowed during the designated hours. In the Western Shanghai area, due to the proximity of the Kunming Concession, the troops stationed in various cotton mills have been mobilized. Yesterday morning between 8:00 AM and 10:30 AM, the troops stationed in Nantao, with armored vehicles, artillery vehicles, small cannons, and machine guns, and more than 300 armed soldiers, patrolled the urban area, seemingly for the purpose of intimidation.

### Changes Among Puppet Troops on the Shangchuan Line: Puppet Troops of Xu, Cao, Zhang, and Qin Defect to Pudong

The Japanese army in Zhuchiao, Pudong, ordered the local people to negotiate with the guerrillas, and the Japanese army withdrew from Zhuchiao, but on the condition that the guerrillas no longer attack. According to the informant, the Japanese army has already withdrawn and is rebuilding fortifications at the station to ensure the safety of the railway. The Japanese army has also conscripted a part of the puppet army of Xu Hongfa and sent them to Zhabei, and continues to conscript the rest of his troops. However, in addition to this, a part of Cao Weizhou's troops refused to obey Xu's transfer. Two companies under Zhang Miaogen, led by Shen and others, also defected and joined Fan Gencai's troops in Pudong. As for Qin Xingyan's troops, apart from his basic troops in Kaohang, those in various towns on the Shangchuan Road have all joined Zhang Huifang.

### British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Murray, Arrives in Shanghai; Patrolled North China Waters for a Long Time; British Cruiser Sails from Weihaiwei to Tsingtao for Reinforcement

British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Murray, arrived in Shanghai on the British cruiser HMS "Cornwall" from Weihaiwei on the 9th. Admiral Murray patrolled and toured the waters of North China for a long time before arriving at the port at 3:30 PM on the 9th. The British warship HMS "Cornwall" is currently berthed at the British naval pontoon. It is said that Admiral Murray will stay in Shanghai for a while. It is also known that the British cruiser HMS "Kent" sailed from Weihaiwei to the waters of Tsingtao for reinforcement on the morning of the 9th. It is said that she will be stationed there for two or three days before returning to Weihaiwei to participate in the summer exercises. According to British naval sources, the British ship HMS "Decoy" did indeed sail to Fuzhou on the morning of the 9th to supply food to the British expatriates who are besieged there. Reports that the British destroyer HMS "Decoy" No. 75 sailed outside the port for patrol are incorrect.

### Airline Industry Receives Phone Call: Japanese Planes Bomb Fenghua Again; Five Japanese Planes Dropped Ten Bombs Yesterday Morning; Only Seven People Injured, Over Seventy Houses Destroyed

Recently, the Japanese side has been bogged down in the war against China without making any progress. Therefore, it has repeatedly decided to send planes to harass the rear, bomb undefended cities, and slaughter innocent civilians, attempting to threaten the people's hearts. Various places in eastern Zhejiang, such as Ningpo, Chenhai, Haimen, Wenchow, Xiangshan, Yuyao, Tz'u-ch'i, and Shaohsing, have successively suffered wanton destruction. The disasters in Ningpo and Chenhai are the most serious. However, this kind of behavior is only enough to increase the people's resentment. According to a telegram received by the airline industry in this city from Ningpo yesterday, Fenghua suffered Japanese planes again yesterday morning. The telegram stated that at 8:00 AM on the 9th, five Japanese planes arrived in Fenghua for the second bombing, dropping a total of ten bombs. One bomb fell next to the Ta Ch'an Hall in Chungshan Park, two bombs fell at the Kwan Ti Temple in Chungshan Park, two bombs fell on Peichieh, one bomb fell next to the telephone bureau in Butterfly Lane, one bomb fell in the Hsiang Fang Lane in Hsichieh, and three bombs fell at Pe Pu Ling and other places. Four people were seriously injured, three people were slightly injured, and over seventy houses were destroyed. There was no other loss.

### Foreign Ships' Coastal Defense Freight Not Interrupted, But Cannot Be Immediately Shipped Inland; Customs Brokers Already Handling Through Transport

After the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire companies first dispatched ships to sail the Shanghai coastal defense route, other foreign merchant ships also followed suit. At that time, coastal defense was the only channel connecting the interior, so shipping was unprecedentedly prosperous, so that the goods transported to the coastal defense area were piled up like mountains. However, there was a lack of vehicles there, and it was not easy to disperse the goods for a time, so Shanghai merchants did not dare to do much.

Therefore, the freight volume of the Shanghai coastal defense route has recently decreased a lot compared with before. As for the report the day before yesterday that Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson refused to load goods for coastal defense, it is not true at all. Because this morning, the Butterfield & Swire company still had the Taiyuan ship sailing from Shanghai to coastal defense, concurrently to Hong Kong, carrying a total of more than 1,140 pieces of coastal defense goods, including piece goods, cotton yarn, soap, and groceries, which is only slightly inferior to before.

The Jardine Matheson company's Yosheng ship is also scheduled to go to Hong Kong and coastal defense from Shanghai on the 13th of this month (Sunday). However, the goods transported to coastal defense cannot be immediately transported to the interior. That is the current reality. Therefore, recently, the Mao Tung and Chin Yuan customs brokers have jointly handled Shanghai-Kunming through transport with the Sino-French Express Company, transporting goods from Shanghai to Saigon, and loading them onto trains from Saigon to go directly to Kunming.

The first batch of goods was loaded onto the French mail ship Félix Roussel on the 18th of last month and transported to Saigon. It arrived in Saigon on the 25th and was immediately loaded onto trains on the 27th to transport to Kunming. It is said that the goods arrived in Kunming yesterday (the 10th). The second batch of hundreds of tons of goods was transported on the French mail ship General Chaffee on the 1st of this month and has now arrived in Saigon and will be loaded onto trains for transport to Kunming within days. It should also arrive in Kunming in the last ten days of this month. The third batch of goods will be transported on the French ship Société Marseillaise de Navigation à Vapeur (Messageries Maritimes) on the 15th. Therefore, the Shanghai-Kunming through transport can be called a success.

It is also known that the Chung Ho and Ewo transportation companies are also jointly handling Shanghai-Kunming express through transport and will implement it within days.

### Absolutely Prohibit Counterfeit Currency Remittances, Which Is Equivalent to Promoting Them; Strict Precautions Should Be Taken

The Ministry of Finance believes that the "Hua Hsing Bank" has issued "banknotes," and has repeatedly instructed all industries in this city to strictly adhere to their positions, refuse to use them, and absolutely stop the exchange of Tianjin-Pukow counterfeit currency. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has again reported that some people advocate using "Joint Reserve" notes for remittances in North China and limiting the delivery to "Hua Hsing notes" in Shanghai. If this is done, although both receipts and payments are counterfeit currency, the result is equivalent to promoting them, and will eventually become the guide wire for intrusion into the south of the Suzhou Creek. Strict precautions should be taken. It is strictly reiterated that it is absolutely forbidden to collect "Joint Reserve Notes" in North China and deliver "Hua Hsing Notes" in Shanghai for remittances.

### Japanese Ship Runs Aground Near Pingyangpu; More Than Ten Passengers Transferred to Shenjiamen

The Japanese ship Yangtse Kiang, chartered by the Hainan Shipping Company, set sail from Dinghai in the morning with passengers and cargo for Shanghai. When passing near Pingyangpu, twenty li from Dinghai, due to the rapid currents, she was accidentally careless and the ship's hull touched the water grid dam stone at that location. At that time, it happened to be low tide, and the waves were turbulent, making it impossible to leave the reef. The shipowner drove a boat and transferred all the passengers, more than ten people in total, to Shenjiamen Town. Taking advantage of the rising tide in the evening, the ship was dragged out of the reefs and continued to carry passengers to Shanghai. However, the passengers had already been terrified.

### Ministry of Finance Encourages Exchange of Gold and Silver for Legal Tender; Guides People Holding Gold to Exchange for Legal Tender in Four Banks and Other Institutions

The Ministry of Finance sent document Yu Ch'ien No. 4353 to the provincial governments, stating that in the implementation plan of the second phase of wartime administration, the Ministry of Finance ordered the following financial matters: 1. Consolidate the credit of legal tender; (1) In the item of collecting gold and silver, it is clearly stated that "Incentives for Exchange: For those who hand over

Large amounts of gold

Over one hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 2% of the total value; over three hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 3% of the total value; over five hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 4% of the total value; over one thousand taels will receive a special bonus of 6% of the total value.

Handing Over Ornamental Gold

Those handing over over ten taels will receive a special bonus of 2% of the total value; over thirty taels will receive a special bonus of 3% of the total value; over fifty taels will receive a special bonus of 4% of the total value; over one hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 6% of the total value. The Executive Yuan will also award

Honorary Rings (法藍鋼)

(For ten or twenty taels or more) or armbands (For fifty or one hundred taels or more). The aim is to encourage the accumulation of pure gold through incentives." The ministry has requested the Joint Office of the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China) to instruct the gold and silver exchange offices to follow these instructions. In order to promote the exchange, we are sending this to your provincial government for your information and to instruct your local governments to

record and post the announcement

widely. In addition, instruct the heads of townships and towns to publicize the above-mentioned incentives for exchange and to guide people holding gold to exchange it for legal tender at the nearest branches of the four banks or their authorized exchange institutions. The handling situation should be reported to the ministry.

### Stores Should Accept Postage Stamps in Circulation; Be Careful Not to Buy New Postage Stamps; To Avoid Increasing the Number of Damaged Stamps

The Shanghai Postal Administration is expected to accept the suggestions of legitimate groups and submit them to higher authorities to find a solution to the 400,000 yuan worth of postage stamps circulating in the market as small change. The public should also be careful not to increase the number of damaged stamps. According to a reporter from the Ta Tung News Agency observing in the market, some stores are unwilling to accept external postage stamps, hoping to avoid suffering from the loss of damage, so they would rather buy new postage stamps from the post office with legal tender for change. If so, the number of postage stamps used as small change will increase, which will also increase the number of damaged stamps. Therefore, it is unwise. It is hoped that these stores can accept external postage stamps and accommodate them. Sooner or later, the government will have a solution to avoid losses to the people.

### Seek Safe Methods for Ferrying Passengers at the Mouth of Chenhai; The Moufu Wheel Steamer has Established Comprehensive Procedures to Prevent Future Dangers and Maintain Passenger Transport

Since the indirect resumption of the Shanghai-Ningpo line and after the authorities approved allowing the elderly, weak, women, and children to board the ships, the passengers on the Shanghai-Chenhai ships are crowded. Many passengers from Ningpo to Shanghai are numerous. Each ship leaving Shanghai has more than one thousand to three thousand passengers, and many of them are waiting in Chenhai in advance. Upon hearing that the Shanghai ship has arrived outside the blockade, they will hire small boats and rush to board the ship. Because the number of people is high and they are all rushing to get on board first, it is extremely dangerous. It is learned that on the evening of the 28th of last month, more than ten passengers jointly hired a small boat to board the De Ping steamer, but when sailing near the blockade line, it suddenly collided with another ship, causing an accident and endangering the safety of the passengers.

The Moufu Authorities Vigorously Promote Safety

In order to avoid dangers and ensure the safety of passengers, the Moufu Wheel Steamer authorities of the Lih Ho Foreign Firm in this city have decided that all tickets must first be purchased at the company before passengers can take the company's special barge to transfer to the ship, and they will absolutely refuse to board the ship on their own to avoid danger. As for luggage, there are luggage rooms and inspection offices in Ningpo and Chenhai. All the methods are extremely comprehensive, and a "Passenger Notice" has been printed and distributed to each passenger when selling tickets so that everyone knows. According to a reporter from the Ta Kuang News Agency, after the Moufu Wheel Steamer returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th, it was originally scheduled to sail to Chenhai on the 12th. Now, because there are still many foreign ships staying in Chenhai, it has been postponed to 4:00 AM on the 15th. The Da Jia Bank at No. 77 Duobo Road has been entrusted to sell passenger tickets.

The Ente and Baoli Sailed to Chenhai One After Another

The Ente ship of the Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company has recently been approved by the Ningpo Garrison Headquarters to join the Shanghai-Chenhai route. The ship is scheduled to depart for Ningpo at 4:00 AM this morning. The Baoli ship of the Yihua Foreign Firm sailed to Chenhai yesterday morning and arrived safely outside the Chenhai estuary at 4:00 or 5:00 PM yesterday. It is anchored in the waters of Chiliyu and will return to Shanghai after unloading passengers and cargo.

### British Warships Return to Hong Kong to Concentrate, Including Submarine Tender and Aircraft Carrier

Amidst the emergency in South China, British warships were ordered to return south one after another. The British China Fleet's submarine tender HMS "Medway" returned to Hong Kong from Weihaiwei on the 2nd of this month, following the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle." In addition to the above two ships, the British warships currently stationed in Hong Kong include the submarines HMS "Regent," HMS "Roqual," HMS "Rorqual," HMS "Rainbow," HMS "Pandora," HMS "Parthian," HMS "Poseidon," HMS "Odin," the destroyers HMS "Fame," HMS "Firedrake," HMS "Scott," HMS "Dainty," the river gunboats HMS "Forester," HMS "Ladybird," and the gunboats HMS "Gnat," HMS "Robin," totaling nineteen ships.

### Japanese Reporters Launch Opposition to Rent Increases

According to the English language China Press, Japanese journalists are leading an anti-landlord movement in Hongkew today (the 10th), and are attempting to unite the tenants of the Peias Apartment (transliteration) at the corner of Penglu and Chapoo roads to oppose the recent rent increases. According to the Japanese-language *Tairiku Shimpo*, the original owner of the apartment, the British Commercial Wide Corporation, on August 1st

Notified the Tenants

That from this month on, one-quarter of the rent must be collected at the exchange rate when the legal tender had not fallen, i.e., one shilling and two pence. This will effectively increase the rent by half. The Shanghai Japanese New Journalists Association and several people in the Peias Apartment have sent letters to all tenants, urging them to jointly launch an

Opposition Movement

It is reported that the first to start raising rents was the Broadway Mansions, owned by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Shanghai Hengchan Company, which notified the tenants of the building last month that rents would be increased by 35 percent from August 1st, and that rents must be paid in Hua Hsing currency from September 1st.

### Rice Merchants Suggest Cooperation for Relief; Market Price Limits Exist Only in Name; Authorities Have Agreed to Consider

It is learned that rice industry leaders have again suggested that the authorities of the two concessions cooperate to relieve the rice market so as to stabilize the people's food within the boundaries. The Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee is now considering the rice merchants' suggestion. Over 800 rice stores, large and small, in the city have vowed not to purchase rice exceeding the limit, and have sent letters to the Rice Stores Guild to forward to the Municipal Council to find ways to crack down on black market deals. It has been a week, but the citizens' purchases have increased instead, so most of the rice stores have no goods to supply the market. Yesterday, when the bean and rice market opened at 9:00 AM, the rice prices were sluggish, and the rice stores stopped adding rice. The rice prices all fell back to two or three corners. The 19th issue of the survey of the city's warehouse rice storage, conducted by the bean and rice industry guild, was published yesterday, but it is still difficult to accurately determine the actual storage of rice stored by merchants and stockpiled elsewhere.

### The Case of Li Mingzhi of Wanbao Silk Factory Being Shot at: Allegations of the Factory Profiting from Inferior Goods; Zhang Yongkang and Mei Shiqing Arrested; The Peacemaker Was Actually a Wanted Criminal; Leaders and Assailants All on the Run

Li Mingzhi, a Ningbo native, shareholder and manager of the Wanbao Silk Factory at 53 Singapore Road, and Xu Jianfan, a Qingpu native and shareholder, received as many as nine threatening letters between April 13th and July 10th of this year, purportedly from the "Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps," accusing the factory of profiting from the purchase of inferior artificial silk and demanding a ransom of 600 national currency. Initially, they ignored the letters, but later, the gang instructed Li to send a representative to meet near the Golden Grand Theatre in the French Concession. Wang Cheng, a Chinese detective sergeant from the Gordon Road Police Station, and Xia Shutang, a detective, disguised themselves as Li's representatives and went to the designated location and to a

Pancake Stall on Avenue Joffre

They arrested Meng Zhaojian, a 14-year-old Siyang boy, and Gong En, an 18-year-old Tianjin native, both apprentices at the pancake shop, who were sent by the gang to collect the money. The shop owner, Min Cuntang, a Siyang native, was also taken back to the police station. After interrogation at the First Special District Court, the two boys, Meng and Gong, were released leniently due to their youth and ignorance. The pancake stall owner, Min Cuntang, was sentenced to 20 days of detention as a warning. After the case was solved, Zhang Yongkang, a Jiading native who previously worked as a clerk at the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Route Cardinal Foch, secretly went to

Wanbao Silk Factory

and falsely claimed to Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan that he knew Shen Yunbin, the head of the Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps, and could mediate to avoid misunderstandings. He managed to swindle them out of 60 yuan for transportation and conversation expenses. Meanwhile, the two shareholders, Li and Xu, of Wanbao Silk Factory, requested the Silk Industry Association and Customs to inspect and certify that the factory did not purchase inferior artificial silk and guaranteed that all raw silk purchased was entirely domestic goods. Unexpectedly, they later received another letter, purportedly from the Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps, demanding 600 yuan to ensure Li Mingzhi's safety, or they would resort to

Drastic Measures

Zhang Yongkang disappeared without a trace. On July 3rd, at 11:30 AM, Li Mingzhi, accompanied by the factory's engineer Liu Feiyi and a Mr. Tao, left the factory by car. On Singapore Road, they suddenly saw a young man in his twenties standing across the road, dozens of yards away, holding a Mauser pistol and aiming at their car. Fortunately, the gun jammed and failed to fire. The driver, being alert, sped away. The young man chased after them and fired two shots, both missing. Li Mingzhi

Managed to Escape

and reported the incident to the police station. Wang, the detective sergeant in charge of the case, and detective Xia quickly apprehended Zhang Yongkang near Haig Road. Zhang confessed that his leader was Shen Yunbin, who was hiding in a refugee shelter in Xujiahui. They were unable to find Shen. They arrested Mei Renqing, a Hebei native, as an accomplice, along with other suspects, including Li Jianman from Hangzhou, Mang Suiliang, a local, and Ma Songxin from Changshu, and brought them to court. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to the Third Criminal Court to investigate. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated that after investigating the suspects, Li, Cao, and Ma, it was clear that they were not involved and requested their release. The court approved the release and stated that the defendants

Zhang and Mei

would be prosecuted for attempted murder, extortion, and fraud under the criminal law. The leader, Shen Yunbin, and the young man who fired the shots at Li Mingzhi's car, Zhang Jin, were still at large. Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan, the two victims, testified about their experiences, stating that they had known the defendant Zhang Yongkang at the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Route Cardinal Foch ten years ago. Zhang confessed to this without hesitation. Mei claimed that he was coerced by Zhang and asked for leniency. Judge Huang ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Two Deaths by Shooting in Western Shanghai: One a Gangster, One a Soil Broker; Each Shot Three Times and Died

Liu Dianyuan

Liu Dianyuan, 43, from Baoding, Hebei Province, lived at 93 Tong'an Lane, Route Mett Herst, and ran the Taixing Soil Brokerage at 6 Dingye Lane, Route Cardinal Foch. Yesterday at 3 PM, while Liu was talking with his partners at the brokerage, several thugs suddenly broke into the business, drew their pistols, and without explanation, fired three shots at Liu Dianyuan. Liu, unable to escape in time, was hit by all three shots. The first bullet hit his left arm and penetrated his lung. The second and third shots hit his right thigh and left calf. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled the scene. Afterwards, he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 5 PM. His body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.

Zhang Yuchun

Zhang Yuchun, a 39-year-old Jiangbei gangster, rented a bungalow with no number in the Meijia Lane, Yong'an Creek, on the Great Western Road in Western Shanghai. He had considerable influence in the area and many followers. Yesterday at around 7:30 PM, Zhang went to the Zhao Family Residence on Route Cardinal Foch. Suddenly, enemies ambushed him and opened fire as soon as he arrived. Zhang, caught off guard, was shot in the throat, chest, and right hand. He collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled in all directions. After the shooting, police arrived and quickly summoned ambulance No. 85, which rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 9 PM. The Jing'an Temple Police Station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and pursue the perpetrators to bring them to justice.

### The Case of Li Yongkuan and His Sons: Closing Arguments Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 16th

Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, and Li Bihua, father and sons, notorious bandits and salt smugglers from Anhui Province, after the Nationalist army retreated westward two years ago, gathered followers in Songjiang County, Pudong Caojing, Xihudang, and Ruanxiang, organized bandit gangs, masqueraded as guerrillas, and committed arson, murder, looting, and forced the women Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian to marry their sons. They also killed Lin's mother. After the regular army was disarmed, they fled to Shanghai. Lin and She reported them to the French police, who arrested Li and his sons one after another and recovered stolen gold jewelry and leather clothing from the Lin and She families. These were handed over to the Second Special District Court, where the lawyers of the French Concession Administrative Authority filed public charges for robbery, murder, and deprivation of freedom. The victims Lin and She also commissioned lawyer Xu Yannian to file an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation of 8,000 yuan each for the defilement and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. The defendants commissioned lawyers Yi Zhendong and Lan Xuzhang to defend them. Judge Liao repeatedly opened court sessions to hear evidence and investigate, which lasted for half a year. The trial had initially been declared concluded. However, regarding the gold jewelry seized from Li's home, Li claimed it was his own, while Lin and She insisted it was stolen loot. A detailed investigation was required. Therefore, the court summoned the counter clerk of Bao Cheng Silver Shop to court with his ledgers for questioning, which proved that Li's statements were false. Following instructions, the court rescheduled the hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao, together with the prosecutor, reopened the trial, briefly questioned Li and his sons, and, considering the facts of the case to be clear, ordered closing arguments. After the prosecutor presented his opinion, lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the French Concession Administrative Authority and the lawyers representing the defendants delivered their arguments. The court then declared the closing arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 16th. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Embezzlement by Employees of a Money Shop: Two Offenders Sentenced Separately

Kong Guangfu, an employee of the Rixin Money Shop at 9 Fuxili, Tianjin Road, was instructed by the manager, Hu Houfu, on the 11th of last month, to discount a remittance draft for 4,368 yuan at the Hangzhou Silk Shop at 48 Jixiang Street for 4,000 yuan. Instead, Kong embezzled the money and fled. He used 2,000 yuan to start a moneylending business with Guan Peide from Yangzhou. The rest of the money was used for gambling in the gambling dens of Rong Sheng and others in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, and for hiring prostitutes, spending 150 yuan in one night and engaging 10 prostitutes. Subsequently, the Rixin Money Shop commissioned lawyer Jiang Chiping to report to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Gao Zhen and detective Wang Qi arrested Kong and Guan and recovered 1,200 yuan in cash. They were sent to the First Special District Court for legal prosecution. The trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court sentenced Kong Guangfu to nine months in prison and Guan to three months in prison. Guan could commute the sentence to a fine at the rate of two yuan per day. Kong was ordered to compensate the plaintiff 2,800 yuan in national currency, and Guan was jointly liable for 1,700 yuan of that amount.

### Prison Guard Allegedly Supplied Drugs to Inmates: The Guard Denies Providing

Jin Mingquan, a robber from Songjiang, sentenced to seven years in prison, was serving his sentence at the Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet. On September 24th of last year, Jin confessed to the prison authorities that he had been smoking morphine in prison, which was supplied by Li Han, the chief guard, and Tu Kun, a guard. Tu Kun escaped. After the incident, Li Han and Jin Mingquan were investigated by prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, who then charged Li Han with dereliction of duty and Jin Mingquan with drug use. The trial had been repeatedly postponed due to the complexity of the case. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian reopened the Fourth Court to hear the case. The defendant Li Han vehemently denied protecting inmates and allowing them to use drugs, claiming that Jin Mingquan was instructed by others to falsely accuse him. Jin Mingquan then stated that his previous confession was true and not influenced by others. The court then declared, "According to the law, the use of narcotics is punishable by death. Are you aware that you will face the death penalty for confessing to using drugs in prison?" Upon hearing this, Jin Mingquan requested leniency from the court. The court, after deliberation, adjourned the case and stated that a defense lawyer would be appointed for Jin Mingquan for further questioning.

### The Case of a Woman Being Chopped with an Axe Late at Night: The Assailant Arrested and Sent to Court

Fang Jinkun, a 28-year-old Jiangyin native, on the night of May 27th of this year, wielded an axe and brutally attacked a woman, Yu Chushi, at the Bund Taikoo Wharf. The woman suffered severe head injuries but fortunately did not die. Fang fled without a trace until August 8th, when he was apprehended by the Water Police at Lujiazui and handed over to the French Concession Police for investigation. The French police yesterday escorted the assailant Fang Jinkun to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, requesting detention for investigation. The presiding judge briefly questioned him and ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation.

### The Mystery of the Missing Dance Hall Girl: Found on Guofumen Road

Lin Shuzhen, a dance hall girl at the Weigong Dance Hall on Ningbo Road, suddenly disappeared from home. After her mother discovered this, she suspected Chen Weiling, an employee of the Dazhong Firm on Seymour Road, who frequented Lin's dances, and reported him to the police, who arrested Chen. Later, Ningbo native Li Yuanqing and a woman named Dong Meimei were apprehended, but Lin's whereabouts remained unknown. On the 9th, Sun Dafa, the detective in charge of the case at the Old Patrol Division, discovered that Lin Shuzhen was being hidden by a woman named Ma Shi, who lived at 1 Maqili, Route MacKay. He arrested Ma, who initially denied it, but after strict questioning, she confessed that Lin was hidden in room C at 42 Guofumen Road. He went there and found Lin. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the situation and requested that the case be tried jointly with Chen Weiling and others. Judge Feng Shide approved the request and ordered Ma Shi to be remanded in custody and the case to be heard jointly with Chen and others on a later date.

### Family Dispute of a Deceased Traditional Chinese Doctor: Wives Confront Each Other in Court; Third Concubine Accuses the First Wife of Colluding with the Second Concubine in Theft; First and Second Wives Deny the Accusations; Court Adjourns the Case

Dai Shoufan, a Fujianese traditional Chinese doctor, 62 years old, had some assets and therefore had one wife and two concubines. The wife, Qiu, 61 years old, and the second concubine, Zhou, 46 years old, were both from Dai's hometown. The third concubine, Li, 43 years old, was from Beijing. In recent years, Dai favored Li and lived with her at 12 Tingyun Lane, Route Lafayette, in the French Concession. The wife, Qiu, lived at 21, 280 Lane, Route Sapey, and the second concubine, Zhou, lived at 5 Caishifang, Caishi Road. On the 12th of last month, Dai died of illness in Tingyun Lane. Qiu and Zhou both went to

Manage the Funeral Arrangements

Li also had no objections. Later, disputes arose over the distribution of the estate, leading to quarrels. On the 2nd of this month, the twenty-first day after Dai's death, Qiu and Zhou were at Li's place preparing for Dai's memorial service. At that time, Qiu and Zhou instructed their children to move the deposited leather trunks to their own residences. Li seized the opportunity to report to the French Concession Police, ordering detectives to arrest Qiu and Zhou. Qiu had already been released on bail through lawyer Ge Zhitan. The French Concession Police yesterday escorted Zhou to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District and also summoned Qiu to court. According to the plaintiff Li's accusation, Qiu was

Accused of Theft

Judge Wu Ke presided over the case. Qiu and Zhou both stated that Li was trying to monopolize the estate of the deceased Dai Shoufan and fabricated the accusations, requesting the judge to investigate thoroughly. Lawyer Ge Zhitan then stated to the court that the case was purely a domestic dispute and did not constitute theft, requesting the court to grant bail to the defendant Dai Zhou. The court, considering the case to be a domestic matter, ordered Dai Qiu to remain on her original bail and Dai Zhou to provide a guarantor who could be called upon at any time, adjourning the case until the 17th of this month for further investigation.

The shipping line from Shanghai to Pinghu has not yet been restored since the interruption of navigation on that route. The shipping line has now been rerouted to Zhujing. Passengers traveling to Pinghu can transfer to sail boats after arriving in Zhujing.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Committee for Raising Sanitary Expenses originally set a fundraising deadline of one month. Currently, fundraising by various groups is still in progress and has not yet been completed as scheduled. Therefore, at yesterday's regular meeting, it was decided to extend the deadline for one month.

A telegram from the Shanghai Boy Scout Delegation in Chongqing stated that there are currently 350 Shanghai Boy Scouts serving in various war zones. President Kong has commended them and granted 350 sets of service uniforms, which are being rushed into production. In addition, Mrs. Hu Mulan of Hong Kong has donated 350 raincoats, a transportation vehicle, and six large bags of medicine.

### The Case of Xue Ashun, Owner of the Yilun Silk Factory in Wuxi, Being Kidnapped and Murdered: The Main Culprit, Hou Genxiang, Charged with Murder; A Female Servant Voluntarily Surrenders to the Police to Testify

Xue Ashun, a Wuxi native who ran the Yilun Silk Factory in Butterfly Village, Wuxi, had his home robbed on May 4th of last year. On March 25th of this year, he was kidnapped and a ransom of 1,900 yuan was demanded. Because negotiations failed, he was murdered by the bandits. His wife, Xue Dai, was also detained and suffered gunshot wounds to her head. She was later released by the bandits and

Escaped to Shanghai. On the 2nd of the month, Xue Dai discovered that the bandit who killed her husband, Hou Genxiang, was living in room 20 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road. She reported this to the Old Zhabei Patrol Division, and Chinese Chief Detective Yun A'gen, Detective Zhai Jiaju, and Detective Qin Boliang arrested Hou and a suspect, Pan Yaoming, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the interrogation continued. According to police lawyer Jiang Baolian, during the adjournment, Liu Wushi, a former maid at Xue Ashun's residence, came to the police station to testify that she witnessed Xue being

Killed by Hou. A detailed statement was written. Therefore, the police are now prosecuting Hou for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Pan Yaoming was found to be unrelated to the case and should be released. Judge Feng Shide questioned Liu Wushi and after her testimony confirming the circumstances of Hou's killing Xue, the court ordered Hou to be remanded in custody and scheduled a further hearing. Pan Yaoming was released.

### Social Miscellany

Confiscated Opium - The Public Concession Police discovered that someone was selling opium at 35 Jisheng Lane, 195 Fujian Road. They rushed there to search the premises yesterday and arrested Zhang Ximing, a Jiading native, and confiscated fifty-one and a half taels of opium, one-eighth of a tael of heroin, and 59.6 yuan in legal tender.

Robbery in Fahua - Five robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Shi Erlang, a Haimen native who worked at the Shengsheng Milk Shed in Fahua West Town, at around 10 PM the previous night. Shi was outside enjoying the cool air and unaware of the robbers. He stepped forward to ask what they wanted and was threatened with guns by two robbers, who told him not to make a sound. The other three robbers entered the house and robbed him of 25 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, and a Xiangyun yarn jacket and trousers. After stealing the goods, the robbers escaped into the darkness.

Man Injured by a Vehicle - At around 7 AM yesterday morning, a garbage truck No. 748 from the French Municipal Council was driving past the entrance of 421 Route Lafayette when a man on a bicycle suddenly came out of a lane into the road.

He died at 6 AM yesterday after ineffective treatment. The Public Works Bureau Charity Association took care of the burial.

### Catering Industry Raises Prices Again: Each Meal Must Cost 20 Yuan or More

Due to the tight foreign exchange, soaring gold prices, and increased costs in various industries in the city, the prices of all kinds of goods have increased, even those industries unrelated to foreign exchange. The catering industry in the city has already raised prices twice. An ordinary meal now costs between 15 and 20 yuan. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, the industry has announced another price increase starting on the 15th of this month. The highest price increase is as high as 22 yuan per meal. It is truly not easy to eat a meal these days.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor, Today's local news column of your newspaper contains a report on the case involving a mother and son and the Jingli Elementary School. The content involves Songru and is very untrue. Therefore, I must write a letter to correct it. The board of directors hired Mr. Shen Ronghua as the principal. This case has nothing to do with Songru. Schools are social enterprises, not private property. Although Songru is a weak woman, she knows a little about education laws. Therefore, she became independent in 1937 and took a job at the Shanghai Women's Preparatory School. Recently, she has been working for the Aimeilan Embroidery Company. She has no intention of scheming against the school. Why would she need to provoke the feelings between Fuhua and her mother? The report is clearly intended to confuse public opinion. Therefore, I am writing this letter to correct it. I hope it will be published in the letters column. Yours sincerely, Zhang Songru, August 9th.
To the Editor, I have read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on the 6th of this month about the Railway Department's efforts to provide relief to unemployed railway workers. The gist of the report is that "after the successive fall of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Ping-Han, and Jin-Pu railways, most of the railway workers lost their jobs. The railway trade unions petitioned the Ministry of Railways for relief. Recently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the situation of the workers and has formulated relief measures, which will be implemented separately to resettle them or maintain their livelihoods. The investigation has been completed and has moved on to investigate in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Suzhou." The Association wishes to raise the following questions: 1. The Ministry of Railways was merged into the Ministry of Communications in January of last year, but the report still refers to the Ministry of Railways. 2. Since the investigators from the Ministry of Communications have already come to Shanghai, the Association and its members have heard nothing about it. How did the investigators begin to investigate the situation of the workers? 3. Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Suzhou are all occupied areas. How can the investigators from the Ministry of Communications openly conduct investigations in these areas? Therefore, the Association believes that the report is a fabrication by traitors with ulterior motives. We are writing this special letter to you and request that your newspaper correct it. Yours sincerely, Yuan Qiaofu and Jiang Jiaxiang, Standing Directors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union.

### The Landlord’s Ideal Calculation of the Second-Hand Landlord

— Tenant 3

Foreign exchange has been shrinking time and again, causing the external value of the legal currency to greatly decrease. The prices of foreign goods have skyrocketed, and the prices of domestic goods are also rising sharply, which has become a common phenomenon. Some landlords who nominally operate as "foreign merchants" are envious, so they also raised rents, the reason being: foreign exchange has shrunk, our "foreigners'" income has decreased, and we cannot make up for the losses, so we must raise prices. Therefore, the standard for price increases is calculated according to foreign exchange. Currently, it is an increase of 30% to 40%, and this will be the precedent for future increases. Under such circumstances, the panic of tenants is imaginable, because their income is not calculated based on foreign exchange, and naturally, the rent cannot be increased by 30% to 40% at once. Currently, there are many such tenants who are devising countermeasures. I cannot help but offer them some advice for reference: They can ask these "foreign merchant" landlords: if the legal currency cannot buy foreign exchange at all (which is very possible), or if the black market for foreign exchange is completely abolished (which should be the case), what will you, the "foreign merchant" landlords, charge the tenants? What will be the standard?

Tenants, of course, are most afraid of landlords raising rents. However, among these tenants, there are so-called first-hand landlords who are not only not afraid of the big landlord raising the rent but even welcome it. As soon as my second-hand landlord received the notice from the big landlord to raise the rent by 40%, he happily came to notify me, saying, "40% is a bit too much, but some increase is inevitable. Haha, the wool comes from the sheep, sorry, haha, the wool comes from the sheep." It is an honor that the average third-hand tenant is seen as worthy by the second-hand landlord, enough to be considered a "minor sacrifice." Therefore, as long as the big landlord increases by 40%, the second-hand landlord can take the opportunity to collect four or five times that amount. Every modern second-hand landlord always raises four or five sheep with wool to shear, enough to provide for his endless eating and drinking. As for when the world is peaceful in the future, the sheep, whose wool has been sheared like an ugly duckling, will run away one by one, the big landlord's 40% will remain the same, and they will have to learn from it alone. These second-hand landlords don't seem to have thought about it.

Wouldn't it be nice to hang some lanterns?

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 15: Overseas Monitoring Suddenly Welcomes Willow Leaves, Miraculous Scenes in the Fire Reveal Lotus Flowers

Let's talk about the He sisters, who received a telegram from their father saying that he was ordered by the International Trade Commission to go to Xinjiang. Originally, it was said that he would go to Beiping and then to the Northeast provinces, but now that he was being sent to Xinjiang, it was likely that his trip to the Northeast was temporarily suspended. Because he was in charge of international trade import and export, his sudden departure to Xinjiang must be related to import and export. It turned out that the highway from Gansu to Xinjiang had been open for a long time, and domestic trade was gradually developing. And the railway from Gansu to Xinjiang would soon be fully open to traffic. However, senior officials still traveled by plane. This time, Mr. He was naturally taking a plane from Beiping to Xinjiang. The area of Xinjiang, nominally a province of China, was not much smaller than the main part of China – the eight provinces. Since – more than a year ago, during the Sino-Japanese War, some people had gone to Xinjiang for development. Afterwards, the number of people going there increased year by year, and it also became more prosperous year by year. This land, because it was in the center, surrounded on all sides, and inconvenient to access, everyone was reluctant to develop. Little did they know that the climate was mild, the products were abundant, minerals, animals, plants, what didn't it have? It was truly a great fertile land. The output of wool alone could supply the whole world every year with surplus. This time, Mr. He was going to Xinjiang, probably for the issue of wool exports? Although his father wouldn't be delayed in Xinjiang for long, at most only two or three months, since his father had told them to telegraph their mother and younger brother in Guangzhou, they naturally telegraphed back immediately. According to the two young ladies' intention, they also wanted to bring their stepmother and two younger brothers to Shanghai for a few days. Firstly, the two younger brothers' studies could not be neglected; secondly, their villa had not yet been built, and coming to Shanghai at this moment would only be a waste of money. Shanghai was still a gold-consuming place. The two young ladies intended to have the villa in Liberty Village built as soon as possible, and after informing their father and discussing it with their stepmother, they simply decided to live there permanently. They would send their two younger brothers to study at the Liberty Village Elementary School. Because the two young ladies knew that their two younger brothers were inevitably somewhat spoiled and still had aristocratic habits. Not to mention the two little brothers, they themselves were also two pampered young ladies. But in this era, they couldn't be like this anymore. They knew that the Liberty Village Elementary School was full of children from rural families who were accustomed to enduring hardship and working hard. They wanted their younger brothers to also develop this kind of simple and hardworking spirit. (169)

### Student Expenses are Already High, Book and Stationery Prices are Rising Again, Using Old Books to Reduce the Burden

— Yisu

The primary and secondary school textbooks issued by various bookstores in this city have recently been subject to further contraction of foreign exchange and rising prices. It was unanimously decided that secondary school textbooks would be sold at 50% above the set price, and primary school textbooks would be sold at 80% above the set price, effective from July 26th. This has further increased the burden on students.

To understand the detailed situation, I took the opportunity to visit the owner of a bookstore. He has some family ties with the author, so the information he provided was relatively sincere.

I started my question: "Now that textbook prices have risen, you can make more money on the books you have in stock!"

He answered very frankly: "Bookstores that sell on consignment don't have a lot of inventory. There are definitely some benefits to the books currently in stock. Speaking of bookstores, the interest is very thin, just enough to cover expenses. This decision to raise prices, in addition to an 80% increase for primary school textbooks and a 50% increase for secondary school textbooks, also includes an average increase of 30% to 40% for non-textbooks. In short, 'hot' books (those in high demand) have increased more; 'cold' books (those in less demand) have increased less. As for stationery supplies, most have also increased by 30% to 40%. Of course, original Western books follow the foreign exchange rate, but fortunately, there are reprinted Western books to remedy the situation; but they have also increased by 30%."

Currently, all prices are soaring. Student’s personal living expenses alone are already very high. Now, with the increase in book and stationery prices, how will a student's parents bear the burden? Therefore, within the realm of possibility, it may be worthwhile to spend more time searching for the books you need at old book stalls, which can save you a lot of money. Below is information about the old book stalls in Shanghai that the author asked the bookstore owner for, as a reference for selecting old books.

After the war, old book stalls in Shanghai, like other emerging businesses, have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The area around Carter Road and Avenue Road can be said to be the center of old books, with a total of more than a dozen places, selling original Western books, reprinted Western books, and senior and junior high school textbooks, with a wide variety. In addition, most are located near Henan Road, Jiao Ma Road, Lafayette Road, and Baylor Road. Among them, the old bookstore on Henan Road near the Commercial Press is larger in scale and has a more complete selection of various books. There is a place opposite the fire station on the same road. Although the facilities are simple, there are many English literature books and Western magazines. Old book stalls on Fourth Horse Road mostly have Chinese classics and primary and secondary school textbooks. On Lafayette Road, there are many books for high school and some common engineering books. As for many other old book stalls, they are very simple and set up temporarily. Occasionally, you can find very good books.

The summer vacation will pass in a blink of an eye. I hope you will try it out when school starts.

### "New Gold Mountain"

— Bai Hua

"Captain Fury"

After watching "New Gold Mountain", it really evokes memories of "Robin Hood". One witnesses the Pope manipulating politics and slaughtering civilians, so he hides in the green forest, unites the masses, rises up in resistance, and loyally serves the royal family; the other is oppressed by the big landlord, rescues his companions, roams among the mountains, and specializes in helping the weak, robbing the rich, and aiding the poor. After their sole target is defeated, they are also recruited by the governor. However, their spirit of resistance, struggle, and perseverance is worth learning. These heroes of the wilderness leave a valuable page in history, which is their spirit of resistance, struggle, and perseverance!

The construction of "New Gold Mountain" is indeed about writing this outstanding hero, General Fury, but the playwright does not emphasize the appearance of this character. Instead, he uses the power of the masses and their tight organization (such as using the white flag as a symbol) to set off their sharp struggle with the big landlord, which finally achieved success. This is commendable. At the same time, it tells me the inevitable failure of compromise. Duboli, who informed the big landlord, not only did not receive a large reward but was imprisoned in jail. This is a valuable lesson!

The director, Hal Roach, handles this play with very high skill. The greed and ferocity of the big landlord, the tyranny of the henchmen, and Fury's resistance, every scene is stimulating and pulsating; and the unfolding of the sharp struggle is also strong and powerful. To give a few examples: when those convicts in iron shackles drag their heavy steps and walk in a line, he contrasts them with the iron-faced, selfless guards with bayonets. A close-up of the scars on an ankle when the shackles are knocked off. This powerful depiction is precisely to strengthen the stimulus of the slaves' resistance. After Frey and Bleich fight, it is Frey who takes the blame for him. The union of only those who are insulted and harmed is not only touching but also strengthens the value of union. When the big landlord's henchmen forcibly seize the land and property of the people, they clearly dissect the cruelty and wickedness and the elimination of abuse for the people. The atmosphere is also very tense, such as the majesty of the cavalry coming and the beacon fire on the top of the mountain as a signal.

What is even more lovable is his probing and drawing of the character of Bleich, from beginning to end, he is extremely lovable.

A dance party is also handled in a lively and bustling manner.

Brahn Eyre, who plays Frey, is not tall enough, but his acting is very calm. Of course, the best actor is Victor McLaglen (Bleich), who is straightforward, rude, passionate, and lovable. His every move vividly portrays the personality of such a character. Compared with "The Informer" and "The Last Hurrah", he is simply a completely different person. Joan Bennett as Jenny, does not appear much. George Zucco, who plays the big landlord Torres, is also very good, and his greedy, insatiable, cruel, and ferocious appearance is very realistic.

Among the films released in various theaters during this summer vacation, "New Gold Mountain" should be the most outstanding.

### Does the Soul Really Exist? (Continuation 2)

— Zhu

(3) People have religious ideas! Religious ideas are a unique human nature; no higher animals have them because they have no soul. Only humans, whether civilized, barbarian, wise, or foolish, have religious ideas, knowing that there is a divine being above humans and that they should be in awe and worship. They also know that the soul still exists after death, so they worship their ancestors. Although they have mistaken gods, treating man-made false gods as true gods (this is because they do not understand the true way, which is understandable), it is enough to show that they all know in their hearts that there is a god, and that the soul still exists after death. (4) Humans all have conscience! Various animals cannot be reasoned with because they have no soul and no conscience. Although humans have different personalities, different environments, and different customs, conscience is the same: "The sense of right and wrong is inherent in everyone." This time, the world's people expressed sympathy with our country in the Anti-Japanese War, which proves that justice (conscience) is in people's hearts. From the personal perspective, doing good deeds brings peace and happiness in the heart, and doing evil deeds is blamed by conscience, and the city is always in fear and fear. This conscience is like a watch placed in the heart of a person by the upper enemy, just like the water and electricity company placing water meters and electricity meters. In the future, when people go to the Emperor to be judged, God only needs to look at our conscience to know what you have done in your life. Therefore, people cannot quibble or shirk responsibility before God. Some people often say, I do things according to my conscience and do not believe in any religion. However, on the day of judgment, conscience will become your accuser, because no one in the world has never done anything wrong since childhood, and conscience can only do its duty as a faithful witness, which is enough to convict you. Therefore, we must repent to God as soon as possible, ask Him to forgive people's sins, and believe in God's son, Jesus Christ, to be your mediator. Because Jesus died for you and made atonement for your sins, God will forgive all your sins. In this way, a change will occur in your heart, as if the debt has been paid off and you have been freed from the burden, you can get true peace and joy (to be continued) Christian Literature Evangelistic Association P.O.

### Miss Chen Yunshang Talks About: Experience and Hope (Part 1)

— Written by Leng Fang

Editor's Note: Chen Yunshang came from the South and rose to fame in Shanghai; the film "Mulan Joins the Army" showed her skills for the first time, making a splash; her talents are outstanding, and it is definitely not accidental. The film industry has been sighing for years about the difficulty of finding talent, and few new people are cultivated; and Yunshang can shine on the silver screen, which is really rare and worthy of attention.

### Random Notes of an Artist

I am a little girl from the South. Since leaving my hometown and coming to the Shanghai film industry, although I have only made two films, I have gained a lot of knowledge in terms of working in the film studio; this gives me a better opportunity to work hard, and I am really very pleased.

Educational Background and Occupation

Looking back on my experience in the film industry: it has been four years since I started at the age of sixteen. Before that, my academic career: I graduated from elementary school at the age of eleven, and then went to Guangzhou Women's Normal School for two years. At that time, my father moved his family to Shantou for work reasons, and I dropped out of school halfway. Later, I moved back to the provincial capital (Guangzhou), and I myself took on the position of tutor at the local public education center - that is, training many children to sing, do gymnastics, etc., like a kindergarten. It was only after more than two years that I went to Hong Kong to enter the silver circle.

Family Situation

My family situation is very simple. My father has always worked in politics, and my mother only gave birth to two sisters. My academic name is Minqiang, and my sister's name is Zhiqian. She is also sixteen years old this year. During my childhood, my favorite thing was to learn singing and dancing. Therefore, the daughter-in-law of the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhu Zhaoshen, was our neighbor; she was British, and because she liked me very much, she started teaching me dance when I was ten years old; singing was learned in school. At that time, whenever there were recreational events held at school or in the community, I would often participate in singing and dancing performances as a child. Some publications say that I came from a dance troupe. Such rumors are absolutely untrue.

### Gu Erji's Family is Ruined

— Hui Cun

Home Bombed, Beloved Wife Forever Separated, Trip to Xinjiang Terminated

Gu Erji is a famous actor in the drama world. Before the war, in the amateur drama troupe's public performances, his special type of acting was beginning to be discovered by the audience, especially in the performance of the play "The Inspector General", his achievements were quite wonderful.

He first appeared on the screen at Diantong Company, and Shi Dongshan's "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" by Xinhua was also his first work after leaving Diantong and entering Xinhua. By the time Shi Dongshan's "Night of Joy" was released, his old and decrepit form and meticulously portrayed acting made the audience very admirable.

In the production of China's first costume sound film "Diao Chan", he played Dong Zhuo, the treacherous hero of the Three Kingdoms, and the success after the public performance also laid the foundation for his success on the silver screen.

We still remember the group wedding of three pairs of artists under the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou in previous years, Gu Erji and Du Xiaojuan were one of them. After their marriage, they had two children.

When the August 13th Incident occurred, Gu Erji and Du Xiaojuan followed the amateur troupe to the mainland to engage in drama work. Later, the amateur drama troupe disbanded invisibly, and Gu Erji also joined "China Electric" as an actor, and successively starred in films such as "Lonely City Bloodbath", "Sons and Daughters of China", and "Long Sky Miles". He also participated in the drama performances of Chongqing film and drama people.

Recently, Japanese planes have been constantly bombing Chongqing. In a certain bombing, his home was burned. In addition to rescuing the two children, clothes and miscellaneous items were all turned to ashes.

Really, the saying "misfortunes never come singly" was fulfilled in him. In order to avoid air raids, he moved to the South Bank to live. Who knew that his wife Du Xiaojuan would get sick there? She died of cholera after only four hours. What was left was nothing, only two children who did not understand human affairs accompanied him day and night. He is now ruined and bereaved. Not to mention that he himself feels deep grief in this situation, even bystanders cannot help but shed a tear of sympathy for him!

Thinking back three or four years ago, he was still a single bachelor, and now, the branches and leaves are just beginning to be lush, but unexpectedly, he has been so violently devastated.

Originally, he decided to go to Dihua, Xinjiang with Zhao Dan and Wang Weiyi and his wife to develop drama work. Now, because the two children lack care and his own inner grief, he has terminated this trip. Greater anger will grow out of his sorrow. I believe that soon, he will resolutely take on the great responsibility again.

### Dance Country Anecdotes Dedicated to Resilient Children

— Fengxiang

Tired Foot Restoration Method · Effective in a Quarter of an Hour

Dancing, this pastime, seems very easy and effortless; but when dancing for too long, the feet tend to feel tired, just like people who carry light loads for long distances will realize the truth of the saying "a hundred steps is not a light load".

Here is a "Tired Foot Restoration Method" created by Hollywood star Priscilla Lane to dedicate to the resilient children of the dance country.

The method instructed by Miss Lane is to first prepare two basins of water, one of which should be very hot and the other very cold; first put your feet in the very hot water basin, then quickly switch to the very cold water basin, and then take them out and dry them, apply almond oil and massage them, and sprinkle some cologne or apply some talcum powder. Then, place your feet naturally flat on a soft pad, and stop for a few minutes, and that's it. At this time, you will feel that the fatigue has suddenly disappeared, and calculating the time spent, the speed of the effect, it does not even take a quarter of an hour.

Finally, you have to remember that when you want to continue dancing, don't wear the socks and shoes you just took off.

Chen Xue (Diaoyuan), although he has the nickname of Chen the Fool. But he is not only not stupid, but also more shrewd and capable than anyone else. Because he deeply knows the secret of the saying "great wisdom seems like foolishness". So he has not lost his military and political position of importance since he was appointed as the Brigade Commander of the 74th Brigade stationed in Xuzhou in the second year of the Republic of China, until now. During the period, he was promoted from Brigade Commander to Xuzhou Garrison Commander. Soon after, he was promoted to Governor of Anhui for his meritorious service in handling the Sun Meiyao Lincheng train robbery case. After the Northern Expedition, he was reappointed as Commander-in-Chief, Chairman of Anhui, and today's President of the Military Senate. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China. He simply worked two fourteen-year wide errands. Except for Yan Baichuan, I don't know how many Northern Warlords were worn down by him (the word "wear down" in the northern dialect is used very well. The common saying is "burning a lamp to wear down the oil" (people are about to die and wear down the time") and such as "Second Entrance to the Palace" opera words "Ten years of cold window, nine years of wearing down." And "Visiting Relatives" One Many years of road becomes a river. A newly married daughter-in-law wears down into a mother-in-law." These wear down words are used very appropriately. Because all things that are slowly consumed into nothingness are described with the "wear down" word. This is more meaningful than using many words. Opera words are related to dialects. Therefore, there are often wonderful rhetorics in local dialects.) There are already very few people in ancient and modern times who can have ten years of good luck. What's more, he has already had thirty years of red luck and is still in a prominent position. Not only have I seen this person, but one of his sons is also my short-legged friend. Therefore, I know quite a lot about his character. He is not only bold and knowledgeable, but also able to handle matters related to the overall national situation. He can pick it up and put it down, and make decisive decisions. He doesn't recognize anyone when he turns his face. In the old days, the Lincheng Baoduzi case. He only carried a letter from an old man in Shanghai, and he broke into the fort alone on horseback. This kind of courage is simply as dangerous and astonishing as when Huang Tianba entered the Linked Rings.——(79)——

### Finance The Primary Target of Speculation: Gold Continues to Surge to New Highs, Peak Price of $4,365, Up $750 in Six Consecutive Days

Yesterday's spot gold bullion market was filled with feverish speculation. The upward trend not only continued unabated but became even more chaotic. Everyone present was stunned and shocked. The root cause was a further tightening of both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates. Most major long positions were tightly held and continuously increased. Moreover, the available supply of gold, after being absorbed by Hong Kong interests, outsiders, and wealthy non-industry merchants, became even scarcer. Consequently, the market opened high at $4,220. Buying intensified after the opening, with gold shops aggressively raising prices, pushing the price up to $4,350. Subsequently, a temporary strengthening of foreign exchange rates triggered selling, causing securities firms and money changers to halt their aggressive buying, leading to a $100 pullback to $4,250. However, as foreign exchange rates stabilized and sentiment turned bullish, certain banks resumed their buying on dips, causing the market to close high at $4,340 by noon. The afternoon opening was flat and weak. News of a slight tightening of foreign exchange rates soon reignited buying, pushing the price to a new peak of $4,365. Profit-taking by floating longs then caused a pullback to $4,350 at closing, resulting in a further increase of $200 compared to the previous day. It was reported that the off-market price after closing was $4,380, with buyers but no sellers. Trading was brisk, reaching 1,500 to 1,600 taels. Gold jewelry also rose by $20, resulting in a record high price of $440. Customs gold remained flat, while British pure gold experienced a slight decline.

Gold Bullion Surges Another $200

Starting this morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose by $70 due to continued tightening of foreign exchange rates. The opening price was $1,220, with money changers buying twenty taels from gold shops, marking the day's low. After the opening, news of HSBC's exchange rate adjustments spurred a flood of buying. Although gold shops repeatedly raised prices and sold off gradually, the number of buyers was several times greater, pushing the price up by $80. A certain gold firm bought fifty taels from money changers at $4,300. The price then briefly pulled back to $4,280. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates tightened further, a certain gold shop and a certain bank aggressively resumed buying, driving the price up by another $70. Money changers bought ten taels from gold shops at $4,350. Thereafter, news of a halt to the tightening and a slight strengthening of foreign exchange rates caused a sudden shift in sentiment, stopping buying. A certain gold firm and money changers began selling, with securities firms also aggressively selling, causing a $100 decline. Money changers traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,250. News of renewed tightening of foreign exchange rates then reignited buying. A certain bank and gold firm aggressively bought large quantities. Although there was still ample selling from retail longs, the supply was limited compared to demand, causing another surge of $95. Gold firms traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,345. Money changers suddenly began selling, causing the upward momentum to falter, resulting in a $30 drop. Money changers sold twenty taels to gold firms at $4,315. A certain money changer then bought dozens of taels from other firms, suddenly pushing the price up to $4,340, the noon closing price. The afternoon opening saw weak buying interest due to stable foreign exchange rates, with the opening price down $20. Gold shops sold twenty taels to money changers at $4,320. News of a slight tightening of foreign exchange rates soon after triggered buying, with a certain money changer aggressively buying dozens of taels, pushing the price up by another $45. Money changers traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,365, an unprecedented high. News of stable foreign exchange rates and profit-taking by retail investors then caused the price to weaken. Gold shops sold twenty taels to gold firms at $4,340. A slight increase followed, with money changers trading thirty taels among themselves at $4,350, the evening closing price. The result was another surge of $200 compared to the previous day. It was noted that the price had risen for six consecutive days, totaling $750. The intraday fluctuation was $145. The premium of spot gold at gold shops over gold bullion was $10. The premium of standard gold bullion over posted gold prices was $65 lower. It was reported that opening was extremely rare.

Gold Jewelry Listed at $440

The initial selling price of gold jewelry at large gold shops was $420 per tael. At 9:35, the price was raised by $10. Shortly thereafter, it was raised by another $5. At 10:00, it was raised again by $5. At 10:30, it was lowered slightly by $5. At 12:00, it was raised again by $5. There were no changes after that. The result was an increase of $20, with large gold shops listing the price at $440 and new gold shops lowering the purchase price to $438 by more than $20.

British Pure Gold Suddenly Drops Half a Penny

A London telegram on the 9th reported that British pure gold suddenly dropped half a penny per ounce, falling to £7 8s 6d, causing the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price to also decrease to $1,212.3. The posted customs gold remained flat at $2.396. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by $0.3 to $1,207.6.

### Foreign Exchange Purchased Regardless of High Price, HSBC Exchange Rate Further Reduced, US Dollar Once Approached $7

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's exchange rate announcement reveal a sharp reduction of 2.5 in British gold and a drastic drop of $0.5 in the US dollar. Both had broken the previous lows of 3.75 on the 8th of this month and 7.3125, setting new record lows of 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. Other currencies also saw severe declines. The unofficial market for British and US currencies saw constantly emerging new highs. The opening price remained unchanged from yesterday afternoon's closing price, but sellers were scarce, resulting in a market with transactions but no activity. Subsequently, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and foreign firms aggressively bought at high prices. Although the British bank HSBC was reluctant to sell, its appetite was substantial. Despite efforts by the Overseas Chinese Bank and others to sell, the supply was insufficient to quell the upward momentum, causing the situation to steadily tighten. British gold even reached a new record high of 3.5625, and the US dollar reached 6.9375. Near noon, the Western firm Sassoon resumed selling, and cotton yarn longs also began liquidating, leading to a slight recovery by noon. In the afternoon, continued activity by Chinese merchants and a certain Chinese bank caused the situation to soften slightly again. In the end, British gold tightened by another 1.5625, and the US dollar also softened by another 3.125. This month's futures followed the same pattern, ultimately closing at 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. Trading was brisk throughout the day.

Sassoon Sells High After Holding

In the early morning, the London "Big Stick" (a reference to a specific commodity or financial instrument) for the near term was unchanged, while the forward term fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price was undetermined. London raw gold suddenly fell by half a penny. Exchange rates for British versus US and British versus French currencies were flat, while versus Shanghai it was down 0.0125. US versus British and US versus French currencies were unchanged, while versus Shanghai it was down 0.15. Central Bank posted exchange rates remained the same. Bank opening spot selling prices were 3.75 for British gold and 7.3125 for the US dollar, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, the market softened due to the scarcity of sellers, with Chinese merchants first settling spot US dollars for this month with a certain bank at $7. Subsequently, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank and importing foreign firms and the Overseas Chinese Bank successively settled spot British gold from 3.6875 with Chinese banks and a certain US bank, tightening to 3.5625, and spot US dollars from 7.125 tightening to 6.9375. Upon the announcement of the HSBC exchange rates, British currency fell by 2.5 and US currency fell by $0.5. All other currencies fell accordingly. After the announcement of the silver balancing tax, the exemption remained unchanged. Western firm Sassoon then suddenly took the opportunity to sell high, and exporters also sold slightly, causing the situation to stabilize somewhat. Sassoon sold spot British gold to HSBC and Yuli (likely another firm) at 3.62. Subsequently, exporters sold spot US dollars to Yuli and other outsiders at 7.0625. Later, China-Italy (likely a firm) bought spot US dollars from counterparts at 7.0625. The Japanese Bank then resumed clearing, and Hong Kong speculators also wired in purchases, causing the situation to soften again. The Japanese Bank and Hong Kong wire transfers successively absorbed spot British gold from China-Belgium (likely a bank) and a certain firm at 3.59375, and spot US dollars at 7 and 6.9375. Near noon, cotton yarn longs suddenly began liquidating, Sassoon's selling interest resurfaced, and the Japanese Bank's appetite waned, causing the market to recover somewhat. Cotton yarn firms and Sassoon successively sold spot British gold to Yuli and other outsiders at 3.625, and spot US dollars at 7. The noon closing bank spot selling prices were 3.625 for British gold and 7.0625 for the US dollar. This month's figures were 3.53125 for British gold and 6.875 for the US dollar.

US Dollar Closes Back at $7

The later market opening was relatively stable. First, a certain Chinese bank absorbed this month's US dollars from counterparts at 6.875. Around 2:30, a certain Chinese bank suddenly began clearing, and Chinese merchants also absorbed current US dollars, causing the situation to tighten slightly. A Chinese bank settled spot US dollars with Datong and a certain bank at $7 and bought spot British gold from outsiders at 3.59375. Subsequently, a Chinese merchant settled spot US dollars with a certain bank at $7 and this month's US dollars at 6.8125. The evening closing bank spot selling prices were 3.59375 for British gold and $7 for the US dollar. This month's figures were 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. As a result, the current British currency tightened by 1.565, and the US currency softened by 3.125 compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong Dollar at $405

A Hong Kong telegram on the 10th reported that today's exchange market opened steadily. British and Japanese currencies were unchanged. The US dollar softened by 0.0625, with the spot price at 28.5 and the near-term price at 28.375. The Shanghai dollar rose by $9 to $386. At 9:55, the Shanghai dollar continued to rise by $4 to $390. At 10:10, it softened. The British currency tightened by 0.03125 to 1s 2.625d. The forward term was unchanged. The Shanghai dollar rose by a total of $6 to $396.

The afternoon opening at 2:30 was stable and unchanged. At 3:25, the US dollar forward term softened by 0.03125 to 28.4375. The spot price was unchanged. The Shanghai dollar rose again by $10 to $410. The Japanese currency tightened by $1 to $104.375. The closing Shanghai dollar fell back by $5 to $405. The overall increase for the day was $28.

Tianjin British Currency Advances Three Pence

A Tianjin telegram on the 10th reported that today's exchange market opened weakly. The British currency tightened by 0.021875 to 0.02875, and the US currency tightened by 0.00375 to 0.050625. The Shanghai dollar rose by $1 to $128. The "United Currency" in the unofficial market rose slightly by $0.5 to $101.

### Foreign Currencies Frequently Rise, British Gold Pound at $103, US Dollar at $106

Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply due to weak foreign exchange rates and soaring gold bullion prices. British and US gold pounds also saw sharp increases. There was strong demand for British and US gold notes. The market was buoyant. Hong Kong and French franc notes both became highly volatile. Singapore and Dutch notes all saw sharp increases. Japanese gold notes were mediocre at $1.09 in the evening market. Korean notes were unchanged at $0.915 in the evening market. Trading at the exchange was scarce. Xiangkang sold 200 gold notes to Rentai Jinde. Hongchang sold 500 Hong Kong notes to Xiangkang. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by $5, British gold notes rise by $3.7, US gold pounds rise by $4.5, US gold notes rise by $0.59, Hong Kong notes rise by $0.21, French franc notes rise by $0.025, Singapore and Dutch notes rise by $0.5, Annam notes rise by $0.15, Robbie notes rise by $0.3, Canadian notes rise by $1, Philippine notes rise by $0.4, Italian notes rise by $0.05, German gold notes rise by $0.2, Australian gold notes rise by $3. Other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Attempts to Rise but Stops

Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange remained firm at over $200 per $1,000, showing a trend of rising first and then flattening. The opening price in the morning was around $205. Subsequently, the sudden increase in the use of cash caused the rate to rise to $218. It only retreated near noon to $210. It was unsustainable in the afternoon, with the final rate at $205, the same as the previous day's price. The interest rate offered by the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged at 18% in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Yarn and Cotton The Second Target of Speculation: Hoarding Cotton Yarn, Double Horse Rises Again by $32, Up $120 in Four Consecutive Days

The cotton yarn market is experiencing a sharp upward trend, and the general state of panic in the market is indescribable. There is a sense that buying cotton yarn will lead to wealth, which is an illusion. It is said that all wealthy individuals and the financial sector are participating and disregarding everything, creating a terrifying situation. Recently, while foreign exchange rates have indeed tightened, the price of one brand of 20s Double Horse cotton yarn has risen by $120 in a straight line over the past four days since the end of last week. Even when compared to foreign exchange rates, the yarn price has risen excessively. Although the actual demand from Guangdong merchants continues, it is said that speculative purchases account for more than 50% of their buying. Considering the cotton yarn itself, there should not be such an excessive rise in price. This situation is not good for the yarn industry.

The spot yarn market opened relatively flat this morning. Due to the significant increase in price the previous day, everyone was observing. The opening price for 20s Double Horse paper goods was $688, and the warehouse receipt price was $639. The momentum soon shifted upwards, and rumors intensified, leading to gradual progress. It was said that foreign exchange rates had further tightened, and speculative buying erupted. The market price jumped by $10, then by $20. The rise in warehouse receipts was frightening, with buyers indiscriminately grabbing, regardless of whether the value had reached its peak. The ex-warehouse price was $722, and the warehouse receipt price was $690, a jump of $51 compared to the opening price. Statistics for the half-day transactions totaled 1,380 bales, plus 150 bales transacted in the afternoon of the previous day. The price of 20s Double Horse rose by $32, Special Jincheng rose by $10, and Double Globe rose by $30. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Xiamen 10 Hong Kong 600

Counterparts 710 Wenzhou 60

Total 1,380

The Japanese yarn market also rose sharply. Most of the activity was speculative. The price of 20s Moon Harp for this month was $427.

### American Seed Cotton Rises to $130

Transactions in Chinese and foreign cotton have seen further progress. A certain merchant, Xinyu Factory, has purchased a large quantity, totaling 1,750 bales. Most of them are 20s materials, with other industry participants mutually buying and selling, making the activity exceptional. Another 1,300 to 1,400 bales were also sold. Fire Engine cotton has been sold for $113 (paper currency), and Tongzhou American seed cotton has been sold for $130, also (paper currency). It has been found that the market prices for various cottons have risen by another $5 to $8. However, British factories have not taken action, and newly established factories have also remained quiet. This is because their yarn selling prices are relatively low. Based on cotton market calculations, the factories cannot make a profit. Perhaps they will resort to reducing production. The supply from northern Jiangsu has increased slightly, with 305 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 230 bales from Beihe. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Sharutuo $150.00 Xinyu Factory purchased 250 bales, paper currency sent to the factory

Huisteng $140.00 Also 400 bales Also Also

Also $147.00 Also 400 bales Also Also

Fire Engine Cotton $113.00 Industry participants purchased 200 bales Also cash delivery

Xinte Cotton $112.00 Also 200 bales Also Also

Pengjiapu $150.00 Xinyu Factory purchased 700 bales Also sent to the factory

Dulila $128.50 Industry participants purchased 200 bales Also warehouse delivery

Tongzhou Cotton $120.00 Also 100 bales Also Also

Brazilian Cotton $177.00 Also 200 bales Also Also

Tongzhou Cotton $113.00 Also 70 bales Also Also

Baled Cotton $130.00 Also 137 bales Also Also

Tongzhou Cotton $110.00 Also 257 bales Also Also

Bailuoqu $130.00 Also 100 bales Also Also

$135.00 Dechengxin purchased 100 bales Also Also

In other news, the trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai has seen rapidly increasing prices due to the daily tightening of exchange rates. Yesterday, Pingguo Er New Special cotton had a transaction at $110. The price for American cotton, which can be spun into 32s yarn, was $180 yesterday. Although the selling price has been increasing daily, there are still many hidden reefs. If the news of yarn factories reducing production is confirmed, or if previously ordered goods from Japanese factories flood the market, then cotton prices will plummet. This is something that must be guarded against.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market opened firmly in the early morning. Speculators were quite active in the market. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported increases, which further boosted confidence. Reports of deteriorating weather in the cotton-producing areas caused the market price to rise by 7-8 pounds at closing. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 75 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by 20 pounds.

### Food The Third Target of Speculation: Manipulating Staple Foods, Though Supplies Arrive, Rice Prices Remain High, General Living Conditions Become More Severe

The Shanghai people's food situation is becoming more tense. Although 15 boats of Songjiang rice arrived downriver yesterday, as well as over 1,000 packages of steamed buns, rice merchants are still spreading rumors that more than 20 ships of the second batch of Songjiang rice will arrive. However, there is talk that the supply of old coarse rice in that area will be exhausted after this batch arrives. Whether this claim is credible remains to be proven by facts. Rice merchants are currently using various excuses to cover up the high price of rice. Yesterday's market transactions remained limited to $26 for ordinary rice, $24.5 to $24 for foreign glutinous rice, and $24.5 for Winter Frost rice. These are unregulated goods. Off-market transactions have reportedly become less active. Rumors persist that high-stalk and thin high-stalk rice are still being offered at $26. Downriver goods are being offered at $24.5 to $25, high-grade rice at $22, premium grade at $20, and broken grade at $18. Based on the previous day's unofficial market, this can be considered the established situation. New粳 rice from Pudong saw ten to twenty dan of brown rice arriving, which was milled and sold by Shanghai factories. It was heard that off-market transactions were occurring at $23. The total number of transactions inside and outside the city was over 5,000 dan, which is not a small amount. However, it is impossible to obtain good rice without offering $26. There are also rejections for those willing to buy rice at the regulated price. Even if you buy it, it is broken and subpar, misleadingly called No. 3 rice. It is unknown what kind of rice it is. Currently, the few who have the resources and ability to store have already stored enough rice. However, the vast majority who do not have a dan of grain feel severely pressured. People are anxious, and the consequences are unknown.

Transactions in the guest merchant's unofficial market have also become scarce. This is because some shops are cautious about transactions exceeding the limit and are mostly hesitant. Moreover, it has been difficult to sell goods purchased within the limit in recent days. As a result, there are few buyers, and the market has slightly declined. However, sellers still insist on not easily selling, resulting in a slight decrease of only $0.2 to $0.3 compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions was around 1,000 bales. The price for Nanjing premium grade was $21.2.

Foreign rice continues to be tightly held, and there are still few transactions in the market. As for orders, it is heard that there is no proper solution due to foreign exchange issues.

### The Fourth Target of Speculation: Buying Flour and Wheat

Flour: Yesterday, the No. 2 flour factory's price rose by another $0.1, changing to $5.6 in cash. All factories have temporarily suspended the supply of large ticket transactions and can only accommodate daily retail sales within the street, limited to dozens of bags per household. It is heard that selling warehouse receipts for returned goods is more popular than factory prices due to hoarding by outsiders in the market. Due to repeated tightening of foreign exchange rates, the selling price of foreign flour has reached $5.8 in cash.

Wheat: Yesterday's supply arrived continuously. Sellers are unwilling to easily sell new arrivals because of the extremely tight foreign exchange rates, rising flour prices, and better sentiment. Yesterday, Chinese and Japanese factories mutually absorbed wheat, and hoarders purchased enthusiastically, causing the market to rise by another $0.1 to $0.2. A total of over 40 truckloads of wheat were sold from Guan Dian, Shaheji, Danyang, Wuyi, Pukou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Nanjing, with hoarders purchasing over 20 truckloads. The remaining was purchased by Fu and Fu factories. The highest price was $8.43.

### Securities General A Bond Plummets, Approaching $4

Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw the lottery draw for Category A bonds. A total of 15 Category A bonds were drawn this time. Therefore, the Category A market price should be calculated based on the exclusion of the winning lottery. According to past practice, the right to win the lottery is only about $1. However, the opening price for Category A bonds was $50, down $2.35, taking advantage of the unregulated location to do as they pleased. The news spread propaganda and amplified the situation. At yesterday's opening, short sellers believed that the exclusion of the winning lottery was the only weakness of Category A bonds. Therefore, the opening price was down $2.35, opening at $50. The market fell another $0.7 in the second session, creating a terrifying situation. Subsequently, the price was gradually lowered, falling another dollar. Other bonds also fell, but few exceeded $1. The agents on both sides of the buying and selling sides mostly reported things that were abnormal and stirred up trouble. The market price ultimately fell another dollar or so. Category A bonds alone fell by $3.95 after excluding the lottery. The volume of transactions was around $400,000. A concise table is listed below:

Category High Low Closing compared to the previous day

General A $50.0 $48.4 $48.0 down $3.95

General B $41.8 $41.0 $41.5 down $1.05

General C $9.5 $9.0 $39.0 down $0.75

General D $38.6 $38.55 $38.55 down $0.95

General E $39.35 $9.00 $39.00 down $0.95

In stock trading, 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of $6.25.

The Industry Association reported that yesterday's rubber stock market continued to be very firm. Several stocks saw new highs, while one or two stocks fell. Foreign exchange rates remained tight. Holders were unwilling to sell unless prices were high. However, no large new capital has been invested in this market. The reason is that it is easier to make a profit by short-term foreign exchange trading, while buying goods requires waiting for market development and often takes a long time to see price increases. To discuss the value of rubber stocks, investors should study the public reserve fund items in the company's balance sheet. If the company's funds are in the Singapore currency system, or if they have invested in British gold assets, then their position is solid. Prices were soft at closing today, but selling was not active. In the industrial stock sector, there were no major changes. The Kaiping stock fell along with the London market price, which fell by 1s 6d, due to the possibility that the coal mines operated by British merchants in North China may be occupied. The Electricity 5.5% bonds fell to $75.5. There was no demand for other bonds.

London British Merchant Far East Companies stock market listing on the 9th of this month (Wednesday) saw more declines than gains. The Security Insurance stock fell by £6 to £22. The HSBC Bank London registered stock fell by £0.5 to £74. The Kaiping Coal Mine stock fell by 1s 9d to 13s 9d. The Gulalaklin Bang Rubber stock rose by 27.5d to 18s 1.5d. The Fu Company stock fell by 9d to 1s. There were no other changes.

London China Foreign Debt stock market listing on the 9th of this month (Wednesday) saw the top-tier Crisp and Rehabilitation (British issue) each fall by £0.5, with the former at £18.5 and the latter at £28.5. The Feixke Aircraft Bond note fell by £1 to £10. The lower-tier Longhai Railway Bonds continued to fall by £0.5 to £9. There were no other changes.

### North-South Goods Bald Dates

- Sold for over $130 -

Since dates from Suzhou arrived in Shanghai, Jiaxing has also followed suit recently. Although the supply has increased, sales are also good, and there has been activity from Hong Kong merchants. Prices have gradually increased by $40 to $50. Bald dates have sold for over $130, and some are asking for $140. They can be said to be exceptionally high.
