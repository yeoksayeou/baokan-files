### Chinese Troops on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Block Japanese Advance into Guangxi; Japanese Troops at Datang Scattered and Routed by Chinese Interception; Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Capture Heshengqiao and Shanpo Two Stations

Chongqing: A Chinese source announced today that the war in South China has shifted from the Beihai area to the mountainous regions on the Guangdong-Guangxi border.

Location Unknown: Director Bai recently commented on the Japanese landing on the coast of Qinzhou and Fangcheng, saying, "For more than two years of the War of Resistance, the Japanese have known that military offensives cannot conquer China, but they still take adventurous actions from time to time, attempting to advance deeply and satisfy their ambitions. This time, the Japanese army, navy, and air force jointly landed in the Qinzhou and Fangcheng coastal areas. The military significance of this is to strengthen the blockade of China's seaports and attempt to cut off our southwestern international transportation lines, in order to cut off China's external resources for the War of Resistance. The Chinese army has long been prepared for this and will definitely give the Japanese army a heavy blow. I hope that the people of the country, both military and civilian, will remain calm and persevering, work together with one heart, and fight and sacrifice, so that we will surely crush the enemy's attempt and create an even greater victory."

Current Commentary

### The Economic War in Europe

While the military situation in Europe has reached a preliminary stalemate among the belligerent nations, the economic war is gradually entering an intense phase. In the past few days, a large number of ships have sunk off the British coast after striking mines, resulting in enormous losses. According to general observations, this may be due to a newly invented magnetic mine laid by Germany. If this is indeed the case, it indicates that Germany has begun to adopt a new offensive in the economic sphere. In the past, Germany retaliated against the economic blockade by Britain and France with a submarine policy, but this was reduced in effectiveness as Britain and France implemented a merchant ship escort system. Now, by placing mines in the shipping lanes, any passing ships will automatically trigger them. This is not only easy to do but also avoids losses for Germany, making it a new tactic employing new weapons.

Whether indiscriminate laying of mines in shipping lanes violates international law or is in line with humanitarianism is a matter for fair judgment, which we will set aside for now. As for how this tactic will resonate internationally, it will depend on the relationships and policies of the countries that suffer losses towards Germany. Germany dares to take this action for two reasons: firstly, after the United States amended the Neutrality Act, its ships cannot navigate to war zones, so it is unlikely to cause a direct conflict as it did during the First World War; secondly, Germany knows that the neutral countries of Europe are definitely unwilling to easily declare war on Germany. Germany's real intention is to disrupt the overseas commercial exchanges of Britain and France, and to threaten the neutral countries surrounding Germany, hoping that they will automatically stop trading with Britain and France and strengthen economic ties with Germany.

In this European war, Germany's economic situation is slightly different from that during the First World War. Reconciliation with the Soviet Union has lifted the land blockade. The Mediterranean Sea has Italy as a gateway, which can still be maintained for its trade routes. In addition, it has signed commercial agreements with Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and other countries, and is conducting commercial negotiations with Estonia, Denmark, Hungary, and other countries. It continues to maintain normal-period commerce with the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and other countries. Therefore, Britain and France claim to have economically blockaded Germany, but in reality, Germany is still able to engage in foreign trade. The coal, iron, steel, copper, and lead of Belgium, meat and coal from the Netherlands, iron ore from Sweden, petroleum, grains, and fish from Romania, and wheat and leather from Bulgaria, various mineral sands from Yugoslavia, are all lacking in Germany. If these commodities are not imported into Germany in large quantities, they will be bought up by Britain and France. Therefore, Germany has warned the neutral countries, demanding that they sever commercial exchanges with Britain and France. It has also conducted commercial negotiations with Romania and Sweden, intending to expand mutual commercial relations through barter trade. Recently, it was reported that Germany has invited countries in Eastern Europe to convene an economic conference. This new offensive that Germany has taken in the economic war in recent days is a threat to Britain and France and an actual warning to the neutral countries.

The wartime economy of Britain and France relies on the support of various colonies. Under the attack of this "new tactic" by Germany, the various raw materials and food products it needs, no matter where they come from, will be in danger of being attacked. It is rumored that Romania and Yugoslavia may therefore stop maritime traffic with Britain. This will certainly be quite unfavorable to Britain and France. However, in war, the use of a new tactic will inevitably be met with another new tactic. In retaliation for Germany's mine warfare tactics, the governments of Britain and France have decided to blockade German export trade. All German export goods can be detained at sea. Germany has also announced that it will take counter-retaliatory actions. In the future, the economic war between Britain, France, and Germany will inevitably become increasingly tense and acute as the war continues.

It is especially worth noting that Germany's economic attacks on Britain and France are currently limited to British waters. In the future, it will inevitably shift its target to the various colonies belonging to Britain and France. The world economy is inherently interconnected. The economic war in just one corner of Europe has already had a great impact on the world. If it unfortunately expands beyond Europe, there is a possibility that it will throw the world's economic structure into chaos. Although the past Sino-Japanese War has not yet stirred up a storm in the entire Pacific Ocean, if the purchase of submarines from the Soviet Union's Vladivostok by Germany becomes a reality, and the so-called mysterious warship patrol actions in Yokohama and other places become increasingly apparent, merchants from various countries engaged in maritime trade in the Far East will probably feel the pain firsthand!

### US Senators Consider Banning Arms Exports to Japan; Hope the State Department Will Issue an Opinion; Japan Says It's Preparing for Treaty Negotiations

Washington: Democratic Senator Harrison and Republican Senator Carper, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hope that the State Department will issue an opinion on Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's draft bill to implement a ban on arms exports to Japan. Carper claimed that after Deputy Secretary of State Welles criticized Japan yesterday for increasing interference in American commerce in North China, they were inclined to support the Pittman bill. Pittman intends to submit his bill to Congress, which will convene in January next year, after the already abolished US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires. The bill authorizes the government and Congress to declare a ban on the export of major raw materials and arms to Japan. Carper claimed, "I would like to hear Secretary of State Hull's opinion on the Pittman bill. I think serious consideration of the bill is valuable." He said that Pittman claimed that if the bill is passed, it would not be implemented, which would also be beneficial to the situation in the Far East. Harrison also said that if the State Department supports the Pittman resolution, then "Congress will seriously consider the bill." He declined to express the merits of the bill, but said that he doubted that the bill could be made into law without "research." Pittman believes that his bill will be passed by Congress, but some people predict that isolationists who are trying to prevent the repeal of the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act will obstruct it again at that time, because the Republican isolationists Borah and Johnson will be opponents of the Pittman bill.

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi announced here yesterday that Japan is prepared to discuss with the United States some way to continue US-Japan commercial relations after the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of January 26, 1911 expires. Horinouchi claimed that US-Japan issues will continue to be negotiated in Tokyo. US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo have held preparatory meetings several times. He declined to predict what actions the Japanese government will take when the US declares the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and the two sides have not negotiated any agreement to continue commercial relations. Horinouchi denied that he had recently issued a statement saying that Japan was prepared to make concessions to the United States in the Far East as a condition for continuing commercial relations. Horinouchi continued that the US-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations will be held at the same time as the US-Japan commercial treaty negotiations. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: According to news here today, the procurement of wartime supplies by Britain and France in the United States will be detrimental to Japan's procurement volume in the United States. The longer the time goes on, the more obvious this unfavorable impact will be. As for the current situation, because there is no large-scale war in Europe, the consumption of various materials such as cotton, copper, and oil shortages is not very large, so a panic situation has not yet been created here. As for Japan, because the expiration date of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is approaching, it has greatly increased its purchases of various wartime supplies here, such as machinery, steel, scrap iron, and fertilizer. However, Britain and France buy with cash, while Japan mostly does not settle the accounts, so in the future, American sellers will inevitably give priority to Britain and France. At present, the United States has mostly sold aircraft and their parts to Britain and France. If Britain and France need a large number of cars and trucks, Japan will get nothing.

### Japanese Prime Minister Abe Talks About the Sino-Japanese War

Hong Kong: Tokyo Foreign Telegram, Japanese Prime Minister Abe talked about the Sino-Japanese War at a reception for reporters yesterday. He finally said that it is difficult for all parties to be optimistic about the handling of the Sino-Japanese incident. Japan has spent 10 billion yen on the "China Incident." This huge sum of money will not only be borne by the Japanese people of this era, but also by the Japanese people of future generations. Therefore, the entire country should not simply hope that the problem can be easily solved. Even if a "pro-Japanese regime" is established, the "China Incident" cannot be resolved in the near future, and it is too early to talk about withdrawing troops. There are special circumstances in North China and Inner Mongolia, and Japan should not gain nothing because of the establishment of a "pro-Japanese regime." In short, Japan has the mission of enjoying special rights in East Asia in order to build a "New Order in East Asia." The ultimate goal is to establish a cooperative body between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. (Special dispatch, 22nd)

### American Pastor DeKruif Has Not Yet Been Released

Tokyo: American pastor DeKruif, who was arrested by the Japanese side on October 12, is still being detained by the Japanese side. According to the Japanese side, DeKruif distributed absurd leaflets and spread unfounded rumors. DeKruif was originally a member of the Shanghai Methodist Church. His wife and two children are currently in Shanghai. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Chita Conference Postponed

Moscow: The Sino-Mongolian Border Commission was originally scheduled to hold its first meeting in Chita on the 29th of this month. Now, due to preparations on the Soviet side, Ambassador Togo has been asked to convey to his government a postponement to December 7. (Domei dispatch, 21st)

### Agriculture Declines in Occupied Areas of China

Washington: According to an article on Chinese agriculture published today by the Foreign Agricultural Relations Bureau of the US Department of Agriculture, agricultural production in the Japanese-occupied areas of China has decreased significantly. As for the areas controlled by the Chinese government, there is no damage. It is expected that China will be able to restore its position in international agricultural trade after the war stops. The reason why the agricultural situation in the areas controlled by the Chinese government is still good is that the difficulty of external transportation lines in these areas makes it necessary to turn to a state of self-sufficiency. The article was written by American economist Laussat. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Soviet Fleet Commander Vigorously Condemns Finland; Prepares to Face War

Moscow - Admiral Tributz, commander of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, published an article in yesterday's Pravda, stating that the Soviet Baltic Fleet is awaiting orders from the Soviet government and is ready to attack Finland at any time. According to General Tributz, "The Soviet government deeply cherishes peace, and its proposals to Finland stem from goodwill and mutual benefit, which is universally known. Unfortunately, Finland's response to the Soviet Union is to heed the calls of its politicians, brandishing weapons and preparing for war against the Soviet Union. The tricks currently being played by the Finnish rulers are merely serving as tools for war-makers, using Finland as a battlefield. However, the Soviet Union's determination to establish peace in Finland, eliminate aggressors, and consolidate the Soviet borders of Leningrad and the borders of friendly nations will not be destroyed by any obstacles." General Tributz concluded by saying that the Soviet Baltic Fleet has made great progress in the past few years, with significant increases in the number of battleships, cruisers, mine-laying ships, submarines, and air force. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### British Government Refutes German Propaganda on its Indian Policy

London - Semi-official sources here refuted German propaganda regarding India, stating that British policy towards India has always aimed at granting it dominion status with complete autonomy through gradual progress. The German claim that the laws promulgated in India are intended for the benefit of the British rather than the Indians is patently absurd. The most important point is that legislative power in India now rests with autonomous provincial councils responsible to Indian electoral districts. Although the central government still retains ultimate British jurisdiction, many important laws in recent years, such as tariff protection laws, have been passed, even if they are detrimental to specific British interests. The German radio station in Zeesen mentioned last week that 90,000 workers in Mumbai were on strike, but in reality, there have been no strikes in Mumbai recently. The German statement clearly refers to a one-day strike at the beginning of October. The Zeesen radio station also mentioned a strike by jute workers in Kolkata, but this matter has long been resolved, wages have been increased by eleven percent, and most workers have now returned to work. This labor dispute is purely industrial and has no political nature. The German report that 100 members of the All-India Congress have been arrested is completely fabricated.

### How Likely is U.S. Involvement in the European War? American Magazine Poll

Washington - According to a public opinion poll conducted by the "Literary Digest" magazine published here yesterday, 50 journalists believe that the United States will inevitably be drawn into the vortex of the European war. At the same time, the majority of journalists believe that President Roosevelt, if he so wished, could win a third term as president. If President Roosevelt is unwilling to run for re-election, the current Federal Security Administrator is expected to replace Roosevelt as a candidate for president. As for the Republican Party, Senator Vandenberg is expected to be a candidate for president. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### New Chinese Literature in the Soviet Union: "Village in August" Translated into Russian and Published

Moscow - "Village in August," a book by the young Chinese writer Tian Jun, along with the preface to the original book written by Lu Xun, has been translated into Russian by Zhdanov and has been published by the National Literary Publishing House, the largest in the Soviet Union, with a preface by the Chinese revolutionary poet Xiao Youmei. According to the person in charge of the publishing house, "The purpose of publishing this book is to enable Soviet readers to appreciate the new and emerging revolutionary literature of China. Chinese ethnic writers such as Tian Jun, Xiao Hong, and Luo Feng are all modern geniuses who add luster to Chinese literature. 'Village in August' is particularly interesting because the Soviet people can learn about the people of Northeast China resisting the brutal enemy since the 'September 18th Incident,' which has never ceased." Within a few days of its release, the book sold over 10,000 copies and received high praise. (Special dispatch, 22nd)

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Announces Decision to Expand Economic Blockade Against Germany; German Naval Warfare Methods Violate the Hague Convention; British and French Navies Cooperate Closely to Seek Retaliation

London - In response to a question from Labor Party leader Attlee in the House of Commons yesterday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced that, in retaliation for Germany's mine warfare, Britain will confiscate German exports on the high seas, stating that more than ten ships have been sunk by German mines in the past three days, six of which belong to neutral countries, and many lives have been lost as a result. Germany is a signatory to the Hague Convention and declared on September 17 that it was willing to abide by it. According to this convention, when using moored mines, all possible precautionary measures must be taken to ensure the safety of peaceful shipping. This is the most essential point of the convention because mines cannot distinguish between warships and merchant ships, nor can they distinguish between the ships of belligerent countries and the ships of neutral countries. Prime Minister Chamberlain then detailed the articles of the Hague Convention regarding mine-laying, stating that the German government had not complied with any of these articles. Germany's violation of the treaty has reached its extreme. British, Allied, and neutral ships have repeatedly been sunk by German mines, torpedoes, and artillery fire, often without warning, even disregarding the conventions it has signed and showing no regard for humanity. The British government cannot allow such actions to continue without retaliation. During the last Great War, Britain confiscated exports originating from Germany or owned by Germans on the high seas in retaliation for German submarine attacks on merchant ships. Now, in view of Germany's repeated violations of international conventions and its inhumane methods, the government has decided to adopt this measure in the future and will soon issue an Order in Council to implement it. The House of Commons cheered at this announcement. At the same time, regardless of the fact that Cabinet Minister Hankey read Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Lords, the House of Lords also expressed its welcome. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris - The announcement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain that Britain will confiscate German-made exports on the high seas in retaliation for German mine warfare has been unanimously approved here. Official sources said that France fully supports this plan without question. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris - The British government has decided to blockade German export trade in retaliation for Germany's adoption of naval warfare tactics that violate international law. Official sources here have also announced that the French government will fully participate in this action. Once detailed measures have been agreed upon, the British and French navies will continue to cooperate closely to implement them strictly. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

London - Following Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons today of the decision to blockade German export trade, diplomatic circles commented that the British government's action was decided after obtaining the full agreement of the French government and carefully weighing the pros and cons. Germany's export trade is a major source of foreign exchange, and striking at it will have a significant impact. According to international law, this type of blockade can only be used as a means of retaliation. Therefore, although Germany has repeatedly violated international law and infringed upon the rights of neutral countries, the British government has hesitated and has not immediately retaliated. Until recently, British and neutral ships, on the usual routes in British waters, were sunk after hitting German mines. Within three days, a total of ten ships were sunk. The British government's legal advisors all stated that there were sufficient grounds for taking retaliatory measures, and the government resolutely decided to do so. It is expected that certain neutral countries will lodge representations with Britain on this matter, and countries such as Italy and the Soviet Union, which have expressed sympathy for Germany's claims verbally and through diplomatic channels, may lodge protests. The British government is aware of this and will provide various explanations and do its best to alleviate the difficulties for neutral countries. Political figures said that Germany's violation of international law and taking advantage of it has become a habit and cannot be allowed to continue. However, there are also various practical difficulties to overcome in implementing the blockade of German export trade, especially the issue of German goods being transported by land to neutral countries and then re-exported overseas.

### Germany Plans to Give Britain an "Appropriate Reply"

Amsterdam - Upon learning that Britain had decided to retaliate against Germany's mine-laying policy, Hitler immediately consulted with military, political, and economic experts on a plan for an "appropriate reply." The Dutch government expressed deep regret over Britain's decision. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin - After Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that he would confiscate German export goods as a means of retaliation against Germany, political figures here regarded it as an act of piracy. They pointed out that Britain's violation of international law and its use of force against small countries are not without precedent. It is not surprising that it has now adopted a plan to plunder the ships of neutral countries. However, it is the neutral countries that suffer the most. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Holland and Belgium Feel Uneasy About the Impact on Trade

The Hague - The Netherlands now views Britain's decision to stop German exports on the high seas as a major blow to Dutch trade. The Rotterdam shipping industry believes that the already reduced trade advantages will be further diminished in the future. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Amsterdam - Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons regarding the extension of the blockade policy to neutral ships trading with Germany has aroused great resentment and unease among the Dutch people. Newspaper editorials have condemned it as an illegal measure by Britain. In addition to criticizing Britain for adopting a blockade policy that affects the shipping and commerce of neutral countries, the "Nieuws van den Dag" also demanded that Britain explain the definition of "German products." The general view is that goods purchased by neutral countries from Germany that are not yet finished and are used as manufacturing materials cannot be considered German products. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### American Newspapers Vigorously Criticize Germany

New York - "The New York Times" commented today on Britain's decision to intercept German exports in retaliation for its mine warfare strategy, which will likely provoke protests from various neutral countries. It stated in detail that the neutral countries are now less critical of the Allied blockade than they were from 1914 to 1918, which is of great significance because what they fear is not this, but the consequences of a German victory. "The New York Herald Tribune" vigorously criticized Germany's recent methods of warfare, stating that neutral public opinion has unanimously opposed it because of its six years of military build-up and breaking of promises. Hitler's crimes have aroused universal curses and made his position even more dangerous than before he began attacking neutral ships. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo - The Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru," which sank near the east coast of England yesterday after hitting a mine, is the 37th neutral ship sunk by German submarines or after hitting mines since the outbreak of the European war, including eight Norwegian ships, seven Swedish ships, five Dutch and Greek ships each, three Finnish ships, two Danish and Soviet ships each, and one Romanian, Belgian, Italian, and Latvian ship each. The sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" was mentioned at the daily press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A British journalist drew attention to the fact that the official Hamburg Nazi Party radio station declared on November 21 that Germany's purpose in laying mines in British territorial waters was to strike at maritime traffic, saying that Britain could no longer provide for the safe passage of British or neutral ships in its territorial waters. It also stated that Germany deeply regretted the impact of this development on neutral ships, but was unable to do anything about it. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Japanese government is awaiting a detailed report on this unfortunate incident. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Details of the Sinking of the Japanese Mail Ship "Terukuni Maru" After Hitting a Mine; Violent Explosion Sent Seawater Flying into the Sky; All 200+ Crew and Passengers Rescued

London - The Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, with a tonnage of 11,930 tons (yesterday's report erroneously stated 2,930 tons), en route from Japan to England, sank off the east coast of England yesterday, definitely due to hitting a mine. Thirteen British passengers on board were injured, and 180 crew members and 28 passengers, a total of 208 people, were rescued. After the explosion, the ship floated on the surface for quite some time. The explosion sent seawater flying into the sky, which was clearly visible from the shore. Rescue boats immediately rushed to the scene to provide assistance. Officials from the Japanese Embassy rushed to the scene after hearing the news. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London - Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship "Terukuni Maru" after hitting a mine, well-informed sources here said that there were 180 crew members on board, making it the second large ship to be innocently lost since the British liner "Athenia" was sunk at the beginning of September. It sank only a few miles off the east coast of England. According to eyewitnesses on the shore, they personally witnessed the ship explode, sending seawater high into the air, and then completely sink forty minutes later. Okamoto, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, went to the scene to inspect the sea area after hearing the news. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London - Captain Matsukura of the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" told a Reuters reporter today about the sinking of the ship, expressing his opinion that the ship was not sunk by a mine on the surface of the sea. He said, "There were five specialized lookouts on duty on the 'Terukuni Maru.' After arriving at Downs Port on Sunday for inspection of contraband, the ship received a sailing permit on Sunday afternoon and was given a special signal flag to hoist on the mast. The British naval authorities also notified the ship that 'the northbound route has now been cleared.' The captain waited until 8:30 the next morning to leave Downs. While proceeding forward according to normal navigation practices, the ship struck a mine, the ship shook, and jumped upward, injuring several passengers and some crew members in the head. Eight lifeboats were immediately lowered into the sea, carrying the 208 people on board, and were towed to the shore by several British minesweepers rushing to the scene." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London - After the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" sank in the eastern waters of England today, the ship's deputy engineer, Kawashima, spoke about what happened, stating, "When the ship hit the mine and exploded, I was in the engine room. The violent explosion almost threw me into the air. All the lights on the ship went out. The chief engineer and I immediately stopped the engines, but the gasoline tank had already ruptured, and gasoline was flowing out, covering the floor of the engine room. All the workers in the engine room then went to the deck to prepare to escape. At that time, the bow of the ship had already sunk into the sea, and the stern was exposed on the surface. I quickly went to the cabin to fetch some belongings, and I and other crew members and passengers divided ourselves into eight lifeboats. The captain left the ship half an hour after the explosion. Shortly after, the ship sank." Mrs. Tafel, a passenger, said that the explosion occurred around 1:00 PM while she was in the second-class smoking room. "The passengers, on the orders of the captain, returned to their cabins to find life jackets. I suddenly lost my key. Fortunately, someone gave me another key, and I was able to open the cabin and take out a life jacket. Thinking back now, I am still terrified." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London - All 225 passengers and crew members of the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru," which recently hit a German mine in the eastern waters of England and sank, were taken ashore by a British ship in the afternoon and transferred to a train to reach here. They were immediately taken care of by representatives of the government and staff of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha and lodged in hotels. Only four of them were seriously injured and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment. One of the passengers, the wife of a British naval officer who had lived in China, told a Havas reporter, "When the 'Terukuni Maru' hit the mine, the entire ship shook. The captain immediately ordered all passengers and crew members to board the lifeboats and then lowered all the lifeboats into the sea one by one. We drifted at sea for a short time and were rescued by a British ship and taken to shore." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Japanese Side Attaches Importance; Will Adopt Appropriate Measures After Ascertaining the Truth

Tokyo - After the "Terukuni Maru" sank after hitting a mine while sailing off the east coast of England, various circles were greatly shocked. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently studying countermeasures. Once the detailed situation is clarified, effective measures will be taken immediately. The issue of laying mines at sea during wartime was formally signed during the Second Hague Peace Conference held on October 10, Showa 14 (1939). The treaty stipulates that the use of drifting mines is prohibited in both territorial waters and the high seas, and that the governments of all countries should be notified of the areas where mines are laid. Therefore, from a purely international legal point of view, the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" can only be due to one of the following reasons: (1) It was hit by a drifting mine or a moored mine; (2) In the case of a moored mine, it sank within the area notified by the belligerent country; (3) It sank after hitting a mine belonging to which country. Therefore, the Japanese government will, once the investigation is clear, lodge a protest and take appropriate measures, such as demanding compensation for losses. Furthermore, the Imperial authorities are concerned that such incidents will occur again in the future, so they have decided to consult with the belligerent countries to call their attention. (Domei dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo - The "Terukuni Maru," which sank in British waters, was completed in May 1930 (Showa 5), with a gross tonnage of 11,930 tons, a length of 154.7 meters, a width of 19.56 feet, a top speed of 17 knots, and a capacity of 235 passengers. It was an excellent passenger ship of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. The ship departed from Yokohama on September 24 for England, intending to carry Japanese expatriates back to their home country to avoid the war. (Domei dispatch, 22nd)

London - Among the 28 passengers on the "Terukuni Maru," there were three Japanese passengers: Kin'ichiro Mase, First Secretary of the Japanese Legation in Switzerland; Kenmi Iwasaki, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in England; and Hayato Nakajima of Mitsui & Co.'s London branch. Secretary Iwasaki was seriously injured. (Domei dispatch, 21st)

London - The cargo on the "Terukuni Maru" included 800 tons of raw silk, 2,100 tons of textiles, canned food, and wood destined for England, 300 tons destined for Belgium, and 1,000 tons destined for the Netherlands. (Domei dispatch, 21st)

Tokyo - The hull insurance for the "Terukuni Maru" was 3,283,600 yuan, and the cargo insurance was 1,800,000 yuan. After a meeting of the insurance companies on the 22nd, it was decided to pay the total insurance claim of more than 5 million yuan immediately in accordance with the insurance contract. (Domei dispatch, 26th)

Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese ship "Terukuni Maru," which sank yesterday, was not reinsured with any foreign insurance companies. Therefore, the loss of the ship will be fully compensated by domestic shipping insurance companies. The ship was also not reinsured with the government-guaranteed war risk insurance association. The ship was insured with the Tokyo Marine Insurance Company in early spring and then reinsured with several other marine insurance companies. The ship, built in May 1929, cost a total of 7 million Japanese yen. The initial insurance amount was 6.5 million Japanese yen, and the shipping company later increased the insurance amount by approximately 3 million Japanese yen, reaching a total of 10 years. The cargo carried by the ship when it left Kobe this time was valued at approximately 4 million Japanese yen, but about half of it was unloaded along the way in France and other places. When it went to England, it was said to be about 2 million Japanese yen. In addition to being insured with the Tokyo Marine Insurance Company, this cargo was reinsured with foreign insurance companies and war risk insurance associations. Domestic companies concerned convened a meeting this morning and decided to immediately compensate the insured amount. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### German Air Force Active Over Britain and France - Five Reconnaissance Planes Shot Down - Intense Artillery Battles on the East Bank of the Saar River

London – German planes flew over England, Scotland, the Orkney Islands, and the French coast yesterday. Allied forces claimed that three German planes were shot down, and the Royal Air Force also shot down two German planes, one of which crashed in the English Channel. French sources claimed that a German plane was shot down by French forces while reconnoitering the Saint-Nazaire shipyard. Including that plane, the French have shot down a total of twenty-two German planes in the past seven weeks. Last night, there was an air raid warning on the northeast coast of England, and anti-aircraft guns immediately fired into the sky. Details are unknown. Three German planes flew in the sky over the Orkney Islands, where frequent alarms were sounded, urging people to take shelter, but the anti-aircraft gun teams were not very active, and the German planes did not drop any bombs. A German bomber flew over Shetland, flying so low that the German national emblem painted on the wings of the plane was clearly visible. The plane did not stop and flew north. Yesterday was the second day of increased German reconnaissance activity over England, and the fear that German planes would soon bomb major cities has also increased. News from Scotland claimed that the air force was very active on the east coast, and Royal Air Force planes quickly flew to the Firth of Forth in the morning, but no German planes were found there. However, some people heard the sound of planes in the sky. The Royal Air Force was active all morning, but there were no air raid warnings. A fighter plane, believed to belong to the German side, was discovered in the northeast of England yesterday morning, flying very high. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Munich Bombing Case – Principal Culprit Arrested in Germany – Elser Confesses to Planting Bomb – Claims Connection with British Intelligence

Berlin – According to an official announcement here, the assassin who attempted to assassinate Hitler in Munich on November 8 has now been confirmed as Elser. He was arrested while attempting to illegally cross the Swiss border on the night of the incident. According to an official communiqué, "After the assassination attempt on November 8, the head of the political police, Himmler, immediately took various measures to apprehend the culprit, closing the borders of various countries and strictly investigating suspicious individuals. Among them, a person named Elser, 36 years old, a resident of Munich, was detained. According to the results of the investigation and interrogation by the expert committee, it was determined that Elser was involved in the assassination plan. Although he initially denied it, he fully confessed on the 14th, admitting it without hesitation. It is said that this plan had been in preparation for a long time and was originally intended to be installed in September 1938, but it failed. In August 1939, an explosion chamber was created. A week before the meeting, Elser repeatedly tried to install a timer, but he was not successful until October 4. Elser then left Munich and wanted to report to his instigator in Switzerland, but for some reason, he returned to Munich on the afternoon of the 7th and entered the cellar to check whether the mechanism he had installed was perfect. He tested it many times that night, and the next morning (October 8), Elser took a car to the Swiss border after breakfast, trying to cross the border that night, but he was arrested. According to Elser's confession, the instigator was a British intelligence agency contact named Strasser. Several people have been arrested in connection with this matter. Details are yet to be announced." (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – The news that the culprit in the Munich bombing case on November 8 was arrested was described this morning by German newspapers in extremely vivid language and published with large headlines to draw readers' attention to the fact that the arrested culprit was employed by British intelligence and that Otto Strasser was the mastermind. The front pages of all newspapers published photos of the culprit "Elser Georg" and the head of the British intelligence agency's Western European Bureau, "Best," and Captain "Stevens," to attract readers' attention and interest. The German people unanimously praised the police for their swift cracking of the case, and street talk showed relief. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Stockholm – After the German official communiqué announced the news that the conspirator in the Munich bombing case had been arrested, Swedish people were very excited when they heard about it. This morning, newspapers published the news in a prominent position, praising the German police for their swift handling of the matter, as the case was solved only two weeks after the incident occurred. Newspapers paid special attention to the background of the conspiracy, involving people outside Germany (such as Otto Strasser). (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Brussels – The news that the conspirator in the Munich bombing case had been arrested was broadcast to France by radio last night, followed by the news that the mastermind had confessed, giving the French public the opportunity to hear the news. Political circles in Paris were surprised and unhappy when they heard the news, believing that the German secret agents released this news with the intention of attacking British intelligence. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

London – The British Foreign Office issued a statement last night, saying that the German government's statement claiming that two British people were among the culprits in the Munich hotel bombing case was "incomprehensible." The German government's statement first mentioned that a German person planted a bomb under a pillar of the hotel, and then said that this person was arrested while trying to escape into Switzerland, and then mentioned that two British people were arrested on the German-Dutch border. These two events are not related. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – The National Socialist Party's special forces announced last night that the culprit in the Munich hotel bombing case was arrested on November 8 and has confessed. It is said that the person who carried out this unsuccessful assassination was named Elser, 36 years old, and lived in Munich. It is said that there were a total of three accomplices in this case, two of whom were members of the British intelligence agency. Elser was arrested on the day of the bombing attempt while trying to cross the German border to Switzerland. Elser confessed on November 14. It is said that Elser had been preparing for the implementation of this plan for several weeks, starting with burying a bomb under a pillar of the Bürgerbräukeller, causing it to explode after one hundred and forty-four hours (six days), but Hitler left earlier than originally planned, causing the plan to fail. When the German special forces officially announced the arrest of these three people, they also slandered the British intelligence agency as the mastermind of this matter, and the illegal anti-National Socialist Party organization "Black Front" as the organization in charge of this conspiracy. A large number of other suspects have also been arrested. A leader of the British intelligence agency in Western Europe named "Best" and a person named "Stevens" were arrested while trying to cross the German border into the Netherlands. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – The German official news agency stated that a person named Elser, 36 years old, has now admitted to being involved in the Munich bombing case. This person was about to cross the border into Switzerland on the night of the bombing, but was detained. Initially, he tried his best to deny everything, but then he admitted that he had this plan a year ago. He worked in a Munich cellar for a short time for several weeks. During this time, he secretly placed a time bomb that would explode in six days in the pillar of the cellar wall. The person who funded the hiring was the British secret agency, and the initiator of this plan was Strasser, the leader of the anti-Nazi Black Shirt Front, who was known for his fierce opposition to Hitler. According to Strasser, he recently told people in Paris that after the Munich bombing, he was ordered by the Swiss authorities to leave the country within four hours because Germany accused him of being the mastermind of the bombing and demanded his extradition. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London – The British Foreign Office claimed that Berlin's statement yesterday that Elser, the key criminal in the Munich cellar bombing case, had been arrested and that he admitted that he was funded by the British secret agency was incomprehensible. The British government and any of its agencies did not know this arrested German. According to news from the Berlin News Agency, the German police had arrested this person the day after the bombing and interrogated him for a long time. It was only now that they released the news that he was funded by the British. Even this point should allow discerning people to assess its truthfulness. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – Officials here announced last night that British intelligence activities in Western Europe, with its intelligence department based in The Hague, were attempting to carry out conspiracy work in Germany. The British intelligence department believed that there must be revolutionary figures in Germany who opposed the party, government, and military, and wanted to contact them to organize them and attack the interior of Germany. It is understood that the British intelligence department provided them with radio transmitters and receivers to maintain contact with them. On November 9, two key members of the British Western European intelligence department, Stevens and Best, attempted to cross into Germany near Venlo, Netherlands, and were caught by German police and have been taken to a police station prison.

### Slovak Prime Minister Expresses Political Views – Reaffirms Friendship with Germany

Bratislava – The Prime Minister of the independent state of Slovakia, Dr. Tuka, yesterday delivered a speech to Parliament outlining the political views of the new cabinet, solemnly reaffirming the friendship between Germany and Slovakia.

In the future, any foreign control over the Slovak people must be eliminated, but the government will not implement policies of abuse or oppression against different ethnic groups within the country. Tuka also stated that the unemployment problem has been solved. As for Slovakia's foreign policy, it does not intend to sacrifice the rights and interests of any country or nation to expand its own.

### Rumors Spread That German Troops Are Concentrating on the Hungarian Border – Plan to Pass Through to Attack Romania

London – According to a dispatch from the "News Chronicle's" special correspondent in Budapest, reliable news from Prague claims that more than seventy thousand fully armed German troops are now concentrated in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It is widely believed that Germany soon intends to pass through Hungary to attack Romania. Rumors are rife in Budapest that Italy has promised that if Hungary is attacked by the Soviet Union or Germany, Italy will definitely intervene to support Hungary. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Explains Policy – Holds Determination to Maintain Independence – Maintains Amity with Neighboring Countries

Budapest – At the afternoon session of the House of Representatives, Foreign Minister Csáky attended and delivered an important speech explaining Hungary's current foreign policy, stating, "The independence and sovereignty that our country should enjoy in military, economic, and diplomatic terms must be maintained. We have sufficient patience to quietly await the arrival of the opportunity. Where the national interest lies, we often remain silent for the time being. However, we are always prepared to fight to complete our historical mission, even if it means fighting to the last person. German Chancellor Hitler once said, "Germany has no definite borders." For us, we only need to maintain a firm attitude and be prepared to act at any time, and we do not need to fear anyone or anything." Furthermore, our country has good relations with Italy and is also willing to improve relations with Yugoslavia. We welcome the increasing strength of Yugoslavia. We are watching the development of the situation in Bulgaria with great sympathy. As for Romania, our country has already taken action to clarify relations between the two countries. In the future, it will only be up to the Romanian government to make more efforts, and it will not be difficult to promote friendly relations. Although the Romanian authorities' recent statements have not been entirely satisfactory, for the sake of peace, our country is still prepared to cooperate with all countries to promote the establishment of a neutral group of countries in the Balkan Peninsula. However, there are two preconditions for this matter: (1) This group must not be used to oppose any third country; (2) All disputes between the participating countries must first be resolved. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Romania Expresses Determination to Fight – To Maintain Existing Borders

Bucharest – A certain important person here stated today that Romania is now willing to assist in the formation of a neutral Balkan group but does not understand that Romania must be prepared to change its borders. Such suggestions are regarded as a step towards establishing a neutral group. Romania has repeatedly stated that it will rather fight to maintain its existing borders. According to news here, although Italian diplomacy is very active, aiming to form a Balkan group, its only achievement now is the exchange of notes between Italy and Greece, attempting to dispel Greece's doubts about Italy's intentions. Although the Balkan countries have taken exploratory actions, political circles say that there is no hope of substantial progress for the time being. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Romania Agrees to Supply Livestock to Germany – Only Achievement of Commercial Negotiations

Bucharest – The Romanian government has agreed to supply Germany with 30,000 head of cattle and 30,000 head of pigs before 1940. This is the first success of the negotiations between the German commercial delegation and the Romanian government. However, negotiations on other matters have not yet produced concrete results. The issue of supplying additional gasoline to Germany seems to have reached a stalemate. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### France and Italy to Sign Agreement Soon – France Alienates Italian-German Relations – Conceding Interests in African Territories

London – According to news received today from neutral sources, a Franco-Italian agreement will be signed soon. After the agreement is signed, the hope of Italy maintaining neutrality will greatly increase. It is reported that in order to take into account the current Italian-German alliance, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will not sign a formal treaty with France, including the current Franco-Italian reconciliation. However, he is finding ways to implement the agreement. It is widely believed that the agreement will grant Italy full facilities in the port of Djibouti (French Somaliland in Africa), or lease the port to Italy for 99 years. France plans to transfer a large portion of the shares of the railway from the Ethiopian capital to Djibouti to Italy. Italy will also obtain one-third of the shares of the Suez Canal Company and a portion of the company's board of directors. The disposal of the port of Tunis in French West Africa will be the biggest obstacle to negotiations between the two countries. It is widely believed that Italy and France should enjoy cultural opportunities in Tunis, such as using both languages and establishing schools. France may allow Italy to participate in a portion of the political power in Tunis, but the Tunis naval base will still be completely under French control and remain for French military use. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Anti-British Flags Discovered Again on the Streets of Beiping – Japanese Side Takes the Opportunity to Exploit the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions – Chinese Passing Through Obstacles Are Extorted

A letter from the "North China Daily News" in Beiping, dated November 13, stated that in recent days, anti-British posters and flags have reappeared on the streets of Beiping, which is somewhat surprising, as less than two weeks ago, the anti-British posters on public buildings had been removed. Even the large Chinese characters "Down with Britain" written on Tiananmen Square in the Forbidden City, equipped with electric lights that shone brightly at night, had also been removed. This move was either due to instructions from Tokyo or due to

Internal Disagreements Among Japanese Authorities

As a result, the anti-British movement here seemed to have subsided, and the Chinese who supported the anti-British movement had lost interest. However, there may be a third reason: the "Anti-British Association" is severely lacking in funds, which is an open secret. The association constantly wastes large sums of money, holding banquets and "discussing the necessary measures to be taken." It is also rumored that the amount of funds embezzled is quite large, so that even the Japanese who control this movement, although they have "Federal Reserve" banknotes that are inexhaustible, are ultimately furious and have reduced the association's monthly subsidy for anti-British activities from 20,000 yuan to a meager 500 yuan. It is no surprise that a "spontaneous anti-British movement" no longer arouses the interest of the Chinese. Some observers believe that the sudden reappearance of anti-British posters is because the association printed a large number of posters when funds were sufficient, and now that they have been printed, they decided to use them rather than discard them. Whether this is the real reason or whether Japanese policy has changed again will become clear in the coming weeks. However, the

Anti-British Movement in Tianjin Has Not Relaxed

The world is already well aware of the "blockade" of the British Concession in Tianjin. However, there has been little news of the "blockade" in recent days. In fact, it is rare to hear of stripping and slapping, but the difficulties and other minor troubles imposed on those passing through the obstacles are as bad as ever. There seems to be a localized reason for this, as the restrictions imposed on entering and exiting the British and French Concessions in Tianjin have now become a "illegal trade" with great profits. It is heard that the police in front of the obstacles extort tolls from Chinese people and vehicles entering and exiting the concessions, and it is heard that

Up to 10,000 Yuan Can Be Obtained Daily

And some estimates reach 50,000 yuan. Chinese people passing through the obstacles are charged a few cents per person, and those carrying vegetables or other food into the concession are charged one yuan per trip, and the more you are willing to pay, the faster you will be allowed to pass. When a certain Chinese was searched in the "inspection shed," a certain policeman frankly asked him how much he would pay before being allowed to pass, and said, "We have to calculate the amount of money we have collected." Also, a certain Chinese drove an empty truck and waited quietly to pass through the obstacles. The police ordered him to pay 50 yuan in total. The driver refused, and the police ordered the car to turn around and drive behind a line of vehicles waiting to pass. When the driver was about to drive backwards, another policeman lowered the price, demanding four yuan, and allowed the car to pass. This is clearly not a "uniform" business. It can be seen that trucks loaded with goods were extorted as much as 300 yuan before they were allowed to pass through the obstacles.

River Traffic Is Also Extorted

A certain British company had to pay Japanese military police 250 yuan before it was allowed to load some goods onto a barge to be carried downstream. With profits to be made in front of the obstacles, anyone who believes that the obstacles will be removed soon is too optimistic. A spokesman for the Japanese army in Tianjin replied to questions from foreign reporters about when the obstacles would be removed, saying that there was no sign of it. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising to hear this. When foreign reporters questioned him about illegal charges, the spokesman replied, "I am not aware of these situations, but I will investigate and take necessary steps if they are true." If such an investigation is conducted, Chinese witnesses will undoubtedly be eager to testify. As a result of this practically open extortion, the prices of food in the two concessions are naturally much higher than outside the concessions. Although there is a large amount of coal stored on the left bank, it is not allowed to be transported across the river, resulting in a

Severe Shortage of Coal in the Concessions

If the Japanese side were to issue a responsible statement clarifying why the blockade continues, its statement would be of interest. However, if the Japanese do not provide a satisfactory explanation, the unanimous opinion of foreigners in Tianjin seems to be quite reasonable, that is, the reason why this absurd blockade is allowed to continue is that it can make great profits.

### Japanese Troops in Huaiying Repeatedly Attacked by Chinese Troops – Japanese Troops Show Signs of Fatigue

A dispatch from Dongtai stated that after the Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu captured Huai'an, Baoying, and other counties, they were repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops ×××. The Japanese troops in Huai'an and Baoying have shown signs of fatigue. On the night of the 27th of last month, two Japanese speedboats in Baoying were destroyed by Chinese troops. Since then, they have not dared to travel casually. On the night of the 2nd of this month, Chinese troops attacked Huai'an again, killing many puppet troops and capturing eight puppet troops, eight broadswords, and several puppet flags. The Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to leave the city to harass. However, on the 9th, two small Japanese warships and more than ten speedboats, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers with two cannons, sailed north from Gaoyou, with three planes as cover to reinforce Baoying. They were ambushed and severely attacked by Chinese troops at Liujiabao. In this battle, three speedboats were sunk, one small warship was damaged, 30 to 40 Japanese soldiers were killed, and two were captured, along with two rifles and a large amount of ammunition and documents. The remaining Japanese troops fled. Several Chinese soldiers were killed and wounded. Chinese troops immediately attacked Baoying City. Many Japanese and puppet agencies in the city were burned down. After four hours of street fighting, 40 to 50 Japanese and puppet troops were killed and a number of troops were captured. At dawn on the 10th, the Chinese troops safely withdrew, with more than a dozen soldiers wounded.

### Dinghai Guerrilla Force Launches Night Attack on Daishan Island – Both Sides Suffer Casualties – Japanese Troops Rush to Reinforce

A dispatch from Ningbo stated that mobile warfare occurs from time to time on Daishan Island in the Zhoushan Islands of eastern Zhejiang. On October 28, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrilla force stationed in Dinghai, led by Wang Xiaonan, staff officer of the Dinghai County Anti-Japanese Command (former chief of the Daishan Police Department), took sailboats and crossed the sea to launch a surprise attack on Daishan at night. The Japanese Third Fleet's Marine Corps Hehe unit, consisting of more than 100 people stationed there, upon hearing the news, divided into two routes and set off towards Dabeifeng Mountain. At 3:00 a.m. on the 31st, the two sides encountered each other in Changkengchang, and a contact battle ensued. After six hours of fighting, with a distance of only 600 to 700 meters, the results were eight Japanese soldiers killed, fifteen wounded, and seven guerrilla fighters sacrificed and three wounded. Wang Xiaonan was injured due to being at the forefront and has been sent to a certain place for medical treatment. The Japanese army was extremely panicked after being attacked. Rear Admiral Hehe, commander of the Third Destroyer Fleet, took a ship to Daishan to reinforce.

### Japanese Troops in Changshu Invade Yangshe, Jiangyin – Chinese Troops Resist Strongly

A dispatch from Jiangyin stated that at 7:00 a.m. on the 16th, Japanese troops searched Yangshe in the eastern countryside of Jiangyin from Langgan Bridge and Beigua in Changshu. They encountered Chinese troops at the boundary of Jieqiao in Yangshe Shuli Xu, and fought for two hours. The Chinese troops then shifted their position to Yanghui, and a fierce battle broke out again. Then, Japanese planes flew in and dropped more than a dozen bombs, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing and wounding one child each. In order to avoid sacrifice, the Chinese troops shifted to Huashi. It is now reported that after the Japanese planes bombed Yangshe, they flew to Huashi, Zhutang, and Houcheng to bomb indiscriminately. It is reported that a bomb hit Huashi Elementary School, killing more than 40 elementary school students.

### Kato Visits and Meets; American Ambassador Travels North Last Night; Kato's Visit Was Merely of a Routine Nature; Preliminary Talks Seem to Be Proceeding in Peiping

Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Japanese Special Envoy Kato visited the office of the American Ambassador to China on Jiangxi Road. The two sides met for about half an hour, after which the Japanese Special Envoy left. Afterwards, according to inquiries made by a "New Voice News Agency" reporter with the American Embassy, Special Envoy Kato's meeting with the Ambassador was only of a routine nature, as this was the first time the two men had met. However, according to news from Tokyo, the meeting between the American Ambassador and the Japanese Special Envoy yesterday touched upon various issues between the United States and Japan in China, and further discussions will continue in the future.

Will Continue Talks in Peiping

The English-language "China Press" stated that Japanese Special Envoy Kato visited the American Consulate this morning (22nd) to meet with American Ambassador to China, Johnson, for a courtesy visit. It is said that these two diplomats are old friends, having both served in Peiping a few years ago. This morning's meeting lasted about 20 minutes. It is not certain whether they discussed issues related to China during that time. However, it is generally believed that the two men had preliminary talks and that subsequent talks will continue in Peiping.

American Alumni Luncheon

After arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing, American Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, at noon yesterday, accepted an invitation from the American Alumni Association to attend its "Monthly Luncheon." Acting Consul Lockhart, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Peiping, was present to accompany him. Others in attendance included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, Colonel Fegen, Commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, and former president of the association, Hamel. The current chairman, Major Betts, delivered a welcoming speech. After the meeting, the Ambassador returned to the Cathay Hotel to rest.

Kato Reveals China's Determination to Resist

The day before yesterday, Kato visited British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to inquire about his impressions of his trip to Chongqing. In a conversation with Japanese reporters, he stated, "Regarding the current situation in Chongqing, it is said to be quite resilient and there is no consideration of peace..." This proves that China is determined to resist until victory is achieved.

According to the English-language "China Press," Kato may continue talks with the British and Italian Ambassadors in Shanghai before heading north in a few weeks.

Took Ship Last Night to Qinhuangdao

Johnson was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th, but he has now changed his plans and took another ship, the Josephine Justsen, belonging to the Kailan Mining Administration, to Qinhuangdao last night. After arriving, Johnson will stay briefly and is expected to arrive in Peiping before Christmas to reunite with his family.

### Japan Sends Kenji Kodama to Shanghai to Intensify Economic Aggression, Attempting to Encompass China's Wealth to Reverse Domestic Economic Decline

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, its economic panic has become increasingly acute. In order to rescue its collapsing situation, it is actively carrying out aggressive activities in China and excluding the interests of various countries in China. Recently, in order to strengthen control over the economy of Central China, the Japanese government has sent Kenji Kodama to Shanghai to discuss "economic cooperation" with the "new government." Details are as follows:

Japan's Economy at the End of Its Rope

Japan is a country with scarce resources and its economic strength was originally very fragile. Since the warlords launched the war of aggression against China, due to the huge war expenditures, the country has been issuing public bonds and levying heavy taxes, exhausting all means of exploitation. This has caused industry and commerce to slump and the people to complain. Recently, with the expansion of the war zone and the deeper involvement, the economic situation has become increasingly desperate. At this moment, before the total collapse arrives, in order to make a final struggle to reverse the crisis, it has no choice but to carry out a further aggressive effort in the occupied areas of China.

Kodama Returns to Shanghai for Further Activities

Kenji Kodama is a Japanese business tycoon and a well-known economic aggressor. Before the August 13th Incident, he came to China under the guise of "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" to organize the "Sino-Japanese Economic Association." After the outbreak of the war, the association became virtually defunct, and Kodama then proceeded to organize the "Central China Development Corporation" to carry out aggressive activities. In December of last year, he was sent to China by the Japanese government to conspire to undermine Chinese finances, but because China's financial foundation was solid, the attempt ultimately failed, and he returned to Japan. It is now learned that Kenji Kodama was dispatched again for the second time and arrived in Shanghai on the "Taiyo Maru" at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (21st), landing at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou and staying at the Broadway Mansions near the Garden Bridge.

Attempting to Intensify Economic Aggression

According to inquiries made by a Da Guang News Agency reporter with foreigners, Kenji Kodama's main purpose this time is to discuss a concrete plan for "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" with the "new central government" that is being planned and established. At the same time, he will strengthen the "Central China Development Corporation" and actively carry out further aggressive activities, attempting to encompass China's wealth to supplement its domestic poverty and reverse the trend of economic collapse. It is said that after a brief stay in Shanghai, he will also go to Nanjing and various parts of Central China to inspect and arrange his new plundering plan.

### Exports of National Cotton Fabrics Gradually Decline; Inconvenient Transportation and Increased Freight Costs; Decreased by One-Third Compared to Last Year

In recent years, Chinese industrial and commercial circles have been constantly working hard to research and develop various domestically produced daily necessities, and the quality and designs are all above standard, comparable to imported goods. Therefore, the import trade figures of the customs have also gradually declined, while exports have increased year by year, with the largest sales volume to the Nanyang area, where overseas Chinese account for the vast majority. Cotton fabrics are also a major commodity sold to South China and the Nanyang Islands. Before the war, due to smooth transportation, sales increased daily. After the war, transportation was obstructed, resulting in fewer South China merchants coming to Shanghai to purchase goods. Various manufacturers have been trying to find ways to maintain the transportation to prevent the market from being interrupted. Since the outbreak of the European war, transportation has become historically difficult, and freight costs have increased several times. Overseas Chinese also respect frugality and are eager to raise donations to contribute to their motherland. Therefore, everything related to daily necessities is simplified. According to a survey of the industry, the export of cotton fabrics to Nanyang this year is less than two-thirds of the previous year.

### American Community Holds Thanksgiving Today; Reading of President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation

Today is the American Thanksgiving holiday, and Americans around the world will celebrate it warmly. More than 800 Americans in this city are scheduled to hold a commemoration at the British Church on Jiujiang Road from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, led by Mrs. Macdonald, chairwoman of the Thanksgiving Society. American Judge Hamid, and American Consul Lockhart, acting in place of Gauss, will read President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation in public. Other women's groups will also hold separate ceremonies. The content of the Thanksgiving Proclamation is said to be a blessing for the health and happiness of Americans, and a hope for the arrival of peace in 1940. The American Thanksgiving holiday is the last Thursday of November each year, commemorating the winter of 1620 when a group of British immigrants first landed in Plymouth Bay in America, creating a British colonial territory on the North American continent.

### U.S. Marine Corps Commander Ordered to Return Home; Fegen to Leave for the U.S. Next Month

According to the "North-China Daily News," it was learned yesterday (21st) that Colonel Fegen, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, has received orders from the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington to return home after serving for a little over a year. He will depart for the United States on the President Grant on December 6th with his wife. It is expected that after Colonel Fegen leaves Shanghai, Lieutenant Colonel Murray, the executive officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, will temporarily serve as commander until Colonel Baker arrives. Colonel Baker has been ordered to come to Shanghai in January next year to take over as commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment. Colonel Fegen is well-known among foreigners and in the sports community in this city.

### Puppet Police Dissatisfied with Treatment; Many Have Recently Deserted and Fled; At Least Eight Cases This Week; Foreigners Reported the Matter Yesterday Morning

Since the puppet municipal government decided to infringe on the police power of the Shanghai Western Roads Extra-Settlement Area, it has dispatched a large number of puppet police to patrol the roads, forcibly occupying positions and managing traffic. According to puppet propaganda, there are already 3,000 puppet police in Western Shanghai. Although this is actually an exaggeration, the number is not small. However, the "remuneration" received by these puppet police is extremely meager, only 16 yuan per month per person. At this time of high prices and high cost of living, it is difficult to maintain life. Moreover, the puppet police who have intruded into the roads outside the settlement are standing side by side with the Chinese police of the concession, and their uniforms and equipment are very different. Therefore, most of the puppet police are tired of this "job", and no less than hundreds of them have "deserted" and fled. According to foreign sources, at least eight puppet police on the roads outside the settlement have fled this week, and one of them occurred yesterday morning, witnessed by a foreigner, Mr. Kern. Mr. Kern lives at No. 3, Lane 310, Yanping Road. When he got up at 7:30 yesterday morning, he suddenly saw a rifle and a police cap in the garden, and was very surprised. He put on his clothes and went into the garden to investigate carefully, and saw three bullets in the barrel of the rifle, and a puppet police mark on the cap. He then realized that another puppet police officer had abandoned his gun and fled.

### Rice Prices May Return to Normal; Management Committee Reorders Merchants to Register; Large Quantities of National Rice and Tribute Rice to Arrive Soon

The previous surge in rice prices in this city was entirely caused by speculators manipulating for profit. Therefore, once the various groups strictly suppressed them, and the rice industry vigorously prevented short selling and buying, the price of rice plummeted. According to statistics, the price of rice has fallen by more than five yuan in the past three days, and it fell by about half a yuan yesterday. Powerful groups and influential people in this city are discussing a proper method to prevent rice prices from going off track again and promote their continued decline. It is expected that a new method will be implemented within a few days. After that, rice prices in this city should be able to eliminate unreasonable conditions and eliminate social hidden worries.

Management Committee Orders Merchants to Register

The Rice Market Management Committee had previously stipulated that all merchants who trade in the market must register in advance. This method, once implemented, has two effective points: (1) There is statistics to check, which can prevent short selling and buying. (2) When disputes occur in transactions, this registration can be used as a basis for mediation. However, some merchants are deliberately unwilling to register and trade in the market. Therefore, the Management Committee yesterday reordered all merchants to register in advance before they can sell or buy in the market. Otherwise, if there is a dispute during the transaction, in addition to not mediating, they will also be severely punished.

Suichang National Rice Has Already Been Shipped

Recently, 7,000 to 8,000 bags of national rice are transported to the rice market every day. The transfer certificates for various japonica and indica rice from Wuhu, Changshu, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Songjiang and other rice-producing areas to Shanghai by trucks have also been arranged for the second time. It is reported that a large batch of indica rice will be transported to Shanghai in the near future, transported from North and South ports such as Kunshan. Currently, the price of rice in Wuxi is 17 yuan per stone, and 19 yuan in Changshu. The first batch of 20,000 stones has been shipped out by Sino-Japanese merchants in half for sales.

Large Quantities of Tribute Rice to Arrive Soon

The various rice firms in this city have jointly entrusted the French company, Dufaure, to telegraph Saigon to order a huge amount of foreign rice, a total of 24,000 bags, which is 2,400 tons. All transactions have been telegraphed and completed, loaded and shipped. It is scheduled to arrive in early next month (December). The selling price is 30 yuan and 6 jiao, calculated at 198 catties, which is 5 or 6 yuan lower than the current highest price of white rice (national rice). Once this batch of tribute rice arrives and participates in market transactions, rice prices in Shanghai will continue to fall. It is reported that various rice firms are currently in contact to make a second order to increase the stock of rice in Shanghai.

### Two Chinese Detectives to Be Released Soon; Chief Inspector Bowen Expresses

According to the English-language "China Press," Chief Inspector Bowen of the Public Concession Police stated to reporters this morning (22nd) that the two Chinese detectives of the Police Department currently detained by the Japanese authorities are expected to be released soon.

Bureau's Negotiations Have Not Been Replied

According to "Yu Lin Bao," Inspector Aggerborg of the Public Concession Police Department, along with two Chinese detectives and one female inspector, conducted an inspection on Rue Robert last Sunday and were arrested by Japanese military police. Aggerborg and the female inspector were released on the same day, but the two Chinese detectives were still detained. Chief Inspector Bowen of the Police Department has sent a letter to Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai, requesting the release of the two Chinese detectives, and the Municipal Council also negotiated with the Japanese Consulate General yesterday. The nature of the negotiations has not been disclosed, and it has not been possible to find out whether a formal protest has been sent out. The "Shanghai Times" also stated that the protests made by Chief Inspector Bowen of the Police Department and the Municipal Council to Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police, and the Japanese Consulate General, respectively, had not been replied to yesterday (21st).

Puppet "Mayor" Forbids Arrest of Foreigners

According to the English-language "China Press," "Mayor of Shanghai" Fu Xiaoan has issued an order instructing the police of the "Municipal Government" not to arrest foreigners. In the event of a serious accident, the nationality of the foreigner should be determined and handed over to the authorities of their own country for handling.

### Restrictions on Remittances from British Malaya Have Been Changed

Since the governments of various regions in British Malaya implemented restrictions on remittances and imports, the remittances of overseas Chinese in Nanyang to their home country and the export of domestic agricultural and industrial goods have been greatly affected. The Chinese Consulate General in Singapore has repeatedly negotiated with the British Straits Settlements government. It is now learned that the British government has changed its approach to the remittances of overseas Chinese and adopted a more lenient approach. The maximum amount of remittance allowed for each overseas Chinese per time has been extended to 500 Straits dollars. According to the current rate, 15 Straits dollars and 7 jiao and 5 fen can be converted into 100 legal tender, and 54 Straits dollars can be converted into 100 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, the remittance of various disaster relief funds raised by overseas Chinese groups and individuals to their home country is not restricted and is given generous accommodation. As for the cancellation of restrictions on the import of goods, it is still being negotiated. After the war, overseas Chinese in Nanyang are enthusiastically promoting the use of domestic goods. If restricted, it will have a significant impact on the domestic goods industry.

### Most of the Exchange Equalization Fund's Foreign Exchange Has Been Recovered; The Market's Demand for Foreign Exchange Has Decreased Sharply; Japanese Merchants' Buying and Selling Steps Are Not Consistent

The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has gone from tight to loose. This change was largely initiated by Hong Kong, which helped legal tender. Due to the exchange restrictions in the British territory, they sold off English currency on the Shanghai market on a large scale. In addition, remittances from the Straits Settlements were also substantial, with the same motivation. Indochina and Manila also made considerable contributions, which was due to commercial needs. Local merchants, in view of the changing financial market environment, gradually recalled their initial trust in legal tender, believing that the time to recover legal tender had matured. If they did not do so now, they would regret it too late.

The Exchange Equalization Committee Replenishes the Fund

After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee tried its best to stabilize foreign exchange in various parts of the country, although it did not maintain the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai on the surface, it actually valued it and made use of the opportunity to recover most of the previously consumed foreign exchange in order to replenish the foreign exchange fund. When it was supplied in the past, the price was around eight and a half pence. Now on the Shanghai market, the association is in the position of buyer. It is heard that this month, it has been constantly absorbing foreign exchange at 5 pence 4375, 46875, and 5 and a half pence.

Trade Improves, Demand Decreases

Since the ban on the import and re-export of luxury goods and non-essential goods to non-occupied areas, foreign trade has improved, and Shanghai Customs has turned into a surplus. Importers in the Shanghai black market foreign exchange have to reduce their demand for foreign exchange. Speculators, in view of the increasingly loose trend of foreign exchange, and the fact that the Equalization Committee's absorption of foreign exchange cannot be explored, the steps of Japanese merchants' banks are also inconsistent. There are both buyers and sellers. The Yokohama Specie Bank is in the position of buyer, while other Japanese banks are mostly sellers. Therefore, those who purchase foreign exchange are cautious. The loose market situation is not accidental.

### Gangsters Hide in Western Shanghai; Robberies Double

Last month, the Police Department of the Municipal Council handled a total of 2,673 criminal cases, an increase of 202 cases compared to September. At the same time, 2,439 criminals were arrested. In addition, there were 176 criminals who committed crimes in the previous months, and 29 criminals arrested on behalf of the authorities outside the border were also quickly arrested. A total of 49 people committed crimes using firearms, and 15 firearms, along with a large number of ammunition, were seized. Among the major crimes recorded, there were eight murders, seven attempted murders, two homicides, and 87 armed robberies. The number of robberies occurring in "B" police district more than doubled compared to September, which was obviously caused by gangs of gangsters hiding in the roads outside the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Area. The police reserve team has been dispatched twice in succession. The cause of the incident was gunfire fighting.

### Ningbo Market Opens Early

According to people from Ningbo, the Ningbo market has become very prosperous due to the smooth navigation and frequent passenger traffic. The hotel industry is ten times more prosperous than in the past. Shops are also open for business as usual during the day. Banks, which were originally scheduled to start operating at 6:00 PM, have now opened earlier at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Most residents still live in rural areas because of the convenient transportation between the city and the countryside, so they go out early and return late on weekdays. Air raid warnings are posted everywhere.

### New Commander of Japanese Naval Landing Force Arrives in Shanghai

Major General Shihao Nobu, Commander of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Force stationed in Shanghai, was transferred by the Japanese Navy Ministry on the 15th of this month to the Wu Military Port Garrison. Major General Takeda Seiji was appointed to succeed him. It is now learned that Mr. Takeda arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 2:15 PM the day before yesterday (21st) to take office.

### Japanese Ship Sunk in England; Shanghai Passengers Safe; Son of Famous Educator Jones; News Received He Has Escaped Safely

According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese ship Terukuni Maru was sunk yesterday (21st) a few miles off the east coast of England. The only passenger on board who boarded in Shanghai was an Englishman named Bart Jones, 18 and a half years old, the son of Jones, a famous educator in Shanghai. Bart Jones left Shanghai five years ago

To Study in Edinburgh

After studying at the University of Edinburgh for one year, he took the Trans-Siberian Railway to Shanghai for summer vacation. He then took the Terukuni Maru because he could not return to England by the same route. Bart Jones's parents have received news that their son has escaped safely. The Terukuni Maru carried a total of 28 passengers

Including Several People

Who boarded in Hong Kong and Singapore. There were 180 crew members. The ship was a motor ship and one of the best among the ships of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company that sailed between Japan and England. Its fares were also higher than the older ships. If the Terukuni Maru had not sunk, this may have been

The Last Time

Sailing to Europe, because the Japanese Mail Steamship Company had intended to change the ship to South America. The Terukuni Maru left Shanghai on October 3, left Gibraltar on November 12, and arrived in Downs, the Strait of England, on November 19. It was about to sail to London when it unexpectedly struck a mine and sank.

### Fundraising for Refugee Cotton Clothes; Variety Show; Posters Distributed Throughout the City; Receipts Must Be Obtained for Ticket Payments

The fundraising committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group has scheduled a variety show to be held at the Xinsheng Stage from the 27th of this month for a total of four days, eight sessions day and night. The association has sent letters to all sectors to request assistance in selling tickets, which are divided into three types: honorary tickets for 10 yuan, blessing tickets for 5 yuan, and charity tickets for 2 yuan. They can be purchased at any time from the association's office in the Xingye Building on Jiangxi Road (telephone 18533). It is also scheduled to exchange tickets for any day or night seat ticket from the association from the 25th of this month to avoid congestion. For the sake of widespread publicity, the association distributed posters for raising cotton clothes to major hotels throughout the city yesterday morning, asking them to post them on their behalf. Regarding the issue of paying for tickets, the association solemnly declared that all sectors that pay for tickets will be issued receipts by the association as proof. Please do not pay without a receipt.

### German Goods Detained in Haiphong; French Consulate Handles Visa Procedures; Deadline Approaching Tomorrow; Owners Urged to Hurry; Shanghai-Kunming Rail Transport Restored

German goods purchased by Chinese merchants in Haiphong before September 3rd. Since the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent people to Shanghai to negotiate a visa plan with the French Consul General in Shanghai, the Vietnamese government can still transport goods purchased before the war in October. However, the relevant parties are urged to complete the visa procedures at the French Consulate and send them to Haiphong for picking up and shipping. A reporter from "New Voice News Agency" learned from the Sino-French Express Transportation Company that the French Consulate General in Shanghai has set the deadline for handling visas at 5 PM on the 24th of this month. The owners are urged to complete the visa before this date. Regarding the joint transport of goods on the Shanghai-Kunming line, transporting from Shanghai to Saigon and transferring to Kunming takes only 20 days. Last month, several sections of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway were destroyed by mountain floods, and the train service was suspended, causing cargo transportation to be blocked. It is now learned from Saigon that the tracks have been repaired and officially opened to traffic on the 13th of this month. All remaining passenger and cargo have been loaded and shipped. In the future, passenger and cargo to Kunming can still arrive according to the original schedule.

### Sixteen German Ships on the Far East Sea; Thirteen in Shanghai and Kobe, Three in Dalian; More Than a Thousand Crew Members Have Nothing to Do

According to the "Continental News," after the outbreak of the European war on September 3, German ships on the Far East sea ventured to avoid British and French warships and sailed to neutral ports for shelter. No German ships in the Pacific were captured by the Allied countries. Today, there are a total of thirteen German ships in Shanghai, Kobe, and Dalian, with approximately 910 crew members. They only clean the ships, keep them clean, and listen to radio messages from their home country. Among these thirteen German ships

Anchored in Shanghai

Only the cargo ship Ramses of the Henningsen & Co. According to Henningsen & Co. personnel, the Ramses is a relatively new ship, weighing 7,983 tons, built in Flensburg, Germany, in 1926. The 57 crew members of the ship are still getting paid, but most of them are paid by the relatives of the crew members at the Henningsen & Co. domestic office.

Currently Docked in Kobe

There are three ships each from Henningsen & Co. and North German Lloyd, and one from Rickmers Line. Among them, North German Lloyd's Scharnhorst is the largest German ship that has taken shelter in neutral ports in the Far East. The ship weighs 18,184 tons, was built in 1935, and has a crew of 270. Also docked in Kobe is

North German Lloyd's

Albert, with a crew of fifty, and Leichtenfels, with a crew of sixty. Henningsen & Co.'s three ships are Cormoran, Markenfels, and Burgenland, each with a crew of 50 or 60. The three ships of the North German Lloyd that are taking shelter in Dalian are the cargo ships Fulda (7,744 tons), Augsburg (6,512 tons), and Bremenhaven (5,355 tons).

Henningsen & Co.'s

Two ships, the cargo ships Saarland (6,725 tons) and Hohenfels (7,974 tons). The crew members of these German ships are receiving assistance from local German expatriates in Shanghai, Kobe, and Dalian, and their lives are quite comfortable. They all want to return home to serve, but the shipping companies need them to take care of the ships so that they can resume trade immediately when the war ends. The cargo carried by these thirteen ships has almost all been returned to the shippers.

### Songkou Dredging Lost, Huangpu River Navigation Difficult, Swire and Jinliyuan Wharf Shoals Extend, Large Vessels Unable to Enter and Exit at Low Tide at Songkou

Since November 13th of the year before last, when the Chinese army moved from western Shanghai, the northern and southern urban areas have been occupied by the Japanese army. All public and private property has been seized at will, and more than ten large and small dredgers of the Customs River Dredging Bureau have also been seized by the Japanese army.

As a result, dredging work within the Huangpu River cannot be carried out. It has been two and a half years now, causing the riverbank shoals to gradually extend into the river. Therefore, at the Swire Wharf, Jinliyuan Wharf, and other places, larger ocean-going vessels cannot easily dock at low tide, and those that have docked are also at risk of

being stranded.

It was previously heard that the River Dredging Bureau had repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, but to no avail. The bureau had ordered a new type of large dredger in the United States before the outbreak of the war, specializing in dredging the Shentan and shallow sands outside the Wusongkou. The large dredger was also among those seized. Therefore, in the Yangtze River area outside Wusongkou, there are also many places where sand and mud have risen on the riverbed. According to the shipping industry,

Outside Wusongkou,

at Black Pouet, the water depth was more than forty feet at low tide. Due to years of neglect in dredging, it is now only more than twenty-nine feet at low tide. Therefore, mail ships with a draft of more than thirty feet must wait until high tide to pass through this area. If the shallow sand in this area is not dredged again, navigation may become more difficult.

### Relief Association Fellow Villagers Group Holds, Movie Star Chrysanthemum Competition

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fellow Villagers Group, in order to raise funds for refugee cotton clothing, will hold a chrysanthemum charity sale and disaster relief conference on the seventh floor of the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road. It is scheduled to continue entertaining all Shanghai movie stars at the original site at 4:00 PM today. On the 25th (Saturday) at 4:00 PM, a chrysanthemum auction by movie star colleagues will be held, in the hope of accumulating a little to make a lot, and jointly contributing to the good deed. It is reported that the fellow villagers group has raised more than 100,000 yuan in various donations for refugee relief since its fundraising.

### Siberian High Pressure Advances South, Climate in this City Gradually Turns Cold

Regarding the climate in this port, it was very hot the day before yesterday because a low pressure system passed through north of Shanghai. According to news from the Observatory yesterday, the low pressure system has passed Shanghai and entered the sea between Korea and Japan, at a location of 34 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude. It is continuing to advance northeast. Because the low pressure system passed through Shanghai, the climate was disturbed. The temperature at 9:00 AM yesterday was 55 degrees, while it was 65 degrees the day before yesterday. The lowest temperature before 3:00 PM was only 52 degrees. It is also learned that the high pressure system in Siberia, Russia, has a tendency to advance towards northern China, so the weather in Pingjin and other places is extremely cold.

### Dozens of Sailing Ships on Shanghai-Taiwan Line, Smuggling Tung Oil to Shanghai

Since the Jiaojiang River in Haimen, Zhejiang, was blockaded by the authorities, shipping has long been suspended. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government recently reported that dozens of sailing ships are operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route along the coast of Taizhou, eastern Zhejiang. They secretly transport tung oil and other goods from Taizhou for export, falsely claiming to be "sailing to Ningbo," but actually sailing to Shanghai. The goods they transport back are all prohibited by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, such as kerosene, white sugar, and cloth, which are secretly sold in the inland areas. This kind of illegal trafficking should be investigated and prohibited as soon as possible. Telegrams have been sent to the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Headquarters to instruct all counties to quickly and strictly investigate and secretly prohibit it.

### German National Kills Mistress, Appeals for Reduced Sentence, Sentence Changed to Eight Years

The German national, Hai Maina Lanya, 44 years old, residing at No. 36, Lane 225, Fair Road, used to run a cloth shop in Berlin. Two years ago, he fell in love with a female employee of the shop, Ya Benhai Meisi (also German). In February of this year, Ya also fell in love with a compatriot, Fa Senhua Tuo, and got married. In March, they traveled together from Germany to Italy and took a ship to Shanghai. However, when Ya boarded the ship, she had an argument with Fa and used a long-distance telephone to notify Hai Maina Lanya, saying that she still loved Hai. Hai rushed to Shanghai by ship. Ya followed Fa to Shanghai and rented a house at No. 2, Lane 915, Avenue Joffre. Unexpectedly, the feelings between the two sexes suddenly broke down again, and Fa rented another house in Hongkou. Ya then fell in love with another man. In May, Hai Maina Lanya arrived in Shanghai. Ya entertained him on the first night and they stayed together. Later, Hai repeatedly asked Ya if she was willing to marry him, but did not receive a satisfactory answer. Hai, heartbroken, wrote a letter of "dying together" and hid it in his pocket. On the morning of June 12, he carried a razor and broke into Ya's bedroom, cutting her throat and killing her on the spot. At the same time, he stabbed his own wrist with a knife, hoping to commit suicide, but failed. He was arrested and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for murder. Judge Liao sentenced him to twelve years in prison. Hai refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyers Lu Dingxiong, etc., to appeal to the High Third Branch Court, arguing that he admitted the murder but had realized his past mistakes and requested a lighter sentence. Judge Wu, together with Assessors Chen and Gu, opened a court to hear the case. The judgment was made yesterday afternoon, overturning the original sentence in the case of Hai Maina Lanya's murder and changing the sentence to eight years of imprisonment.

### Liu Rongfu and Wife Sued for Joint Injury by Concubine

Liu Rongfu, a shareholder of Xie Xing Dyeing Workshop at No. 44, Ji Jia Lane, Dapuqiao, and his wife, Liu Zhao, have recently been sued for joint injury in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court by Liu Gu, Liu's concubine (30 years old and from the same village as Liu), who hired lawyer Yu Xiufang, requesting legal investigation. According to the statement, in 1934, the first defendant learned that the plaintiff had some savings, and seduced her in every possible way, saying that his wife was still vacant and that he was willing to marry the plaintiff as his wife, which led to adultery. After living together, he deceived all of the plaintiff's savings under the pretext of jointly opening a shop. In April of last year, the first defendant's wife, the second defendant, came to Shanghai, and the plaintiff realized that she had been deceived. The first defendant repeatedly and earnestly persuaded her, and the plaintiff had no choice but to endure it and retreat to the position of concubine. Unexpectedly, the second defendant was fierce and shrewish, and repeatedly instigated the first defendant to abuse the plaintiff jointly. On the 1st and 3rd of last month, they repeatedly beat the plaintiff, causing injuries. In addition to requesting an injury examination, she sued for legal investigation. According to the statement, the court opened a court yesterday morning to summon them for questioning by Judge Huang Yan. The defendants refused to accept the summons because the plaintiff had made a mistake in the original statement, claiming that their last name was Li, so only the plaintiff and her lawyer were present. After a brief interrogation in court, the plaintiff's agent lawyer was ordered to correct the defendant's surname in court, and then a date was set to summon the defendants to court for interrogation.

ship lease contract,

requesting a judgment for compensation for damages. According to the general meaning of the complaint, Tong Sheng Company, jointly established by the first to eleventh defendants, previously sub-leased the Norwegian merchant ship Randi to the plaintiff through the twelfth defendant as an intermediary, with a fixed monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings, for a period of twelve months from the date of delivery. The lease was signed on March 17 of this year, and the above-mentioned ship was delivered in accordance with the lease at 6:00 AM on April 11. However, not long after, Tong Sheng Company suddenly sent letters on June 10, 23, and 29, claiming that because the company shareholders

had lost all their money,

they requested to terminate the lease and refused to pay the rent. The plaintiff, considering the matter to be a breach of the lease, immediately entrusted a lawyer to negotiate repeatedly. The company suddenly declared bankruptcy, and the manager and responsible persons disappeared. The plaintiff was forced to plead with the Norwegian shipowner repeatedly before being understood, and the plaintiff paid the shipowner 1,250 pounds in damages and a commission of 5,000 national currency as a settlement. It was found that the above-mentioned damages and expenses incurred due to the termination of the contract, together with the plaintiff's profits for ten months at 87 pounds and 10 shillings per month,

totaled

943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, and 75,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, which should be jointly and severally liable for by the shareholders of the company according to law. It was also found that the twelfth defendant, as the contract intermediary, received a huge reward of more than 1,000 yuan per month, and should bear full responsibility for this. It should be ordered that the defendants jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, and 75,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, and a 5% per annum

statutory interest

from the date of the lawsuit until the date of execution, and bear the litigation costs. According to the statement, the court opened the fourth court yesterday afternoon by Judge Chen Can to hear the case. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping and stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, as well as the object of the judgment. Some of the defendants were represented by lawyers Ma Shouhua, Su Fuchou, and Cai Rudong, who appeared in court and presented their defenses. The court also summoned a witness for questioning. The two lawyers debated fiercely for an hour. As a result, because the whereabouts of Liu Zirong, one of the defendants, were unknown, he had to be served by public announcement. There were also those who did not appear in court. The court then adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Finance, Frequent Rumors of Good News, Gold Prices Soar, Tianjin and Hong Kong Gangs Still Have Strong Appetite, Gradually Creating the Highest Closing Price

Yesterday's dark market situation for spot gold followed the foreign exchange market closely. Therefore, the overall situation was first flat and then rose. The buying momentum gradually expanded. Since it was reported that the Soviets and Japanese had started commercial negotiations, speculators had another opportunity to profit. All kinds of empty rumors spread, foreign exchange was tight, and the Tianjin and Hong Kong gangs still had a strong appetite. Market prices rose and it was difficult to fall back. People's hearts in all parties were unanimously upward. Although the securities gang, Defu, sold out in one go halfway, it was ultimately because Baokang's recent appetite was particularly strong. By the afternoon, the highest price even broke through the 3,700 yuan mark. Yesterday's process was as follows: the opening price in the morning was 3,650 yuan, which was no different from the previous day. Later, a certain money exchange industry sold out, and the securities gang, Defu, frequently came to dump goods, so it fell slightly at this time, twice falling to a low of 3,648 yuan. However, soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was reporting soft, and people's hearts were stirred up. The money exchange industry, Baokang, and Tiancheng took the lead in purchasing, and the money exchange industry that had previously sold out also came back in force. The trend was unusually stable, rising by as much as 20 yuan. However, the securities gang came up with a new trick and continued to sell, and another money exchange industry turned to hedging, pressing down a small ten yuan. However, at noon, the buying momentum rose again. A certain silver shop, on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, and a certain silver firm and a certain gold firm, on behalf of the local gang, joined forces to absorb goods. Moreover, because the foreign exchange market also continued to report soft, the closing price was raised to 3,675 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly became tense. The opening price was 3,680 yuan. Then, rumors confused the public, and the buying momentum expanded. A certain money exchange industry and Baokang actually entered another 700 taels of goods in force, surprisingly raising the price to 3,704 yuan. It was the highest closing price of the day. As a result, it soared 54 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume for the whole day was quite strong, with 2,500 to 2,600 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 5 yuan, while the price of customs gold remained flat.

The price of spot gold exceeds the 700 yuan mark. From the beginning of the day, the situation for each bar (ten taels) was stable. Initially, the money exchange industry, Qiantai, sold ten taels to a gold firm for 3,650 yuan, which was the same as the previous day. After a while, it was pressed down by two yuan. A certain money exchange industry sold another twenty taels to the same industry for 3,648 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry raised the price by seven yuan by receiving goods on behalf of customers. The money exchange industry entered ten taels for the silver shop gang and thirty taels for the securities gang, all for 3,655 yuan. At that time, the securities gang continued to sell more than one hundred taels, pressing it down to a low of 3,648 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market reported soft, and people's hearts were slightly encouraged. A certain money exchange industry turned from selling to buying, soaring seven yuan in an instant. Later, because a certain gold firm also followed suit, and sellers were scarce for a while, it rose by another thirteen yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered thirty taels for the cash firm for 3,668 yuan. Then, because the securities gang revived the selling momentum, and a certain money exchange industry and a certain firm also came to sell, it fell back by ten yuan. The securities gang sold twenty taels to the money exchange industry for 3,658 yuan. Near noon, the buying momentum resumed. A certain silver shop absorbed goods in the front, and a certain silver firm and a certain gold firm followed suit, and the buying momentum was boosted by the continued softness of the foreign exchange market, so it rose by another seventeen yuan. A certain gold firm entered thirty taels for the securities gang for 3,675 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to frequent rumors of good news, people's hearts were optimistic, and the opening price was five yuan higher. The silver shop gang entered ten taels for the gold firm for 3,680 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry aggressively entered more than two hundred taels, continuing to rise. Soon after, it rose another sixteen yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered thirty taels for the securities gang for 3,696 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm made a profit and sold, so it fell back by a small eight yuan. A certain gold firm sold thirty taels to the money exchange industry for 3,688 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to enter several hundred taels again. Although the silver shop gang and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, the positions were still insufficient, and the sellers' asking prices were quite high, so it broke through the 3,700 yuan mark. The gold firm entered twenty taels for the money exchange industry for 3,704 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry stopped buying for a while, so it fell back by four yuan. The money exchange industry did ten taels mutually for 3,700 yuan. Near the evening closing time, a certain money exchange industry purchased dozens of taels again, rising by four yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered twenty taels for the silver shop gang for 3,704 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it soared 54 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 56 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were few transactions.

The price of gold ornaments increased in the afternoon. The initial exchange price of silver shop gold per tael was still 370 yuan at Datonghang. At 2:05 PM, it increased by five yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to 375 yuan. The new counterparts had the same price as above, and the purchase prices were reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Demand Recovers; Soybean Market Price Rises Again

### Sassoon and Company Profitably Settle Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC exchange rate listing was announced and remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange market was only open for half a day, and the situation became increasingly quiet. Most operators were taking a wait-and-see approach, but those who expected a decline were also not determined to enter the market to buy, so the fluctuations remained narrow. At the opening, because the American and British exchange rate returned to 75 points higher, the opening market showed a sign of British tightness and American stability. The British gold rate was 5 pence 296875, and the American exchange rate was $8.6875, with a very stable trend. Until after 9:30, Sassoon, a Western merchant, suddenly came to the market to buy in, and Company Profitably also had an appetite for purchases. Moreover, it was reported that the Soviet Union and Japan had begun negotiations on a commercial treaty, so the trend suddenly became tighter. In addition, importers also successively settled their foreign exchange purchases, and HSBC's appetite for absorption was not lagging behind others, so the exchange rate gradually decreased without turning back until the midday close. The British gold rate was only 5 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was only $8.59375, which was 0.0625 tighter for British gold and 0.09375 softer for American currency compared to the previous day. It was reported that the futures market situation was completely similar to the spot market.

The results all showed tightening.

At the beginning of the morning, London's large bars were flat for both near and far terms. New York silver prices also remained stable. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rates of British currency against American currency and against French currency were both flat, rising by 0.0625 against Shanghai currency. The American currency rose by 75 points against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai currency, and rose by 0.0625 against French currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 5 pence 296875 for British gold and $8.6875 for the American exchange rate, which was slightly 0.015625 tighter for British gold compared to the previous day, while the American currency did not change. This was due to the increase in HSBC's listed exchange rate. After the opening, the market situation was quiet and flat, and transactions were also rare. When HSBC's listed exchange rate was announced without change, and the silver balance tax was also announced without any increase or decrease, Sassoon suddenly came to absorb purchases, and Company Profitably also had a slight appetite, so the situation slightly softened. Sassoon and Company Profitably bought spot American exchange rate at $8.65625 and $8.625 from a certain bank. Later, Sassoon also purchased spot British gold at 5 pence 28125 from a foreign bank. Subsequently, importers also followed suit to settle foreign exchange, and HSBC also absorbed a little, leading to a continued tightening and softening of the trend. A foreign firm settled spot American exchange rate at $8.59375 with a certain bank, and HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 5 pence 26525 from Wah Bi. By noon, the bank's spot selling prices at midday close were only 5 pence 25 for British gold and $8.59375 for the American exchange rate. The December British gold rate was 5 pence 1875, and the American exchange rate was $8.46875.

### Securities: Rumors Abound; Public Bonds Weak; Foreign Stocks Firm and Rise on the Other Hand

The securities grey market situation yesterday: After hovering in a weak state several times, the market gradually rose and fell. This trend may not be stopped for a while. This has been repeatedly stated in this newspaper. Because the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is getting closer, Britain and France are making concessions to Japan, and the North Sea war is becoming more and more intense, making the future more difficult to deal with. Empty words come from nowhere, and market rumors take the opportunity to rise up. Fortunately, many parties were still able to exert their remaining strength to pull up the market, otherwise the fall would have been more than this. Most of the players on the surface were shorting, but some bulls emerged, so the Class A and Class C bonds suddenly broke through $7. Although there are some fluctuations in the future, it is difficult to be optimistic about the trend. At the beginning of the morning yesterday, No. 41 bought in, and Song Mao followed suit, which can be called the mainstay of the moment. Unfortunately, few people sympathized. Dasheng suddenly released a large number of bulls, and the trend relaxed, and people's hearts were suddenly scattered. Lianhe and Yongkang both sold off considerable amounts, and the market price suddenly broke through the $7 level. Retail investors were still buying in small amounts. In the afternoon, No. 41 still had the power to buy in. Tiansheng, Datong, and Hongkang also had to buy, while Shengda Lianhe continued to sell. No. 38 and Yizhong also sold off, and the market price continued to weaken. The bulls pulled up the market again at the close, but the effect was minimal. The market price uniformly fell by a small amount of 3.5 cents to 7 cents. The turnover was about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Qingfeng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of $46 each.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was extremely firm and lively. Jardine Matheson shares and Steel shares all reached peaks of $70, $23.50, and $15.20 respectively. The transaction price of China Business Corporation bonds was $88, which was slightly firmer than before, while the stock transaction price was only 58 cents, which was 10 cents lower than before. This is evidence that the public has paid attention to and distinguished the truth, which is gratifying. In terms of rubber stocks, the Langezhi stock was the most pleasing, with a price of $22.75 at the close, and there was no shortage of purchases. (Note: The delivery date of the Public Industry Association will be changed. For details, please refer to the announcement on the cover of the association today.)

London, 21st telegram. The London Stock Exchange was closed today.

### Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Difficult to Ease; Japanese Factories Plan to Use Fire Machines

The cotton trade is still not weak. The appetite of Chinese and foreign factories is gradually expanding. This is because there is no hope for a decline in the overseas cotton market, and it is more cost-effective to purchase local cotton. At the same time, the market price of yarn and thread has increased a step compared to the past. Therefore, although the factories are not searching for large quantities, they have changed their style and are not as dull as before. The selling price is therefore slowly increasing. Japanese factories, both domestic and foreign, which have been stagnant for a long time, have also purchased 1,000 bales. At present, because the source of cotton from northern Jiangsu has not been cut off, people's hearts are still calm. However, judging from the situation of foreign cotton, the foundation of the cotton market will not be shaken. 1,415 bales of Tonghua cotton, 469 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,690 bales of Beisha cotton arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left. (The price of the factory is the price delivered to the factory including baking water. The transaction price of the industry is the dock delivery price.)

Tonghua Cotton

$135.00 $135.50 $136.00

Industry Purchases

600 bales

American Cotton

$140.60 $141.00 $143.00

Also

700 bales

American Cotton

$147.35

Anhui Purchases

500 bales

Another report on foreign cotton market prices: when New York cotton cloth opened in the morning, cotton prices continued to rise due to purchases by the industry. Telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay skyrocketed. Later, prices fell due to profit-taking by some bulls. As a result, the closing price fell by 1 to 7 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was like a raging fire. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose another 11 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 20 pence.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, all parties have stated in recent days that overseas cotton markets have risen for many days and prices are too high, so the desire to purchase is very weak. Factories are very quiet. The industry has also seen few spot transactions, so some have switched to trading in New York American cotton futures, and transactions are very busy. At the beginning of next month, a large amount of American cotton will arrive at the port. The factory delivered price including tax, converted at an exchange rate of $8.625 for the US dollar, is as follows:

20s American Middling: $166.60

20s American Middling, Lower Grade: $160.60

32s American Middling: $172.80

32s American Middling, Lower Grade: $165.10

42s American Middling: $175.90

42s American Middling, Lower Grade: $166.60

### Large Yarn Market Holders Eager to Sell

The yarn market, which rose sharply the previous day, entered a stable and quiet path yesterday. This is because wholesale sales have not developed in retail sales, and large holders of goods are very willing to sell goods for cash when market prices rise, resulting in a loose trend. However, overseas cotton markets are still firm and rising, and the rise in Indian cotton is very dramatic, increasing factory costs. Therefore, some are taking the intention of buying in at low prices. From this point of view, the foundation of the yarn market may not fall greatly for the time being, but the actual demand is still too sluggish.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning, continuing the momentum of the previous day, rising another 4 or 5 yuan. The spot price of 20s Shuangma yarn in foreign warehouses was $646-7, but all were transactions within the same industry. Hong Kong merchants still lacked excitement and did not purchase in large quantities. As for retail merchants eating a few bales of coarse yarn, there were still very few fine yarns. After the industry ate their fill, they stopped buying, and suddenly there was a decline of several yuan. The closing price of 20s Shuangma was $643, which was not much different from the previous day. Other brands were still firm, and coarse yarn was rising. Factories did not take action. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 135 Industry: 600

Fuzhou: 80 Ningbo: 30

Jiangxi: 120 Xiamen: 10

Inland: 15 Tianjin: 50

Previous Day's Transactions: 865 Total: 1905

### Food: Retailers Are Likely to Bring Rice Prices on Par with Superior Rice

Yesterday, the source of rice and grain for each group was slightly scarce due to continuous rain. More than 3,000 bags of goods from Suzhou, Jiaxing, Kunshan, Taicang, and Fengxian arrived. Because the midday market had tightened once the previous day, there was still residual energy in the morning, and there were continued calls for higher prices. However, the sales market in the local area was not smooth, and the hoarding households saw that the situation was not good and sought to sell their goods. Supply exceeded demand. As a result, whether it was superior rice or retail rice, prices were stable and soft, with a decrease of 40 to 50 cents. In short, the market has shown a state of hovering after a major decline. Statistics show that the city's total transactions were more than 6,000 bags.

Yesterday, the retail glutinous rice arrivals were still continuous. Although there were no large batches coming to Shanghai, small batches in transit arrived continuously. In the morning market, the market price increased once due to the low prices and eagerness of the shopkeepers and hoarders to purchase. However, the price of retail glutinous rice was more expensive than the thick rice at $32.50, and actual sales finally did not dare to purchase smoothly, so the market turned flat again in the later market. The total number of arrivals and sales throughout the day was nearly 3,000 bags.

Yesterday, foreign rice was not formally traded in two batches that had been agreed upon because foreign exchange was not settled on Wednesday. Chinese and foreign merchants were still peddling. The selling prices varied. One said that the production price had risen, and Saigon No. 1 had to be continuously priced at $35.40, which was more than $0.20 more expensive. Another said that futures could be reordered for only $34.60, but at present, the booking and handling were unified, and the later market could continue to be transported.

### Flour and Wheat Remain Firm

Flour

Yesterday, spot flour transactions were active. Merchants from Beiyang (Yantai, Qingdao) and Nanyang (Hong Kong, Xiamen) all had intentions to purchase. However, because raw material prices are currently expensive and production has decreased, all factories are becoming increasingly tight in their sales intentions. All wholesale transactions were restricted. It was reported that the price of the Paoche brand flour had risen from $7.30 to $7.40. Although the book price of the Bingshuan brand was still $7.20, the merchant price was no longer supplied. There were few returned goods supplied and demanded. Affected by the decline in rice prices, the warehouse and merchant prices were not very poor. The total market traded nearly 5,000 bags. The market was clearly stable and secretly firm.

Wheat

Yesterday, the market was also trending upward. This was because there were currently few arrivals and few stored goods, and those holding goods were thinking of storing them in warehouses to wait for prices to rise. The demand from factories and warehouses was also not urgent. After the market was once squeezed the day before yesterday, formal transactions began yesterday. Changzhou wheat opened at more than $11.30, and all other goods rose by 10 to 20 cents. It was reported that foreign wheat may gradually become accessible. Once the source is open, the future of domestic wheat will be significantly affected.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Solid and Stable

Recently, the yellow soybean market situation has been such that arrivals have not been smooth under rumors that there will be control in the production area. People's hearts are optimistic. The market price has risen by more than 50 cents compared to last week. At present, arrivals and storage are not strong, so the standing price is still solid and stable. Yesterday, the Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 300 bags of Chongmingsha yellow soybeans, priced at $14.50 to $14.55. Other transactions on the street included 500 to 600 bags of Wuhu soybeans, priced at $13.75 to $13.90, 300 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, priced at $13.90, and 200 bags of Nanjing soybeans, priced at $13.60. 120 bags of soybeans were shipped from Beisha yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Jinjiang Sugar Prices High and Unprecedented

The national sugar market was still active yesterday. Jian merchants continued to open 250 bags of diaoqing at $33.50, and the merchants of Jue opened more than 200 bags at $33.20. Chao merchants opened more than 300 bags of high-quality huanggangqing at $36. According to Jinjiang, sugar prices are high and unprecedented. White sugar is as high as more than $90, and brown sugar has also reached more than $70. It is impossible for it to come to Shanghai. The trend of the association's cleared dishes is stable. The old goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar in foreign warehouses are $51.50, and the new goods are $52. Taikoo Che Bai B-Mark Dong Warehouse is $55, and the West Warehouse is $55.50. The rest is according to the refund. Dutch red sugar is $41 to $41.50. The local cotton white and No. 1 ice are all priced at the original price, with not much change.

### North and South Goods: Honey Dates Decline

Recently, honey dates have continued to arrive from time to time, and destocking has been rare, showing a situation of supply exceeding demand. Prices have declined. Yesterday's market price was $110 for Huigong bald heads, $100 for Lanxi bald heads, and $90 for ordinary ones, which was nearly $10 lower than before.

### Silk and Tea: Local Silk Exports Suddenly Rise

In recent days, the Shanghai market situation has been stable following the rise in Japanese and American silk prices. White factories have continued to receive purchase orders from American merchants. Yesterday, because overseas market prices uniformly declined, the atmosphere in this port also turned dull. The appetite for American Zhuang purchases was weak. Factory selling prices remained stable. The Shanghai silk inventory was not very large. Yesterday, Dachang imported 10 to 20 dan, priced at $4,150. The Philippine exports, which have been lacking in improvement for a long time, suddenly started buying yellow local silk yesterday, purchasing 30 dan of goods from Mianyang and Huangzhou, priced at $1,020. At this time of quiet local silk trading, the offered price was still not bad.

### Piece Goods: East Piece Goods and North Sales Active; National Cloth Factory Prices Increased

National cloth factory prices increased. Merchants in the local area and national households are thinking about rising prices, and the buying style is slightly stronger. The turnover of fine cloth, fine twill, satin, grey cloth, fine yarn Qianfu silk grey cloth in this month and next month is very large. The market price has turned firm. Colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and fine twill have each risen by 10 to 20 cents per piece. Yihuo coarse cloth of light and heavy pounds has each risen by 5 cents to 10 cents per piece. Yongwen merchants handle more than 100 bags of various grades of coarse cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handle 70 to 80 bags of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. More than 100 cases of flannel, colored cloth, and colored twill. Fujian merchants handle more than 4,000 pieces of colored twill and Shilin bamboo cloth. Merchants from northern Jiangsu and Wuhu handle several thousand pieces of colored cloth and other goods.

East piece fine cloth and fine twill fell back after rising. The morning market situation was quite soft. The low price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to $18.20 per piece. Later, because the northern merchants and the local street purchases were still strong, more than 700 pieces of white goods were traded. The selling price in the later market recovered, and the spot price of Longtou was $18.40, and the fine twill was $17.60, but it was still 20 to 25 cents per piece lower than the previous day's high point. Merchants did not open goods, so according to industry observations, the market atmosphere was quite stable.

### Hardware: Iron Billets and Local Nails Weak

Black iron billets are purchased by mirror factories, thermos factories, iron printing factories, printing factories, etc. There is a large number of stocks on the market, and overseas orders are continuously loaded, such as Yihuo, Baolong, Lianyi, Guanhua, Lihe, Hanli, and other foreign firms continue to supply. Due to the congestion of spot goods, the price of 200-pound goods is $75-76 per box, and the price of 2,000-pound goods is about $800 per piece, which is about one-tenth lower than in the past.

Local nails are mainly purchased by the local construction industry. Recently, because the work done is not prosperous, the price has fallen again and again, from $50 to $47, and then to $45. Yesterday, the market only sold $42-43.

### Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College Changed to National Status; Cooperative Finance Department Established

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College was formerly known as Jiangsu Provincial Bank College. The school site was originally in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the school moved to Hunan to resume classes and was approved by the Ministry of Education to be renamed "Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College."

Mr. Gao Bozhen was a native of Wujin, Jiangsu. He graduated from Jiangsu Public Law and Politics University. He passed the trial of undertaking review and was appointed to Taixing. After arriving at his post for nine months, he made clear and fair judgments, and the scholars and people praised him. He then returned to teach at Wujin County Women's Normal School and served as a standing member of the county party headquarters for many years, and also held local public office. In the 20th year, the central government convened a national conference and was elected as a representative of Jiangsu. During the Anti-Japanese War, he presided over the salvation work in Changzhou.

### The Western Youth Basketball Tournament of This Year: Twenty Chinese and Western Teams Participate in the Competition; Chinese Teams Account for Three-Fourths of All Teams

The registration for the 12th Western Youth Invitational Basketball Tournament closed the day before yesterday. That evening, the committee convened and approved all twelve Group A teams and eight Group B teams that had registered. Yesterday, Mr. Bratou, the sports director of the association, officially announced the list. Group A was originally set to have eleven teams, but now has one more. The Paramount team, a strong Chinese team and the runner-up of the previous tournament, surprisingly gave up joining. The Aurora College team, which finished fourth last year, has moved down to Group B. The Ponpei team was excluded due to late registration. This year, the McKlings will participate with three teams. In addition to the McKling Red, the champion of the previous tournament, the McKling Military will also regroup. The McKling Gold will be replaced by the McKling White. New teams include the emerging strong Chinese team, the Shanghai Youth, and the China One, the overall champion of the Central Youth Group B in the previous tournament. In addition, there are a total of eight Chinese teams, including the China Union, Friendship Union, Tianxing, Moore, Xu Fang, and Blue Black, accounting for two-thirds of the total. They are determined to compete with the McKlings. The Western Youth Little Bear team is considered to have mediocre skills and not worthy of much attention. In Group B, Chinese teams account for seven of the eight teams, with only the Giant team being Western. Except for the Aurora College team, all are new to this year's tournament. Teams such as the Shangxing Cloud and Guangshi are very strong and will surely dominate. The tournament is scheduled to open on the 5th of next month. Both Group A and Group B will adopt a single round-robin system. Group A will have a total of sixty-six matches, and Group B will have twenty-eight matches. For Group A, three matches will be held every Monday and Friday starting at 7:15 pm, and two matches will be held every Wednesday starting at 8:15 pm.

### Third Act of the Central Youth Basketball Tournament: Ponpei vs. Xu Fang Tonight; Friendship Union Meets Blue Black in Another Match

The third act of the Central Youth Basketball Tournament features two Group A matches tonight. In the Central Division, Friendship Union will face Blue Black. Friendship Union boasts strong players such as Lu Gusui, Zhou Yaokang, Shen Ji'en, and Lu Shungen, making them a very strong team. Although Blue Black's Ma Fangcui and Tao Zunan were once prominent players, they are now old. And Zhuang Youren, a famous soccer player, is better with his feet than with his hands. Therefore, Friendship Union can confidently win. In the Youth Division, Ponpei will meet Xu Fang. Ponpei is more of an exhibition team and does not count for points. Many of its players are veterans of the basketball scene, such as Zhang Wenyuan, Wang Shoufang, and Li Feiyun, who are still strong. Team captain Qian Xucang is also intelligent and brave, so they should not be underestimated. Xu Fang, under the leadership of Dong Xiaopei, has players such as Lu Dazhen, Tao Shaosheng, and Zhang Jinxiang, who are all top choices of their time. Tan Dahua is making a comeback, which is noteworthy. Ponpei will likely have a hard time winning, but may be able to outsmart their opponents. Considering the strength of both teams, Xu Fang is more likely to win. In Group B, Qianghua and Jizhong are expected to win. Also, the Aurora College team has officially withdrawn from Group A, and in Group B, Nanguang has changed its name to Pangdui, and Xiaoguang has changed its name to Guangming. Tickets for tonight's games are still sold at 30 cents (non-members) and 20 cents (members).

### The Motive Power of Emotion

— Ding Di

When we listen to several people play the same piece of music, with fixed rhythms and words, it illustrates the different emotions of each person. It's not just music; in any art form, the content must be entrusted to the form, and the form will inevitably be influenced by it. The external form may be the same, but you cannot ignore its internal motive power. When the surging internal motive power generates its own waves, it is the hidden difference accumulated inside. Even if you cannot distinguish it from the outside, you can still choose its soul from the core of things. Emotion and music are no different. It's the same emotion; you are angry, and so is he; you admire, and so does he. However, there is a big difference between them. It's not just the depth of the degree, but more importantly, the origin of the emotion.

The existence of emotion lies in the human heart, and it is inevitably subjective. However, when you investigate further, you find that people construct a psychological change, through the coincidence of physiological and psychological factors, from nothing to create a state. In that instant, it is a vague and amorphous mental retina. Before it is formed, in a very short and mysterious time, like a spider spinning silk, it pulls out thin, grayish-white strands. The way of spinning the silk, before forming a web, will indeed affect the future web. Usually, because this web is formed too quickly, you cannot distinguish its "management" and "existence," thinking that there is nothing but subjectivity. This view is wrong. I believe that the emergence of emotion in an instant can be regarded as an objective state. How you weave those spider's threads, the web is considered your creation. Every "emotional web" weaver weaves different webs, and these webs are their sustenance.

Ruskin, the author famous for "The King of the Golden River," analyzes the various aspects of emotion in detail in "Modern Painters." His main point is that emotions are divided into noble and base, and the nobility and baseness depend entirely on the cause of their "basis." If the cause is noble, then the emotion is also noble. The same is true for baseness. For example, admiration and resentment are not necessarily emotions he considers noble, but when one is resentful of being harmed exceptionally or admires the budding flower, these emotions are noble emotions. They are completely different from being resentful of having a small amount of money taken away or admiring fireworks and commodities. The so-called "basis of emotion" is actually a kind of motive power, the direction in which the spider spins the silk when weaving the web.

Emotion is an element in literary works, which is very obvious. But I don't know that there is another kind of motive power besides emotion. There are hidden emotions besides emotions. The same emotion contains different values. Who can deny Ruskin's words? The value of the same resentment and admiration is very different. Their value is not in external things (emotions) but in the essence (emotions other than emotions). The motive power of emotion controls emotion, which can be explained by Montaigne's words: "External things have color and taste because of the essence." This is not so much a distinction of emotions as it is honestly a distinction of essences. It's like the surface sound of the strings being the same, but what exists in the heart is different. When Guangwu Zhongxing, the people cheered with the same sentiment, "I never thought I would see the Han official ceremony again today!" is admiration. "Why are you so late?" is also admiration. "When will the sun perish? I will perish with you!" is anger. "If there is such a thing, I will follow you!" Wu Sangui's words on horseback were also anger. But the emotions between the two are very different in terms of sublimity and vulgarity.

The greatness or insignificance of the motive power of emotion will undoubtedly control the greatness of literary works. In this era, we can be considered uniquely blessed, with resentment and admiration, and these emotions hide great and sublime motive power behind them. Deep and serious injuries cause resentment, and the passion of light and caress causes our admiration, and these are also sublime emotions beyond emotions, definitely not the kind of emotions derived from the boring motive power of those greedy admirations and hatred of justice, which will never produce great literary works.

### Newspapers and Magazines in Yan'an

— Ye Fen

Yan'an also has shops that specialize in selling magazines and bookstores that also sell magazines. If you step inside, you will be dazzled by a pile of colorful magazines and newspapers. In addition to a large portion coming from various places outside the area, there are quite a few that are published locally. And they are all able to stand on the front lines of the great era, leading the public and guiding those who are progressing. That's right: the lineup they display shows them to be so strong and healthy. In this group, it's hard to find anyone who is backward, loose, blind, or depressed. The lively but serious writing can really make people love and respect it when they have it in their hands. If readers want to know some of its "resume," let me introduce them one by one below!

"Liberation" is one of the earliest in the publishing world of Yan'an newspapers and magazines. It was born with the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At first, it was a weekly, but later, due to the lack of paper, it was changed to an irregular publication. The organizer is the CPC Party Newspaper Committee. The content is mostly about the cultivation of party members, party theories, and reports. Mao Zedong, Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming), Zhang Wentian (Lofu), Cheng Fangwu, and others often wrote here. It once wanted to move to Wuhan for publication, but it did not succeed. Due to distribution issues, it suffered several major disasters in Xi'an.

"New China Daily" is a small four-page newspaper that has been transformed from mimeograph to letterpress. The organizer is Mr. Chengzhi, the son of Mr. Liao Zhongkai. It is a local newspaper for conveying news to the Yan'an public. It is published every Tuesday and Friday. The supplement has no name and is the base for reporting literature in Yan'an. Writers once engaged in a pen war here over the issues of cities and villages. Comrade Mao Zedong came forward to mediate before they each stopped fighting.

"Unity" is a semi-monthly publication in the form of a single 16-page book. The organizer is the Border Region Government. The content is mostly similar to "Liberation Daily," but most of the manuscripts here are recorded from the lectures of the Shaanxi Northern Public School. Therefore, many students of the Shaanxi Northern Public School buy it. In addition, there are some local party and government news and other manuscripts.

"Chinese Youth" This is a semi-monthly publication in the form of a single 16-page book. Because the writers are all young partners, its content is absolutely lively. It's hot and energetic, with an invincible trend. Such as the history introduction of the International Youth Movement, the world youth character records, and the feature articles of young warriors active in the occupied areas are all valuable manuscripts. The organizer is the Chinese Youth Society.

"Chinese Women" The "Chinese Women" who do not wear high heels gave birth to it at the end of June this year, after taking some space and effort in the struggle of life. It is a monthly publication. The movement of the manuscripts is closely following the life problems of women in the War of Resistance and the introduction of women's work dynamics in various places. The organizer is the Chinese Women's Society.

In addition to these, there are also "wall newspapers." "Wall newspapers" in northern Shaanxi are as numerous as Shanghai's cigarette advertisements. They can be seen everywhere on every street. Even if you run to every institution, factory, and cooperative, you can also find their masterpieces on the walls. This is where they review their work and report their lives. Although schools such as Shaanxi Northern Public School, Anti-Japanese University, and Chinese Women's University, as well as larger institutions and organizations, print them in letterpress, the paper and transportation in Yan'an are difficult, and the price is expensive. Just take newsprint as an example: when Shanghai only sold two cents a sheet, it already sold for ten cents a sheet there. Now there's no need to mention it anymore. Even "Liberation Daily" and "New China Daily" have switched to printing on a kind of rougher Maobian paper. The lack of paper materials there can be imagined.

### News

— Gongsun Seng

When the swallows fly south, the geese fly north, and the yellow leaves fill the ground in autumn, I began to settle down by a lake, constantly recalling the painful memories experienced in the distant borderlands. And I often looked out, in fact, I was yearning for the arrival of spring.

However, spring was hiding slowly, while autumn was gradually deepening. From the window of my humble residence, I saw the endless declining grass and the mirror-like lake without the sound of kingfishers. Even the shadows of the trees were gradually thinning. However, all sighs and sorrows are in vain, and autumn will not quietly slip away because it is hated.

At this time, a friend often sent me letters and comfort from a distant foreign country. Just as I had suffered for seeking spring, that friend was also forced to leave his own country for seeking spring. In my autumn-like days, thanks to him, I could often get some news about spring. If I had ever smiled at the lonely river or the still starry sky, then that laughter should have been given by him.

However, in autumn, even the wind and rain are dull and subtle. The lake water stagnates in the lake bed every night, with only ripples and no waves. The stars are nailed to the sky every night, with only faint light and no movement. I cannot see the harbinger of spring coming, nor can I find the traces of spring passing away.

However, one day, that friend told me a message, saying that there would be a meteor shower one night. At that time, I could see the jump of the stagnant stars and the churning of the calm lake.

That night, leaning against the window facing the water, I looked at the calm sky and lake, and I had a joyful heart. I seemed to feel that the meteor and the lake would give me news of spring.

But other than listening to the sound of insects and the sound of wind all night, until dawn, they still did not change this stagnant scene. In the time I wandered in front of the window, I had resented that friend.

But on that very night, gunfire rang out in a city not far away. In the morning, when the people in the streets told me the news, they had excited smiles. Then, I suddenly realized that the meteor and the lake had really moved that night, and spring had definitely come suddenly in the bleak autumn air without any news. I was ashamed of the resentment I had had, and my friend had not deceived me, but had used another way to report to me the news of that "spring."

After that, I hurriedly left this lonely lake. Now that I knew the whereabouts of spring and had seen the coming of spring, then why should I stay in that environment that is forever autumn? Just like the swallows flying south to seek warmth and the geese flying north to avoid the cold, I made myself a person seeking "spring" who is heading towards spring.

I left in such a hurry.

### Vitality

— Bingquan

A bright and clear autumn morning.

I jumped into the fresh air; I stepped on the dew-covered mud with brave and broad steps;... The cool and emerald-green breath made me very happy.

Opposite me was a cluster of ancient and twisted trees. The sun shone its light on this side and that side, and also on the green-leafed dome; dewdrops glistened on it... forming a golden, shimmering sea of light. I was amazed by the beauty woven by nature. Several yellow leaves hung weakly on the intricate branches, which must be the footprints left by autumn.

A subtle insect sound drifted from the distant side, perhaps tired, lazily lying into my ear and slowly dying away. Although it is so weak, it is the cry of life! The severe winter of death is lying in front, and the season that is so cruel that it will not allow even a single blade of grass to survive will come. These lives will be threatened by the devil's hand of death; but I believe that they will grow up in the struggle. One day, they will be strong and spread their high-pitched and majestic songs proudly across the earth.

I have a joy and comfort in life; I have received a new inspiration, and I have a newborn hope for everything.

I gazed at the distant sky; I took a deep breath; as if I were a warrior going to the struggle.

Spring will follow winter, I thought.

### Mei Lanfang's Russian Female Disciple

— Huazhi

Dr. Mei Lanfang has a Russian female disciple named Siavina Brown. It is said that Mei met her during his visit to the Soviet Union several years ago. Ms. Brown is the wife of a Russian painter named Brown. She is very young and talented, and her mother was a famous actress during the Tsarist era of Russia. She has a family tradition of learning. Brown has studied drama and dance since she was a child, integrating the classical dances of various Eastern countries such as China, Korea, and India, and evolving them. She claims that when she first saw Mr. Mei, "the chief priest of the Chinese art world," perform sword dance several years ago, she expressed her fascination and joined his school. She began to learn skills and felt that the fun of the whole set of singing and dancing in Peking opera was far more comparable to ordinary multi-scene operas. After learning the secret, she set up her own school and created her own style, permeating the monotonous oriental colors with a strong Western taste. She has traveled around for many years and has gained a good reputation. Brown and her sister Nina Du Nan recently went to the United States to sell their art, performing dramas, operas, and dances. When they passed through Yokohama, they also gave a public performance at the local International Women's Club. According to the talk, "Recently, she has melted various dance arts of China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan into one furnace, and can cater to the taste of any audience. As for the sword dance technique, it completely follows the Mei style." According to foreign women who love Peking opera, there was once a German named Jung-chu, and now there is Brown. If what she said is true, she is another strong general of the Mei school.

### The Madness of New York Women: Clark Gable's Magic for Women

— Translated by Lin Gong, from "American Film Intelligence: Anecdotes of Movie Stars"

Clark Gable, after much difficulty, finally obtained permission from his company for a two-month vacation in the warm spring. He seized this excellent opportunity to travel around with his wife, but because his charm was too great for women, women flocked to him like bees and butterflies wherever he went, which annoyed him greatly. As a result, he secretly took a detour from New York back to Hollywood before even three weeks of vacation had passed.

When he was invited to perform on stage at the Randle Grand Theater, the women, upon hearing the news, were so excited that they jumped around like madwomen, pushing and shoving into the theater as if fighting. After each performance, they lingered reluctantly, and had to be forcibly driven out by theater staff. When Clark Gable was leaving or returning to the theater, countless women surrounded him at the theater entrance, cheering and shouting, pulling at his coat, shirt, and tie, snatching his hat, and grabbing his gloves. Each wanted to bravely squeeze closer to him, hoping to get a lock of his hair or a shred of his clothing as a souvenir. As a result, Clark's clothes were often torn to shreds, and he was so annoyed that he almost cried.

The next day, Clark Gable was terrified. He hid in the dressing room backstage at the theater, from noon until evening, but more than five thousand women crowded at the door waiting to see him. They even broke through the police cordon, and with the force of thousands of jade arms crashing against it, they finally broke down the backstage door of the theater. However, they did not find their ideal lover. Later, word spread that he was hiding in the locked dressing room, and only then did some of them gradually disperse.

On the third day, Clark Gable, feeling too stuffy from being cooped up in the room, went to the window for some air. He was immediately spotted by a girl, who rushed out from the crowd, risking danger, and climbed out from a small room near the furnace. They were willing to exchange their lives for his autograph, which, though foolish, showed the extent of his charm.

The theater was always packed, making the owner so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He even requested that the number of performances be increased from twice a day to six times a day. Clark finally couldn't take it anymore, so he took his wife secretly on a late, quiet night, took the train and sneaked back.

"New York is like this, I never imagined. I lost five pounds in weight in three days. Walking on the streets of Hollywood is not surprising at all, but New York was such a sensation," Clark Gable often said to his friends.

According to general critics, "The reason Clark Gable has such a magical power to attract women is because he is full of male sensuality, and can be called a 'hot man'."

Truly, Clark Gable is a living treasure to women!

The contract between the Shanghai Drama Society and the Xuan Palace Theater will expire on the sixth of next month. Both the front and back stages are considering whether to renew it after it expires. If it is not renewed, then "Taking Oneself as an Example" following "A Regret from the Late Ming Dynasty" will be the last play performed by the Shanghai Drama Society in this period.

On New Year's Day of the 29th year, a new spoken drama theater will be established in Shanghai, and the person in charge is actively preparing for it. If time permits, it may open as early as Christmas. The address is in the most central area of ​​the "isolated island."

After Chen Kengran completed "Women's Apartment," it was once rumored that he would direct "Du Shiniang" for Guohua. According to recent news, there is a possibility of renewing the contract with Yihua, but it is still a "per-film" deal, with a director's fee of 1,500 yuan per film.

Luo Ping's "Chen Yuanyuan" has recently been written, and the first act was submitted the day before yesterday. It will probably be performed in the spring of next year. The performance rights belong to the Shanghai Drama Society.

Yihua Company's "Wang Baochuan," which was produced with all its strength, will be screened at the Greater Shanghai Theater starting tomorrow. According to friends who have seen the test screening, there are several shots of Zhang Cuihong that are very beautiful and quite in line with the demeanor of "Eastern beauty."

Li Ying left Yihua and joined Hezong. Some people said: It is exactly "A horse has left the boundary of Xiliang..." because he played Xue Pinggui in "Wang Baochuan."

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a chrysanthemum exhibition on the seventh floor of the New New Company, displaying more than 6,000 pots of precious chrysanthemums, in a riot of colors, which was quite spectacular. It is now scheduled to hold a charity sale of movie stars this Saturday, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.

North and South Each Have an Honoree

Even with the vast and profound skills of Wang and Yang, old Tan saw them as merely the best among the ordinary, which shows how high his standards were. Unexpectedly, after his death, Yang and Wang each enjoyed great fame. One became a leader among the martial actors, with a reputation for being unprecedented and unsurpassed; the other was revered as the Lord of All Knowledge, the Great Dharma Master, not only serving as the chief among the female actors, but also able to create new styles, arrange old plays that had been lost for a long time, impart them to his students, and make them public to the world. His contribution to promoting Peking opera is rarely seen among actors in ancient and modern times. He and Xiao Lou not only lived up to Old Tan's earnest expectations, but also each achieved a lofty reputation as the leading figure in their respective fields. If Tan knew this in the afterlife, he could rejoice that his old eyes were not mistaken. Yao Qing, because he had never left Beijing, was able to interact with scholars and celebrities from time to time. He had deeply studied bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting, and was especially good at painting chrysanthemums, hence the nickname "Chrysanthemum Obsessed." He had a large collection of Han jade, and his keen eye was admired by antique dealers in Beijing. I often went to his residence in the evening to chat. He was gentle and refined, and his conversation was lively. His extensive knowledge of opera was astonishing, and his appreciation of antiques made him one of the leading artists in the pear garden.

In terms of learning, although Debao was not as good as Yaoqing, Ruiling's extensive knowledge of opera, being able to do both civil and military roles, Kunqu opera and various other genres, was almost comparable to Wang's. Rui was humble and amiable. Because his family had many old scripts from the Sanqing Troupe, he often selected and read them in his spare time. Whenever he encountered something difficult to understand, he always consulted with learned scholars. He would not stop until he fully understood it. However, he was ultimately old-fashioned and superstitious. Two things he said were quite laughable. (147)
