### Ten Thousand Japanese Troops Invade the Taihang Mountains; Chinese Troops Are Currently Engaged in Encirclement and Interception; More Than a Thousand Japanese Troops Annihilated in the Battle South of Pingyao; Liaoxian Has Been Recaptured; Fighting Has Erupted in Jiaozuo, Northern Henan, and Most of the Coal Mines Have Been Burned Down; Chinese Troops on All Routes in Guangdong Are Counterattacking, and the Situation in Zhongshan Has Stabilized

(Chongqing) Military news: Following the battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the battle of Taihang Mountain has now begun. In the past month, the Japanese suffered heavy blows from the Chinese in western Shanxi and were defeated. Still unwilling to give up, they mobilized five regiments, totaling more than 100,000 troops from their original garrison in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, to launch a large-scale encirclement against the Chinese troops in the vast area of the Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army decided to invade in five routes. Among them, two forces invaded from north to south. One force started its southward invasion of Qinyuan from Pingyao on the 3rd. The Chinese army immediately launched an interception and annihilated more than 1,000 troops under the command of Japanese battalion commander Ganbigu in a battle south of Pingyao. Ganbigu was also killed by the Chinese in this battle. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are still fighting south of Pingyao. Another force moved south from Pindin on the 5th, attacking Chinese-held Liaoxian. When the Japanese troops sneaked into Hanwang Town, south of Heshun, the Chinese army flanked the Japanese army from Yangcun, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Chinese army recaptured Liaoxian on the 7th. The Chinese and Japanese are now engaged in fierce fighting on the He-Liao Highway. As for the other two forces, they attacked from south to north. One force attacked Huixian from Xinxiang. When the Japanese troops sneaked into Huixian, the Chinese army had already made preparations and encircled them. Currently, the remnants of this force are still trapped in the Chinese army's encirclement. The Japanese army, feeling desperate, requested assistance from Xinxiang. Another force moved west from Xinxiang to support Boai. When the Japanese troops were moving from Xinxiang to Boai, the Chinese army seized the opportunity to ambush them halfway, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. However, fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese army also invaded Xiaoweiying, south of Boai, on the 5th. The Chinese army gathered its forces north of the town and waited for the Japanese to sneak into the town before encircling them. In addition, there was another Japanese force attempting to sneak east from Yicheng to Qinshui and Yangcheng. The Chinese and Japanese are currently engaged in bloody battles in the area west of Qinshui. The above five Japanese forces have either been encircled or intercepted by the Chinese army, and their momentum has begun to weaken. (12th dispatch)

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson recently announced at an intelligence conference that the Chinese troops in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi are putting up the strongest resistance against the Japanese army. Since last month, the Japanese army has attempted to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in northern Shanxi with four divisions and one mixed brigade, but the result was a complete failure. The Chinese army's strategy in the area is to attack individual Japanese units, and the mountainous terrain is extremely favorable to the Chinese. After the Japanese troops in Liaoxian were surrounded by the Chinese army, they have been completely reduced. The current focus of the battle is on the Datong-Puzhou Railway. (12th Hai Tong News Agency dispatch)

Yulin: On the morning of the 6th, the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Liaoxian. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted out of the city. After repeated attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. The Chinese army followed closely and charged in, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army fled the city in a panic and retreated to Hanwang (north of Liaoxian). Liaoxian was declared recaptured. In this battle, Japanese corpses were scattered inside and outside the city. In one corner of the city alone, there were more than 50 corpses. The Chinese army seized many military supplies and war trophies. (12th dispatch)

The Chinese army withdrew when Japanese reinforcements arrived. (13th dispatch)

(Luoyang) After the Japanese occupied Zhongcun (southeast of Yicheng), a part of the Japanese army, about two to three thousand, moved east towards Baihua Village on the 11th. The Japanese army in Qinshui has been blocked by the Chinese army for days, and their eastward invasion has failed. A part of them is now sneaking south along the Qin-Dong Avenue and has reached Shangwo Village. It seems that they will join forces with the Japanese army in Baihua Village to attack Zhuoyun Town and continue to invade the west side of Yangcheng. Chinese troops have been dispatched to intercept them. (11th dispatch)

Fuliang: On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army attempted to invade Huangmei in eastern Hubei.

Xingji: About 20,000 Japanese troops have gathered in the Yicheng area and are being transferred east one after another. The fighting is quite fierce. The situation in the Zhongtiao Mountain area is relatively quiet. There are definitely no Japanese troops in Xiaoli and Yongle towns. There are still a few Japanese troops near Fenglingdu, and the Chinese army is searching and eliminating them in the Qingju Town and Ershili Ridge area. (11th dispatch)

(Luoyang) The battle in southern Shanxi is still progressing fiercely. The Chinese army's attacks are proving successful. On the night of the 8th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Qinghua Town. The Japanese army responded in a panic and suffered countless casualties. Another unit attacked Yuxiang, and the Japanese were also caught off guard, suffering even more casualties. After a night of fierce fighting, several hundred Japanese troops from Jiexian and Yongji reinforced from the east and west. The Chinese and Japanese are still fighting fiercely in the Wufacun area. (11th dispatch)

(Xi'an) The Japanese troops in Chita, 20 li south of Jiexian, were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army on the night of the 5th. After a night of fierce fighting, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed and countless Japanese troops were wounded. The next morning, the Chinese army launched an encirclement against the Japanese troops in Tiaogou, killing many Japanese troops. The remnants retreated north. (11th dispatch)

Shaanzhou: On the morning of the 7th, more than 2,000 Japanese troops from Baitanyao, Yueshan Temple, and Xifanchang and more than 600 Japanese troops from Baishan and Qicheng "all north of Boai" simultaneously launched a large-scale invasion under the cover of artillery fire. At noon, the Japanese troops sneaked to the vicinity of Dongxi Bagou and were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. After six hours of bloody battle, the Japanese army failed to succeed and resorted to releasing poison gas to attempt another invasion. They were bravely repelled by the Chinese army. Then, the Japanese army concentrated more than 20 heavy artillery pieces from Gangshan and launched a fierce bombardment. The Japanese infantry took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. The Chinese army waited for the Japanese army to approach the position and launched a brave hand-to-hand combat. The battle situation was tragic. At the same time, a surprise unit of the Chinese army detoured to the flanks of the Japanese army. The fierce battle lasted until night. Thanks to the dedication of the Chinese generals and soldiers, all the Japanese troops were repelled. The Japanese army fled in a panic towards Tianpo. In this battle, more than 400 Japanese troops were killed, and many weapons, ammunition, and military supplies were captured. At 11:00 p.m., the Chinese army's pursuit troops reached Tianpo and took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness to break into the Japanese camp and engage in hand-to-hand combat for a long time, killing more than 100 Japanese troops and capturing 25 rifles, one machine gun, grenade launchers, and many documents. (12th dispatch)

Editorial

### Strengthening the Control of Foreign Trade

According to the latest customs report, China's foreign trade in the first five months of this year had an import value of 56.8 million yuan and an export value of 24.3 million yuan. Compared with the import and export figures for the same period last year, both imports and exports have increased. The trade deficit was 22.5 million yuan, an increase of 10.2 million yuan compared with the same period last year, which is twice the total deficit for the entire year last year. In the past, China's trade deficits had a negative impact on China's economy. During the current war of resistance, the country's economic capabilities should be concentrated on various economic construction projects and the purchase of arms. However, the facts show that China still has to bear a huge expenditure on foreign trade, which cannot but be considered a waste.

When a country is at war with foreign countries, it always imposes extremely strict controls on foreign trade. Since the War of Resistance, China has also imposed controls on foreign trade, but they are not very strict, so they cannot produce the greatest effect. The reason why trade controls are not strict is not because it is factually impossible, but to preserve the rights and interests of European and American countries in China and not to make their business in China too affected. Therefore, the occupied areas can operate freely outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government's laws and regulations; goods that are prohibited from foreign trade can continue to be imported into the interior; and the import of some non-essential goods cannot be prohibited. As a result, China's foreign trade has the largest amount in the occupied areas in terms of region, and Japan has become the leader in China's foreign trade in terms of country. These situations are not only detrimental to the wartime economy.

Recently, in order to adjust foreign trade, the Chinese government simultaneously promulgated three laws and regulations: Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods, Measures for Exchanging Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Obtaining Exchange Rate Differences, and Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange. The first law prohibits the import of all luxury goods and some non-essential goods; the second law encourages the export of local products; and the third law is a provision for the procedures for applying for foreign exchange. All import trade in the occupied areas cannot apply according to law. These three laws are all aimed at the current bad state; it is expected that they can achieve great results after implementation. As for the rights and interests of European and American countries in China that the Chinese government was concerned about in the past, they are now limited by facts and are under great pressure. It is no longer possible for China to make concessions, so it is no longer a problem.

China's wartime trade control can be said to have been considerably strengthened legally since the promulgation of the above three laws and regulations. However, in addition to the laws and regulations, it must be managed by a strict organization and supplemented by a definite policy to produce great effects. During the First World War, the most effective country in implementing trade control was Britain, and the most strict organization for trade control was also Britain. Under the Ministry of Commerce during the war, it set up various commodity committees to manage the import and export of various commodities; and it set up the Wartime Commerce Investigation Department and the Wartime Commerce Statistics Department, which specialized in investigating the business conditions of neutral countries. Its trade policy mostly adopted the method of agreed trade for various important commodities to prevent aiding the enemy. Judging from the situation of China's foreign trade in the past two years, there are many prohibited commodities that are still sold in markets everywhere in the interior; and China also has many raw materials that are still unreasonably exported. It can be seen that the control organization is not yet perfect. China's trade policy has recently adopted the method of barter trade, which is also a form of agreed trade, but this is limited to a few commodities. There is still a need to fully expand its scope in order to adjust the import and export of commodities and increase the amount of export trade. For example, after the implementation of barter trade, the amount of tea exported in recent years has greatly increased compared to before the war, which is a successful example.

In addition, the Chinese government should also pay special attention to the foreign trade in the occupied areas. Recently, the foreign trade in the occupied areas often accounts for more than 80% of the country's total trade. This is a huge economic force that cannot be ignored. Now the government only restricts the import of the occupied areas by applying for foreign exchange, but it can never prohibit the occupied areas from exchanging imports without exports. This is a serious wartime economic problem and a political problem parallel to military affairs!

### The Japanese Cabinet Will Hold an Emergency Meeting Today to Decide on the Policy for Negotiations on the Tianjin Case; the Preliminary Talks Between Arita and Craigie Seem Likely to Be Cancelled; Negotiations Will Begin After a Date Is Set and Lists Are Exchanged; It Is Generally Expected That the Meeting Will Be Bleak and There Will Be No Good Results

(Tokyo) Regarding the upcoming Anglo-Japanese meeting, the Japanese government has agreed on the points of Japan's "unchanging attitude." It is reported that the Japanese government has decided to hold a special cabinet meeting tomorrow morning. After the cabinet meeting approves the various resolutions, Foreign Minister Arita will go to Hayama to ask the Emperor to approve Japan's policy. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the preliminary talks between Arita and British Ambassador Craigie will be cancelled. Arita will arrange a date to start the meeting with the British Ambassador and exchange lists of representatives. Then, all the representatives will immediately begin negotiations. "Negotiations on local incidents" does not seem to be the main point. General concern will focus on the negotiations between Arita and Craigie regarding Japan's demands. What Japan will demand is that Britain express its willingness to strictly adhere to neutrality in the war in China, and take this as a preliminary condition for starting concrete negotiations on the Tianjin case. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) When the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received journalists this morning, he declared that the agenda of the Anglo-Japanese meeting on the Tianjin incident must wait for the meeting between British Ambassador Sir Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita to be decided. The two will probably meet next week. It is expected that Foreign Minister Arita will demand that Britain first express its willingness to maintain strict neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War. The spokesman denied that the Japanese government was related to the anti-British movement currently being held throughout Japan. A reporter asked whether Japan was instigating the anti-British movement in the occupied areas in China. The spokesman replied, "This question is an insult." He also said that he had not received any information about various minor incidents, such as the recent incident in Qingdao where the British consulate was stoned. He also had no news to release about the recent situation of British military attaché to China, Major-General Spear. As for whether Japan had notified the British authorities in Beijing that it would organize a military court to try Spear and had invited British representatives to participate in the trial, he had not heard anything about it either. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that the Cabinet will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide on the policy for negotiations on the Tianjin case. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tianjin) This morning, another Chinese person was electrocuted and died on the barbed wire fence at the northern end of the British Concession. This is the third Chinese person who has been electrocuted and died after the Japanese officially announced that the barbed wire fence surrounding the British and French Concessions would be electrified. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese side has made thorough preparations for the negotiations on the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin issue. The military and diplomatic departments have drafted the necessary plans and can start negotiations at any time. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita will ask British Ambassador to Japan Craigie to talk with him on Friday to determine the exact date for the start of the talks. Probably, the Anglo-Japanese parties may have a preliminary meeting before Kato and Matsudaira. If so, the formal meeting can probably open on Saturday. (12th Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) Senior officials of the US government today expressed great concern about the changes in the Sino-Japanese situation in the past 48 hours, such as the crowd instigated by the Japanese throwing bricks at the British Consulate and the increasingly severe incident of the Japanese army blockading the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. All of this is clear evidence that the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations will not have any good results. At that time, the situation of foreigners in China will inevitably become more serious. At the same time, the news that the Japanese side will also raise the treaty rights of foreigners in China and other broader issues has aroused great attention here. However, US Secretary of State Hull recently declared that discussing broad issues will inevitably involve the United States. The US is also surprised that the Japanese side will try British military attaché Spear by military court, because Spear is a diplomat and enjoys the benefits of extraterritoriality. Therefore, the arrest of Spear is unprecedented among civilized countries. (12th Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to sources from the British Embassy, the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo meeting will inevitably fall into a deadlock. On the one hand, the views of the two sides are too disparate. Britain is determined not to discuss any issues that will affect Britain's position in the Far East, but Japan very much hopes to discuss this issue. Therefore, even if the Anglo-Japanese parties are related to the issue of British aid to China, the issue of recognizing the New Order in East Asia, and the transfer of silver stored in banks in the British Concession in Tianjin to the Japanese side, conflicts between the Anglo-Japanese parties will still occur from time to time. Furthermore, after Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin have fallen, and Shanghai has become an isolated island, Britain's position in the Far East will become more and more difficult. (12th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) The Times today carried a message from a diplomatic correspondent saying that if the Japanese Cabinet raises broader issues in the Tokyo talks than the Tianjin blockade, the negotiations will not succeed. The British government itself does not want to, and other countries will not allow the discussion of the more extensive demands made by the Japanese military for cooperation in its invasion of China. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) In order to make the anti-British movement spread throughout the country, the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, have ordered their branches in various provinces, cities, and towns to organize anti-British conferences and pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a firm attitude in negotiations with Britain. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Tianjin) Today, Soviet Milkoff supplied two truckloads of milk to the British and French Concessions. However, the White Russian's continued transport of milk to the Concessions was stopped by Japanese sentries. Therefore, the preferential treatment given to Soviet Milkoff by the Japanese sentries is considered bizarre here. According to a Japanese military spokesman, the tense relationship between the Hankou French Concession authorities and the "Wuhan Special Municipality" has nothing to do with the situation in Tianjin. In other words, even if the Hankou French Concession is blockaded by the Japanese, it is another matter and will not have much impact on the resolution of the Tianjin issue. (12th Associated Press dispatch)

### Anti-British Movement Discovered in Jinan

(Beijing) An anti-British movement has also appeared in Jinan. Chinese merchants have been notified that they are allowed to sell old British goods in stock, but newly imported British goods will be confiscated. According to reports, the main British goods sold in Jinan are textiles, kerosene, and cigarettes. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Qingdao) The British authorities have issued a warning, advising Britons not to come to Qingdao for summer vacation for the time being. The warning has been notified to travel agencies and shipping companies in Shanghai and the Far East. It is reported that the British authorities issued this warning because they believe that the Japanese side cannot maintain order in Qingdao. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### British Ship Detained at the Mouth of the Pearl River Has Not Been Released

(Guangzhou) The British small steamer Lilla, which was detained by the Japanese Navy at the mouth of the Pearl River on June 3, has not been released yet. It is reported that British Consul General Blunt lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side on July 2, but has not yet received a reply. It is reported that when the Japanese side detained the ship, it was carrying kerosene ordered by the Chinese government. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Attack Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, and Jiangxi

Hengyang: Two Japanese planes sneaked from Jiangxi into Hunan on the morning of the 12th and dropped four bombs in Youxian at 7:35 a.m., killing and wounding two people each. Then, they sneaked into the airspace over Zhuzhou, circling and observing, and flying low and strafing. (12th dispatch)

(Chongqing) This afternoon, 27 Japanese planes took off from Hankou and raided Fengjie (also known as Kuizhou) on the north bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Sichuan. After dropping bombs in the area, the Japanese planes did not go to Chongqing and flew back. It is reported that Badong, on the border of western Hubei near Sichuan Province, was also bombed by Japanese planes. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Fuzhou) Ten Japanese warships are currently docked in the sea off the coasts of Nanbeilianjiang, Chuanshi, Meihua, Songxia, and other places in Min. Japanese planes took off six times today and dropped more than ten bombs in Changmen and Changle. (11th dispatch)

Shangrao: Two Japanese planes flew east along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang today. At 2:30 p.m., they flew to Hekou and dropped four bombs, and then dropped five bombs in Geyuan. The bombs landed in the wilderness, and the Chinese side suffered no losses. (11th dispatch)

Shangrao: Two Japanese planes sneaked into Hekou Town, which belongs to Tieshan County, at about 3:00 p.m. on the 11th, and dropped four bombs in the suburbs. Another batch of two Japanese planes invaded Gujiang Town, which belongs to Ji'an County, at about 4:00 p.m. and dropped four bombs. The Chinese side suffered no losses. (11th dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Charge into Huaiyuan City, Destroying Japanese Puppet Organizations and Military Supply Warehouses; Japanese Troops Are Panicked, Suffering Many Casualties

Tunxi: On the night of the 6th, Chinese troops in northern Anhui attacked Huaiyuan County. The Japanese troops were caught off guard. The Chinese troops charged into the city, and the Japanese troops were panicked, suffering many casualties. The remaining Japanese troops fled the city and sneaked into Lijiazui. On the morning of the 7th, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked and launched a fierce bombardment with machine guns and artillery. In order to reduce losses, the Chinese army destroyed all Japanese puppet organizations and military supply warehouses in the city and moved to the suburbs. They are still confronting the Japanese army on the west side of the city. (12th dispatch)

### Kong Xiangxi Issues a Statement

(Chongqing) Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan, individually met with the general manager of the Hai Tong News Agency, Mestim, today. Mestim asked what attitude China would take towards the upcoming Anglo-Japanese meeting. Kong replied that if Britain yields to Japan's demands and retreats timidly, China will consider Britain's actions to have harmed its friendship with China. According to Kong's observation, the Anglo-Japanese meeting will focus on the disputes in Tianjin and will not be unlimited, involving general issues of the Far Eastern political situation. As for the Chinese government's conditions for a truce, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China must be a prerequisite. Only when Japan implements the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory will it be possible for China and Japan to hold negotiations. At that time, China is willing to participate whether a third country comes forward to organize a peace conference or an international conference is held. (12th Hai Tong News Agency dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Donate Funds

(Chongqing) Overseas Chinese communities abroad have recently been holding gatherings to donate funds. For example, the Chinese community in Germany launched a memorial service for fallen soldiers and compatriots who died in the war. More than a hundred people, including representatives from various organizations, male and female students, and overseas Chinese, attended. Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Chen, presided over the event, and the atmosphere was extremely somber. Overseas Chinese in Batavia also held a general meeting with great enthusiasm, unanimously supporting the central government's policy of resistance. Councilor Zhuang Xiyan and Qiu Yuanrong each donated 10,000 yuan on the spot. Other overseas Chinese also donated nearly 100,000 yuan for disaster relief. It was also decided to send a telegram of condolence to President Chiang and the soldiers at the front. Furthermore, the total amount of donations from overseas Chinese in Singapore and other British territories in Southeast Asia in April has recently been tallied, reaching a total of over 4.58 million national currency. The Malay Peninsula alone accounted for over 1.7 million. The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese is evident from this. (12th dispatch)

Kuala Lumpur: All overseas Chinese in the Kuala Lumpur jurisdiction support the government's resistance and are in high spirits. The total amount of donations is estimated to reach over 500,000 national currency. (11th dispatch)

### Xinhua Daily Publishes a Special Issue

(Chongqing) The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party recently issued a special issue of its mouthpiece, the Xinhua Daily. The content roughly concerns the demand to resist to the end, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the necessity to oppose compromise and surrender, so as to realize the Three People's Principles advocated by Sun Yat-sen and establish an independent new China. The publication pays tribute to President Chiang, expresses deep gratitude to the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the powers aiding China. It then points out that after its military failures, Japan has had no choice but to engage in political activities. The publication also states that what China is currently experiencing is the oppression of Japan's political schemes and a Far Eastern Munich movement. Therefore, the urgent task at hand is to stop the development of these two. What we should pay special attention to is that compromise is tantamount to surrender and should never be lightly considered. The publication concludes with an appeal to the Chinese people and army to continue the resistance and concentrate the country's material and human resources to achieve final victory. (12th dispatch from Haitong News Agency)

(Chongqing) According to a statement issued by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party not only wholeheartedly supports Generalissimo Chiang but also reveres the Three People's Principles.

(Chongqing) According to sources from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih is currently suffering from heart disease, he has achieved extremely outstanding results, so he will not be replaced as ambassador. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)

### The Japanese Army's Position in China is Becoming Increasingly Difficult. The Chinese Army Will Be Able to Launch a Large-Scale Counteroffensive After a Certain Period.

(Paris) According to Chinese authorities in this city, the Japanese army's position in China is now becoming increasingly difficult. After a certain period, China will be able to launch a large-scale counteroffensive. Currently, the Japanese army only dares to rely on city walls or fortresses for protection and does not dare to venture a step outside the suburbs. Most railways are virtually useless due to guerrilla attacks. At the same time, after Chinese civilians evacuate cities garrisoned by Japanese troops, they are often subjected to relentless attacks by the Chinese army. The Chinese side is now adopting a new strategy of total and simultaneous counteroffensive on all fronts, causing the Japanese side to be stretched thin on all fronts and unable to reinforce one area by weakening another. Although the Japanese army is still superior to the Chinese army in terms of military equipment, it is inferior in terms of numbers. The biggest strategic error of the Japanese army is the excessive length of the front lines and the rear transportation lines, which has given the Chinese side the initiative in military operations. In addition, because the Chinese army has more troops than the Japanese army, the Chinese side can launch simultaneous counteroffensives on several fronts. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)

### Cholera is Rampant in Hankou. The Situation in the French Concession Remains Tense.

(Hankou) The cholera here is spreading rapidly. According to reports from this city, since July 1st, more than 170 people have been admitted to isolation hospitals, of whom 47 have died as a result. The spread of cholera is also related to the Japanese side's unwillingness to supply food and water to the refugee camps in the Wusheng Temple area. Because the refugees have no tap water, they can only draw contaminated water from wells and rivers for drinking. The Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese here still say that the relationship between the French Concession and the "Wuhan Special Municipality" remains tense. The "Wuhan Municipal Government" plans to blockade the French Concession and cut off the supply of food, drinking water, and electricity needed by the concession, urging it to open as soon as possible. Regarding the case of the arrest of members of the "Hua Zhong Youth Federation," it is reported that several members of the association and the five-colored flags they were holding were arrested and confiscated by the French Concession. The "Wuhan Municipal Government" is now demanding the release of the arrested personnel and the return of the flags. Although everything is silent now, this is only the calm before the storm. (11th dispatch from Associated Press)

### Chinese Guerrillas are Very Active in the Jinpu Railway Area

(Tianjin) According to a Japanese military spokesman today, the Japanese troops stationed in the Jinpu Railway area are constantly under the threat of attacks by Chinese guerrillas. It is said that the Chinese guerrillas in the Jinpu Railway area have teams of at least 100 and up to 3,000 members, often attacking isolated Japanese units along the line with superior numbers. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)

### Hong Kong is Negotiating Wireless Communication with the Japanese Authorities in Guangzhou

(Guangzhou) According to a Reuters correspondent, the Hong Kong government is currently in direct wireless communication negotiations with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. It is expected that a contract will be signed today. Once the contract is signed, measures will be taken to close the Shameen Chinese Telegraph Bureau. It is reported that the bureau has decided to close voluntarily, because otherwise it would have to cooperate with Japanese wireless stations. It is also reported that after the above-mentioned new measures are implemented, the Japanese will exercise their right of inspection. (12th dispatch from Reuters)

### Soviet-Mongolian Cooperation to Defend Territory. A Devastating Blow Will Be Delivered to Challengers. Japanese and Manchukuo Troops Rush to the Front Lines for Reinforcements. The Two Sides Have Been Fighting Fiercely for Days in the Nomonhan Area. Manchukuo Expresses Willingness to Hold Border Demarcation Talks with the Soviet Union.

(Moscow) Soviet newspapers recently published unanimous articles commemorating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. Pravda said, "Japan's lackeys are now rampant on the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic, but the Mongolian people remain calm and work hard to engage in creative work and improve the welfare of their motherland. The Mongolian people deeply know that their national defense is solid and challengers will get what they deserve. The guarantee of Mongolia is the close friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet people, which is sufficient to overcome any tests." (11th dispatch from TASS)

(Tokyo) According to a spokesman for the "Manchukuo" government today, "Manchukuo" is prepared to negotiate border conflict incidents with the Soviet Union and is willing to accept any border demarcation proposals from the Mongolian side. The spokesman also stated that the "Manchukuo" government has strongly protested against the illegal border crossings by Mongolian and Soviet troops on two occasions, but the Outer Mongolian government has not only ignored them but has also made the same protest to the Japanese side. According to history and past administration, the Khalkhyn Gol River has always been the natural boundary line between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Now that Mongolia and the Soviet Union have crossed this boundary line, "Manchukuo" and Japan have no choice but to resort to self-defense. Finally, the spokesman hoped that peace would be seen in the border area as soon as possible. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)

Reuters Special Correspondent's Dispatch from the Manchukuo-Mongolian Front Line on the 12th: Since the war shows no sign of ending soon, both sides are sending reinforcements to the front lines. The Japanese side claims that the Soviet Air Force has been reinforced with the latest aircraft from Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The reporter saw several Japanese 6-inch cannons and anti-aircraft guns today being transported to the artillery positions. Yesterday's Soviet air raid was apparently unexpected by the Japanese defense forces. The reporter witnessed two air battles. The first was launched by Soviet aircraft, using a feint to lure Japanese aircraft away from the Japanese water source, and then Soviet aircraft took the opportunity to bomb the Japanese water supply station. The Japanese pilots who participated in the battle with 24 Soviet aircraft yesterday admitted that the battle was the fiercest they had ever fought. Last night, the reporter met 16 Soviet prisoners captured the day before, all of whom were reserve soldiers from farmers in the woodworking areas of Siberia. According to them, they were called up on May 29, not knowing the reason and destination of the call-up, and went straight to the front to fight. They also said that under the fierce machine-gun fire of the Japanese army, the captain told them that resistance was futile, so he waved a white shirt and surrendered. The captain was seriously injured when he surrendered, and one of his legs was amputated this morning. The center of the fierce battles between the two sides is Nomonhan, which is just a sand dune, barren and uninhabited. The Mongolian side in the area also cannot control the higher areas. According to an officer commanding the Japanese army in the battle with the Mongolian army when interviewed by reporters, only a remnant of 200 Soviet troops remain guarding the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River. These people are now in a position of either death or surrender, because all the bridges across the river have been destroyed. The Japanese army has now seized the entire area in the middle of the Kherlen and Khalkhyn Gol rivers. The officer further stated that a small team of Soviet cavalry, assisted by tanks, crossed the Khalkhyn Gol River 18 miles north of the current battlefield, apparently in an attempt to contain the Japanese army, but most of the cavalry team has been driven back. The Japanese army is currently preparing to wipe out the remaining enemies. He believes that the entire area on the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River can be cleared of the "enemy" forces in a very short period of time. Although the exact strength of the Soviet army cannot be ascertained, it is reported from the prisoners that the 36th Siberian Rifle Division, the 4th Mechanized Brigade, and the Mongolian Cavalry are at the front. The reporter met with the commander of the Japanese front-line troops three miles from the front line, and the sound of their conversation was sometimes drowned out by heavy artillery fire. The commander said that the Soviet side might continue to bombard them to harass the Japanese army, but he would try to deal with this harassment.

### Japanese Merchants Exploit Soviet Miners. The Soviet High Court Upholds the Principle and Imposes a Huge Fine.

(Moscow) A certain Japanese coal mining company on Sakhalin Island was fined 374,000 rubles by a Soviet court for failing to fulfill its contract with the Soviet trade union and providing Soviet workers with inferior food and clothing. The Japanese company immediately appealed, and today the High Court of Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky City on the island ruled to uphold the original verdict. Soviet newspapers recently commented that foreign concessionaires should take this ruling as a warning and be vigilant if they want to exploit Soviet workers. According to reports, Japanese Ambassador Tōgō Shigenori had talks with the authorities of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to intercede for the coal mining company, but to no avail. (11th dispatch from Havas)

(Moscow) A dispatch from Vladivostok reports that the Japanese "North Sakhalin Mining Co., Ltd.," which enjoys a concession to mine coal in the Dué area of North Sakhalin Island, reduced its work from 1937 onwards, systematically making the living conditions of workers increasingly difficult, and violating the concession contract, illegally reducing workers' wages and food rations, causing significant losses to the workers and staff of the mine. Although the local coal miners' union mine committee repeatedly protested to the Japanese company, demanding that the workers' food ration quota be maintained, the results were ineffective. Therefore, a lawsuit was filed against the Japanese company, demanding compensation for the workers' losses totaling 375,000 rubles. After local people's judgment, the Japanese company was ordered to pay the full amount. Subsequently, the Japanese company appealed to the local provincial court, and the result was that the appeal was rejected and the original verdict was upheld. The above-mentioned judgment of the Soviet court is a serious warning to those who rashly hope to brazenly obliterate the legal rights of workers in the Soviet Union. (11th dispatch from TASS)

### Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Sends Condolences for the Death of Ludin

(Chongqing) Soviet Ambassador Ludin and his wife died in a car accident. The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association recently sent a telegram of condolence to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The original telegram said, "To the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, translated by the Soviet Embassy: We were shocked and grieved to hear of the sudden death of Ambassador Ludin in a car accident. Mr. Ludin worked hard to promote Sino-Soviet relations, and his great achievements are well-known. The people of our country deeply admire him. We extend our deepest condolences and hope for your understanding. Respectfully, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association." (12th dispatch)

(Moscow) Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, Losovsky, and other senior officials of the committee recently jointly published an article in various newspapers to mourn the deceased Soviet Ambassador to China, Ludin. The article praised Ludin's hard work for the country and his achievements in the diplomatic world. (11th dispatch from Havas)

### Britain Continues Efforts to Stabilize Chinese Currency. Statement by Finance Minister Simon in the House of Commons.

(London) In the British House of Commons today, Finance Minister Simon was asked whether the British government, in view of the resolute attacks on Chinese currency by the Japanese authorities, intends to find a way to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that such continued action is not currently under discussion. Labor Party Belenjer asked Simon whether he was confident that the equalization fund or the remaining equalization fund was still sufficient to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that, as he thought, this kind of question should best not be discussed in a question-and-answer format. Belenjer knew very well the British government's efforts regarding Chinese legal tender. Belenjer said that the reason why he asked this question was just to know whether the government's current intention was the same as when the bill was first proposed. I don't know if the House of Commons can hear this kind of guarantee. Simon replied that he thought his answer had addressed this matter, that is, the government is not currently discussing such continued action. (11th dispatch from Reuters)

### Germany, Italy, and Japan Collude. General Terauchi and Admiral Osumi Will Visit Germany to Attend the Nazi Party Congress.

(Tokyo) Former Army Minister General Terauchi and Military Councilor Admiral Osumi have accepted Hitler's personal invitation to attend the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. The two will depart from Tokyo next Tuesday with their staff and will visit Italy along the way. (12th dispatch from Reuters)

### British and French Parliamentarians are Concerned About the Far East. Exchange of Views on Current Issues.

(London) Five representatives of the French Chamber of Deputies "Sino-French Committee" (composed of 348 members of various parties), arrived in London last night and met with members of the British Parliament this morning, such as Sir Milner of the Conservative Party, Mand of the Liberal Party, Baker of the Labor Party, and Badre of the Independent Party, to exchange views on the Far East issue and had lunch together. Afterwards, one of the French representatives, Socialist Deputy Moudet (former Minister of Colonies), issued a statement saying that their trip was to explain to British parliamentarians the need for organized collective security and resistance to aggression in the Far East. British opposition Labor Party member Baker said that the trip of the French deputies was of an informal nature. Some members of the British Parliament who were willing to discuss the Far East with the French deputies who knew about it invited them to come to consider various measures so that British and French parliamentarians could cooperate closely. In addition, some members of the House of Lords are scheduled to be invited by Lord Lytton (former chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Team) to talk this afternoon to discuss the Far East issue. French deputies will also attend at that time. (12th dispatch from TASS)

### Italian Foreign Minister is in Spain, Encouraging Them to Join the Axis.

Vitoria: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive here this afternoon from the port of Barcelona. Representatives of the Spanish Falangist Party's Blue Shirt Brigade, the Army, and the Italian Fascist Party headquarters all arrived here this morning to prepare for the welcome. A gate has been built outside the airport, and the national flags of Spain and Italy are hung. Shops and residences along the road where the welcoming procession passes are also fluttering with flags. After arriving here, Foreign Minister Ciano plans to travel by car to the Port of Santo Stos to meet with Nationalist Army leader General Franco. A grand welcoming ceremony was also prepared there yesterday. (12th dispatch from Havas)

(Rome) Political figures here recently commented on Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Spain, saying that Italy should do its best to urge Spain to adopt an "imperialist policy" and assist it, so as to be determined to recover British Gibraltar and French Morocco, and then formally make a request. Because the Spain ruled by General Franco occupies an important position in Italy's Mediterranean policy, Italy should promote diplomatic relations with it. Since Spain is ideologically related to the Axis powers, the foreign policy it pursues will inevitably run counter to the interests of Britain and France. A certain Fascist theorist said that if Italy can conclude an alliance treaty with Spain, it is the best way to shift the public's attention, promote attention to diplomacy, and maintain the rule of the Fascist Party. There is no doubt that Italy's diplomacy should grasp this goal. (12th dispatch from Havas)

### Italian Ambassador to the UK Transferred to Seal Keeper, Concurrent Head of Justice

(Rome) Italian Ambassador to the UK, Count Grandi, has now been appointed as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and is taking office in Rome. Grandi is succeeding Mr. Sulmi, who resigned from this position for personal reasons. The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal also serves as Minister of Justice and is entitled to attend cabinet meetings. The selection of the successor to the position of Ambassador to the UK has not yet been announced. (12th dispatch from Reuters)

### The Key to the Negotiations Between the Three Countries. The British and French are Studying the Soviet Counterproposal.

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, after the Soviet side put forward several new proposals on the 9th of this month, the British cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee discussed it today. Foreign Secretary Halifax also met with the French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, to discuss the matter together. Political figures claimed that what Foreign Secretary Halifax and Ambassador Corbin discussed was the most important definition of "indirect aggression." According to news from Paris, the Soviet government hopes that a military agreement will be established first, and then a political agreement will be signed. It is a matter of course that the political agreement should be supplemented by a technical agreement, but the signing of a military agreement should not be a prerequisite. From this point of view, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may not end for a while. (11th dispatch from Havas)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, a member asked about the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that there had been some reports in the past two days, and there was nothing more to add at this time. Opposition Labor Party member Baker then spoke, saying that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had been going on for three and a half months, and the Soviet government had at least shown sincerity at the beginning of the negotiations. It is unknown why it has been delayed until now without success. I hereby request the government to compile and publish the suggestions of both parties so that public opinion across the country can understand where the responsibility lies. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied that all documents would naturally be published before the end of the negotiations, but publishing them at this time might cause criticism and would not be appropriate. Opposition Labor Party member McLean also transferred that if the negotiations had not been successful, who was to blame? We must allow public opinion to have a basis for judgment. The Prime Minister replied again, "When the negotiations are still in progress, it is inappropriate to calculate responsibility." (12th dispatch from Havas)

### The British Government is Drafting a Bill so that the House of Commons Can Still Be Convened in an Emergency During the Dissolution Period.

(London) According to sources familiar with the parliamentary news, the date of the general election of the House of Commons is likely to be in November of this year. For the sake of preparedness, the government hopes to establish a law so that after the dissolution of the House of Commons and before the completion of the re-election, it can be reconvened when the international situation is tense. According to the British constitution, after the dissolution of the House of Commons, it ceases to exist. It can only be reconvened in the event of the monarch's death. (12th dispatch from Havas)

### Thrilling Incident at the New York World's Fair. A Couple Parachuting Hits a Beam and is Rescued After Five Hours.

(New York) A comedy occurred at the amusement park of the World's Fair here last night, which almost caused a disaster. A certain couple planned to parachute from a 230-foot high tower, but in mid-air, their parachute got caught on a beam, and the couple was drifting in the air, unable to get down. They were 120 feet above the ground, and even the highest ladder could not rescue them. Curious people gathered around to watch, and more and more people gathered. Within a few minutes, the number reached as many as 20,000 people. Some people even took the opportunity to sell seats, asking for two US dollars per hour. There were also many searchlights that focused their light on the couple. At first, they tried to be humorous and waved to the crowd from time to time. However, they knew that they would not be able to come down for a long time, and they also glimpsed a huge ambulance for saving lives and helping the wounded parked nearby, so they were frightened and discouraged. Later, the World's Fair authorities mobilized all the police and firefighters to try to rescue them. After five hours, they were rescued, but they were already pale. (12th dispatch from Havas)

### It is Rumored that Germany has Proposed to Poland that Danzig be Jointly Managed by the Two Countries, Attached with Conditions to Occupy a Superior Position, and Deliberately Trying to Break Through the Peace Front.

(London) Political figures here recently received as-yet-unconfirmed news that German leader Hitler intends to make a surprising proposal to the Polish government, advocating that the Free City of Danzig be placed under the joint management of Germany and Poland, while Germany occupies a superior position. The entire territory of the Free City is governed by Germany, while the Port of Danzig and the customs are jointly managed by Germany and Poland. This proposal is attached to the following conditions: (1) Poland should withdraw from the peace front led by Britain and France. (2) Poland should conclude a separate treaty of friendship with Germany to replace the Treaty of Non-Aggression of January 26, 1934 (which has been repealed by Germany). (3) Poland's surplus food should be re-imported into Germany. (4) The Free City of Danzig should be a demilitarized zone. (5) The system of the League of Nations governing the Free City of Danzig should be abolished, and the high commissioner sent by the League of Nations should be expelled. (11th dispatch from Havas)

(London) Poles here claim that whether the Polish government will negotiate with Germany on the issue of the Free City of Danzig depends on whether Germany can first accept the following principle: that is, the Free City of Danzig must maintain its international nature and must not be incorporated into Germany under any circumstances. In addition, Polish Ambassador to the UK, Raczynski, recently returned to his country to report on his work and met with Polish President Mościcki and Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz. He returned to his post yesterday and visited Foreign Secretary Halifax to explain the views of the Polish government and stated that Poland is currently unwilling to sign a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. (11th dispatch from Havas)

### Danzig Builds Military Bridge to Connect with East Prussia

Warsaw. The Danzig city authorities are actively building a temporary bridge over the Vistula River to connect the Free City with the border of East Prussia. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. According to the authorities, the purpose of the bridge is simply to facilitate transportation. However, it is known here that its goal is purely strategic, intending to facilitate the entry of German troops into the city. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

The United States Does Not Wish to Intervene in European Affairs

(Washington) British newspapers report that President Roosevelt may step in to mediate the Danzig issue. Diplomatic circles here consider this to be completely unfounded. Both the President and Secretary of State Hull have repeatedly stated that the United States does not wish to intervene in various European political issues. In addition, given the domestic political situation in the United States, this stance is even less likely to change. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Poland Issues Order to Inspect Recruits

Warsaw. The Polish government has issued an order requiring all Polish men between the ages of twenty and fifty to report for inspection between July 15th of this year and July 15th of next year. After the inspection, the government will assign them to various military units based on their individual personality and qualities. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### Tomorrow is France's National Day: Grand Military Parade to be Held; British Military Leaders Invited to Attend; French Fleet to Conduct Exercises in the Atlantic

(Paris) British Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, Vice-Admiral Pound (First Sea Lord), Air Chief Marshal Newall, and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Gort have been invited by Premier Daladier to come here on July 14th to participate in the French National Day commemoration and ceremony. In addition to the previously announced battalion of the Grenadier Guards, 200 sailors and a military band from the British military will also participate in the parade. On the same day, the French fleet will conduct exercises in the Atlantic Ocean, and the British cruiser "Revenge" will also participate. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Britain's Additional Army Budget: £79 Million for Accelerating National Defense Program; Defense Force Could Reach 480,000

(London) The supplementary army estimate was published this morning, totaling £79 million, accompanied by a statement indicating that the increased expenses will be financed by loans. The items include: £10 million for the regular army and reserves called up for the national defense force; £12 million for increasing the national defense force; £28 million for training the militia; and £36 million for expanding and accelerating various plans related to the army defense program. In terms of resources, in addition to fixed contributions from the Malay States and Indian princes, the Straits Settlements will contribute £500,000. This supplementary estimate will bring the total borrowing under the National Defense Loan Act of 1939 to £145 million and will bring the army estimate to a huge sum of £227 million before deducting this amount. The estimated maximum strength of the militia is 100,000, and the revised strength of the national defense force is 485,000, an increase of 239,000. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Britain Accelerates Shipbuilding Program

(London) The naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" published an article today revealing the names and numbers of new British warships. It is reported that, in addition to the recently launched battleships "King George V" and "Prince of Wales," the battleship "Duke of York" will also be launched on September 16th. In addition, two more battleships, named "Jellicoe" and "Beatty," are expected to be completed within the year. All of the above ships have a displacement of 35,000 tons. Next, the warships to be completed by the end of this year include five light cruisers, namely "Fiji," "Nigeria," "Mauritius," "Trinidad," and "Kenya," each with a displacement of 8,000 tons. In addition, there are seven small cruisers of 5,450 tons each, four aircraft carriers of 23,000 tons each, ten to fifteen destroyers of 1,700 tons each, and nine submarines of 1,090 tons each. In addition, the work on refitting the battleships "Queen Elizabeth," "Valiant," and "Renown" will soon be completed. The first two have a displacement of 30,600 tons, and the last one has a displacement of 32,000 tons. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

(London) According to a public announcement here, Prime Minister Chamberlain has been appointed Honorary Air Commodore of the Royal Air Force, belonging to the 1916-level Auxiliary Air Force. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### British Air Force's Powerful Capability: Range of 2,000 Kilometers; Flew in Formation from France Back to Britain, Demonstrating Close Ties Between the Two Countries

(London) Regarding the matter of twelve squadrons of British Air Force bombers flying to France for training flights, several squadrons of light bombers took off at 9:00 this morning and flew 1,300 kilometers over French airspace, returning to Britain at 1:00 in the afternoon. The remaining squadrons of heavy bombers took off at 8:00 this morning and returned at 2:00 in the afternoon, making a non-stop flight of 2,000 kilometers over southwestern France. According to responsible individuals here, the training flights of British bombers are a normal occurrence, but flying to France is a first. The purpose is to familiarize pilots with flying in foreign lands, and this will continue to be done in the future. Political figures say that this move is of great significance. Not only does it demonstrate the close and inseparable relationship between Britain and France, but it also shows the world the strength of the British Air Force and the range of its aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Berlin's Displeasure: Newspapers All Publish Articles Criticizing it as Foolish Provocation

(Berlin) The matter of 150 British bombers flying to France for exercises has been fiercely attacked by all newspapers here, which say that this is a tactic with two purposes: one is to show strength and comfort to the Allied country, France, and the other is to intimidate the future enemies of the peace front. The "Völkischer Beobachter" (People's Observer) stated, "The world will not forget, when looking at this clumsy intimidation, that the German Air Force has repeatedly established remarkable achievements in the Spanish Civil War and is still the most elite air force in the world. In particular, the strength of its combat range has not yet been fully understood by the world." The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" (Berlin Stock Exchange Daily) stated, "This kind of threat cannot influence us in any way. We are dealing with it calmly. If we listen to the speeches made by certain ministers in that country, we are indifferent to the existence of these airplanes. If Britain intends to imply to us that this kind of 'invincible air force' may one day appear over the German cities of Leipzig, Nuremberg, and Hamburg, then it underestimates our common sense too much." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### New German Army Units: Mechanized Cavalry Infantry Named "Rapid Deployment Force"

(Berlin) The army authorities have recently ordered that each armored car regiment and cavalry regiment should be reorganized into a new unit on the 17th of this month, called the "Rapid Deployment Force." All anti-tank teams, motorcycle teams, bicycle teams, mechanized reconnaissance teams, and light infantry teams should also be included. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### Italy Issues Expulsion Order: Contains Political and Military Significance; Britain Investigates the Truth; France and Switzerland Have Lodged Protests; The Strategic Position of the Upper Adige Region is Important; A Glimpse of the Evolution of the European Situation Can Be Seen Here

(Rome) The British and French ambassadors and the Dutch minister to Italy first went to the Italian Foreign Ministry today to inquire about the order limiting foreigners from leaving South Tyrol. This foreign exit order applies to the entire border area of Bolzano, including Merano and Braies. Foreigners will not be allowed to go out of this area, except for those in transit. Many tourists are said to have received notice to leave at noon, but foreigners residing there for a long time are given a longer deadline to settle their affairs. It is estimated that 30 British, 15 French, 40 to 50 Dutch, and some Swiss citizens are affected, most of whom have resided in the area for many years. It is heard that the Italian side says that this expulsion order is of a political and military nature. It is heard that two American citizens are not on the list of those to be expelled. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(London) Regarding the Italian government's order for foreigners to leave the Tyrol province, the Foreign Office has instructed the British Embassy in Italy to conduct an investigation. It is reported that 15 British citizens in the province have all received the order conveyed by Italian officials, but the reason is unknown even to these officials. At this moment, the British official attitude is completely silent, but leftists have already spoken of launching retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(London) Britain, France, and Switzerland plan to protest to the Italian government regarding Italy's expulsion of foreigners from South Tyrol. It is heard that the British government has instructed the British ambassador to Rome to obtain the truth from the Italian government before lodging a protest with the Italian side. France and Switzerland have already lodged protests. Switzerland points out that this action by Italy has clearly violated the Italo-Swiss agreement. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)

(Rome) Italian newspapers have not mentioned a word about the order for foreigners to leave the Upper Adige region of Italy (including the Tyrol province and the Bolzano province). Foreign observers here have recently commented that the motive is of a military and economic nature. The Upper Adige region is an industrial center and a hub for important railway lines. In the event of war between the totalitarian states and the democracies, the Alps will become a battlefield, and the Upper Adige region will be at the forefront. Strategically, the relationship is extremely important. Now, it is said that Italy intends to make military preparations in this area and does not want foreigners to discover secrets, so there is the expulsion of foreigners. The fact that Italian newspapers have now begun an anti-espionage campaign seems to corroborate the above suspicions. A glimpse of how the Italian authorities view the evolution of the European situation can be seen here. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(London) The Italian government's order for foreigners to leave the two Tyrol provinces continues to be of concern to British public opinion, firstly because British subjects are also affected, and secondly because the Italian government's intention in this move remains unclear. A morning newspaper recently published a dispatch from Geneva stating that German troops are being moved along the Brenner Pass (the border between Germany and the Tyrol province of Italy). The Italian government does not want foreigners to discover secrets, so it has issued the expulsion order. Responsible individuals here say that this is speculation, and it is not yet possible to confirm it, but the government authorities have also imagined this possibility, so they are very concerned, not only because it involves British citizens. The British Embassy in Italy is continuing to conduct investigations in the hope of ascertaining the reason. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Roosevelt Seeks Successor: Favors McNutt

(Washington) President Roosevelt has appointed Paul Vories McNutt, High Commissioner to the Philippines, as Federal Security Administrator. Observers say that this appointment is of great political significance. McNutt's friends are strongly urging him to be a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1940. It is heard that President Roosevelt has promised that if he decides not to run for a third term, he will allow McNutt to continue his campaign for president. It is also said that if Roosevelt remains president and has McNutt as his vice president, it would be even more ideal. Several days ago, McNutt stated that if Roosevelt intends to run for re-election, he will definitely not contend for the Democratic presidential nomination in next year's election. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Britain and Romania Establish Commercial Agreement

(London) A commercial agreement between Britain and Romania was signed today by the Board of Trade. The content of the agreement stipulates the use of a £5.5 million loan granted by Britain to Romania and the method by which Britain will purchase 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat.

### US Neutrality Law Amendment Issue Postponed for Discussion: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Votes to Decide; Postponed for Reconsideration During Next Congressional Session; Pittman Proposes Ban on War Supplies to Japan

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee studied the neutrality law amendment issue on Thursday, and immediately decided by a vote of twelve to eleven to postpone the discussion until the next session of Congress. The committee has a total of twenty-three members. A few days ago, eleven members supported immediate discussion, ten members advocated postponement, and the remaining two members, independent Democratic Senators Gillette and George, had not yet decided their attitude. Until the last moment, they supported postponement. In addition, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, proposed banning the shipment of ammunition and metal mixtures to Japan. This case will be submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion on the 14th of this month. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided today by a vote of twelve to eleven to postpone consideration of the government's proposed neutrality bill until the next congressional session. This is a major blow to President Roosevelt, who hoped that Congress would resolve the neutrality issue during this session. The government originally intended to obtain the cancellation of the ban on arms exports to belligerent countries based on its proposed plan, and replace it with a cash-and-carry approach, so that Britain and France could benefit from it in the event of war. Now that this case has been resolved by the Foreign Relations Committee, it is heard that Democratic leader Senator Barkley will immediately propose in the Senate that if Barkley can get the Senate to approve his motion and remove the Foreign Relations Committee's responsibility to consider the neutrality bill, then the Senate can directly handle this case. After receiving the report from the Foreign Relations Committee that the case had been resolved, Secretary of State Hull immediately consulted with President Roosevelt on how to deal with the aftermath. After the meeting, Hull stated that for the sake of peace and security, the government will continue to advocate that Congress adopt the government's neutrality program. Senate Majority Leader Minton recently stated that President Roosevelt may force the neutrality bill to be handled without any decision from the Foreign Relations Committee. There are rumors of a special session of Congress being convened, because the development of world affairs may require the United States to decide on a neutrality approach before the next session of Congress. Judging from Secretary of State Hull's remarks, there will be a fierce battle in the Senate, because according to the opinions of government party leaders, the Bloom Bill passed by the House of Representatives has obtained sufficient votes to repeal the articles prohibiting arms exports. The government side still believes that the number of votes that the opposition in the Senate can recruit will definitely not exceed 35 to 40, so the government will definitely win a majority of the votes. The government side said that the opposition's attitude at a time when the European situation is so tense is tantamount to playing with fire. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(London) People here believe that the US Senate's rejection of discussing the Bloom Bill has dealt a serious blow to the British and French governments, who are trying to create a balance of power in Europe. Currently, British officials are unwilling to publicly express their opinions on the US neutrality case, but they deeply hope that the embargo articles can be abolished, and if this happens, the Rome-Berlin axis countries will face a major threat. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)

Pittman Proposes Content of the Case

(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced today that he had submitted a joint resolution to the committee, advocating that the President be authorized to restrict foreign trade for any signatory country of the Nine-Power Treaty that discriminates against the United States. This kind of plan has been frequently discussed in all circles of Congress, and it is considered an economic measure to warn Japan against its activities in China. According to Pittman, the Foreign Relations Committee has agreed to consider this case at a special meeting convened on Friday. The purpose is to cut off the supply of war materials to Japan. The exports to be restricted or completely prohibited will include ammunition, war materials such as steel, gasoline, oil, scrap steel, and scrap iron. Pittman said that he is sure that there will be action on this case during the last session of Congress. Pittman was one of the senators who voted against postponing consideration of the government's proposed neutrality bill. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Roosevelt Will Send Message to Congress

(Washington) According to authoritative sources, President Roosevelt will send a message to Congress within a week, requesting that Congress must decide on the neutrality issue during this session. In this message, the President will use very strong language to ask Congress to abolish the clauses prohibiting the supply of arms to belligerent countries, and at the same time, he will emphasize the current international situation, state the basic principles of American foreign policy, and reiterate that the United States must morally use all means "decided on war" to help protect the independence and territorial integrity of small countries. It is heard that the nature of Roosevelt's message is roughly the same as the draft resolution proposed by Pittman to prohibit the supply of materials to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty.

US Secretary of State Issues Statement

(Washington) After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to postpone discussion of the neutrality law amendment issue, Secretary of State Hull immediately visited President Roosevelt to discuss the matter, and then issued a statement to the press, saying, "I have previously proposed six points that I believe are necessary for the United States to defend its interests and maintain peace and security. These views have not changed from the beginning of the neutrality law issue to the present. The so-called six points are: one, restricting Americans from traveling to war zones; two, prohibiting American ships from entering these war zones; three, for goods shipped to belligerent countries, ownership should be transferred to foreign buyers before export; four, the current laws regarding cash or credit lending to belligerent countries should be maintained; five, regulations should be formulated for charitable donations for belligerent countries; six, the current inspection system for arms exports and the method of applying for import and export licenses for arms should continue to be implemented." In addition, when President Roosevelt met with reporters, when asked what he planned to do to get the Senate to continue discussing the neutrality law issue, the President refused to answer, only expressing his agreement with the statement made by Secretary of State Hull, and saying that among the six points, only one point is included in the current neutrality law. When asked when Congress would adjourn, the President also did not give a clear answer. Regarding this level, political figures explained that President Roosevelt at this moment may be in talks with the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, hoping to find a solution to the current situation. According to the President's intention, he may order the Senate and House of Representatives to continue to meet, even at the expense of offending the anger of the members. This level can be done simply by proposing other bills other than the neutrality law issue. People around the White House said that the President may order Congress to continue to meet for two months. During this period, if the European situation becomes tense, he will order them to discuss the neutrality law issue. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Political Figures Mostly Satisfied

(Washington) After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to postpone discussion of the neutrality law amendment issue, political figures were generally satisfied. Although the opposition claimed that this was another setback for the government, those who supported the current foreign policy and hoped to abolish the arms embargo clause said that a majority of senators had decided to obstruct the establishment of the neutrality law amendment. Therefore, today, rather than immediately submitting the case to the Senate for discussion and ultimately failing, it is not yet known whether postponing the discussion will lead to favorable results. In particular, many of the President's advisors and senior officials of the State Department have said that it is advisable not to insist, so that public opinion can have ample time to study the situation and then express its attitude during the congressional recess. In short, apart from prohibiting the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, there is no clause in the current neutrality law that can protect American commerce and the lives of the American people in wartime. Not only is the government dissatisfied with this level, but even the isolationists who fear that the United States will be dragged into the whirlpool of war are also dissatisfied. In the end, they all agree that amendment is necessary. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 11th)

House Foreign Affairs Committee Changes Chairman

(Washington) After the death of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds, the vacancy has been filled by the election of Democratic Representative Bloom. This person has proposed the neutrality law amendment, advocated abolishing the arms embargo clause, and has always strongly supported President Roosevelt's policies. For several months, he has actually served as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### US Lowers Silver Prices: Intended for Japan

(London) Financial figures in London believe that in the past week the US treasury authorities allowing the price of foreign silver to fall is implemented in order to deal with Japan. This is said to be part of a plan of the democratic countries so Japan does not reap economic benefits from the British and American Aid to China campaign. According to news from the London financial world, the Chinese currency balance fund has been discontinued because Japan got more of the benefits than China did. The result was a major blow to Japan. (According to reports, the committee is mainly organized by the British.) It is said that the Japanese authorities, in the occupied area of North China, collect silver from the people, sold it to the London market according to the high price set by the United States. However, because Japan infringed on British and American interests in China, this aid to Japan has stopped being implemented. It is reported that this measure was decided to implement retaliation.

### From Recent Border Conflicts, Speculating on a Soviet-Japanese War
### By Wen Hu

### Extending the War Against China, Japan Wants to Fight But Cannot; The Soviet Union Continues Construction, Currently Seeming to Have No Intention of Waging War

In the southwest of Heilongjiang province, bordering Outer Mongolia, there is a river of strategic importance that flows northwest into Lake Buir, the Khalkhyn Gol, with lush vegetation on both banks suitable for grazing. The Outer Mongolians were originally nomadic people who did not pay much attention to things like national borders. Seeing the good grass on the opposite bank, they drove their livestock across. Sadly, the few puppet soldiers on the opposite bank, under Japanese control, understood little about anything else, but they did have a slight understanding of the concept of border violations. Now that Outer Mongolians had entered, it seemed they should be driven out, and thus the conflict began.

Conflict Begins

Once there is conflict, there must be victory and defeat. The winning side takes advantage of the situation to pursue, and the losing side quickly reinforces. If Party A is thwarted by Party B's reinforcements, it will find a way to obtain reinforcements greater than Party B's to counterattack Party B. If Party B suffers a loss, it will also find a way to obtain even greater reinforcements to counterattack Party A. Thus, both sides continue to reinforce and counterattack. A minor conflict can easily lead to a large-scale war. Recently, Japanese wire reports stated that the Soviet Union had transferred 60,000 troops from the Lake Baikal region in Siberia to aid Outer Mongolia. The fact that the Japanese side released this news indicates that Japan will also send a corresponding or even larger number of reinforcements to deal with the Soviet Union. As a result, the war between the Soviet Union and Japan will become increasingly serious.

This is only in terms of the conflict in the Nomonhan area. We know that the border between Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia is not just along the Khalkhyn Gol, and in addition to this border between Manchukuo and Mongolia, there are endless borders between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo. When the Nomonhan War becomes intense, one side may use a feint to the east and attack in the west, suddenly attacking in another place where the two sides border, to contain the opponent's military strength and relieve the siege of Nomonhan. This is a very common strategy. In such a vast area like the border between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo, this strategy is even more useful and easy to implement. At that time, a formal war between the Soviet Union and Japan will also occur.

The question we want to study now is: Will the war between the Soviet Union and Japan break out because of this?

Japan's Plan

War between the Soviet Union and Japan will happen sooner or later. Not only do people in third countries say this, but the people of the Soviet Union and Japan also acknowledge it. Think about it: the Soviet Union has air force bases in its two strongholds in the Pacific, Vladivostok and Khabarovsk (formerly Nikolayevsk), and these two places are only 700 miles away from Tokyo and other industrial areas of Japan. This is something that Japan cannot ignore. According to its wishes, the Soviet Union's defense line should be moved westward, to west of Lake Baikal, so that the threat it faces would not be so unbearable. Its consistent policy has been moving in this direction. For example, in 1919, taking advantage of the Soviet Union's internal turmoil, it began to occupy the coastal provinces of Siberia, including Vladivostok, until 1923, when it was forced by the situation to return the occupied territories. Also, since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan had already occupied the southern half of Sakhalin Island, which belonged to Russia, a region extremely rich in oil. However, after the outbreak of the European War, it then occupied the northern part of the peninsula, until 1925, when it was again forced to return it.

Japan's railway policy in Manchukuo even more clearly demonstrates Japan's ambition to drive Soviet forces west of Lake Baikal. After purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union, it began to add branch lines, two of which directly connected to the Soviet border, and one directly connected to Outer Mongolia. At the same time, it also opened new military ports in Korea, namely Seishin and Rason, with the aim that from then on, Japanese troops heading to northern Manchuria would not have to pass through Dalian and the South Manchuria Railway, shortening the journey by two or three days during transportation. This,

If we want to understand its intentions, we only need to compare the transportation situation of the Soviet Union in the Far East. The main transportation route of the Soviet Union in the Far East is naturally the Siberian Railway. That is a railway parallel to the Heilongjiang River, north of the Heilongjiang River, and very close to the Heilongjiang River. Once the Soviet-Japanese war breaks out, Japan can use the convenience of the new military ports and new railways to transport large troops to the Heilongjiang River in a short period of time, cutting off the Siberian Railway and preventing it from connecting east and west. Once this route is cut off, the Soviet Union will be unable to supply its troops in the Far East, and the garrisons in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk will be cut off from their rear lines. This is a fatal blow that Japan can inflict on the Soviet Union's Far East forces.

Soviet Countermeasures

The Soviet Union, seeing Japan's intentions, quickly launched countermeasures. What are the countermeasures? It is to build a parallel line to the Siberian Railway to the north of the Siberian Railway, starting from a town called Taishet located west of Lake Baikal, heading southeast, directly to Komsomolsk on the Pacific coast, which is another newly built town located north of Vladivostok. This newly built railway is also connected to the Siberian Railway in Khabarovsk. Khabarovsk is the location of the Soviet Union's Far East military headquarters, and the army's defenses are very tight. It is difficult for Japan to advance north from that place again and cut off the newly built railway. That railway is now mostly completed and will soon be open to traffic. With this preparation, the Soviet Union has nothing to fear even if Japan cuts off its Siberian Railway. Moreover, the Siberian Railway has now been laid with double tracks, and several important sections have even been laid with triple tracks. Seeing such arrangements by the Soviet Union and Japan, we know how deep their intentions are and how strict their war preparations are. However, the war between the two countries will definitely not happen at this time.

Japanese Concerns

From Japan's position, naturally, the earlier such a war breaks out, the better. Since the Great Revolution, the Soviet Union has completed two five-year plans one after another, and the third five-year plan is underway. The fourth and fifth five-year plans will definitely continue. Every year the war is delayed, the Soviet Union will have one more year to prepare. During this delay, Japan's preparations can also proceed simultaneously, but Japan's preparations have almost reached a saturation point and cannot advance at the same rate as the Soviet Union. Therefore, "doing it early" is actually beneficial to Japan. However, in reality, Japan's military operations in China are becoming increasingly rigid, and it will be impossible to end them without three to five years. When it thinks of this, it cannot help but make considerable concessions. Moreover, Japan started with "taking advantage of opportunities." In its war against China, it also initially wanted to "take advantage of opportunities," but because it did not have a thorough understanding of Chinese national consciousness, it backfired. Now, when dealing with the Soviet Union, it must not repeat the same mistake. What it considers "clever" is to start when the Soviet Union is busy with matters in Europe, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. As for now, it will always be tough first. If toughness doesn't work, it will then "read the situation" itself.

Soviet Attitude

As for the Soviet Union, now also seems to be a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan's involvement in China to launch a surprise attack and deliver a head-on blow, which will definitely put Japan to death. However, international entanglements are never so simple. In addition to its powerful enemy in the East, the Soviet Union also has a Hitler lurking behind it. It should be known that the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is, frankly speaking, just a German-Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union. Moreover, Stalin is a very pragmatic politician. He is focusing on construction at home, and war and construction are difficult to reconcile. Construction can enhance the Soviet Union's status, while war will place the Soviet Union's national destiny in a precarious situation of uncertain success or failure. Comparing the two, it is naturally more prudent to remain calm and not lightly talk about war. Moreover, the Soviet Union's war against Japan is not a "healing war" but just a "preventive war." Since it is a "preventive war," it is always better to avoid it if possible. Moreover, now that China is at war with Japan, the Soviet Union does not have to come forward personally. It only needs to provide substantial assistance to China to weaken Japanese forces in the same period and achieve the effect of a "preventive war." Under such circumstances, why should it bother to step forward to fight?

Observing the Future

In short, Japan is currently unable to fight, and the Soviet Union's current position is that it can fight but has no intention to. But the result is the same by different routes, which can prevent a war between the Soviet Union and Japan from happening for the time being.

We believe that the outcome of Nomonhan will be similar to the outcome of Changkufeng. During the Changkufeng conflict, Japan claimed that Soviet troops had invaded the Manchukuo border, but the Soviet Union replied that its people went to that mountain every year at that time, indicating that it was Soviet territory. When Japan was tough, it later softened when the situation was unfavorable, allowing the Soviet people to continue "walking" on that mountain. Regarding the Nomonhan conflict, Japan again claimed that Outer Mongolian people had invaded the Manchukuo border. If the Emperor's spirit could drive the nomadic experts of Outer Mongolia from the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol, that would be the best outcome. If not, when the time comes when they really cannot continue to fight, they will have to let these experts continue to graze there until winter arrives and the vegetation dries up.

### The Dignity of Teachers in Guangxi
### The Guangxi Provincial Government Orders Educational Institutions to Change the Term "Mr." to "Teacher"

Guilin Correspondence. The saying of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao has been a kind of slogan in our country's Confucianism. Since the Zhou Dynasty, it has been followed by successive generations without change. After the Revolution of 1911, the dignity of teachers gradually declined. Students no longer knew how to respect their teachers. In recent times, scholars regarded the saying of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao as a product of the feudal era and even thought about breaking it down. Thus, the dignity of teachers was almost completely lost. The Guangxi Provincial Government authorities recently issued a circular, instructing all educational institutions and primary and secondary schools to require students in all schools to uniformly address educators or tutors as "Teacher" from now on. All institutions and organizations that appoint or hire educators must uniformly change the term to "Teacher." After the issuance of this order, the momentum of "Teacher"

was greatly enhanced. In the past, Confucius lectured at Nishan, with three thousand disciples, and later generations called him the First Teacher, without adding "old". Later, Xun Kuang, at the age of fifty, studied in Qi, advocated propriety and encouraged learning, clarifying the teachings of Zhou and Confucius. He served as libationer three times, and the scholars revered him. Therefore, the Historical Records of Xun Qing says, "During the time of King Xiang, Xun Qing was the most respected teacher." The name "Teacher" probably originated from this. The meaning is the most respected teacher in terms of seniority. During the Han Dynasty, Emperor Gaozu, who had seized the country on horseback, looked down on Confucianism, and the dignity of teachers also declined. Therefore, Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty began to write "On Teachers," and the dignity of teachers revived. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, students universally addressed their teachers as "Teacher". Students addressed their examiners as "Teacher," and students of prefectural and county schools addressed academic officials such as instructors and trainers as "Teacher". Today, primary school students universally address faculty and staff as "Mr." "Mr." means

"one who was born before me," which is also a title for those with virtue and seniority. Although the term cannot be regarded as completely wrong, it is far from the meaning that one must have a teacher to learn. The Guangxi authorities, because Chairman Chiang stressed the importance of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao at the Third National Education Conference, specifically issued this decree to ensure that the name matches the reality and to correct students' respectful address for teachers. The following is the text of the Guangxi Provincial Government's circular to all administrative regions, county governments, and educational institutions and organizations: (Title omitted) It has been found that students in secondary schools and elementary schools in this province, except for a few places that call them "Teacher," most places call them "Mr." According to the world, calling a teacher "Mr." is only because their virtue and learning are slightly better and they were born before me. In reality, there is a great discrepancy between the name and the reality.

If the name is not correct, how can the Dao be respected? It is understandable that the dignity of teachers has been taken lightly. However, according to ancient times, the dignity of teachers was extremely respected. It gradually declined during the Han and Wei Dynasties, and it worsened during the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, Han Yu wrote "On Teachers" to clarify the principle that one must have a teacher to learn. From then on, the world began to know to respect teachers again. For more than a thousand years since the Tang Dynasty, scholars in China have all known the dignity of teachers and have all known to call their teachers "Teacher." With the name being correct, teachers dare not belittle themselves, and students will also follow the rules and be respectful and reverent, without daring to overstep. Since the founding of the Republic of China, old systems have gradually been abolished, and new rules have not been established. In this transitional period, scholars despised feudalism, considering teachers as a product of feudalism and abolishing them. School students even regard teachers as

knowledge peddlers. Inside the classroom, there is a distinction between teacher and student, but outside the school gate, there is no difference between them and strangers. It has been a long time since teachers have viewed themselves as non-teachers and students have viewed themselves as non-students. If the teacher is not strict, the Dao will not be respected. If the Dao is not respected, the people will not know to respect learning. They are scattered and disorderly, indulgent and arrogant. To transform the people and establish customs, is it not difficult? The national crisis has reached this extreme, and the traces of cause and effect are not difficult to find. The lessons of the past are not far away, and the mistakes of the past can be avoided. The way to remedy this is to follow the instructions of the President at the Third National Education Conference, trace the roots and guide the origins,

and respect teachers and value the Dao. The term "Mr." should be changed to "Teacher" to show respect. Except for university teachers, who already have fixed titles such as professor, lecturer, and teacher, which will not be changed, all primary and secondary school teachers should be uniformly changed to "Teacher." All articles of association of secondary schools and elementary schools that have the word "educator" should be changed to "teacher." In the future, when appointing teachers to various schools, the appointment letters should use the word "teacher," and the principals of each school should instruct the students to call the teachers "Teacher." With this change, there will be a new look, and both teachers and students will be more conscious. Teachers will not lose their role as teachers, and students will not lose their role as students, so that teachers are strict and the Dao is respected, and the people know to respect learning. Transforming customs and educating the people will depend on this. The future of the country will be hopeful. This is ordered to be circulated to all to comply with.

### In the Suburbs of Suzhou,
### Chinese Troops Win
### Puppet Troops in Baitaxiang Disarmed

Suzhou Correspondence. Recently, a large number of powerful Chinese troops have arrived in the four villages of Suzhou, and they are active everywhere, causing the Japanese army to be exhausted. On the 8th of this month, in one day, Chinese troops attacked the two key points of Taipingqiao and Baitaxiang in the suburbs, and both were victorious. It is reported that the Japanese puppet army suffered heavy losses, and the field hospital of the Japanese army in Suzhou has been filled. Therefore, the wounded puppet soldiers have been sent to various small hospitals in this county, which shows that the battles in the two places were very fierce. The details are recorded as follows:

Taipingqiao

Taipingqiao is located outside the Loumen gate of this county, controlling the throat of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway. This Chinese military counterattack was planned in advance. The area was originally stationed with more than 50 puppet pacification troops and 20 Japanese soldiers. When the Chinese troops attacked in two directions, the Japanese puppet troops collapsed and retreated into the city in less than an hour. Because it was very close to the city, the Chinese troops knew that the Japanese puppet troops would definitely make a comeback after retreating, so they completely destroyed the fortifications built by the Japanese puppet troops there, and set fire to many houses where the Japanese army was stationed. On the night of the 9th, at 2:00 AM, the Japanese puppet troops led a large force to attack. The Chinese troops ambushed in the hills, and when the advance troops of the Japanese puppet troops reached the vicinity of Yaojiajiao, the Chinese troops fired their guns, surrounding them from all sides. A fierce battle began and lasted until 3:00 PM. Except for those who escaped, the rest of the Japanese puppet troops were either wounded or killed. In this battle, the Chinese troops also lost one battalion commander and seven soldiers.

Baitaxiang

At dawn on the 9th, the Chinese mobile troops stationed in Taihu Lake suddenly advanced towards Musu Baitaxiang (the entrance to the Suzhou area of Taihu Lake). There was a puppet army district headquarters in the town. When the Chinese troops arrived in front of the puppet commander's gate, all the puppet soldiers were still sleeping. When the Chinese troops rushed into the puppet headquarters, they realized the change, but it was too late to resist. All the puppet soldiers were captured. The Chinese troops escorted a puppet company commander and three platoon leaders to a certain place, and then released all the rest after earnestly persuading them. In this battle, the Chinese troops did not lose a single soldier, and obtained a large number of rifles and one machine gun. This is an important achievement in recent months.

### In the Xuzhou Area,
### The Japanese Army Suffers Losses Everywhere
### Guerrilla Forces in Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Peixian and Fengxian Are Extremely Active
### Heavy Japanese Casualties in the Battle of Phoenix Mountain

Xuzhou Correspondence. In the Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Peixian, Fengxian, and Dangshan areas of Xuzhou, the Chinese guerrilla forces are very well organized and constantly attack the Japanese army, posing a major threat. The previous day, Japanese cavalry with two trucks went to the Tongshan and Xiaoxian areas to search. When they passed Phoenix Mountain, they encountered the Xiaoxian Regular Army of the Chinese side and the ×th Route Army and engaged in battle. Li Ruichen, the company commander of the Regular Army, took the lead and was killed by a bullet in the abdomen. The Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties. The Chinese army captured one machine gun and more than ten rifles. The Japanese army was defeated and fled back to the city. Zhang Lijun, the commander of the Tongshan Chinese Regular Army, led dozens of soldiers to dismantle the bridge between Sanbao and Caocun on the Jinpu Railway. A Japanese military vehicle heading north passed through the area and fell into the river, suffering heavy losses. The Xuhai Highway is also constantly damaged by the Chinese guerrilla forces. Therefore, more than 100 Japanese troops stationed in Pantang, the seventh district of Tongshan, were ordered to patrol back and forth in several cars. Once discovered, they forcibly conscript nearby civilians to build roads at any time. The 30 Japanese troops stationed in Yangzhuangji, the seventh district of Tongshan, were frightened and erected barbed wire fences around them for defense. They also forced resident He Yongzhi to organize a puppet maintenance association. Before three days had passed, He was captured by the Chinese Regular Army, severely punished, and ordered to report the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army from time to time to facilitate Chinese military operations. He was then released.

The Japanese army is now trying to recruit more than 1,000 bandits and puppet troops, giving them extremely strict training at Jiuli Mountain. These bandits and puppet troops, who were accustomed to being free and unrestrained, secretly contacted the Chinese ×th Route Army and suddenly revolted. More than a dozen Japanese officers who were training them were arrested, and more than ten rifles were captured. The Japanese army is suffering losses everywhere and has no way to solve the problem. Recently, they specially recruited a "Civil Corps" and planned to transport them to "Manchuria" for training. Anyone who recruits one person will receive a reward of three yuan. The residents saw through their tricks, and no one responded.

### Pacific Typhoon Violently Lashes Shanghai Yesterday: Fierce Winds and Torrential Rains Arrive Like Mountains Overturning the Sea; Low-lying Areas Become a Vast Expanse Like a Water Kingdom

The typhoon that originated in the Ryukyu Islands of the Pacific Ocean, touched Shanghai with its outer edge yesterday morning. It made landfall south of Shanghai in the afternoon. The fierceness of the wind was unprecedented in decades. From 8:00 AM yesterday to 5:00 PM in the evening, the wind had not subsided. Throughout the day, telephone and tram services were temporarily disrupted in some areas. Shop signs and roadside advertisements, as well as the glass windows of residents' homes, were damaged almost everywhere. According to reliable statistics, the losses from this disaster are no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. Furthermore, the 50,000 refugees in the city, already displaced by war, were hit by this typhoon, making their situation truly pitiable.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the first typhoon of the season reached northern China and approached Shanghai after noon, causing walls to collapse, roofs to be blown away, and many people to be injured. According to the Siccawei Observatory's noon report, the typhoon was estimated to pass west of Shanghai between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM. At that time, the typhoon's position was at 30.45 degrees north latitude and 122.30 degrees east longitude, within 15 miles. The wind was moving towards the northwest-west but showed a tendency to move north again. At 2:25 PM, traffic between Zhejiang Road and Yu Qiaqing Road on Nanjing Road was temporarily suspended due to fallen power lines blown down by the wind.

The Customs Office First Hoisted a Ball as a Warning

The typhoon that originated in the Ryukyu Islands of the Pacific Ocean developed to the point that, by 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was rapidly advancing towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, posing a significant threat to Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs immediately hoisted a black ball on the roof of the new Customs House on the Bund and on the lighthouse at the Customs Wharf on Weituoma Road (Yangshupu), and at night, replaced it with a red light to indicate that the typhoon might strike Shanghai, warning all kinds of ships to stop leaving port. Civilian ships and sailboats sailed to the waters off Lujiazui in Pudong to take shelter from the wind.

Fierce Winds Roared, Accompanied by Torrential Rain

At 6:00 AM yesterday, the typhoon had reached 30 degrees north latitude and 122.5 degrees east longitude, with the center of the wind force within a 30-nautical-mile radius, rapidly advancing in a northwest direction. According to reports, its location was east of the Zhoushan Islands, only 80 nautical miles from Shanghai, and the typhoon's outer edge had already touched Shanghai, causing fierce roars and torrential rain. The Customs Office again hoisted a black ball (making it two balls in total) on the roof and the Weituoma Road wharf, warning that the typhoon was attacking Shanghai.

The Situation on the Bund Was Alarming

At 9:00 AM yesterday, the situation on the Bund was extremely alarming. At the corner of Nanjing Road and the Bund, many rickshaws were overturned by the wind. Pedestrians leaned against walls to avoid the wind, and some who occasionally stepped away from the wall were blown over by the wind. At that time, the typhoon and rain were heavy, and the waves in the Huangpu River were high. All ships suspended their departure. When the wind and rain were fierce in the morning, the Huangpu River ferries also stopped running. By the afternoon, when the wind had subsided slightly, important ferries, such as those of the electricity company and waterworks, were still operating with difficulty to transport workers back and forth. As for the barges and sampans moored along the Yangjingbang and at the wharves from Beijing Road to the Bund, although they had strengthened their moorings in accordance with the Customs' warning, the wind and rain were fierce, and the waves were surging, causing them to collide with each other and become unable to withstand the conditions. Around 9:00 or 10:00 AM, some sampans were dragged ashore. It is estimated that as many as 37 were dragged to the south side of the Customs House inspection room, the riverbank of the Bund, and the floating bridges. Among them, one, No. 301, was dragged inside the fence of the Bund on Nanjing Road. According to the boatmen, about 20 or 30 boats were sunk by the waves. Most have sunk and been smashed, making it impossible to investigate. There are also six boats whose hulls have been smashed but have not sunk, drifting in the waterways of the wharves with the river water. Several barges were also damaged in collisions. All the boatmen on the damaged boats escaped safely, and fortunately, no one fell into the water. The plight of those in distress is very miserable.

The Wind Force Hitting Shanghai Reached Level Eleven

As the typhoon continued to advance rapidly in a northwest direction, the wind force hitting Shanghai reached a level of eleven around 11:00 AM. Then, between 12:00 PM and 2:30 PM, the typhoon began to make landfall about 30 nautical miles south of Shanghai. By 4:00 PM, the typhoon had reached 31.40 degrees north latitude and 121.40 degrees east longitude, west of Shanghai, with the center within 30 nautical miles, rapidly advancing to the northwest or directly north.

The Customs Office Still Lit a Red Light Last Night

By 5:00 PM, Shanghai was still being troubled by the tail of the typhoon, but the wind force had decreased to level five. At that time, the Jianghai Customs had not yet taken down the two black balls. After 6:00 PM, it changed to lighting a red light, indicating that the residual force of the typhoon was still present, sincerely warning ships to remain prohibited from sailing. It is expected that navigation will be permitted starting this morning. After the typhoon made landfall, its direction showed that it would sweep across the lower reaches of the Yangtze River last night and exit into the Yellow Sea.

Tram Services Disrupted, Shops Closed

The British and French Concessions, in order to prevent accidents due to the ravages of the typhoon and rain, specially ordered the Fire Department to dispatch fire engines and ambulances to patrol the area. Due to the scarcity of customers, most of the shops on the roads closed their doors. The number of passengers in the vehicles on the roads was also sparse. At 8:30 AM, the trolleybus line in front of the Slaughterhouse Company on Min Ti Ni Yin Road was destroyed by the wind, causing the trolleybuses to be unable to operate. More than a dozen were stopped at one time. It was not until a few hours later that repairs were completed and operations were restored.

Arrival and Departure of Ships Were Postponed

The ships that were scheduled to arrive yesterday, including the Tai Gu Bei Yang Ban's Shuntian, Jardine Matheson's Yisheng, Yihe from Beihe, the Japanese Changjiang Ban's Daikichi Maru, and the Dalian Steamship Company's Daisoku Maru, were all postponed. If the typhoon leaves Shanghai, they can arrive today. In addition, Jardine Matheson's Lisheng, which came to Shanghai from Qingdao, entered port at 5:00 AM yesterday morning before the typhoon arrived, so it was not affected. The Norddeutscher Lloyd's Gneisenau, originally scheduled to arrive on the 14th (tomorrow), is now sheltering in port and will be delayed by one day, arriving at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Passengers will disembark at the new Customs Wharf by tender at 10:30 AM. As for departures, the Taikoo Chengdu, which was bound for Hong Kong yesterday morning, anchored near Wusong to wait for the typhoon to pass before departing. Also, the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso, originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to return to Venice at 2:00 PM yesterday, was affected by the typhoon and will be delayed by one day, departing at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The passenger tender will depart from the new Customs Wharf at 12:00 PM at noon. The new ship Chizawa Maru of the Chia Hua Company will depart this afternoon according to schedule, heading to Xiamen and Hong Kong, and returning to Batavia via various ports in the Nanyang region. Due to the typhoon yesterday, passengers and cargo could not be loaded and unloaded, so it will be changed to tomorrow (the 14th) at 4:00 PM to set sail. The passenger tender will depart from the new Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The Far East Company's Hana Maru, originally scheduled for its first voyage to Ningbo this morning, will now depart tomorrow morning. All ships traveling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River had no arrivals or departures yesterday.

A Vast Expanse, Water Reaching Knee-Deep

The city of Shanghai had cloudy skies and wind due to the typhoon the day before yesterday, but yesterday, heavy rain and storms began, leading to a lot of water accumulation on the roads. (French Concession) Yesterday, after the storm, the tide rose, and the bustling streets of the French Concession, from the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet to Rue Massenet, a distance of several hundred yards, as well as the intersections of Ximen Road, Rue Grolier, Rue Lupan, and Route des Soeurs, were transformed into a watery land. At the deepest points, the water reached knee-deep. Six parasol trees along Avenue Joffre were uprooted by the wind and fell to the side of the road. In the morning, the large glass window at the entrance of the Golden Grand Theatre was also blown off. The tin shed in front of Zhu Pinzhai at the Ningbo Road intersection and the power lines in front of the Slaughterhouse Company were also blown down, causing about sixteen or seventeen trams to be temporarily stopped there. (International Settlement) The intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, originally the center of the bustling city, was also a vast expanse. Sincere and Wing On were the first to be hit, and pedestrians were nowhere to be seen. Many of the large display windows of Wing On were shattered by the typhoon. The company temporarily nailed wooden boards to close the display windows, and it is said that the losses were very large. After 8:30 AM, the large billboard erected by the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Beijing Road was violently attacked by the wind and fell down along with the wall, injuring a rickshaw puller and damaging a car. From Daxin Street in the east to Yunnan Road in the west, all of Sima Road became a watery land. Most of the shops along the road temporarily built dikes at their entrances to prevent water from entering. Jishi Fei'er Road, Di Feng Road, and other places in western Shanghai were even several feet deep in water, invading the residents' homes.

### Japanese Troops Cut Off the Riverbank of the British Factory, with Profound Significance, Even Threatening to Block the Entire Building; the British Protest Has Not Yet Received a Reply

The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 11th), regarding the matter of the Japanese troops in Zhabei erecting barbed wire to cut off the three British-owned factories on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, the British protest has not yet received a reply from the Japanese authorities. Although two of the factories were working yesterday, barbed wire was erected along the pier area in front of the factory buildings, making it uninhabitable. However, not far away, ships were loading cargo at the pier in front of a Japanese-owned yarn factory, where there was no sign of barbed wire. It is understood that the three factories are the China General Edison Company, the Zongxin Yarn Factory, and the Zhentai Yarn Factory. The British Consulate authorities protested because others were not allowed to go to the piers in front of the three factories. Official contacts began negotiations with the Japanese authorities on Sunday afternoon. According to the Japanese authorities, the isolation of the three factories had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that they were British-owned, but was part of the overall plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire to prevent undesirable elements from crossing the river and infiltrating the western district of the International Settlement. However, the North-China Daily News reporter went to the China General Edison Company and the Zongxin Yarn Factory yesterday and found that the barbed wire currently erected only extended in front of the British properties to the point where there were no other factories beyond the British properties. Near the China General Edison Company, there is a large factory with a Japanese flag hanging on it, but so far, the factory has not been included in the overall plan to isolate the north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire. Yesterday, a member of one of the three factories commented on the situation, saying that this may be the Japanese authorities' plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire, or it may not be a matter of discrimination against British factories, but the fact is that the erection of barbed wire is limited to British factories. For example, next to the British-owned Zongxin Yarn Factory is a Chinese factory (now operated by the Japanese). Although the Zongxin Yarn Factory has been isolated by barbed wire, the Japanese factory has not. If the Japanese want to isolate the north bank of the Suzhou Creek and erect barbed wire on the sides and backs of the factories, it cannot be stopped, because undesirable elements cannot enter the western district of the International Settlement. The Japanese can achieve their goals without inconveniencing the factory owners. This simple fact has been explained to the Japanese military. If the Japanese military ignores it, they will invite others to condemn their deliberate obstruction and interference with neutral rights. The land where they erected the barbed wire is British property and is recorded in the British land deeds. This is indeed another example of continuing interference in foreign commerce. At yesterday's reception for journalists, a Japanese army spokesman claimed that if the British continue to maintain their current attitude, the Japanese may need to tighten the relaxation of passage and residence for people of third countries in the occupied areas around Shanghai. Furthermore, the British attitude shows a lack of understanding of the situation. If the British try to investigate and cooperate, there will be less friction than there is now. This is not only the case in this example, but also in other examples. The Japanese believe that the British are currently abusing the relaxation given to them, which is not friendly to Japan. The Japanese may have to reconsider their policy toward third parties. The spokesman also replied to a reporter that barbed wire is currently only being erected in the most congested areas, but in the future, barbed wire will eventually be erected around all properties. When the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, the nature of the three factories in question was not determined. After investigation, it was proven that they were British-owned. Last November, at the request of the Zongxin Yarn Factory, the British authorities asked the Japanese to allow 40 Chinese workers to enter the factory to repair the machinery. The Japanese allowed it. On November 28, the Japanese agreed to the resumption of work at the two yarn factories, with five conditions: (1) Workers should enter the factory via Zhongshan Road or Route des Soeurs Bridge. (2) Employees must not go beyond the designated roads and yarn factory buildings. (3) The yarn factory must not build bridges over the Suzhou Creek, nor may it use boats to transport employees. (4) Employees must obtain a pass from the British Consulate General. (5) The agreement will be temporarily invalidated in the event of military needs or violations of the regulations by the yarn factory management. The spokesman continued that the British authorities had not responded to the Japanese proposal and had taken action without Japanese permission, using boats to transport employees across the Suzhou Creek, or allowing people who had committed crimes and carried weapons in the occupied areas to enter Zhabei. The Japanese had to prevent undesirable elements from infiltrating, so they erected barbed wire. This kind of secret communication must be stopped. The British protested against the erection of barbed wire as an unfriendly act and on the grounds that the Japanese rules could not be accepted because the factories had only just resumed work. The Japanese believe that they cannot agree.

### Rumors of Changing the Status of the Northern District Denied by the British: Tokyo Talks Limited to Tianjin Issue, Changing Settlement Organization an International Matter

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that rumors that the Japanese were attempting to gain British support to change the Public Settlement district on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek into a Japanese settlement as a point of discussion for the Tokyo talks, which will begin soon, were firmly denied by responsible British figures in Shanghai yesterday (the 11th). Local officials, aware that these rumors were rife, specifically stated that the Tokyo talks were limited to the Tianjin issue and would not include any discussions on changing the status of the Northern District. In short, the United Kingdom is only one of the countries with a very important relationship with the Shanghai Public Settlement. This is an international issue and cannot be decided by any one country. It is heard that in Hongkou and the surrounding areas controlled by the Japanese, rent and land prices have soared recently, with land prices increasing by 400% compared to pre-war levels. The increase in house prices is also higher than the average increase in the de facto Public Settlement and the French Concession. This shows the ambitions of the Japanese, that is, Tokyo may exert pressure to force recognition of the establishment of settlements within the occupied areas. It is generally believed that the Japanese authorities have allowed dozens of European refugees to enter Hongkou in order to create an atmosphere of an international city in the area.

### Datuan Briefly Recaptured: Chinese Troops Assist Guerrillas in Counterattack; Invading Japanese Troops Show Signs of Retreat

The Japanese troops invaded Nanhui City and launched a full-scale attack from Xinchang and Zhuqiao. Unexpectedly, they were ambushed in the northwest rivers on both land and water, suffering heavy casualties. The first offensive failed, and the second wave of reinforcements advanced again, using four or five aircraft to bomb, dropping more than 20 bombs over Nancheng, destroying many civilian houses. In order to avoid direct sacrifice, the guerrillas abandoned Nancheng. After the Japanese troops from Zhuqiao entered the city, the troops from Xinchang bypassed and attacked Datuan. The old soldiers of Gu Lifeng's department of the Chinese side resisted this route and inflicted heavy damage, which was a great achievement. After the Japanese troops entered the town, they designated the Ni gentry ancestral hall garden as the guerrilla headquarters and set it on fire, causing heavy losses. Unexpectedly, after the guerrillas withdrawing from Nancheng and Datuan joined forces, they launched a counterattack against Datuan with fierce momentum. The Japanese were no match and were forced to withdraw. After the guerrillas recaptured Datuan, they captured Tao, the puppet "Chairman of the Datuan Maintenance Association," who had not had time to escape, and killed him with a large knife, greatly pleasing the people. Knowing that the Japanese troops would definitely launch another full-scale attack, they destroyed the important defense facilities of Datuan and withdrew to the east of Duangongtang. Sure enough, the Japanese and puppet troops searched and arrived in the town the day before yesterday. Because the people had all fled, it became a dead town. They urgently wanted to find a replacement for Tao's vacancy, but no one dared to take the position, so the order was chaotic and has not yet been restored. As for the main force of the guerrillas, they are now gathered in Fengxian County and Wanxiang Town on the Nanhui coast and have received assistance from most of the 45th Brigade. Since the day before yesterday, the suburbs of Nanhui Datuan have launched a fierce counterattack. The Japanese troops show signs of retreat, and there has also been fierce fighting in Fengxian.

### He Shiguang of the Sino-French Express Company Will Return to Hong Kong: Hosted Yu Qiaqing and Others Yesterday

In order to facilitate the Shanghai-Kunming transportation for the Chinese people, the Sino-French Express Company was organized. Recently, He Shiguang (nephew of Sir He Dong) and Ye Jiaxing were specially sent to Shanghai to organize a branch office and solicit transportation opinions from industry leaders. Now that the branch office has been established, yesterday evening, a reception was held at the Atlantic Western Restaurant for the city's business tycoons, including Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Ma Shaoquan, Fang Jiaobo, and more than a hundred others. It was a grand occasion. It is learned that He has scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the 14th and travel to Saigon, and will inspect the transportation business along the way.

### Ministry of Finance Announces Withdrawal Methods: Pawnbroking Not Restricted; Speculative Businesses Lack Cash and Cannot Manipulate; Further Elimination of Exchange Rate Premiums Would Be Fatal

The Shanghai Pawnbroking Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting it to forward an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Finance, asking for lenient handling of the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on withdrawal methods, which are affecting the industry. The reply telegram received stated that the pawnbroking industry is closely related to the livelihoods of ordinary people and should not be restricted in the use of deposits. In addition to sending a telegram to the Shanghai Banking Trade Association, you should immediately inform and notify.

Surplus Capital and Booming Speculation

Since capital from the war zone flowed into Shanghai, capital has gradually become abundant, and financial current deposits have surged. However, Shanghai lacks legitimate channels of use, and the internal transfer of capital to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, most of the capital has been transferred to speculative businesses, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, foreign currency, gold, stock trading, and even the hoarding of various commodities and the rental and construction of real estate and houses, which are more prosperous than before the war. This deformed development is not only detrimental to the stability of the Shanghai financial market but also inconsistent with the government's wartime financial policy.

Deformed State of Shanghai Trade

The deformed state of Shanghai's foreign trade is self-evident. The monthly trade situation this year has shown an increase in imports and a decrease in exports, with a growing cumulative trade deficit. The need for foreign exchange has been increasing. For example, in January, imports were 40,162,000 yuan, exports were 30,080,600 yuan, and the trade deficit was 9,356,000 yuan. In May, imports were 73,512,000 yuan, exports were 34,454,000 yuan, and the trade deficit was 39,058,000 yuan. The sharp increase in the trade deficit has set a new record for the Shanghai Customs after the war.

Curbing Speculation Improves Trade

The New Voice News reporter learned from various industries yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance issued measures prohibiting the import of goods and the rules for applying for import foreign exchange, the British HSBC Bank restricted foreign exchange swaps. All of these measures are to prevent speculators from manipulating and adjusting international trade. Therefore, the prices of gold, cotton cloth, flour, and other commodities in Shanghai's exchanges and black markets have gradually stabilized. Speculators lack cash and cannot manipulate any longer. However, it is hoped that further reduction of exchange rate premiums will be fatal to speculators.

### Gao Xinbao Regains Freedom: Detained Due to False Accusations; Released After Investigation Reveals No Involvement

Mr. Gao Huai de, courtesy name Xinshi, from Shanghai, is generous and righteous, and has always been enthusiastic about public welfare. However, since the war, he has been disheartened. In addition to contributing to refugee relief efforts, he has long been indifferent to social events and is engaged in business and operating the Lido Garden and presiding over the Lido Sports Association. Recently, he was falsely accused of being suspected of being a guerrilla. The investigation has now been completed and found that there is no suspicion. He was released yesterday (the 12th). Gao's relatives and friends have sent their condolences. According to Gao's associates, after this stimulation, Gao will not participate in any social events and will focus on continuing his past business.

### French Health Department Advises Citizens to Kill Flies: Health Education Campaign, Third Day of Publicity Week

Yesterday was the third day of the Health Education Campaign Publicity Week organized by the YMCA. After Chairman Xu Xiaochu reported the significance of the conference, Gu Douyan gave a lecture on children's health, followed by a table tennis performance, egg-holding competition, group games, ordinary family nursing methods, and two films on bacteria. Each radio station also continued to broadcast programs. Yesterday, the French Concession Health Department again advised citizens to kill flies in an article titled "War on Flies." Dirty people are always followed by flies in all climates. Flies use unclean items as food in all climates. Unclean objects are the most dangerous breeding grounds for disease-causing bacteria. Flies are covered in bristles and have small racket-like devices on their feet, so they carry various pathogens. They transmit infections everywhere they land. The bacteria they swallow are excreted in their feces, which are even more toxic. Therefore, we should fight against flies. Those who can be defeated by flies are those who are clean. Keep your house and its surroundings clean. Do not let food scraps or any garbage be scattered. Do not allow flies to come into contact with human excrement.

### Chinese Hospital in the International Settlement Is Full

The North-China Daily News reported that at midnight yesterday (the 11th), the beds in the Chinese Hospital in the International Settlement were fully occupied. According to the fire brigade's ambulance division, no more people could be accommodated in hospitals other than foreign hospitals.

Spring Cocoons from Eastern Zhejiang Are Allowed to Be Transported to Shanghai; Foreign Exchange to Be Settled According to Posted Rates; Puppet "Central China Company" Allows Zhejiang Cocoons to Be Transported to Shanghai; First Batch of Over a Thousand Packages Arrived Yesterday

Yesterday, it was learned from silk factories that silk factories within the Shanghai settlement area, due to a lack of raw materials, had petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Government through the industry association, requesting permission for spring cocoons from Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Sheng County, and other places in eastern Zhejiang to be shipped to Shanghai by ship from Ningbo to provide assistance. It was also agreed to sell foreign exchange to the government in accordance with the posted rates of the Bank of China and the Central Bank, in accordance with the methods for re-exporting local products to the occupied areas. After negotiations between the provincial authorities and the Trade Commission, it was heard that the transportation of spring cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai has been permitted, but foreign exchange must be sold to the government in accordance with the law.

### Zhejiang Spring Cocoons Released for Transport to Shanghai

The cocoons obtained by the silk factories in the Shanghai settlement area from the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, (1) 16,000 dan of dry cocoons from Zhejiang and (2) 20,000 pieces of dry cocoons from Jiangsu, were successively obstructed from being transported to Shanghai by the "Central China Silk Company" under the guise of control. After repeated negotiations by the factory, "the company" put forward harsh conditions, causing the factories in Shanghai to be forced to completely shut down. It is heard that the Zhejiang cocoons have now been negotiated and the manufacturers are allowed to transport them to Shanghai for reeling. The first batch is from the Lamping Juxing cocoon bank, totaling 1,150 packages, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday by the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. The cocoons from Jiangsu that have been blocked have not yet been resolved.

Settlement Factories Prepare to Resume Operations

There are a total of 46 silk reeling factories in the settlement. Previously, they were forced to shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. Now that the Zhejiang spring cocoons have been released for transport to Shanghai, they have begun to repair their machinery and prepare to resume work. The cocoons from Jiangsu Province have not been resolved, so it is temporarily impossible to transport them to Shanghai. It is heard that the manufacturers have requested that they be handled in accordance with the Zhejiang method. After the "Central China Cocoon Silk Company" allows it, they can also be transported to Shanghai in batches by train. It is also heard that the manufacturers have suffered losses due to the sudden obstruction of the transport of the cocoons they obtained, but they can only bear with it under the influence of power. However, future purchases from the occupied areas will be regarded with caution.

### Using Fishermen to Probe Military Intelligence, Coastal Smuggling is Rampant: Fake "City Government" Issues Sea Passes, Fishermen are Used to Sell Inferior Goods

According to a telegram from the Eighth District National Self-Defense Corps of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the fake regime, in order to increase tax revenue, dump inferior goods, and facilitate the probing of our military intelligence, ordered the fake "Shanghai City Government" to produce and issue sea passes to solicit coastal fishing boats to obtain them. Each pass costs more than ten yuan. The ships that obtain the passes mostly carry inferior goods that have been repackaged and transported to various ports for sale. In addition, they also probe military intelligence each time. The fake regime also occasionally shows small favors to make them grateful. If they encounter military interrogation, they insert the passes into firewood. The method is to split the firewood into two pieces, insert the pass, and then reassemble them into one, mixing them into the firewood. The military police cannot detect them, and they are able to enter the port and land safely time and time again. This practice is prevalent in Taizhou and Jinqing Port areas, so many of the fishermen in that area have been invisibly used by the fake regime. The coast of Wenzhou also shows the same trend. If it is not prevented in advance, the impact on the future of the war of resistance will be significant. After receiving the report, the provincial government believed that the matter was a certain conspiracy and telegraphed the Wenzhou and Taizhou defense commanders, the Sixth District Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and the county magistrates of Zhenhai, Yin County, Cixi, Xiangshan, Ninghai, Fenghua, Huangyan, and Yuyao counties to strictly prevent it to avoid future troubles. It is also reported that the smuggled goods imported are mostly cloth and cigarettes, and the goods leaked to the sea are mainly rice, firewood, tung oil, and tea.

### Celebrations by Various Concession Police Stations for French National Day

Tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of the French Democratic Revolution. The French expatriates and authorities in this city will follow the usual practice and hold a warm celebration, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the French Concession's Grande Horloge, McLane Police Station, Songshan Road Police Station, Lujiawan Police Station, and the entrances of various fire brigades have been ordered to install tricolor light bulbs and French flags in front of the doors, and decorate them with pine and cypress. They will be brightly lit in the evening to celebrate. At 7:30 tomorrow morning, all French Concession police, French army, navy, volunteer teams, etc. will line up in the Gujiazhai Garden on Hualong Road, where they will be inspected by the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudic. A flag-raising ceremony will also be held. This year, the French authorities, like in previous years, do not intend to issue invitations separately. The Gujiazhai Garden will be closed all day tomorrow for military review purposes. Residents and shops in the French Concession may hang flags to celebrate the French Republic Day. In the evening, Ambassador Cosme will host a banquet at the French Chamber of Commerce on Hualong Road for French army and navy officers and senior police officers in Shanghai, where there will be music and dance to add to the fun. The lantern parade, like last year, will be suspended. The French police will, as usual, promote meritorious personnel on this day to show encouragement. French warships in the Huangpu River will also fly flags to celebrate the National Day.

### Rice Prices Plummet, Retail Prices Still Follow Price Limits, Authorities Should Increase Supervision

In the past two or three days, rice prices have plummeted by about one yuan. Medium-grade goods have fallen by more than two yuan compared to the highest price, which can reflect the substantial inventory and the stability of the public's mind. However, although the prices in the rice market have fallen, most retail rice shops still sell at the limited price. It is hoped that the authorities will further lower the rice price and revise the limited price, so that the small people and the entire people's food supply will benefit greatly. According to the statistical table of the rice industry over the years, from 1864 to 1911, the highest selling price of one picul of japonica rice ranged from three yuan to seven yuan. In 1912, it rose to nine yuan, in 1920 to thirteen yuan, in 1925 to eighteen yuan, and in 1930 to twenty-three yuan. The limited price in 1930 was 21 yuan per picul. Although the current limited price is nominally the same as in 1930, due to changes in the market system, the current one picul of rice is only 85% of one picul in 1930. According to this calculation, the current limited price is actually equal to 24 yuan per picul in 1930.

### Broadcasting for Fundraising

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Relief Home at 771 Lane, Xiafei Road, will hold a two-day broadcast promotion at the city's four major radio stations, Guohua, Mingyuan, Zhongxi, and Youlian, starting tomorrow, appealing to all sectors to generously donate and actively adopt refugee children (6 yuan per month per child), donate education fees (2 yuan per month per child), and adopt nursery babies (10 yuan per month per child). It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will support and participate in this charitable cause.

### Permits for Summer Cloth Transported to Shanghai Limited to 300,000 Yuan

Regarding the transport of summer cloth from Jiangxi Province to Shanghai, the local summer cloth industry previously telegraphed the Zhejiang Maritime Customs Commissioner to inquire whether there was an order to release it. Now, a reply telegram has been received stating that regarding the transport of summer cloth left in Ningbo by the Jiangxi merchants to Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that within the limit of 300,000 yuan, they are allowed to be exempted from the domestic sales special permit. The merchants should apply to the official office at the place of departure for a certificate proving that it is indeed for domestic sales, and present it to the customs for verification and release without settling foreign exchange and collecting taxes.

### Banking Industry Disaster Relief, Charity Sale for the Last Two Days

The banking industry's amateur association is holding a charity sale of domestic goods for disaster relief, which has been continuing for four days since the 11th. Every day, a large number of people come to the meeting to purchase inexpensive and high-quality American goods. It is heard that it is scheduled to end on time at 8 pm on the 14th, and will not be extended. It is hoped that colleagues in the banking industry and people from all walks of life will take advantage of these last two days to go and purchase more, both to benefit the victims and to obtain exquisite American goods.

### Primary Postal Worker Examination, List of Admitted Candidates Announced: 236 Regularly Admitted, 182 Alternates

The Shanghai Postal Administration has announced the list of candidates admitted to the primary postal worker examination by the examination committee of the bureau yesterday morning. A total of 236 candidates were regularly admitted, of which 56 are required to report within ten days to listen to training and be assigned to local post offices for employment. Another 60 are also required to report within ten days to listen to training at the savings and remittance bureau and be sent to the interior to handle savings counter affairs. Another 120 are required to report within ten days to listen to the head office's assignment to serve in inland postal districts. In addition, 182 alternates will fill vacancies when there are vacancies in the regularly admitted list, or be called upon when the bureau needs them. The complete list of regularly admitted and alternate candidates has been posted on the second floor of the Sichuan Road Bridge Management Office, and will not be listed here.

### Tea Leaves Exported from Ningbo Must Be Reported for Transit

The Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou Tea Inspection Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute recently announced that the application form for the inspection of transit tea leaves has been implemented by the office. In the future, if tea leaves from other provinces or inland areas of the province that have been inspected and qualified and have obtained a certificate of qualification are transported to Ningbo for export, they must be reported to the office for transit and the certificate of qualification must be submitted for verification and export. Those who evade the transit procedures and export privately will be fined up to 500 yuan in accordance with the regulations. It is urgent to announce the format of the transit application form to let everyone know and follow it.

### Preparations for Setting Up a Civilian Factory

The Production and Construction Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Rehabilitation Office pays close attention to the production and construction of refugees. The group has now re-formulated the following plan for establishing a civilian construction factory: (1) The crafts taught in the carpentry factory should establish the following five principles: A. The raw materials are convenient to obtain and do not require huge capital; B. The manufactured products are daily necessities and can be sold at any time; C. The equipment is simple and does not require huge machines, or can be used manually and semi-mechanically; D. After the civilians have learned, they can operate independently and be able to engage in sideline occupations in their spare time; E. After the civilians have learned, the job prospects are easy and urgently needed by all parties. (2) The workshops that should be set up in this factory, according to the above principles, should first handle the following types: A. Toy industry; B. Rattan, bamboo, and grass weaving industry; C. Woodware industry; D. Machine tools; E. Lace sewing industry; F. Towel weaving industry; G. Other daily necessities industries. (3) For the above-mentioned industries, the association will contact and cooperate with factories that have achieved significant results. All factory buildings will be provided by the association. The skill transfer and product promotion will be the responsibility of each factory. The work performance, character training, food, lodging, and management will be the responsibility of the association's factory director. If each factory needs the association's financial assistance for equipment and raw materials, it can be provided with loan facilities. The loan measures will be formulated separately. (4) The workers of the association's civilian construction factory will be selected from the refugees in each shelter who volunteer to learn the crafts and sent to work separately. After the skills are mature, wages will be given on a daily basis as an encouragement. If permitted by the supervisors of each workshop, they can also be introduced to suitable jobs. (5) The association's factory may add or change workshops at any time to adapt to the environment in order to meet social needs.

### Various Industries Send Personnel to Northern Jiangsu to Purchase Various Foods

Daily foods in this city, such as chickens, ducks, eggs, fish, and vegetables, have always relied on the supply from northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and the four suburbs of Shanghai. Since the inland river and port shipping are controlled by Japanese merchants, passenger and freight traffic has been declining. Although shipping in eastern Zhejiang has been indirectly resumed between Shanghai and Ningbo, freight transport has not yet been smooth. Therefore, there is still a shortage of supply in the market. It is learned that various industries have now sent personnel to various parts of northern Jiangsu to purchase various goods, and will hire special ships to transport them to Shanghai in a steady stream to meet the needs and stabilize the prices of various goods.

### Fierce Battle in Yuhuan: Japanese Troops Driven Back to Ships; Japanese Navy's Attempt to Land Through the Mountains Failed; Japanese Warships Did Not Withdraw, Chinese Troops are on High Alert

According to news received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon: (1) Five Japanese warships arrived in the Chuanshan waters on the morning of the 11th and bombarded the shore. Then, more than ten speedboats were lowered, full of armed Japanese soldiers, and attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army failed. Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, Chuanshan and Dinghai are only separated by water. The Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities had already dispatched heavy troops to guard the area, and the defense was very solid. (2) On the 11th, the Japanese army once again attempted to land in Yuhuan outside Wenzhou. The Chinese army's position was destroyed by intense artillery fire, causing the Japanese army to land. Then, the Chinese army's fresh troops arrived and launched a counterattack. Thanks to the soldiers' dedication, the Japanese army was driven back to the ships. Currently, there are still six Japanese warships anchored in the waters around Yuhuan in Wenzhou, and it seems that they are continuing to attempt something. The Chinese army is on high alert.

### Japan Plans to Blockade Southern Fujian, Notifies Foreign Merchant Ships, Warships, and Nationals to Withdraw; Chinese Army Positions in Chaozhou and Shantou Will Not Be Affected

The English-language "China Press" reported that according to reliable sources in this city, the Japanese Navy will begin military operations in Quanzhou, Tongshan, and Zhao'an in southern Fujian within a few days in order to intensify the blockade of the Chinese coast. It is heard that the Japanese Navy has notified the intention to third countries and asked them to order their merchant ships and warships to leave these ports, and stated that the Japanese authorities will not be responsible for any direct or indirect losses suffered by ships left in the three ports after the start of military operations, and also asked third-country nationals residing in these areas to withdraw as soon as possible. It said that the entrances to the three ports were involved in military operations and would be blocked with obstacles and dangerous materials. After that, ships would not be able to enter or leave the three ports. The obstacles and dangerous materials in Quanzhou, which is not far from Xiamen, will be placed on the line connecting Chongwu Lighthouse and Xiangzhixiao. The public is afraid that the blockade of the port will greatly affect the residents of Gulangyu, because the small island obtains food supplies from the Fujian mainland, which will become more difficult. The obstacles and dangerous materials in Tongshan, south of Quanzhou, will be placed near the mouth of Tongshan Bay, that is, near the east-west line passing through Guleitou Mountain. It is believed that the Japanese Navy does not intend to send marines to the above-mentioned two ports, except for Zhao'an. The Japanese army may launch a land war in Zhao'an for military reasons, so as to encircle the Chinese army around Shantou and Chaozhou. These three ports have no highways or railways connected to the interior, so the Japanese blockade will not greatly affect the Chinese positions. Among the three ports, only Quanzhou is slightly more important in commerce.

### A Chinese Arrested on Xidou Road

At around 4:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month, several Japanese people, together with detectives from the Criminal Section of the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, went to the French General Police Station and claimed that a certain Mr. A, a native of Anhui who was an "anti-Japanese element", was hiding in the pavilion room at No. 136 Renji Lane, Ximen Road, and asked to assist in the arrest. The police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to go together and arrested Mr. A on the spot. After a detailed inquiry by the French police, he was handed over to the detectives of the Central Police Station of the Public Concession to be taken away. However, it is not known whether Mr. A is still in the Central Police Station or has been extradited to the Japanese.

### Affected by the War in Northern Jiangsu, Fresh Pork and Chicken are in Short Supply, the Market Supply and Demand are Not Sufficient, Market Prices Have Increased

The supply of fresh pork and chicken in this city has always relied on Taizhou, Jingjiang, Rugao, and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River as the only source. Recently, due to the continuous occurrence of wars in the territory of Taijing and Rugao, the situation is chaotic and transportation is obstructed, resulting in a great impact on the source of fresh pork, chicken, duck and other livestock, and the arrival of goods is reduced. Those who are in the Japanese military occupied areas are all taken by the Hongkou pseudo "Livestock Market" by special forces and transported to Hongkou by Japanese ships for slaughter. Sales are limited to one area. Therefore, in the Public Concession and the French Concession, the supply and demand of fresh pork, chicken, duck and other meats are insufficient, and only a small amount is available for the market. The selling price has increased by 10% to 20% to 30% compared to before. Meat eaters in Shanghai are affected considerably, and there are quite a few who give up meat and eat vegetarian food.

About 1,000 people came to the meeting. At 7 o'clock, the chairman Xu Guanqun led the salute, and then reported that the city is prone to disease transmission due to the concentration of population. Since the Shanghai War, the population has increased sharply, reaching 5 million. According to the statistics of the health offices of the two concessions, the mortality rate has also increased by 16% to 17%. Diseases not only cause mental suffering, but also cause significant material losses. Therefore, if we want to avoid the danger of disease and death, we should first pay attention to the hygiene of daily life. The meaning of the Youth Association's launch of this meeting lies in this. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will widely promote it so that citizens can live a long life.

### Japanese Women and Children Have Tragic Fates: Labor Shortage Has Reached Degeneration; Women and Children are Responsible for Loading Coal on Large Ships

The China Press reported that, according to a private letter disclosed by a foreigner here yesterday (the 10th), the labor shortage in Japan has reached an acute state, and women and children are even forced to engage in the most difficult manual labor for more than 24 hours. The letter was sent by an American woman who returned to the United States last month on the Russian Empress. On June 26, the ship began loading coal in Nagasaki. Obviously due to the labor shortage, a group of coal loaders were all women and children under the age of fifteen. Traditionally, the loading of coal takes up to five and a half hours, but these women and children were forced to load coal for 24 and a half hours. When they finished loading, they were so exhausted that they could be said to have collapsed in the barge.

### Dahua Towel Factory Relieves Unemployed Female Workers

As the war moved west, the towel factories in Chuansha, Baoshan, Jiading and other counties successively tried to relocate to Shanghai to resume production, totaling no less than 20. All the female workers were residents from Chuansha, Jiading and other counties who came to Shanghai to take refuge, and the number reached more than 1,000. Recently, prices have soared, and factories cannot maintain their operations. Except for several new factories, such as Xinxing, Yongmao, and Mingchang, which have now closed down, the remaining factories are also returning to their hometowns one after another. Therefore, the number of unemployed female workers is increasing day by day. It is learned that Dahua Towel Factory, located at No. 67 and 68, Ciyou Road, Xujiahui (west of the Observatory), is trying to expand and can accommodate dozens of people. Any unemployed female workers who want to work in the factory can go to register.

### Throwing Stones at the British Consulate, Qingdao is Overtly Anti-British, Seven British Businesses Including HSBC Bank Were Also Attacked and Destroyed by Protesters

The China Press reported that the news that a large group of anti-British protesters in Qingdao threw stones at the British Consulate and seven British businesses reached Shanghai yesterday (the 11th). The British expatriates in this city are deeply resentful. Most British expatriates and foreigners were talking about the Qingdao incident last night. Whenever British expatriates gathered in one place, they immediately discussed the Qingdao incident.

Japanese Actually Tried British Military Attaché

In addition, it was reported yesterday that the Japanese military authorities in North China announced that they would open a special Japanese military court in Zhangjiakou to try British Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Spear, which further increased the anger of the British expatriates. Last night, Shanghai received news from Qingdao that the city was still calm after the incident that occurred there two days ago.

British Warship Sailors Rumored to Have Landed It is rumored that sailors from warships have landed, but this statement could not be definitively confirmed in this city last night. The British Naval Office in Shanghai announced yesterday that the British warship Duchess or Duchess will leave Shanghai for Weihaiwei today (the 12th), and said that the trip has no special significance, but observers believe that the ship's trip is related to the anti-British activities in Qingdao.

Seven British Businesses Similarly Humiliated

Also, according to private sources here last night, the windows on the front entrance of the HSBC Bank in Qingdao were smashed by anti-British protesters during the Qingdao incident on Sunday. HSBC Bank was one of the seven British shops that were attacked by stones thrown by the protesters after they left the British Consulate. Reuters reported from this question yesterday morning that two British banks had been attacked with stones, but the report did not name the banks. It is believed that the other bank is the office of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.

### Sir Sassoon Purchased, the "Iron Lung" Has Arrived in Shanghai by Ship, Temporarily Placed in the United European Immigrant Hospital, Paralysis Patients Need This Instrument

The China Press reported that the first "iron lung" in Shanghai has arrived. After customs inspection today (the 12th), it will be installed in the United European Immigrant Hospital on Huacheng Road near Huishan Road. This is the second "iron lung" in the Far East. The other "iron lung" in Beiping became known worldwide for saving the life of Mr. Snart two years ago. This one was purchased by Sir Sassoon, a wealthy man in Shanghai, and will be temporarily lent to Huacheng Road Hospital. When the United Immigrant Relief Association wishes to obtain a perfect hospital, the "lung" will be moved into the new hospital or donated completely. The new equipment was originally intended to be used by European refugees in this city for free or at a low price. The "iron lung" arrived here on Saturday evening of last week on the Italian ship Corfu. The reporter asked a member of the United Hospital Committee how many people in Shanghai needed an "iron lung". According to the answer, there are many people in the immigrant shelters who suffer from early paralysis, so this kind of instrument is quite needed. There is great hope for the establishment of the new immigrant hospital, and economic assistance has been appealed for in the United States and Britain. It is said that in the spring of 1937, Mr. Snart, the son of a wealthy man in Chicago, suddenly suffered from early paralysis in North China. People in general began to know that there was such a thing as "iron lung", and that only "iron lung" could save his life. At that time, the only "iron lung" in the East was in the Peking Union Medical College, so he was rushed to the "lung", took the train to Shanghai, and then returned to the United States. This incident caused a sensation around the world. Now, although Mr. Shi has largely recovered, he still often hears about being in the "lung". It is also said that the iron lung transported to Shanghai has a power intensity of 220 volts (according to the unit of electricity), and the single side is a 50-line garden.

The Japanese Ship Taian Runs Aground in the Wind

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese ship Taian Maru No. 1 ran aground on Saddle Island this morning (the 12th) due to strong winds and waves and sent out a distress signal. Wireless operators in this city and ships at sea received it. A ship of the Moller Company, believed to be the "Isabel Moller," is reportedly docked next to the "Taian Maru." Coastal ships are either anchoring to avoid the wind or proceeding slowly, and scheduled sailing times have had to be changed. Many pedestrians in the streets have fallen, and rickshaws have overturned. However, the streets present a rare scene of tranquility, as most trucks are not driving out to prevent goods from being damaged by the rain. Several yachts at the Shanghai Rowing Club's anchorage in Yangshupu have sunk. It is reported that one or two other yachts safely floated on the huge waves, and some took shelter on the other side of the Huangpu River last night. The fire brigades of the two concessions have been busy since 6:30 AM, and fire engines are being dispatched to the scene of collapsed walls, while ambulances are also being sent to carry people who have been struck by falling bricks and tiles.

### Japanese Military Intelligence Department Arrests People in the French Concession Over a Dozen Men and Women Arrested, Temporarily Detained in the French Police Station No Contraband Found, Japanese Request for Extradition Fails

At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese Military Intelligence Department dispatched more than a dozen Japanese officers, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Criminal Division of the Public Police, to the French Police Department, claiming that people residing at 142 Rue du Père Froc and a certain place on Route Tenant de la Tour were related to a certain incident and requesting assistance in arresting them. The Western detective chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to proceed to the above-mentioned two locations and arrest more than a dozen men and women. They searched each location but found no contraband. They then took the arrested individuals back to the French Police Station for temporary detention, pending investigation. However, the Japanese request for extradition was unsuccessful. It is reported that the French Police Department is investigating the arrested individuals. The English-language "China Press" reports that twenty Japanese, believed to be members of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department, planned to arrest anti-Japanese terrorists and guerrilla leaders and requested the cooperation of the public and French Concession Police Departments. Accompanied by police officers from the two concessions, they went by car to 142 Rue du Père Froc and a Chinese residence on Route Tenant de la Tour at 4:00 AM this morning (the 12th) and arrested more than a dozen Chinese people, including women and children. They also searched the two residences but reportedly found nothing. The arrested individuals were taken to the French Concession Police Headquarters. The Japanese requested extradition, but the French authorities refused because the Japanese did not provide sufficient evidence. The Japanese then left the arrested individuals in the French Police Station. The names of the arrested individuals could not be confirmed this morning. It is reported that the Japanese accused them of being related to anti-Japanese groups in Shanghai and guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai. The arrival of the Japanese and concession police officers in cars disturbed the neighbors of the two residences.

### When Recording Recent National Events, the Minguo Era Must Be Used The Western Era Can Be Appended Later in Parentheses

Zeng, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, recently sent a letter to all levels of party departments throughout the country, stating that many books, publications, and printed materials published in various places, when recording recent national events, abandon the Minguo era and use the Western era. This is very inappropriate. In the future, the Minguo era must be used, and the Western era must not be used exclusively. When necessary, the Western era can be appended after the national era, with parentheses, to set the record straight. You are to immediately instruct all local newspapers and publications to strictly comply.

### Evaluation and Auction of Lida Real Estate Mortgage Handled by the Silver Industry Joint Reserve Real Estate Committee Designated by the Court and Not Related to the Mortgagor

Yesterday's report stated that in the case of the auction of the Lida Company real estate mortgage with the Shanghai Bank, the Lida Company's proxy lawyer said that Chen Guangfu, the general manager of the Shanghai Bank, was also the chairman of the Banking Association, so he believed that the estimated amount of 510,000 yuan was obviously biased, and he expressed his opposition. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Bank, Chen Guangfu resigned from the positions of chairman of the Banking Association and general manager of the Shanghai Bank on September 25 of the previous year and June 20 of last year, respectively, and no longer participated in the matter. The Lida Company's proxy lawyer said that Mr. Chen was still the general manager of the Shanghai Bank and the chairman of the Banking Association, which is obviously wrong. In fact, even if Mr. Chen still held his original position, with Mr. Chen's fairness and integrity and the Banking Association's large organization, there would be no bias. Moreover, the actual valuation agency in this case was not the Banking Association at all, but the valuation committee of the Real Estate Evaluation Committee of the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Association, and foreign merchants China Sales Company and Probstfield & Co. also participated. In terms of the relationship, they are the same as Lida Company, which is engaged in real estate business, as real estate merchants. The original price of this real estate is not known to the Shanghai Bank, but since the August 13 Incident, land prices have been falling. Until recently, the selling prices of various large real estate in the central district are still hovering around 60% of the Municipal Council's evaluation. There have been examples in previous newspapers. The Municipal Council's valuation of this real estate is only 480,000 yuan, the Real Estate Association's valuation is 800,000 yuan, including 700,000 yuan for land and 100,000 yuan for houses. After the court's three decisions to reduce the price and auction it to 600,000 yuan, not only was there no major bidding, but even no one paid attention to it. Lida Company previously proposed to value the real estate at 520,000 yuan, which is the amount of the debt, and let the Shanghai Bank inherit it, thinking that the price was too high, it was difficult to find a seller, and it was unwilling to inherit real estate at all, so it refused. Then how can the Banking Association's valuation of 510,000 yuan be said to be biased? The Banking Association's valuation was designated by the court, not requested by the Shanghai Bank, and it should be stated.

### Driven by Beastly Desires, Obscenity of a Young Girl, Peking Opera Teacher Arrested

Gu Abing, who lives at No. 6, Lane 699, Zhejiang Road, sent his 15-year-old daughter Gu Xiushi to Yang Xichang, a Tianjin native at No. 44 Guangxi Road, to learn Peking Opera six months ago. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 PM on the 2nd of this month, Yang took advantage of the teaching of opera to commit beastly desires, using his fingers to dig Gu's lower body, to take pleasure. Although the girl's lower body was injured as a result, she did not dare to tell her parents because of Yang's lewd power. Until the day before yesterday, Gu did not know how, angered Yang, and even beat the girl severely. The girl then fled home and told her father Gu Abing about the obscene acts Yang committed on the 2nd of this month. Upon hearing this, he angrily reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Ding Yizhong went to arrest Yang. The girl was sent to the hospital and found that her hymen was damaged. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted according to Article 224 of the Criminal Law. Judge Qian Hongye ordered a ban on spectators because the case was related to morality. As a result, the case was postponed for one week for further hearing.

### Extortionists Huang Xin and Others Convicted

Huang Xin, a rogue youth who has received secondary education or above, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, colluded with his gang to use the names of the Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group and the Patriotic Youth Service Corps to extort money from various firms and shops on the grounds of inspecting inferior goods, obtaining huge sums of money, which were divided and used. The matter was discovered by the Public Concession Police, who arrested Huang and his accomplices Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Liu Fuqiu, Zhang Caiyi, Zhang Rongshang, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, Zhang Cuiying (female), Chen Quanlin, Liang Chuli, and other twelve men and women and sent them to the Special Second Court for prosecution according to law. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. As a result, after being sentenced to imprisonment separately, the French Police found that Huang and others had also committed similar cases in the French Concession and sent detectives to the Special First Court to transfer Huang and others to custody. After investigation, in addition to extorting money from five companies, including Meilun Elastic Tape Factory on Ningbo Road, Beixin Yarn Store on Zilaihuo Street, Changji Woolen Cloth Store in Bu Linli, Baida Knitting Factory on Kangti Road, and Xingyu Woolen Cloth Store on Minguo Road, they also took goods to sell for profit. They were sent to the Special Second Court. Except for Chen Cuiying, Chen Quanlin, Liang Chuli, and other three people who were not prosecuted and were released first and sent back to the Special First Court for verification, the French Concession Administrative Authorities' lawyers prosecuted the other nine defendants, including Huang Xin, according to the crimes of intimidation and extortion. The defendants hired lawyers Wang Shizong, Le Junwei, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and others to defend them. The case has been repeatedly heard and investigated by Judge Zhang Minsheng, and the details have been recorded in previous newspapers. This case has been investigated and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang went to the Criminal Division 1 and ordered the defendants to be brought to court for sentencing. Huang Xin, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, and Zhang Caiyi were sentenced to three years of imprisonment each. Liu Fuqiu, Jiang Bofang, and Fei Guishun were sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment each. Zhang Rongshang and Jin Huiquan were acquitted. After the sentences were pronounced, the defendants were ordered to be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period.

### White Russians Exploit the Environment to Swindle Jewish Refugees Claiming That a Large Number of Houses Will Be Built in Hongkou Extorting Huge Deposits, Rents, and Tips The Police Investigated and Arrested All Three Criminals

Recently, more than 10,000 Jewish refugees have been forced to seek refuge in Shanghai. They are all unfamiliar with the place and have no homes to return to. Therefore, the Public Concession Municipal Council and various charitable organizations have set up shelters to accommodate them. However, some of them have some financial resources and believe that it is not a good policy to rely on accommodation all the time without engaging in production. Therefore, they have been looking for houses to live in or to engage in business. However, in the current environment in Shanghai, it is not easy to find houses. Therefore, although some Jewish people have already found housing, there are still many who cannot find houses. This situation was known by the White Russian Kouk Tros, who organized a so-called Canada Far East Export Company in Room 200 of No. 81 Renji Road, engaged in real estate business, and used the German Jewish Nanch Liouqiu Meike to declare to Jewish refugees that a certain real estate company intends to build a large number of houses in Hongkou, specially for these refugees to rent. It is stipulated that the monthly rent for each single building is 130 yuan, and the monthly rent for a double building is 260 yuan. However, there are not many houses. If you want to rent, you must first pay a deposit rent for one month. Single buildings require an additional tip of 200 yuan, and double buildings require an additional tip of 400 yuan. At that time, more than 100 refugees paid to book houses, paying more than 10,000 yuan to Kou and the other two. In fact, the so-called building and renting of houses is completely Kou's scam. However, after Kou and others cheated such a huge amount of money, they were still not satisfied. Recently, Kou wore a special patrol uniform and went to various refugee dwellings, claiming that those who have booked houses must pay another 260 yuan for a single building and 520 yuan for a variable building, or they would not only confiscate the previous payments but also be expelled. The refugees were in an uproar. The matter was discovered by the police. After investigation, the chief patrol Fang Qishan and the Western detective arrested Kou and the other two on the 11th. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested permission for temporary detention, pending investigation and prosecution. Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered the three defendants to be detained and a hearing postponed for one week.

### "Reformed Government" Covets the Fake "Unified Tax Bureau" Shao Shijun Will Be Forced to Step Down Yan Jiachi Has a Rumor of Succeeding as the Fake "Director"

The pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau" of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is now of an independent nature. Since Shao Shijun obtained this lucrative position through various machinations, he has appointed a large number of private individuals, such as the positions of secretary-general and section chief, which are all filled by relatives.

### Letter to the Editor

Respected Sir, I have read the Mubu news in your newspaper on the 11th of this month, titled "Tenant Accuses Landlord of Obstructing Freedom, Landlord Denies the Matter." The plaintiff in this case, Pan Dalong, was shocked to learn of it. Upon investigation, the defendant, Chen Guowan's wife, the second landlord, stated in court on the 8th of this month that on June 22nd, at about 5:00 PM, a Western police interpreter accompanied her to the Pan Dalong's chamber in the pavilion. She took out a steel lock and requested that the chamber door be locked. She personally closed the windows. The draft of the letter to the police station was also on file. It was also stated that she received seven yuan and three corners as Dalong's rent for June, confirming that Dalong lived with Zhang Ziquan. There was no statement that "Zhang Jicheng was arrested for smoking opium at Pan Youcai's place at No. 24 in the same alley, and Pan escaped and took his children to hide in Zhang's chamber in the pavilion and refused to leave." Where did this come from? Long and his sister had lived with Zhang Ziquan in the chamber in the pavilion since October of last year, not just for one day. The neighbors on the left and right have seen it clearly, and it is verifiable. It has nothing to do with whether there is a drug offender in No. 24 in the same neighborhood. The defendant wanted to increase the rent to 15 yuan and 6 corners but failed, so she had the idea of locking up and expelling them, which has already been stated in court. Although it is said that the news was rumored and has nothing to do with it, it is important that your newspaper values fair comments. Now, without relying on the records of the statement, you have highlighted this statement, which may harm the reputation of people not involved in the case and may damage the trust of readers. I hereby declare the proceedings of the court hearing that day and request that you correct it. I would be most grateful. Respectfully, Pan Dalong and Pan's sister, July 12.

### Finance: Spot Exchange Supply and Demand are Balanced; Sassoon Concludes August US Dollar Forward Contracts; Hong Kong Dollar Re-emerges Above 44 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listing only decrease by 125 for the Singapore dollar; the rest remained unchanged. The British and American dollar black market showed no excitement. Today, only foreign firms slightly came to close positions, but speculators were restricted by cash and unable to act. Chinese and foreign firms had offers, so the results were neither good nor bad. Although the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank absorbed futures for this month, speculators and Chinese firms continued to close positions, so the market was very ordinary. In the end, there was no movement up or down. August futures slightly softened because the Western firm Sassoon resumed absorbing and foreign firms were slightly less willing to supply. There were not many transactions in the morning. The Hong Kong dollar suddenly re-emerged above 44 yuan because foreign firms' willingness to sell increased.

At the beginning of the morning, the recent London tallies were up 3125, the distant tallies were up 1875, the New York silver price was unchanged, and the London raw gold was also unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American dollars and to Shanghai was flat, and to France was up by one centime. The American dollar to British dollars was up by 0.0625, and to Shanghai and France remained flat. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same (it is rumored that applications have been stopped). The bank's opening spot selling prices were six pence five six two five for the British gold, and twelve yuan seven eight one two five for the US dollar, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, foreign firms first closed positions, buying HSBC's spot British gold at six pence five six two five, and then closed positions, buying a certain bank's spot US dollars at twelve yuan seven eight one two five. The market was extremely calm. HSBC's listing in the morning only decreased by 125 for the Singapore dollar; the rest remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced, and it was still exempt. Afterwards, Chinese firms such as Huaqiao successively sold this month's US dollars at twelve yuan six two five to speculators. Then, a certain broker sold this month's British gold at six pence four six eight seven five to the Yokohama Specie Bank on behalf of speculators. The situation was also unchanged. Nearing noon, the Western firm Sassoon came to absorb foreign firms' August US dollars at twelve yuan one five six two five. The market slightly softened. At this time, foreign firms' willingness to sell Hong Kong dollars increased. Jardine Matheson offered foreign firms a spot price of forty-four yuan one two five. The market hardened. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were six pence five six two five for the British gold, twelve yuan seven eight one two five for the US dollar, six pence four six eight seven five for this month's British gold, twelve yuan five nine three seven five for the US dollar, six pence two three four three seven five for August's British gold, and twelve yuan one five six two five for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the spot and current months were unchanged, August's British slightly tightened by 0.015625, the American dollar slightly softened by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong dollar hardened by 0.25 based on the transaction price. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The half-day transactions are recorded below.

### Small Daily Changes in Cash; Over 300 Taels Traded

Yesterday's cash market situation remained in a hovering state, with occasional ups and downs, which were insignificant. Trading was also very quiet. All parties generally stood by. Although a certain money exchange industry continued to absorb in the middle, cash shops and silver houses had supply, resulting in this stagnant situation. At noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange futures tightened, causing the price to fall and then rise. As a result, it continued to rise by two yuan. Transactions totaled just over 300 taels for the entire day. The gold price of jewelry remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.

Cash Only Rose Two Yuan

Since the beginning of the market, the situation has been flat. The market opened two yuan lower. Silver houses sold 30 taels to gold shops at a price of 2,588 yuan. Then, at the same price, cash shops sold 30 taels to silver houses. A Russian cash shop then sold 10 taels to the money exchange industry at a price of 89 yuan. At this time, a certain money exchange industry resumed trade, and the market improved. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from a certain silver house at the same price. Then, it bought 50 taels from a gold shop at a price of 90 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry also bought 20 taels from silver houses at a price of 90 yuan. It then immediately raised by two yuan. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from silver houses and colleagues, both at a price of 92 yuan. At noon, it fell back by two yuan. The money exchange industry mutually traded 50 taels, with 90 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the transactions became quieter, and the market was stable. The market opened two yuan higher, and cash houses mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 92 yuan. Afterwards, no trading was seen until 3 o'clock, so the evening close was still at 2,592 yuan. As a result, it rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. There were only four yuan of ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops was 2,600 yuan, and the buying price was 2,585 yuan. The current price of standard gold is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there is very little trading.

Jewelry Still Suspended at the Original Price

The exchange price of gold for jewelry is unchanged. The Dahang company is still suspending it at 262 yuan, and the Xinhang company is at 260 yuan, with a buying price of 254 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold is Stable

A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian silver market had stabilized, with the spot price up 14 annas, July up 12 annas, and August up 11 annas.

### American and British Gold Pounds Are Strong and Rising

Yesterday, the price of pure British gold was unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled accounts, and foreign banks supplied smoothly. The market price was stable and unchanged. The market opening price of cash was slightly higher, and customers supplied slightly eagerly, opening at the low price of 2,588 yuan. Then, the money exchange industry absorbed more smoothly on behalf of customers, and the market trended firm. The noon closing price was 9,000 yuan. In the afternoon, customer absorption was even more eager, and the supply was relatively scarce. The opening price was 92 yuan, and the market trended firm. The evening closing price was the same. As a result, it rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. The supply and demand of British and American gold pounds were not strong, the British gold pound was stable and unchanged, the American gold pound was strong and tending to rise. British and American gold notes were traded quite heavily, and the market price did not change much. The British gold note slightly rose, and the American gold note slightly fell.

### World Silver Prices are Fluctuating; Changes in Shanghai Silver Prices

Since the United States adopted its silver policy, it has maintained a policy of raising silver prices for six years, so the gold-silver ratio has been able to maintain a certain level. Recently, due to the United States' suspension of silver purchases, silver prices in various countries have plummeted. For example, the London large silver tally price has fallen from 19 pence 625 to 16 pence 875. Due to the government's prohibition of transporting and hoarding, and the confiscation by a certain party in the occupied areas, there is little inventory. Also, due to some merchants hoarding to drive up prices, the price has risen to as high as 2 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen per tael. Affected by this, former holders have been dumping their holdings, so the market price once fell to 2 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen. However, the exchange prices of silver jewelry have not decreased, hoping that silver prices will rebound. When the US Senate passed a compromise plan, still allowing President Roosevelt to devalue the dollar and continue to purchase silver, it was heard that the domestic silver purchase price was changed to 7 jiao 1 fen 1 ounce, and the foreign purchase price was changed to 3 jiao 5 fen, but it must be changed daily, depending on the rise and fall of the London large silver market. Also, because speculators are optimistic about the future, they are buying heavily, so the trend is good. It has been heard that the local price has returned to 2 yuan 4 jiao. The restoration of stable silver prices will greatly benefit our country's international finance. (Star)

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Merchants Continue to Purchase; Cotton Yarn Shows a Small Rebound; Japanese Yarn Continues to Fall

Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen on the previous day, showed signs of recovery. The reasons for its improvement were: (1) The panic on the previous day was somewhat excessive, causing a small portion to return to buy cheap goods; (2) The Guangdong merchants had a remittance to Shanghai last night, and Yunnan merchants bought 170 bales of 10-count coarse yarn. Hong Kong merchants imported 20-count Shuangma and Tejin City brand yarns. The Guangdong merchants sold some in real terms and initiated purchases, and the human spirit immediately improved, rising by several yuan. However, at a time when credit is tight, it is fundamentally not allowed to rise excessively. In addition, other yarns are falling and depressed, cheaper than Chinese yarns, and there is fear that the cuckoo will occupy the magpie's nest.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened in the early morning, and because Typhoon Guofeng arrived in Shanghai, the momentum was very violent, and travel was difficult. The number of people attending the market was reduced by two-thirds compared to usual. It was not until after 10 o'clock that the market opened, and the opening price rose by two or three yuan because the drop on the previous day was too severe, causing a rebound. At the same time, Guangdong had sporadic purchases. The selling price of 20-count Shuangma at the foreign depot was 477.35 yuan. The middle of the day was calm, without much change. However, the big players have a deep-seated concept of rising prices, but it is not allowed by the environment, and their actions are slightly more stable. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 870 bales were traded, and the previous day's afternoon transactions were 175 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 3 yuan, and the price of Muyang rose by 5 yuan. The rest were similar to the previous day. The amount of purchases from each merchant is listed below:

Hong Kong 335 Yunnan 170

Inland 35 Colleagues 330

Statistics 870 Previous Day's Transactions 175

The Japanese yarn market continued to decline, and business became more and more quiet, completely entering a standstill. The current price of 20-count Yueqin yarn is 385 yuan.

### Woolen Fabric Prices in the Last Ten Years are Rising This Year

The selling prices of woolen fabrics in the last ten years are worth reviewing in the recent state of high commodity prices. Woolen fabrics were sold in taels of silver, and after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, prices began to be quoted in national currency from 1933. Therefore, when looking at the table below, the first thing to note is this point. Regarding the prices from 1930 to 1932, if you want to compare them with the prices in 1933, you must first convert them to national currency using 7.15 before you can compare them. Looking at the reason for the price increase of woolen fabrics in 1931, it was because of the implementation of the new tariff, which increased the tax burden and also increased the selling price. However, good times did not last long. The January 28th Incident in 1932 broke the Shanghai market, and the woolen fabric market also fell. In 1933, prices were quoted in national currency, but in reality, they were still slightly lower than the same period in 1932. In 1935, the dumping of Japanese woolen fabrics made the market even more tired. In 1938 and 1939, commodity prices continued to rise, all due to the influence of high foreign exchange rates and the shortage of goods. The recent market price is the highest, more than double that of 1930. There are also those that are more than double. In other words, if you buy one foot this year, you could buy two feet or two feet with some left over in 1930. It can also be said that if you make one piece of clothing this year, you could make two pieces in 1930.

### The Amount of US Cotton Export Subsidies is Determined by the Government at Any Time, Approximately 6.25 to 8.75 Yuan Per Bale

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was weak at the beginning of the morning due to overseas cotton merchants selling on the market and some bulls closing positions. Later, it improved due to reports from Bombay and Liverpool that prices had risen. The central and western parts of the American cotton area also received unnecessary rain yesterday, which hindered cotton production. It was heard from Washington that the export subsidy would be increased to between 6.25 yuan and 8.75 yuan per bale. The rise and fall of the subsidy fee will be determined by the government at any time, and its main purpose is to depend on the rise and fall of the cotton market. Yesterday, New York rose by two pounds, India rose by the same forecast by two rupees, and Egypt rose by more than ten pounds.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is becoming increasingly quiet. However, North China has a strong demand for cotton. Several Shanghai firms are trying to transport cotton there to trade for cotton yarn and other various products. A certain German firm has been buying more than 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton these days, all of which are being transported to Qingdao. It is said that the others have no trading.

The Chinese and foreign cotton markets have completely fallen into a standstill. The factories have no demand, and not a single transaction has been concluded. The ships from Subei cannot sail to Shanghai due to the hurricane, so there have been no ships arriving at the pier. It is estimated that they will all come to Shanghai after the weather clears up.

### Securities: Internal Debt Watch and Wait, External Stocks Affected by Current Situation

The securities gray market yesterday saw a relatively stable market, but the downward trend has not fully subsided. Trading volume has been decreasing, and both bulls and bears are mostly watching and waiting for a clear announcement regarding the payment of principal and interest. Market rumors are based on bullish or bearish positions, with no truth to be found. All inaccurate rumors are merely idle talk and gossip. Trading on the floor is mostly speculation for quick profits. The storm has subsided slightly, and everything is quiet, but the truth will eventually come to light. Yesterday, many offers to buy and sell were listed, but few transactions were completed. Buyers included Datong, Lianhe, Maotai, and scattered individual investors, while sellers included Lianyi, Renchang, Xieda, and Jianli brokers. However, the total transaction volume was only about two to three hundred thousand yuan. Prices decreased slightly by three to seven and a half cents. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock transactions included 100 shares of Hanyang Iron and Steel Company stock at a price of $X.X5 yuan, it is said.

Due to the unsettled situation, the stock market at the Public Exchange is calm and weak. The heavy storm yesterday prevented many brokers and clients from reaching the Exchange, which also contributed to the sluggish market. Jardine Matheson shares continued to weaken, with a price of eighteen yuan and two cents, but telephone shares showed some improvement, rising to twelve yuan and one cent. If the situation and weather remain the same, there is little hope for improvement in market sentiment.

London British Far Eastern companies' stock market prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday): Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank Hong Kong-registered shares rose half a pound, to eighty and a half pounds. There were no other changes.

London Chinese external debt market prices on the 11th of this month (Tuesday) remained unchanged. English physical goods were offered for sale, including £1,000 of stamped Reorganization Loan bonds, selling for £30 15 shillings, which is £1 15 shillings below the London price. Also, £1,000 of stamped German Loan bonds were offered for sale, selling for £28 15 shillings, which is £3 15 shillings below the market price.

### HSBC Bank to Pay Interim Dividend

It has been learned that the Shanghai HSBC Bank recently received a telegram from its head office stating that the bank will pay an interim dividend of £2 10 shillings per share starting August 14th of this year. Taxes may not have been deducted.

### Food: Chinese Flour Mills Reduce Production

Flour

Yesterday, the spot flour market was unusually quiet. Due to the sudden change in the weather during the summer heat, with hurricanes and rainstorms hitting Shanghai, pedestrian traffic on the streets was almost nonexistent, so the number of merchants was even more sparse, and customer demand remained sluggish. Even the small-scale sales of local and inland merchants were minimal. It is heard that Fuxin Flour Mill has partially suspended operations for machinery repairs due to the prolonged stagnation of flour sales and summer maintenance. Fufeng Flour Mill has also reduced flour production. However, flour mills run by Japanese merchants are operating as usual and have not reduced production. Yesterday, the asking price for second-grade flour remained at four yuan and six and a half cents in cash, while returned goods sold for five yuan to five yuan and five cents in remittances, but there were more offers than actual transactions.

Wheat

Yesterday, the arrival of new wheat was also limited due to the wind and rain. The remaining stock from previous arrivals waiting to be sold in warehouses was still considerable. With the demand from Chinese mills sluggish, relying only on the sales of Japanese mills, the market felt particularly weak. The main reasons are nothing more than tight credit and a lack of cash. Yesterday, both supply and demand were low in the market, and Japanese mills showed little interest. As a result, transactions were limited due to a lack of holding power.

### Inland Merchants Actively Purchase Passenger Rice

Yesterday, inland merchants actively purchased passenger rice, and local rural villages also showed interest. The total daily transaction volume increased to three thousand six or seven hundred bags, and the market showed a firming trend. After Jingwu high-grade rice sold for sixteen yuan and one dime, the sellers intended to raise prices further. Medium and lower grades of machine-milled rice and brown rice were particularly active due to inland demand, and prices were one or two dimes higher than the previous day.

### Hurricane Hits Shanghai, Rice Market Stalls, No Major Damage to Crops

The rice market was affected by the storm yesterday. The supply from various merchants, whether from the river or wheelbarrow deliveries, did not arrive, and no customers visited the market, so trading came to a standstill. Although some brokers made purchases, they were only two or three hundred bags. The market closed around 10:00 AM. The prices were nineteen yuan and four cents for Changbang old glutinous rice and eighteen yuan and nine cents for Wuxi old glutinous rice, more than two dimes higher than the previous market. According to rice merchants, the storm has not caused significant damage to the rice seedlings because the summer heat has passed, the roots are firm, the short stems are resistant to wind, and clear weather will promote growth. If it had happened half a month later, there would have been a risk of damage, it is said.

### Sugar Market: Slight Easing of Foreign Sugar Production News

According to a London telegram, the price of raw sugar for delivery in August was seven shillings and nine pence and one farthing, unchanged for December, and slightly down two five for March of next year, to six shillings and three pence and seven five farthings. Due to the severe wind and rain, few people attended the Shanghai Association's pricing session, resulting in a lack of transactions. The prices for second-grade white sugar and Taikoo Che Bai sugar remained unchanged. National sugar was not quoted. The market situation was stable.

### North and South Goods: Guangdong Lychees Becoming Increasingly Scarce

The arrival of Jinshan lychees has not been continuous recently, and inventories are dwindling. Cold storage round lychees have also increased by ten yuan, requiring eighty yuan for high-grade goods. Glutinous rice branches are even scarcer, with asking prices reaching two hundred yuan, and transaction prices also requiring one hundred and seventy or eighty yuan. The trend is strong.

### Red Foxnuts Needed by Hong Kong Merchants

Due to the scarcity of the source, foxnuts have recently been actively purchased by Hong Kong merchants. Several dozen bags of red foxnuts were sold for thirty-five yuan in cash. The remaining stock is already scarce, and the market is quite firm.

### Jian Mushrooms Are Soaring in Price

Due to the tense situation in Min'ou, Fujian, it is impossible to transport mushrooms, so the source has been cut off. Sellers rely only on existing inventory for supply. According to Hong Kong news, the price has already reached one hundred and seventy-five yuan, which has further strengthened market sentiment. It is heard that Jian brand is offered for one hundred and thirty yuan cash, with a strong upward trend.

### Hardware: Sesame-Head Nails Still Enjoying Customer Sales

Due to the wind and rain hitting Shanghai yesterday, few people attended the hardware market, so there were few transactions for general goods. However, sporadic business was still conducted. The market for sesame-head nails, which had been quiet for a long time, was relatively active due to good customer sales. For example, more than sixty boxes of three-point varieties were purchased by Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao merchants, priced at forty-five yuan to forty-six yuan. More than twenty boxes of four-point varieties were purchased by inland and Tianjin merchants, priced at forty-three yuan. Customer merchants traded only a dozen boxes of five- and six-point varieties, while colleagues in the lumber district sold more than thirty boxes. Other merchants from Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and other places also purchased more than thirty boxes. The price for five-point nails was forty-two yuan, and the price for six-point nails was forty-one yuan, both higher than the previous market by several dimes to one yuan. As for other scrap iron products, there were also transactions yesterday. For example, foreign round bars were offered at fifteen yuan, foreign plates at fifteen yuan and five cents, triangular iron bars at sixteen yuan, rubber belt heads at thirteen yuan and five cents, old and new leather at ten yuan and five cents, and cement bones at fifteen yuan, etc.

### Import and Export: Large Quantities of Oil Cakes Arrive in Shanghai, Sugar Also Delivered

The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen, transporting 465 bags of sugar. Yesterday's incoming goods included 1,400 pieces of soybean oil from Qingdao, as well as 3,590 pieces of soybean cakes, it is said.

### Italian Artificial Silk Arrives

Italian artificial silk has also arrived. The Italian postal ship Controsso arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, carrying 1,321 pieces of artificial silk, including 50 pieces that need to be transferred to Tianjin. It is heard that Japanese artificial silk brands such as Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) are very active in the market recently, and more goods are gradually arriving.

(From this newspaper in July of the 11th year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty)

### Western Magician Tangui Performs

Last night, the Western magician Wana performed at the Tangui Tea Garden. The dazzling lights made one suspect that it was a sleepless night; the diverse performances were like entering the market of Persia. Light clothing, small fans, figures, and the fragrance of clothing filled the air. The upstairs and downstairs were almost full, and later arrivals had nowhere to put their feet, which can be called a grand event on the sea! The phrase "men and women sitting together, shoes crisscrossing" can faintly describe one or two aspects of it. The magician first performed various tricks, such as... flying cups sharing a drink, echoes in an empty valley, and dead trees blooming, all extremely magical and incredibly detailed and appropriate. Then a Western girl was supported out, with two poles suspended on a chair, and then the chair was removed, so the poles were suspended in the air, fluttering and flying in the void, like a swallow playing in the palm. After spinning for a while, the girl smiled sweetly and then made a gesture like Yang Guifei losing her hairpin at Mawei, letting out a sigh, and disappearing. Another performance was the magician borrowing three foreign watches from the audience, wrapping them in a foreign handkerchief, and entrusting them to a girl to carry. The girl's hand loosened slightly, and the watches suddenly fell to the ground. The magician pretended to be frightened and searched everywhere, but only two were left. The other one was like a colorful cloud in the sky, not knowing where it had gone. The magician then took two broken watches, placed them in a foreign gun, and stuffed the top with paper. Then he brought out a wooden box, hanging it on the stage, with several small screen doors on the outside. The magician struck the stage with a loud bang, and the screen doors opened to reveal the three watches in the middle. A white dove flew out of the box, circling the stage, rising and falling in time with the music, and the audience applauded! Then a bottle of wine was placed on the stage, with two glass bottles on a side table. The bottles were shown to the audience, empty, covered with glass cylinders. The magician muttered incantations. When opened, the bottle on the stage was empty, and the wine had overflowed from the two side bottles. Then the magician borrowed a Westerner's straw hat, put an egg yolk inside, then added white sugar and mixed it with a spoon until smooth, and then borrowed a ring from the audience and placed it in the hat as well. He then reached into the hat and pulled out a bouquet of colored flowers, with the borrowed ring tied to it. The crowd clapped and cheered! There were also shadow plays, even more novel! There were scenes of battles and food deliveries, like being on a mountain road, making people unable to take it all in!

Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation: Summer Special

### Essentials of Summer Hygiene

—Ying Dai

It's summer again! As summer approaches, diseases are more prevalent than in other seasons, so it's especially important to think about and pay attention to hygiene. Here, based on my personal thoughts, I will describe several hygiene issues that should be noted in various aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the summer.

Clothing Hygiene: The clothes worn in summer are thin and easily get dirty, so they need to be washed frequently, preferably every day. Regarding the weather, the mornings and evenings in summer are much cooler than midday, so the clothes worn in the morning and evening should be thicker and should not be changed less frequently for the sake of coolness. Overly tight-fitting clothes are not hygienic when worn on the body, especially for young men and women whose bodies are not fully developed. They should not wear small clothes just to be fashionable.

Food Hygiene: You need to be most careful about what you eat in summer. If you are not careful, you will get sick, and it will be especially severe in summer. If possible, cook all the meals at home. It is better to eat less at restaurants. All food must be covered to prevent flies. It is best not to eat leftovers. Food exposed to the open air on stalls should not be eaten. It is best not to eat cold drinks, and if you do, do not overdo it. Bowls and dishes must be washed on the same day and washed cleanly. Absolutely do not drink unboiled water.

Housing Hygiene: During the summer, the windows in the house should be wide open. Whether in the courtyard or inside the house, spray disinfectant water every day. It is best to install screens to prevent mosquitoes and flies from entering. If there are patients in the house, they should be isolated. If it is an infectious disease, send the patient to the hospital immediately. If there are mosquitoes in the place you live, install mosquito nets on the beds. Every room must be washed and swept frequently. All utensils must also be wiped frequently to prevent mold growth.

Transportation Hygiene: In the summer, it is better to go out less if you don't have anything to do. If you need to buy something or for other matters, it is better to go out in the morning or evening because going out at midday, when the sunlight is strong, is prone to heatstroke. Even in the morning and evening, you shouldn't walk too much. Every morning, it is best to go to the park for a walk, breathe fresh air, and take a walk, which is also beneficial to hygiene. When you are walking down the street and sweating profusely, do not take advantage of the temporary heat to eat a lot of cold drinks. Even if you want to eat, it is best to eat less.

I believe that if people living in Shanghai can pay such attention to hygiene in clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the summer, they will definitely be able to reduce many diseases and spend the summer safely.

### Swimsuits

—Lu Lishi

What kind of exercise is most suitable in summer? Football and basketball are too strenuous, and you can't stand the excessive heat. Summer is originally the tennis season, but this kind of thing is not widespread, so under the hot sun, we still jump into the swimming pool, spend a few cents (buying a long-term pass is even cheaper) to take a full bath, practice swimming, and at the same time, in the pool full of mermaids, we join in to join in the fun, at least it's a very interesting thing.

Speaking of swimming, I think of swimsuits. Of course, you can just go to the store to buy one, but we have to choose the most satisfactory swimsuit. Ordinary swimsuits are probably the same style as undershirts, with a pair of pants attached below. People in the water should be as light as possible, everyone should be naked, but this seems too uncivilized. Wearing a piece of clothing to cover some places that cannot be made public, so the material should be soft and the lighter the better. Silk swimsuits can have these two advantages, but the price is very expensive. Isn't it said in the newspaper that Mr. Zhang Shankun went to Hong Kong to buy one for Ms. Tong Yuejuan for dozens of yuan? Most of the ordinary people use cotton yarn, and the price is at least more than one yuan. Therefore, swimming, this sport, may not be very developed in the city because it costs a lot.

Recently, a new type of swimsuit has been invented abroad that allows people who can't swim to float on the water after wearing it, like putting on a lifebuoy, so it is very useful for beginners in swimming. This kind of swimsuit is made of woven fabric, filled with celluloid bladders and a very light grass produced in Brazil, which can provide great buoyancy. People who talk about swimming float and do not sink. This kind of swimsuit looks similar to ordinary ones, but the effect is greater.

### One Week Economic Menu

Hua Ying

When eating vegetables in summer, you should always eat them refreshingly. Fatty fish and meat are a bit daunting. However, fish and meat are not impossible to eat. As long as they are prepared properly, the greasiness can be reduced. For example, dried vegetable braised pork. The pork should not be cut into whole pieces but into small, thin slices. Put more dried vegetables, so that all the meat oil is absorbed by the dried vegetables, and you will not feel greasy. And because the dried vegetables have more meat oil, they are more flavorful. There is also fresh lotus leaf steamed pork, which is one of the famous summer dishes. Cut the pork into thin slices, soak it in high-quality soy sauce for a while, and then wrap it in glutinous rice flour. Cut the fresh lotus leaves into squares, wrap them one by one, and steam them over water. It tastes fragrant and refreshing, and you don't feel the greasiness of the meat. Beef made with onion beef shreds, cabbage tomato beef soup, etc., are not greasy. As for fish, it is not as greasy as pork at all, not to mention stewing and steaming, which are very refreshing. You can also fry the fish in oil first and then cook it with winter melon, which is also very suitable for summer tastes.

### Talking about Vegetarianism

—He Lisan

Some people say: Vegetables are rich in "vitamins" and iron. Therefore, eating vegetarian food is enough to nourish the body. Promoting vegetarianism is most suitable for hygiene. This is, of course, not objectionable. In fact, when it comes to health maintenance, a person does not necessarily have to be a vegetarian. Because if you eat vegetarian for a long time, there will be too much lack of fat in your diet, and insufficient nutrition will adversely affect your health. It may even lead to anemia. I am in the medical profession, telling you from experience. It is common to see many women who are long-term vegetarians are often weak and sick. Also, because the range of food is too narrow, their appetite will not be good. Eating less, the body will naturally become tired. Moreover, most people who are long-term vegetarians do not know how to maintain their health. Their minds are full of superstitious ideas. They believe that eating vegetarian food, refraining from killing, and receiving the blessings of the Bodhisattva will be reborn in the next life as a blessed person. So, usually bound by this superstition and negativity, they forcibly suppress the most important "appetite" in life. Think about it, eating vegetarian like this completely violates "natural life," isn't it harmful rather than beneficial? In our country, the most emphasis on hygiene has always been on Confucius. And there is the saying "food and sex are natural": advocating "food is never too refined." The principle can also be thought about deeply. In short, everything values "appropriateness." There must also be a standard for vegetarianism. Sometimes you should be vegetarian, sometimes you shouldn't be vegetarian. For example, if you are unwell, you should naturally abstain from meat when you are sick. Or in the hot summer, you should also eat vegetarian food as much as possible. The compromise method is to eat meat and vegetarian food complementarily, not biased. Overindulging in meat and strong flavors is equally detrimental to hygiene. Long-term vegetarianism is not necessarily beneficial to hygiene. The so-called "too much or not enough is equally harmful." This is up to our own choice.

### From Eating Fruit to Littering Fruit Peels

—Qiu Lang

Spring has quietly passed away, and the hot summer has come rushing in. Speaking of "spring flowers and summer fruits," summer is the season for the ripening of melons and fruits. Walking into the market, you can see them everywhere. In Shanghai, which is known as an isolated island, it is still possible to transport them from other places, which cannot be said to be the good fortune of the people on the isolated island.

Fruit is a side dish for Westerners after meals. It is said to help digestion and clear the stomach. Even at our banquets, there are four dishes of fruit for drinking and sobering up. Moreover, in the hot summer, eating melons and fruits is indeed a wonderful way to relieve heat and quench thirst, so I am not against eating fruit, but I have two rules for fruit; (1) Do not eat fruits that are not hot or rotten, (2) Absolutely do not throw away the skins of melons and fruits anywhere, especially in the middle of the street! The former is of course harmful to hygiene and may even cause disease, while the latter is the development of bad habits. It is often seen that people of the lower class buy fruits on the street, eat them while walking, and throw the peels into the street, which is the worst! I try to explain as follows; eating fruit along the street is not unaesthetic, but littering peels is an act of violating police regulations, first, the dirty vegetable peels attract mosquitoes and flies, hindering public hygiene, second, pedestrians may inadvertently step on them and slip, which damages morality, and third, there are many bad impressions, so I specifically mention it, hoping that people who throw away melon and fruit peels at random will refrain from doing so!

### Talking About Cold Drinks

—Xin Fo

Once the hot season arrives, all businesses become bleak, but only cold drinks have an endless stream of customers. Like before the August 13th Incident, tens of thousands of dan of watermelons were transported to Shanghai from the inland for sale. Now, due to transportation inconveniences and various restrictions, I am afraid that the general public cannot enjoy this good fortune. So last year, the sour plum soup and popsicles of the Mukden cold drink industry were in short supply, breaking all previous sales records. Because the prices are low and the taste is beautiful, popsicles are convenient to eat, even if you are walking on the road, sitting in the car, or lying on the beach, you can have one in hand to cool off and relieve the heat. However, there are many miscellaneous brands on the market, and the manufacturing is sloppy, which is quite dangerous to eat. It is best to buy famous products such as Beauty Brand, Ice Wheel Brand, and Golden Camel Brand, because they are indeed made with boiling water.

Fashionable people and playboys, when summer arrives, ice cream and fresh orange juice become their only drinks. Like in the Suzhou-Jiaxing area, there is a homemade cold drink called "jelly," which is no less delicious than the above two. There is now domestic jelly for sale, and the production method is extremely simple. You only need to mix it with water, boil it, and let it solidify, then cut it into small pieces, pour in frozen mint water, and add white sugar and homemade plum sauce to make it. It quenches thirst, promotes salivation, and is beautiful and refreshing. Summer has arrived, so why not ask your Shanghai friends to try it at home. (Note: Plum sauce is made by boiling ripe plums until they are rotten, removing the sour dew, and adding white sugar. The more you boil it, the better. It is not sold on the market.)

### About Swimming

—Competition

The swimming pools have all opened: of course, people living in the bustling city can get a relatively "quiet" place again. The clothes on your body are thin, and the water in the pool is so cool, you can relieve the heat all over your body by jumping into the water; who says there is no fun? And it is also a strength-building exercise that can make your muscle lines healthy and beautiful, it is really the best!

Here I want to tell you some things to pay attention to when swimming: Our swimming time is best in the morning or about two hours after a meal; before entering the water, you should do a few minutes of gentle exercise and deep breathing to warm up the whole body and make your limbs flexible, so that you can be more active after entering the water. If you feel a little tired or cold in the water, you should immediately get out of the water to rest; if you are a beginner, then it is best not to stay in the water for more than thirty minutes each time. Before swimming, it is best to plug the ear canal with cotton and apply Vaseline or something similar on the outside; if you don't use cotton, then you must remember to dry the water in your ears after swimming to avoid ear canal inflammation. After swimming, you must also rub your whole body with a dry towel until the skin turns red; frequent rubbing like this can strengthen the skin! If you encounter cramps, you should try to massage the affected area or apply hot water.

There are also a few points to pay special attention to: If we want to swim, it is best to have more people, because swimming alone is a dangerous thing. It is not advisable to swim after eating too much, because it will hinder digestive function. You should not go swimming when your body is not very comfortable. You should not swim after a long walk or strenuous exercise. Many people neglect this point the most, but they do not know that the body's temperature changes too quickly, which can cause cramps or other diseases!

If you are not good at swimming, you should not practice diving in places where you do not know the depth of the water; if you have not done considerable research on lifesaving methods, you should not risk entering the water to save people, you should only use equipment or other methods on the shore to rescue.

These many points are partly heard and partly referenced, but there are always some points that are quite valuable. I am writing them here to contribute to the many people who are active in the blue waves.

### Methods for Eliminating Bed Bugs

— (Chen Mingxi)

As the weather gradually warms up, Shanghai will become a world of bed bugs. The lower and middle classes suffer the most, with these blood-sucking creatures lurking in cracks in boards, on mattresses, and in orange chairs. Now, I have several methods for eliminating bed bugs. If your residences are troubled by bed bugs, you might as well choose a convenient and easily accessible one to try.

First Method: Mash peach leaves and apply the paste to the cracks where bed bugs reside. The scent will immediately paralyze the bed bugs, and they will never revive. If you worry that peach leaf juice will stain the curtains and bedding, leaving marks, you can grind dry peach leaves into powder and spread it between the bedding and bed boards, which will have the same effect.

Second Method: Place wheat straw under the bedding, then boil buckwheat straw with water and pour it hot into the cracks, killing the bed bugs instantly.

Third Method: Grind eel bones and pangolin scales into a fine powder and simmer it under the bed. Bed bugs are most afraid of this smell and will die immediately after smelling it.

The above three methods are all easy to implement and cost very little. I have personally tested them and found them to be very effective. I dare to introduce them to readers so you can avoid a summer of disturbance.

### Summer Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Chan Chen

Late spring has quietly passed, but the wheel of time has secretly ushered in the prelude to a new summer. As the seasons change, people's lives naturally undergo considerable changes.

Summer is a period when diseases are most rampant and active. Cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, prickly heat, and cholera are even more terrifying. Some people believe that if they can safely get through the summer, they can relax at other times. This is not an exaggeration but a real fact. Therefore, we must be especially careful about clothing, food, housing, transportation, and daily life in the summer. Although it may seem too early to discuss these issues at the beginning of summer, it is good to "plan ahead" and discuss them in advance.

Clothing: Summer clothing should be light and simple, unlike the hassle and expense of wearing layers upon layers in other seasons. In the past, summer clothing materials mostly used spun silk and Indian silk for their lightness and coolness. However, at this moment, the people in the occupied areas cannot live and work in peace to raise silkworms and reel silk. These materials are naturally mostly artificial silk. If you want to be true to your conscience, it is better to wear less of that kind of clothing. Authentic domestic products include crepe, Xiangyun gauze, and Wanzai summer cloth, which are strong and stylish. Everyone may want to try wearing them, but I'm afraid there won't be many available this year. As for the color of summer clothing, white is the most appropriate because it can reflect sunlight. Black or dark-colored clothes absorb sunlight and are very hot. Also, although we don't want to dress like flamboyant "lotus dandies" in the summer, going shirtless and wearing shorts is both unsightly and unhygienic, so I hope it will be absolutely avoided.

Food: This is the most important thing. As the saying goes, "Calamity comes from the mouth, and disease enters from the mouth." Especially in summer, most diseases are caused by improper diet. Because the weather is hot in summer, the human stomach and intestines are relatively weak. Therefore, it is best not to eat greasy, meaty foods and other foods that are difficult to digest, as these things are detrimental to health. Some people advocate vegetarianism in the summer, not to cultivate immortality and become a Buddha, but truly for health and hygiene, which is worth promoting. There are also some people who are greedy for small gains and eat cheap, unsanitary ice cream, sour plum soup, fresh orange juice, mung bean soup, and other things, which are all causes of disease and should be handled with caution. There is also a hateful thing in the summer—flies, which carry microorganisms on their feet and harm people by flying around. Generally, if a person inadvertently eats food that has been contaminated by flies, they are guaranteed to get sick, so everyone must rise up and eliminate them.

Housing: It is not easy to live in an isolated island. The usual cramped, pigeon-cage-like houses are already suffocating, and in the summer, it is even easier to suffer from heatstroke. Finding a more spacious house is difficult. On the one hand, there is the problem of overcrowding, and the demand for housing exceeds the supply. Where can one find it? On the other hand, even if you discover a water source in the desert and find a relatively spacious house, the unscrupulous landlord thinks it is a "rare commodity" and demands a price that makes you gasp and feel discouraged. "Hanging salted iron on your nose," don't even think about it. Therefore, "housing" is a very serious problem this summer. Some people, because their living quarters are cramped and there is no other way, sleep outdoors with just a pillow and a mat. Although it is temporarily cool, it will cause problems. It is better for everyone to tidy up their houses, move out some empty space, and find some peace of mind and mental tranquility, which may help to dispel some of the heat.

Transportation: Summer travel should be simpler than in other seasons. Walking around under the sun is very easy to suffer from heatstroke, and it is very inconvenient to sweat profusely as soon as you move. Therefore, all unnecessary socializing and unnecessary travel in the summer are best "rested."

What has been said above applies only to ordinary common people. As for those classes who live in foreign houses and ride in cars, they should be considered separately.

### Self-Promotion

— Bai Ying

It is said that self-promotion by writers is a somewhat popular and despised habit. But I think the issue lies in the motivation for self-promotion. If the motivation is for personal gain, then even if it cannot be summarily judged as a despicable act, at least such promotion is of little value. However, because the "self" is involved, even the introduction and criticism of objective motivations are all considered despised habits, which is too restrictive of the broad significance of scholarship.

For example, if a writer writes something, they are only allowed to be criticized by others and forbidden to say a word themselves, otherwise they will be ridiculed for "self-promotion." I think this attitude is very unfair when applied to academic exploration. Such an attitude is rarely seen in Western academic circles, but it is still quite popular among Chinese writers. This is a major obstacle to the progress of scholarship.

I personally believe that rather than rejecting self-promotion, it is better to allow even self-boasting to exist. The reason is that in the exploration of scholarship, self-boasting cannot have a long-term possibility of survival; boasting may deceive readers for a while, but the boaster can only benefit from that opportunity to exist. Conversely, liberating objective self-promotion is giving greater freedom to academic research. If an author dares to introduce their own writing, dares to express the views of their own work, wouldn't this be a help to other critics and general readers?

Although self-promotion is not a popular term, self-criticism has long been accepted as a tool for progress. In fact, self-promotion and self-criticism are nothing more than two means of self-knowledge: one is active, and the other is passive. Non-objective self-criticism is actually subjective self-promotion—boasting; objective self-promotion is equivalent to objective criticism.

A well-known writer often, at the request of readers or out of self-motivation, specially recommends some of their works to readers. This behavior can also be said to be self-promotion. And almost every famous writer does this without feeling ashamed, because the effect of this kind of promotion comes entirely from pure self-knowledge, without any personal gain involved. Although such self-recommended works may still be unavoidable with the author's own biases, in most cases, they are indeed the author's representative works.

I do not suggest using self-promotion as an independent tool for academic advancement, because this would lead to many abuses. My meaning is to treat it as a means of self-knowledge, to be used in conjunction with self-criticism, another means.

It is not enough to think that self-criticism is self-knowledge, because criticism only fulfills the task of the passive aspect; active self-encouragement still requires self-promotion with self-confidence.

Finally, it must be stated that the "promotion" here does not refer to the overused promotion in political terminology, but rather to the original meaning of advocacy—the self-expression of belief.

### Mao Guang's "Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas"

— Zou Xiao

I recently read Mao Guang's "Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas" and would like to say a few words.

Mao Guang, styled Heting, was a native of Rufu, Jiangsu, and a descendant of Mao Pijiang, the author of "Shadow Plum Hermitage Recollections." In addition to Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas, there are also "Xiaosanwu Pavilion Lyrics" (originally named Guizhai Oral Sins) and others. His prose has been selected into the New Ancient Prose Anthology. His son Shuyan is the author of "Fighting in Northern Shaanxi."

I met Mr. Mao once at a gathering of musicians. I spoke Mandarin, and he spoke fluent Mandarin to me. Later, he spoke Jiangxi dialect and Huguang dialect to other acquaintances. It can be said that he had a talent for languages—he must have been a very interesting person. His flowing white beard also reminded me of Feng Zikai for no reason. The phrase "乖乖龍東" (guai guai long dong) in "Departure Temple" is just a natural expression, not fully expressing Mr. Mao's strengths.

Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas contains eight miscellaneous dramas, several of which mention the author's ancestors. "Departure Temple" takes Mao Pijiang as the protagonist, so it goes without saying. Even in miscellaneous dramas with other people as protagonists, they are often mentioned. For example, in the drama "Zheng Tuoniang," Mao Pijiang's inscription on the sword-speaking picture in the army is mentioned, and in the drama "Ma Xianglan," the poetry collection of the Four Beauties of Qinhuai selected by "Mao Boqi" is mentioned. Lin Qin'nan's "Evening Illumination Temple for Mr. Mao Chaomin's Birthday Record" says: "Heting is erudite and capable of poetry, honoring Mr. Chaomin, even broken silk and scattered fragments, he must pick up and hide them." He cherished his ancestors' legacy so much that it is no wonder he repeatedly mentioned them in the dramas.

Mr. Mao also liked to talk about Buddhism. "Ye Nu Returning Soul" and "South Sea God" contain many Buddhist terms. This can be seen from the preface to his Guizhai Oral Sins, where he claimed to have "studied Buddhism for forty years in Guizhai," so it can be known why he liked to talk about Buddhist principles in his dramas.

There must also be many authors and readers. The Magpie Stepping Branch in "Departure Temple" is similar to "Thinking of Mortal Life," and the Leisurely Tune in "Ma Xianglan" is similar to Xu Wei's Four Cries of the Gibbon.

These eight miscellaneous dramas all use women from the late Ming Dynasty as their subjects. The characters in the first four are Wu Ruixian, Ye Xiaoluan, Ma Xianglan, and Bian Yujing. Each person has one act, like the Four Cries of the Gibbon and Four Beautiful Women. The characters in the last four are Wang Huajiang, Yun Shiniang, Yin Niang, and Zheng Tuoniang. Their counterparts are Qu Dajun, Chen Qinian, and others. Among them, some literati, seeing that the country was about to perish, indulged in pleasure in a perverted way, committing slow suicide. Although it is not something we should emulate, their mood is pitiful. Here are just a few selected epigrams: "Who knows Lingjun's hard heart?" (Opening scene at the end) "What can be done, remembering the broken homeland... fleeing in a small boat. Endless tears for the country, a miserable nest barely surviving." (Departure Temple) "Princess of Zhongshan, creating chaos before entering the palace, driven away by the northern soldiers with a single whip." (Bian Yujing) "Seeing that the Central Plains is losing its deer, who says that women do not fly heroically?" "Like Qin Liangyu, generous, more proud than Long Gejun's women's army." (Yun Shiniang) "Swallows on the riverbank, the old nests are all gone." "Hongguang fled south, the mountains and rivers in a hurry, the birds' clothing of the Wang and Xie families all withered." "Worry, can't bear to watch this country weep." (Zheng Tuoniang)

At the end of the song, I think that the most praiseworthy character is Liu Jingting, who appears last. Looking at it through tinted glasses, I hope that Mr. Mao will write another miscellaneous drama to show Mao Pijiang's heroic spirit when he stayed in Nanjing to defend against the rebellion.

What I like as much as Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas is Mr. Mao's recent Dragon Mountain Gathering: "The flames of war are spreading, everywhere in the north and south, Yan Zhao and Wu Chu. Counting the annual sorrow in autumn, it is not as bitter as this year."

### (3) Five Methods of Approaching God

— Xie

(1) Always think that God is omnipresent, and say like the poet: "Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I go to escape your face? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I am in hell, you are also there." If a person always keeps this thought in mind, then over time, they will naturally develop a sense of awe for God, and all their actions will be cautious and careful, daring not to be careless. Our behavior must be pure and flawless, and we must not commit the slightest sin, because in the final judgment, the Lord's judgment is extremely clear, and there is no way to escape. (2) No matter what you see, you must think that God exists there and think of God's power and grace. For example, seeing the sun, think of God's glory; seeing fire, think of God's passion; seeing water, think of God's kindness. God sends down sweet dew, nurturing all things and providing for people's needs in life. At the same time, he also gives us comfort in our hearts. If we maintain this concept, we can promote our good intentions, strengthen our faith, and dispel all evil thoughts and delusions. (3) When a person is living in solitude, they should often meditate on God. A saint once said: "The work of dark contemplation is to build a holy temple in the heart for God to dwell in." (4) God lives inside us and also lives inside our brothers and sisters, so if our brothers and sisters lack food and clothing, we should help them, and God will surely be pleased. (5) All living beings in the world are created by God and are loved by God as much as we humans, so we must not treat or harm any living creature.

### Talking About the Past (Part 1)

— Keshan

Recently, there have been many alarming news items, which can be seen in various news reports, saying: at what time, what will happen; at what time, what will happen. But everyone's psychology hopes that these will not become a reality.

Now, let's not talk about these things, let's talk about past facts. Because the newly opened Haitian Bookstore in Shanghai asked me to proofread Xu Mengxin's "Comprehensive Compilation of Northern Alliance Affairs of the Three Dynasties" of the Song Dynasty, which aroused my interest in talking about it. Among them, according to the annual events, the deeds of the Jin people's wars and peace with the Jin people during the forty-five years of the three dynasties of Huizong, Qinzong, and Gaozong are compiled, and more than three hundred kinds of unofficial records are collected, becoming a masterpiece of 1.3 million words. Mr. Ji Xiaolan, the "Chinese" Didai Lu, once commented that it was "erudite and detailed, and no other work at the time could surpass it." It can be seen that it is a very valuable book.

What I am proofreading is the second year of Jingkang (the reign title of Song Gaozong), a period of facts after Huizong and Qinzong were captured and the Jin people established Zhang Bangchang as emperor.

At that time, the Jin people were determined not to let the Zhao family rule anymore, but the hearts of the Chinese people were very excited and supported the court, so that the Jin people did not dare to directly take it as their own. Since Qinzong went to the city for peace talks, thousands of scholars and commoners gathered at the South Gate every day to welcome the emperor's carriage. Later, they even gathered Taoists and monks to set up altars along the streets to pray, making the whole city noisy and filled with incense. Although it was close to superstition, the direction of the people's hearts was very clear. Another passage writes about Li Ruoshui resisting the imperial decree:

On that day, after reading the decree, the Han envoy Nianhan made Qing take off his imperial clothes. Ruoshui stepped forward and held them up, telling him not to take them off, saying, "This is乱做(luàn zuò, doing recklessly). This is the true emperor of the Great Dynasty. You dog辈(bèi, bunch) cannot be disrespectful." Holding it with his left hand and pointing at Nianhan with his right hand and scolding him, he was beaten on the head by several people, blood splattering everywhere. After a while, he saw that he had put on the imperial clothes, and he immediately fainted to the ground. After a while, everyone dispersed, and Ruoshui also recovered slightly.

This can also express the people's loyalty to the country at that time, so that the Jin people did not dare to swallow China in one gulp.

At that time, the most active Wu and Mo were the two people who forced the Supreme Emperor (Huizong) into the wilderness and took the empress and princes. At this time, the Jin people did not dare to take China's land as their own, and asked the chief officials of the court to elect someone who could replace the Zhao family as emperor. However, the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor Sun Fu and others submitted statements to the court four times, still hoping to preserve the Zhao family. Later, the people knew that these Jin people wanted to harm the country, and they all looked at each other and cried. Even the great national traitor Fan Zongyin was called to comfort the army and the people.

The Jin people ordered to gather hundreds of officials to elect an emperor of a different surname, but who should be elected? The compilation records:

Wang Shiyong again ordered Fan Zongyin to guard the provincial gate, using the matter of recommending Zhang Bangchang to speak to the army and the people. In the inner front government, the terrace officials were stripped of their duties and ordered to quickly provide their names and titles to support him. Those who dissented were escorted to the front of the army. The army, the people, the elderly, the monks, and the Taoists looked back and remained silent, nodding and retreating. Only the students of the Imperial College replied, "What we have seen..." meaning "not quite so." Fearing that the army and the people would follow suit, they raised their voices and rebuked the crowd, saying, "Loyalty is the most important thing today, not filial piety alone." Then they ordered their colleagues to return to school. At that time, Sun Fu and Zhang Shuye had already left, and only Shiyong presided over the matter. Hundreds of officials were gathered, but they only saw ten screens of white paper, ordering them to write their positions and names and then retreat. The sad words were kept secret and not shown to the public. Thin paper, Wu Sheng and Mo Shi submitted their statements and left.

### Red Devil Vasika

— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

Vasika's day of retribution finally arrived.

One evening, before the prostitutes went to the parlor to receive guests, they were having dinner in the dining room with their clothes loosely worn. At that time, one of them, named Lida Milnogurova—a bold, cruel, and slovenly woman—looked out the window and said:

"Vasika is here."

A torrent of worried curses erupted.

"Come and see!" Lida shouted, "That guy is drunk. He's with the police... Come and see!"

Everyone ran to the window.

"They're taking his clothes off!... Look!" Lida shouted happily, "Oh, he's injured!"

Curses and malicious laughter filled the dining room—the laughter of vengeful joy. The prostitutes jostled each other and ran to the door to greet their helpless enemy.

They saw the officer and the driver supporting Vasika. Vasika's face was pale, and large beads of sweat welled up on his forehead. His ruined left leg dragged behind him.

"Vasika! Laineinichi! What's going on!" the madam shouted.

Vasika shook his head weakly and replied hoarsely:

"I fell..."

"He fell off the cart..." the officer said, "He fell, and his leg got caught in the wheel and broke... That's all!"

The prostitutes fell silent, but their eyes flashed with fire.

People carried Vasika to the attic and put him on the bed, while someone called for a doctor. The prostitutes stood by his bed, looking at each other without saying a word.

"Get out of here!" Vasika said to them.

No one moved.

"Now you're happy!... (7)"

### Words of a Bad Guy (Part 1)

— Wang Xianzai

Editor's Introduction: Wang Xianzai dedicated himself to the screen very early and has long enjoyed the reputation of "the number one villain." But in person, he is a very nice gentleman. From what is stated in this article, it is known that this is motivated by something, which shows that his success on the screen is well-deserved and very interesting.

After dabbling in the film industry for nearly twenty years, I have acted in more than a hundred films. Because I have always specialized in playing villainous roles, the result I have achieved so far is that I have left the audience with a bad impression of being "extremely wicked" and have won many evil names and curses such as "standard villain" and "bad guy." I often think about it and find it very funny: if a person really did this to such an extent, he would obviously be "pointed at by thousands of people" and should have "died without illness" long ago!

"Wang Xianzai, this bad guy, has never played a 'good guy' on the screen." That's right, this is indeed the real situation. But why do I only play "bad guys"? Am I really incapable of playing "good guys"? In the simplest words: this is really all forced upon me by the environment, that is, there is a surge of anger hidden in my heart, and I always feel that I must vent it in this way, which is why it was created.

In my performance on the screen, I am an "unforgivable" great sinner; here, like a criminal! I am willing to make a very sincere confession about the origin and experience of my evil deeds.

The Motivation for Thinking of Doing Evil

When I was young, I grew up in Vladivostok. My father was a well-known local businessman, and his business was not small. Unfortunately, when I was eleven years old, he fell ill and passed away, leaving our mother and several children. My mother suffered from illiteracy, and I was a very young child; all property matters were handled entirely by several relatives. Unexpectedly, they were real bad guys. They bullied the widow and orphans, fabricating documents and playing various tricks, trying to seize the family property. Within a few years, they had suffered great misfortune.

This painful memory, and the faces and behaviors of those seemingly kind but sinister villains, are forever deeply engraved in my mind. Later, when I entered society, I suffered a lot of deception and oppression, and my nerves were also severely stimulated. Because under cold observation, I saw too many faces of bad people, and I heard and saw a lot of bad people's evil deeds, so after entering the film industry, I made up my mind to use this "experience" as a target for imitation. Therefore, I thought of doing evil and became a heinous "bad guy."

My motivation for being a "bad guy" was motivated by something; my purpose for being a "bad guy" was to have a little edifying effect. I hope that there will be no bad people in the world in the future, and my "bad guy" on the screen will have no way to do evil at that time.

### Hitler Appears on the Screen

— Degang

Hollywood's Joint Production Company is now filming a blockbuster called: "Confessions of a Nazi Spy." Naturally, there are often shots of Hitler in the film, but after searching all of Hollywood, no one was completely similar to Hitler and could take on this important role. There was no way, so the director decided to invite Mr. Hitler himself to play the role.

The method is this: old newsreels and photos of him in daily newspapers and magazines are selected one by one, gathered together, and some cutting and pasting is added, which is enough to meet the needs of Hitler's shots in the film.

Although Mr. Hitler himself has been very busy with the Danzig issue recently and cannot spare time to come to Hollywood to film, this is equivalent to him personally appearing on the screen.

Vasika weakly shook his head and hoarsely replied:

### Zhao Tongshen is Skilled in Both Northern and Southern Schools

— Yiren

Zhao Tongshen (Furongcao) has long been highly paid and has earned a good reputation. In fact, Mr. Tongshen lives in seclusion, promoting national opera. He founded a labor school and rebuilt the Gengsu Theater on a grand scale, making it the best in the north and south of the Yangtze River. He hired Ouyang Yuqian to preside over the competition, and Yuqian then invited Tongshen, Zha Tianying, Wu Wozun and others as instructors. Yuqian is the chief of the northern and southern school blue shirts, and gets along very well with Tongshen. In addition to presiding over teaching affairs and performing every night, Yuqian also uses his spare time to arrange new plays, mostly based on the books "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Lianzai." The play "Chang'e Benyue," is especially popular. Every performance is a collaboration with Tongshen, and the two are in perfect harmony, with the wonderful effect of complementing each other. Tongshen knows Yuqian's strengths well and understands everything. After spending several years together, he has benefited deeply. Therefore, Tongshen's art is skilled in both northern and southern schools, and his current good reputation is not accidental. It is remembered that in the play "Chang'e Benyue," Yuqian played Chang'e and Tongshen played Wu Gang, and the wonderful expressions and actions can be called the best of both. Now that Yuqian is working hard in the film industry, this tune has truly become Guangling San!

### Pinghua Master Guo Shaomei Suddenly Passed Away

— Lüe E

Pinghua master Guo Shaomei was the founder of Yuyushe at the end of the Qing Dynasty and one of the five tiger generals of the society. He was good at telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Five Tigers Pacifying the West," and could also tell "Liaozhai." Shaomei had extremely deep academic roots and was very knowledgeable. When telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," he always quoted classics and cited historical facts, geography, and characters, so that everything was clear and correct. He increased people's knowledge. Guo has damaged books for more than fifty years. Later, due to old age, he specialized in teaching Chinese and history in a certain school, teaching students to enjoy his later years. Guo first came to Shanghai more than twenty years ago and performed in Xuxulou outside Datongmen East Street, succeeding Yue Chuantai's head Cheng Hongfei. After refusing to write books, he often enjoyed tea at Tianchan Teahouse. A few weeks ago, he suddenly fell ill and could not afford to get up. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away on the 3rd of this month. He was over seventy years old. His sons and daughters-in-law are all in the mainland and were unable to see him off in person. Guo has no savings and his funeral is bleak. From then on, the Pinghua world lost another one, which is indeed a great loss.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the White Tiger of the Pear Garden

The reasons given by their clan leader are that although gambling and smoking all waste materials and hurt the body, there is a difference in urgency and internality. Gambling is outside the family, and it is not easy for parents to prevent it. Moreover, the gambling in the countryside is either pressing treasures or playing dominoes. As the saying goes, "the collapse of the dominoes family," it only takes one night to lose all the real estate, so the danger to wealth is too great. As for prostitution, it is enough to make people lose their reputation. If prostitutes are brought home, it will inevitably disturb the peace of the whole family and cause disharmony between husband and wife. Although its danger is slightly less than gambling, once it reaches the level of wild prostitution, it will disappear without a trace, and people will not be seen. Things that should be handled cannot be handled. Therefore, compared to the three, smoking is a kind of hobby, and its danger is the smallest. They all smoke in moderation, which not only does not hinder the affairs that the children should handle, but also naturally prompts them to immediately run home when they are addicted, and they will never dare to do anything wrong outside. Furthermore, if they are already addicted to smoking, even if they are allowed to engage in wild prostitution and gambling, they are absolutely unwilling to do so. Since the Meng family rules allow open smoking of opium, of course, the Xiangzi shops such as Ruifuxiang and Ruilinxiang in Peiping and the residence of Meng Siye often have lights on. Biyun is at the Meng family for almost twenty days a month. It is really too difficult for young people to be sure of themselves. Sometimes, after the performance in the restaurant, they feel a little tired, and occasionally smoke one or two pipes, but they don't feel anything. As the days go by, they can't do without it. Singing actors often focus on appearance, and once he develops a habit, the makeup will become more and more ugly day by day. Biyun does not check himself, but seems to be digging his own grave, which is also the biggest reason why he willingly falls. Secondly, he relies on his adoptive father's wealth and loves him very much, so he acts recklessly. Later, he committed adultery and was sentenced to several months of hard labor. Since then, his reputation has been ruined and he has been treated like a person. Although Meng Siye paid to bail him out not long after, he was too embarrassed to perform again in a short period of time. —(58)—

### Leisurely Drawing of the Entertainment World

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

(9) Bang Bang Opera

The first to introduce Bang Bang Opera (Ping Opera) to Shanghai was the Zhu sisters, and the one who made the deepest impression on Shanghai people should be Bai Yushuang.

"Ma Widow's Idle Shop" and "Shooting the Little Old Lady" are Bai Yushuang's representative works. At that time, the recitation of several plots such as "Dreaming Back to the Cross-Legs" and "Undressing and Breastfeeding" far exceeded today's "Luo Luo Li Bo" and "Burning Fire and Sleeping Screen".

Strictly speaking, this is a kind of "local small opera" that is not elegant.
