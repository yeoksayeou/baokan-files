For example, the incident in Chenliu in which rioters invaded an American church, smashed windows, and forced Chinese people to withdraw is one proof of this. Therefore, many people now believe that the clamor that began with the anti-British political movement is gradually becoming a Japanese movement against Christianity. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### The Heroic Martyrdom of Battalion Commander Shi and Company Commander Chen: Complete Sacrifice Is Praiseworthy and Moving: Special Merits in the Battle of Northern Hunan

Miluo: In this Battle of Northern Hunan, although the officers and soldiers of the Chinese armies had different successes and sacrifices due to different circumstances, their composure and courage in combat, advancing without retreating, are the most important factors in achieving this epoch-making victory. There are two praiseworthy and moving events: (1) The Japanese attacked the Chinese army's Bijiashan on the north bank of the Xinqiang River. Battalion Commander Shi Enhua, who was defending the area, held out independently for three days with a battalion of troops. The Japanese concentrated more than ten planes, more than 30 artillery pieces, and a regiment of infantry and cavalry, and launched a fierce attack for eight hours. The Chinese position did not move at all. The next day, the Japanese army attacked again with all its strength. Shi immediately went to the front line to supervise the battle. When the soldiers heard that the battalion commander had arrived, they all fought bravely, with each one equaling ten. At about 6:00 PM, Shi was wounded in the shoulder by a Japanese machine gun bullet. The regimental commander ordered him to retreat for treatment, but Shi refused to go down, fearing that it would damage morale and the position would be lost. At that time, the division commander told him that if it was absolutely necessary, he could withdraw his troops. Shi replied, "Report to the division commander, I will never have a time of absolute necessity," and continued to fight, bandaging his wound and commanding the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion. Only Company Commander Yi Ping and Qu Wensheng had already been killed, and Company Commanders Yan Ganxi and Wang Kuishan were seriously wounded. The so-called entire battalion was actually only two platoon leaders and more than 40 soldiers. At this point, Shi ordered the entire army to sing the March of the Volunteers, which boosted morale even more. The Japanese army launched twelve attacks, all of which failed. They retreated and then used artillery to bombard the Chinese positions, with shells raining down like a storm. Battalion Commander Shi finally died in battle. Shi loved the people like his own children in peacetime. After the Japanese troops retreated, the residents respected his loyalty and integrity and raised money to bury him in ××, writing "Tomb of Chinese Battalion Commander Shi." (2) Company Commander Chen Huiqun was ordered to ambush the Japanese troops between Fulinpu and Shangshan. He ambushed his unit in ×× and fought the Japanese back and forth for days, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. While they were excitedly cleaning the battlefield and collecting spoils, more than 200 Japanese cavalrymen suddenly sneaked up. The company was caught off guard. The troops were densely packed and unable to disperse at once, so they engaged in a melee for three hours. After killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers, all of them died heroically. The only survivor of the Chinese army was Private Zhang Zhong. When he met the reporter, he recounted the heroic battle of Company Commander Chen, with tears still streaming down his face.

### The Dalai Lama Arrives in Lhasa

He was discovered in the Kokonor area at the beginning of this year. He will now live permanently in Lhasa. The enthronement ceremony, originally scheduled for mid-November, has now been postponed because Wu Zhongxin, the chief Chinese representative and chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, will not be able to arrive on time, and Tibet considers Wu's attendance to be extremely important.

### Associated Press Reporter Inspects the Battle Achievements in Northern Hunan The Japanese Army of 180,000 Collapsed The Victory Belongs to the Chinese Side After Failing at the Last Hurdle

Changsha: In the past four days, the reporter has traveled through an area 40 miles long and 10 miles wide, which runs parallel to the Wu-Chang Highway. On September 30, the Japanese army was surrounded by the superior forces of the Chinese army in a swift and unexpected manner. In this area, the Japanese army mobilized 180,000 troops in this attack on Changsha, but the severe blow it suffered was the worst this time. In this battle, the Japanese mobilized the 5th and 13th Divisions on the front of the Wu-Chang Line, the 33rd Division advanced along the highway, and the 106th and 101st Divisions protected the left flank, while preparing to advance rapidly southwestward from Fengxin and Nanchang to outflank the Chinese army. However, in this area, the mountains are undulating, and the Chinese army is very capable of making planned retreats, and then launching surprise attacks on each route of the Japanese army with lightning speed. Therefore, the Japanese army failed at the last hurdle, and the victory ultimately belonged to the Chinese side. Furthermore, the peaks in the northern Hunan area can not only make the Japanese lost, but even the Chinese soldiers who are familiar with this place often get lost in the mountains. For example, our party hired several guides who were familiar with the geography of this area, but on one day, we got lost twice in the mountains of Fulinpu. In addition to this, there are countless valleys here, which can accommodate at least a division of troops. Therefore, the Chinese side made full use of this advantageous terrain. At the same time, the people in the villages and towns where the Japanese army was stationed had moved their food, and the Chinese army controlled the high ground, attacking the Japanese army from above without stopping. In addition, the traffic on all the highways was completely destroyed by the Chinese, so the Japanese heavy artillery, tanks, and mechanized equipment could not be brought in and used, and they lost contact with other troops. Moreover, because they could not get food, they lost their way, and the attacks of the Chinese army became more and more fierce. Therefore, the Japanese army had no choice but to retreat. Guan Linzheng, commander of the 52nd Army, had already achieved military success in Taierzhuang and is now leading the army to defend this area. Guan is 33 years old and is the youngest of the Chinese army commanders. According to General Guan, the Japanese army's retreat this time was a complete collapse. The Japanese army's retreat began on October 1, but the order for the entire army to retreat was not issued until October 5, when the Japanese Commander-in-Chief commanding the battle in Xinshi, Miluo River, returned to Yuezhou. Little did he know that in fact, when this order was issued, the Chinese army had not only recovered the original positions along the Xinqiang River, but also advanced six miles to the north, deep into the rear of the original Japanese line. Now the Japanese army in Yuezhou is transporting military supplies to the north, and the Bailuoji Airport east of Yuezhou is also ready to be destroyed at any time, which shows that the Japanese army in Yuezhou is planning to withdraw. Jinjing is the place where the Chinese army opened a gap to lure the Japanese army to attack south. The reporter also went to inspect the place. When the Chinese army lured the Japanese army to advance, they secretly retreated to the mountains in the east. There are now graves of 500 Japanese soldiers on the hillside. Of the original 9,000 residents, 500 have returned here. In the Fulinpu area, the Japanese army was ambushed by the Chinese army, and the trees and rocks are covered with bullet marks, which is evident. According to the residents here, when the Japanese army collapsed, they threw their military uniforms, ammunition, and weapons into the river, searched for civilian clothes, disguised themselves as Chinese civilians, and fled in panic. Jinshan City is the most forward point reached by the Japanese army. According to a man in his forties here, the Japanese army captured him and asked him for food and inquired about the location of the Chinese army. Later, when the Japanese army interrogated others, he escaped into the mountains. According to another reporter, four women in the family of a Chinese doctor named Li in Malinqiao were raped by Japanese soldiers, and their son-in-law came forward to intervene and was killed by Japanese soldiers and thrown into the pond. The whole family, except for an old grandmother, jumped into the pond and committed suicide. According to a reporter from a certain inn, three women in his family were raped by Japanese soldiers and then brutally killed. According to reporters from civilians in various places, Chinese officials had ordered them to flee to the mountains, but after they fled, they also returned to inspect and suspected that the Japanese army was the retreating Chinese army, so they were victimized by the Japanese soldiers. According to a Chinese official, most Hunan people are good old men of the old era and do not believe that the Japanese are so cruel. Driven by curiosity, they wanted to see what the Japanese were like. As for now, they have personally seen the truth, so there are thousands of people who have automatically joined the army to seek revenge and revenge.

Editorial

### Is Japan Regaining Its Sanity?

Twenty days ago, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in a major battle in northern Hunan, with the Chinese army achieving a great victory; this is a military event in China's War of Resistance worth highlighting. Four days ago, the American ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, issued a frank and severe warning regarding Japan's aggression; this is another international event in China's War of Resistance that is worth highlighting. Both events are well known at home and abroad. Now, there is another event, as reported yesterday by the "Kokumin Shimbun" in Tokyo and transmitted by Reuters; the "Kokumin Shimbun" is known as a mouthpiece of the military. Yesterday it stated as follows:

(Reuters, Tokyo, 24th) The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that, "Now is the time to finally resolve all domestic and political issues since the Mukden Incident. Future developments are noteworthy. Political parties have been unusually busy recently, and the general impression is that 'the China Incident can now be considered nearing its end.' The power of opposing parties has weakened under the pressure of the political situation, so political parties should be able to regain power. At the same time, the Abe cabinet is weak and powerless. Senior statesmen close to the Emperor now hold the view that the current transitional cabinet is gradually reaching the extreme of its existence, and that the emergence of a political party cabinet should be possible in the near future." The "Kokumin Shimbun" also stated that, "Since the China Incident is nearing its end, international diplomatic pressure will become stronger and domestic economic difficulties will become even greater. Therefore, only a cabinet that can gain national support can overcome this difficult situation."

This is the latest report on the internal situation in Japan related to China's War of Resistance. Given the strictness of Japanese news censorship and the standing of the "Kokumin Shimbun," we cannot but believe in the accuracy of this report. If this is accurate, it is worth highlighting, and can be considered on par with the great victory in northern Hunan and the American warning. All three are absolutely beneficial to China, which goes without saying. However, it is not an unexpected development, nor a lucky gain, but merely confirms the accuracy of the various views and judgments held by China and its sympathizers regarding the War of Resistance over the past two or three years.

Favorable facts and circumstances for China are continuously emerging, appearing one by one before our eyes. Who can restrain their extraordinary delight? However, in terms of the overall situation and future of Sino-Japanese relations, there are still divergent paths awaiting Japan's choice. While we are delighted, we should still remain calm and carefully observe. Why do we say this? If Japan continues its aggression until a complete victory or defeat, then the coming years will merely be an extension of the mutual struggle and killing of the past two or three years. This is one path. If Japan abandons its aggression and seeks complete peace, then a sudden and bright turn should be seen within the next two or three months. This is another path. According to the former scenario, China has no choice but to continue the War of Resistance. As for the inevitable protractedness of the war, the inevitable painful sacrifices, and the inevitable suffering of coastal and riverine areas in the early stages of the war due to inferior military equipment, we knew this before the war, we saw it clearly, understood it deeply, and stated it publicly before resolving to resist. What we believe in is the later stages of military strength, the advantages of inland terrain, the potential of our people, justice, fairness, and international sympathy and assistance to win the final victory. According to the latter scenario, China only wants Sino-Japanese equality, only wants to maintain independence, and only wants the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration. Under these political principles, China is a great market with abundant resources, and it can be said that Japan and any other country cooperating with its capital and talent is a natural state that adapts to the principles of economic supply and demand. There is no need to say welcome, but it is not a surrender under the city walls! Before 1918, before the so-called Mukden Incident, China suspected Japan's hidden intentions and dared not speak lightly of cooperation. Now, there is no need to discuss Japan's intentions in the past, but Japan's aggression from the 1918 incident to the present has proven China's suspicions to be correct. Eight years of militarism, two years of bloody war, both have paid a great price, and whether they will recognize, live in peace, be good, and cooperate with each other from now on depends solely on whether Japan has regained its sanity.

The victory in northern Hunan is not yet a decisive war, but it should help Japan regain its sanity, as it should know that continued aggression is hopeless in military terms. The American warning is not yet the implementation of strong pressure, but it should also help Japan regain its sanity, as it should know that continued aggression is not tolerated by the international community. Military hopelessness is like this, international intolerance is like that; must we wait until the days are longer, the soldiers are older, defeated again and again until a disastrous defeat is beyond recovery, and then it will be over? Must we wait until the United States' so-called visible policies and actions are fully implemented and there is no room left, and then it will be over? Japan should not be so foolish. And yesterday's political brewing recorded by the "Kokumin Shimbun," as well as the so-called "China Incident is nearing its end, international diplomatic pressure will become stronger, and domestic economic difficulties will become even greater," such feelings, such confessions, we are happy to regard as a sign that Japan is gradually regaining its sanity. What remains to be examined is: what does their so-called "China Incident is nearing its end" mean? To this day, we have seen all kinds of proposals and actions by Japan other than military ones, not only is none of them expected to end this incident, but also none of them is expected to end this war! It is important to know that the state of war must end with the period of Japanese troops staying in China; and the end of the incident must wait for the establishment of equal, independent, and complete political principles! Before the military has not suffered a disastrous defeat beyond recovery, and before international pressure has not been fully implemented, it is the best and last opportunity for Japan to "resolve its domestic political situation," to sincerely face the Chinese government, and to seek a solution to the dispute. A sudden change of course will lead to a sudden turnaround, and a frank confession will lead to a bright future.

### Under the Heavy Pressure of Diplomacy and Economy, the Abe Cabinet Exposes Its Incompetence; a Political Party Cabinet May Appear in the Short Term; the Japanese Yen Breaks Away and Joins the Pound Sterling and the US Dollar

Tokyo. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that, "Now is the time to finally resolve all domestic and political issues since the Mukden Incident. Future developments are noteworthy. Political parties have been unusually busy recently, and the general impression is that the China Incident can now be considered nearing its end. The power of opposing parties has weakened under the pressure of the political situation, so political parties should be able to regain power. At the same time, the Abe cabinet is weak and powerless. Senior statesmen close to the Emperor now hold the view that the current transitional cabinet is gradually reaching the extreme of its existence, and that the emergence of a political party cabinet should be possible in the near future." The "Kokumin Shimbun" also stated that, "Since the China Incident is nearing its end, international diplomatic pressure will become stronger and domestic economic difficulties will become even greater. Therefore, only a cabinet that can gain national support can overcome this difficult situation." (Reuters, 24th)

Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. The Japanese cabinet held a meeting this morning and decided to decouple the Japanese yen from the British pound sterling and join the US dollar. The Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying that this decision was entirely due to economic factors and was not intended to change Japan's commercial policy. Previously, the Japanese yen was linked to the British pound sterling at a rate of one yen to one shilling and two pence. However, after the outbreak of the war, the British government has been strengthening its control over foreign exchange in order to prevent the war from prolonging. Therefore, in order to facilitate the movement of Japanese funds abroad, the Japanese government decided to change the Japanese yen to be linked to the US dollar. As for the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the US dollar, it is based on the latest market conditions. According to the decision made by the foreign exchange banking community in today's meeting, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen will be set at 23 and 16/7 US dollars per 100 yen. (24th dispatch)

Tokyo. The Japanese government decided in today's meeting to change the exchange rate standard of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling. The Ministry of Finance announced it immediately as follows, and announced that it would be implemented from October 25th. The exchange rate of Japanese currency has always been based on the British pound sterling, with a prescribed rate of one shilling and two pence. However, Britain is now gradually strengthening its foreign exchange purchase policy due to the outbreak of war in order to prepare for a long-term war. Therefore, in order to facilitate the operation of overseas funds, Japan decided to change the exchange rate standard to the US dollar. At the time of this change, regarding the question of how to prescribe the Japanese exchange rate, considering the impact on foreign trade and other aspects, in order to avoid drastic changes, it was decided to use the recent exchange rate as the base. As a result of today's consultation with banks, it was agreed to use the telegraphic transfer rate of 23 and 16/7 US dollars as the base exchange rate. It goes without saying that this change is entirely due to economic reasons and is not based on changing Japan's commercial policy. (24th Domei dispatch)

Tokyo. After the Japanese exchange rate standard was changed to the US dollar, Yūtarō Yūki, Governor of the Bank of Japan, issued a statement saying that Japan's exchange rate policy has always maintained the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling, in order to stabilize the external value of the yen and have a good impact on trade and the general economic community. However, since the end of August, the situation in Europe has been tense, and the British pound sterling has been shaken. Its exchange rate against the US dollar has fallen from 4.68 dollars to 3.82 dollars. The exchange rate against the US dollar calculated by Japan at the rate of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling has also fallen sharply. Therefore, the exchange rate against the US dollar was temporarily fixed as an urgent measure. After that, the method of calculating the exchange rate against the US dollar based on the official exchange rate of the Bank of England was adopted until today. During this period, Britain gradually strengthened the application of foreign exchange management as the war progressed. Japan considered its impact on the domestic financial community, and then changed the exchange rate standard from the British pound sterling to the US dollar. This is the most appropriate method.

### Overseas Chinese Enthusiasm and Eagerly Donate Funds

Chongqing. The "Sing Tao Daily," "Sing Chong Daily," and "Penang Sin Pin Daily" newspapers founded by Mr. Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman in Singapore, specially sent reporter Li Bingren back to China to observe the war resistance construction projects in the southwest and northwest provinces of the motherland. Li arrived in Chongqing a few days ago and will soon travel to the northwest provinces. According to Li, he was deeply moved by the various construction projects in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, which are flourishing like bamboo shoots after the rain. He has reported the results of his observation in detail to overseas Chinese compatriots in order to enhance their belief in the final victory. Li also said that overseas Chinese compatriots are extremely enthusiastic in supporting the country. In terms of donating money alone, they have now created a trend of donating money in competition. In addition to each person donating a regular monthly donation, various commemorative days are also used to raise special donations from various groups. This time, the Wuhan Choir's fundraising performance in Malaya sold tickets for 800,000 national currency in Johor, 500,000 in Malacca, and 500,000 in Negeri Sembilan. The performance in Selangor is currently underway, and the estimated result will be at least 1.5 million yuan. In the future, after traveling through Pahang, Perak, Penang, etc., at least 6 million yuan in national currency can be raised. Among those who bought the most tickets, the labor community is Mr. Liu Guoqi, a dock worker in Muar, Johor, who bought 1,000 yuan worth of tickets. Another female nurse, Miss Lin, in Malacca also bought 1,000 yuan worth of tickets. Among the capitalists who bought the most tickets, Mr. Chen Yong of Kuala Lumpur reached 250,000 national currency. From this alone, we can get a glimpse of the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese compatriots. In order to make money donations universal, Malayan Chinese have established a fundraising general association in each of the twelve districts of Singapore, Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Perlis, Perak, Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Penang since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Under the general association, there are numerous branch associations. All the above-mentioned general associations are subordinate to the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fundraising General Association. According to Li, this visit to the northwest will last for two months, and then he will go to the southwest provinces and return to Singapore via Hong Kong. (24th dispatch)

### British Ship "Foshan" Accidentally Hits a Mine

Hong Kong. The Swire Shipping Company's "Foshan," carrying 1,500 passengers (including 40 foreigners), left Hong Kong for Guangzhou at 8:00 this morning. At about 10:00, when it reached the waters of Linting Island, the bottom of the ship suddenly hit something, seemingly a mine. The ship immediately showed signs of sinking. However, the area happened to be the shallow waters of Linting Island, so the ship ran aground and did not sink. Therefore, all passengers were safe. Some of the passengers have already landed on Linting Island, while others remain on the ship, waiting for ships from Hong Kong to come to the rescue. (Associated Press, 24th dispatch)

### If Japan Does Not Change Its Policy, the United States Is Prepared to Take Further Action; Grew's Frank Remarks Are Praised at Home; Using Economic Weapons Will Surely Force Japan to Submit

Washington. Well-informed sources claimed last night that the frank warning issued by US Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo last week was only the first step in the United States' strong stance against Japan's seizure of US rights and interests in China. The US government does not intend to hastily reveal the "behind-the-scenes" reasons for Ambassador Grew's unprecedented speech before thoroughly studying Japan's response to the US ambassador's warning. What is considered meaningful here is that although State Department officials said that Grew's speech only expressed his personal opinions, the government did not express disagreement with his speech. Even isolationist senators in the Senate did not disagree with Grew's warning that the American people oppose Japan's "New Order in East Asia" and that only when Japan changes its Eastern policy can the tense US-Japan relationship be improved. Congressional leaders endorsed decisive action against Japan and yesterday reiterated the restoration of the ban on arms exports to Japan and other punitive measures to sanction Japan. Washington officials doubt that Japan can change its policy as a result of Grew's speech.

### The United States Has an Absolute Advantage in Negotiations with Japan

The warning issued by Grew represents the views of President Roosevelt and was tacitly approved by officials in advance without any objection. In addition to waiting for the outcome of Grew's speech, the United States is prepared to use "more pleasing methods" to force Japan to give better treatment to American people and interests in Japanese-occupied areas in China. Observers here with access to information acknowledge that the State Department has reviewed the crisis between the United States and Japan in the past two weeks. They feel that the United States now has a better "bargaining" position with Japan than it did several weeks ago. Everyone agrees. It is generally believed that the United States is currently in a position to bargain with Japan alone. The change in Japan's position is due to the bankruptcy of the anti-communist public, which has led to Japan's diplomatic isolation.

### Now That the European War Has Broken Out, There Is No More Concern

In addition, it is widely believed that President Roosevelt's restrictive actions against Japan before the outbreak of the European war were deeply concerned that the US-Japan crisis in the Pacific would prompt Chancellor Hitler to launch an early attack in Europe. Observers believe that now that the European war has broken out and the hopes of mediation have decreased, the United States does not have to worry about other serious problems in Europe and can take a more resolute attitude towards the Far East. It is generally believed that the United States' threat to ban the export of American raw materials that can be turned into military use to Japan will not only make Tokyo extremely concerned, but also improve the United States' bargaining position with Japan. Senator Hugh Mitchell of Washington State, a Democrat and the drafter of the proposal to ban the export of raw materials to Japan, said yesterday that he intends to promote the bill when the next Congress convenes in January, and at that time the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which has been announced by the United States to be terminated, will also expire. Senators and Representatives who proposed the same bill indicated that they will re-launch the bill in January. Senator Vandenberg of Michigan, a Republican and a possible candidate for the 1940 Republican presidential election, declined yesterday to criticize whether he would propose convening a Peking Conference to discuss Japan's repeated violations of the Nine-Power Treaty.

### Economic Pressure Is Enough to Kill Japan

Congressional reaction to Grew's nationwide speech in Japan last week against Japan's policies in China was "almost" universal. Observers here believe that the State Department may take "more pleasing methods" to control Japan. The initial work will be economic. It is generally recalled that US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, told reporters in Shanghai that under the current circumstances, it is impossible for the United States and Japan to negotiate a new treaty of commerce and navigation to replace the old 1911 treaty, which expires in January. It is believed here that Sayre's message is meaningful, as he held an important position in the State Department before being appointed to his position in Manila. Observers here view Japan's initial response to Grew's warning as largely unyielding, and that attitude will prompt the State Department to adopt direct methods to make the Japanese government and people understand the new policy of the United States in the Far East.

### New Characteristics of the US Far East Policy

It is indicated here that yesterday's statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson was actually an attack on the reason of the American people, rather than a response to Grew's accusation that the Japanese authorities often attack American rights and interests in China and cause resentment and the danger of being bombed by the American people. Sources here with access to information solemnly stated that the policy currently adopted by the United States in the Far East has no special features. Several of them have been conveyed to the Japanese authorities as early as two years ago. The new feature of the policy is that the US government has decided to take "more effective methods" to maintain the US position in the Far East if Japan continues to ignore US rights and interests in the US. (United Press, 24th dispatch)

### Whether US-Japan Talks Have Touched on Commercial Treaties - Hull Says He Has No Knowledge

Washington. Japanese newspapers reported that Foreign Minister Nomura will hold talks with US Ambassador to Japan Grew to study the possibility of concluding a new commercial treaty. Secretary of State Hull told the newspapers that he had no knowledge of the nature of these talks or whether Foreign Minister Nomura had raised the issue of a new commercial treaty. (Havas, 23rd dispatch)

Peking. The spokesperson for the Japanese army here has refused to criticize US Ambassador to Japan Grew's frank speech denouncing the actions of the Japanese army in China for several days, but today finally issued a sour and sarcastic criticism. According to the official view of the Japanese army, Grew's frankness is commendable, but the Japanese army expects more than that. In this speech, the Japanese army has not found that Grew, in his capacity as ambassador to Japan, has conveyed the views of the Japanese people to the American government and public. The Japanese army's request for Grew to take this action may not be excessive. The destruction of the rights and property of American residents in China was not done intentionally. The situation in the war does not allow for the prevention of all conflicts between American interests and the activities of the Japanese army, but the Japanese army is determined to respect these rights as its policy. When asked whether the Japanese economic blockade in China is consistent with this policy, the spokesperson replied that the United Kingdom first established an economic bloc to oppose Japanese exports. Japan must live, so it began to take action in China. (Reuters, 24th dispatch)

### Ozumi and His Entourage's Activities in the United States

Washington. General Ozumi and his entourage arrived in Washington on the afternoon of the 22nd and attended a luncheon held by the Japanese Embassy.

General Ozumi, accompanied by Naval Attaché Ogawa, inspected the US Naval Academy in Annapolis and is scheduled to go to New York on the 24th. (Domei, 23rd dispatch)

### Mrs. Roosevelt Enthusiastically Supports China Relief Efforts - Appointed Honorary Chairman of the China Relief Association

New York. Mrs. Roosevelt, the President's mother, formally accepted the invitation of the China Relief Association here yesterday and was appointed Honorary Chairman of the Association.

The disaster suffered by China now is the worst in the world. (Associated Press, 24th dispatch)

### Japanese Envoys to Germany and the Soviet Union Meet in Berlin; Wavering on European Policy; Kurasu Appointed Ambassador to Germany

Tokyo: According to an announcement here today, Japanese Ambassador to Belgium, Saburo Kurusu, has been appointed as the new Ambassador to Germany, with the approval of the German government. As for General Oshima, who has already been recalled to Japan, he is scheduled to leave Berlin for Italy on the 28th of this month, traveling by ship via the United States to return home. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, along with Oshima and Kurusu, have met in Berlin to discuss the future of Japan's European policy, which must be approached with great caution in order to adapt to the ever-changing situation and avoid repeating past mistakes. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Berlin: Ambassador Oshima, in view of his imminent return to Japan, specially convened a meeting in Berlin from the 21st with his successor as Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu, and the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, lasting until the 22nd, for two days of important discussions regarding Japan's future European policy. The following is a general outline of the opinions presented by the three ambassadors at the meeting:

(1) To predict how much benefit Japan might gain from the outbreak of a European war; however, the development of the situation may not allow for such optimism. (2) It is extremely dangerous to establish such a strategy if the European conflict continues to develop into a long-term war. That is, to anticipate a sudden shift in the situation leading to peace, in which case Britain will inevitably take advantage of this short-term truce to once again suppress the Far East. (3) The relationship between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union is extremely delicate. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate that the situation may suddenly change, altering the current state of European politics. Thus, Japan's European policy should consider adapting to the handling of the China Incident. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

Moscow: The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, has gone to Berlin to treat a dental ailment and is scheduled to return here on the 27th of this month. According to well-informed sources, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan regarding the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border issue will continue after Ambassador Togo returns to his post. Negotiations regarding the demarcation of the border have been temporarily suspended due to the unresolved issue of exchanging prisoners of war. The Soviet side demands that, in addition to the officers and soldiers of the Red Army captured in the Nomonhan region, all those previously captured by the Japanese side, including several Soviet pilots who strayed into "Manchurian" territory, should also be returned to the Soviet Union. The Japanese side is unwilling to treat these two matters as one, hence the unresolved dispute. According to the principle of equality in the exchange method, it can be seen that the Soviet Union captured more prisoners in the Nomonhan region than the Japanese side captured Red Army officers and soldiers. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### Soviet-American Relations Expected to Develop; Soviet Ambassador Soon to Return to Post

Washington: According to reliable sources here, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, who has been in his home country for three months for consultations, will soon return to the United States. It is anticipated that after Umansky returns to his post, Soviet-American relations will undergo new developments. At the same time, according to observations here, the purpose of the Soviet Ambassador's return is to explain the Soviet Union's motives for its actions in the Baltic Sea region, as President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the status of Finland. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

### Pro-Japanese Leader in the Philippines Arrested

Manila: The pro-Japanese leader in the Philippines, Ramos, who launched the Sakdal uprising in 1935 and failed, resided in Japan for three years. Recently, he returned to the Philippines to organize the Ganap Party, advocating for the Philippines to be under Japanese protection. The local police authorities have now ordered his arrest. According to the police, Ramos organized a party without authorization, privately collected party fees of fifty Philippine pesos per person, and sent photos of party members to Japan as "Friends of Japan." It is claimed that, in the event of a Japanese invasion of the Philippines, his party members would be guaranteed safety. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

### Philippine Islands Vote on Amendment to Independence Act

Manila: The economic clauses in the Tydings-McDuffie Philippine Independence Act, which previously had adverse effects on the Philippine coconut, tobacco, embroidery, and ramie industries, have been greatly improved after being amended by the U.S. Congress. Today, the people of the Philippines are voting on the approval of this amendment, and it is anticipated that no one will cast a negative vote. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

### Western Front Warfare; French and German Forces Still Fighting for Strongholds; German Attack on Small Town Near Forest Failed; Muddy Roads Hinder Large-Scale Offensives

Paris: In the past 24 hours, the situation on the Western Front has been more lively than the previous day. French forces carried out raids in the area east of the Moselle, while German forces engaged in activities west of Forbach in the Saarbrücken area, attacking a village in German territory occupied by the French. The Germans attacked several times, but the village remained in French hands. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Paris: French and German forces engaged in fierce fighting all day yesterday in German territory west of Forbach, contending for a small town near the Warndt Forest. German forces repeatedly attacked French positions there, but were unsuccessful. The French forces were able to maintain their original positions. Semi-official circles commented that although the French forces had retreated some time ago, they had not completely withdrawn from German territory. They are determined to hold all militarily important points, as evidenced by this incident. In addition, French forces captured a German artillery officer and his squad of sentries near the Warndt Forest, and made further captures on the east bank of the Moselle River. In general, the weather along the front lines has been bad recently, with muddy roads after heavy rain, hindering military operations. If the German forces were to launch a large-scale offensive, the difficulties would inevitably be multiplied. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Paris: The General Staff recently issued War Bulletin No. 99, stating, "The advance units of both sides have been quite active today, especially in the Saar River area." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### British Aircraft Destroy Two German Submarines; German Aircraft Repeatedly Attack British Ports; Total Loss of Sixteen Heavy Bombers

London: According to a statement from the Ministry of Aviation, British aircraft have recently attacked German submarines twice, both with successful results. One was in the North Sea, and the other in the Atlantic. British aircraft circled over the locations where the submarines sank, and no trace of the submarines was seen again. The British pilot in the North Sea reported, "A reconnaissance aircraft spotted a submarine surfacing, and dropped several depth charges at its periscope. After the explosions, a second explosion was heard from underwater. The British aircraft then flew back to the submarine's location and dropped a second batch of bombs. After the first drop, there was already an oil slick on the surface, and after the second drop, the oil slick was even larger, and the submarine did not reappear." The British pilot in the Atlantic also reported that an enemy submarine was discovered a short distance from the coast. The submarine then submerged, and the British aircraft dropped several large bombs, which appeared to hit. Shortly after, dark spots and spray appeared on the water. The British aircraft then dropped more bombs nearby and circled for a long time, but nothing more was found. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

London: Responsible sources have recently released information stating that the German Air Force has recently flown to the British coast to attack several times, losing approximately sixteen heavy bombers. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### American Cargo Ship Detained by Germany; Escorted to Soviet Port

Moscow: A report from the port of Murmansk states that a cargo ship flying the German flag entered Kola Bay, north of the port, last night. There were no Soviet pilots on board. After the Soviet side sent people to investigate, it was discovered that the ship was the American vessel "City of Flint," with a displacement of 5,000 tons, originally sailing from New York to Montrose, England. It was seized en route by eighteen sailors from a German cruiser, who forced the ship to change course and sail to Kola Bay. According to the German sailors, the ship's cargo was contraband (including tractors, grains, fruits, leather, candles, etc., totaling 3,700 tons). The authorities in the port of Murmansk have temporarily detained the ship, and the German crew members have also been detained. (TASS dispatch, 24th)

Moscow: Regarding the detention of the American ship "City of Flint" in the port of Murmansk, the American Embassy here was not notified in advance and only learned of it after reading the newspaper. The embassy is currently investigating the details of the incident. However, today is a Soviet holiday, and all government agencies are closed, so it is impossible to negotiate. However, since the Soviet Union claims neutrality, it is expected that the ship will be released soon. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

Princeton: Regarding the German detention of the American ship "City of Flint," Professor Corwin, a legal expert at Princeton University, stated that if the American ship was indeed carrying contraband, then the Germans were indeed entitled to detain the ship under international law. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

It only asks that Finland formally promise not to build defensive fortifications on the islands and provide guarantees that it will not participate in any attempts hostile to the Soviet Union, while ceding Hogland and two nearby small islands to the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### One Hundred and Ten German Soldiers Captured; Several British Airmen Captured

### Polish Gold Arrives in Paris; Totaling Seventy Tons

Paris: "Paris Soir" recently reported that seventy tons of gold from the Polish National Bank, which were transported from Warsaw via Romania, Turkey, and the Syrian Republic, across the Mediterranean Sea to France, a total distance of 10,000 kilometers, have now arrived in Paris. This gold was transported out of Warsaw in trucks on the day the evacuation order was issued, and was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft en route. Upon reaching the Romanian border, it was transferred to special trains and transported to the port of Constanta, where it was loaded onto a Turkish ship and transported via the Black Sea to that country. Shortly after the ship set sail, the German government informed the Romanian government that if it allowed the gold to pass through its territory without interference, it would be considered an unfriendly act, but it was too late. Subsequently, this gold was loaded onto a French ship in the Syrian Republic and transported to France, reaching here. Once Poland is restored, it will still be used as the country's monetary reserve. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th)

### France Establishes Procurement Agency in the United States; Implements Cash Purchases

### US Neutrality Act Amendment; Senate Debate Concludes; Isolationists Admit Defeat; Still Attempting to Struggle in the House

Washington: Senate isolationists admitted last night that their attacks on the administration's proposed Neutrality Act amendment had failed. They now hope to obtain assistance in the House of Representatives. Senate leaders have informed President Roosevelt that the Neutrality Act amendment could be put to a vote in the middle of this week. The Senate convened one hour earlier than usual yesterday, and Senate Majority Leader Barkley immediately declared that he would propose limiting debate to prevent isolationists from obstructing the process. Although isolationist Wiley continued to speak out against the Neutrality Act amendment, the isolationists have admitted their defeat, but they are still working hard in the House to prevent the export of armaments that the U.S. Army and Navy themselves feel are lacking. Isolationist Clark also claimed that he would propose to President Roosevelt to prohibit armed merchant ships of belligerent countries from entering U.S. ports. (United Press dispatch, 24th)

### Germany's Raw Materials Are Currently Extremely Scarce; Soviet Union Refuses to Offer Credit

London: According to well-informed sources here, Germany is currently experiencing a severe shortage of raw materials and food. Domestic production cannot be expanded, and public spending is bound to increase. The only options at this point are currency inflation or further reductions in consumption. The raw materials held by Germany abroad are worth at most 800,000,000 marks, only one-tenth of the reserves in 1914. Germany has no foreign exchange, and its foreign currency reserves have been exhausted. Its ability to borrow has been zero for years. Future supplies depend entirely on production and exports. Although the reserves in German-occupied territories can be seized and used to alleviate the immediate emergency, this approach will damage their future productivity. As for the Soviet Union, it cannot be persuaded by empty words; to purchase Soviet goods, payment must be made in cash. The most lacking food items in Germany are eggs, cream, lard, and vegetable oil. Since 1935, Germany has felt a shortage of oil and fat supplies, which is now even more severe. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

London: A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph reported last week that Germany had received 17.5 tons of gold from the Soviet Union, which is completely untrue. This gold is currently held in banks in the Netherlands. According to intelligence received in London official circles, this gold will be used to purchase goods from the United States. Before the war, the Soviet Union ordered a large number of machines from Britain, but the British side is now unable to fully fulfill the contract due to the outbreak of war. Therefore, the Soviet Union intends to use part of this gold to purchase American machines. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Wartime Europe March (Continued) – Special Correspondence from London

— Shu Di

(3) A Review of the Diplomatic Situation Moments Before the War

At around six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday (the 1st), Hitler launched a military attack on Poland. So, has this European war officially begun?

However, the opinions here yesterday and the day before yesterday were not entirely certain. The consensus was that the key to the current situation lay in whether Britain and France would fulfill their mutual assistance agreement with Poland. Therefore, for these two days, the Polish Ambassador to Britain has been sitting in the British Foreign Office almost all day, waiting for a definite answer. The British public has also been mobilizing to urge their government to take swift and decisive action.

However, the first move by the British government was to send an ultimatum to the German government, ordering it to immediately withdraw its troops from Poland; otherwise, Britain would "have no choice but to fulfill its mutual assistance obligations to Poland."

At the time, this measure was absolutely unable to satisfy the wishes of the general public, who were hoping for a direct and, of course, declaration of war against Germany. Therefore, at the meeting of the British Houses of Parliament at six o'clock the day before yesterday, the divide between the government and the members was quite deep. The resolute and clear words spoken by the opposition leaders in the House of Commons, in effect, forced their government to a point where it was difficult to avoid fulfilling its obligations to Poland.

The worst part was that the British and French ultimatum to Germany did not include a time limit for a response! As a result, rumors started circulating again. However, it should be specifically pointed out here that, apart from rumors, there were indeed many concrete diplomatic activities taking place. On one side was a war raging with artillery fire, while on the other, diplomatic contacts were also taking place simultaneously.

As usual, diplomacy comes to a dead end, then war breaks out; once the war begins, diplomatic activity ceases. However, this time it was different. Even during these two days of war between Germany and Poland, Germany and Poland were still in contact through Mussolini. Even before 11:00 a.m. today, the possibility of Poland surrendering to Germany still existed. The precondition for the so-called surrender, of course, was accepting the "sixteen terms" proposed by Germany.

Undoubtedly, this was a huge crisis! – not just a crisis for Poland; what was even more important was that it was linked to the entire future of the British and French empires!

Now, this crisis has finally passed. At 9:00 a.m. today, Britain and France sent another strong ultimatum to Germany, setting a two-hour time limit for a response. When the time reached 11:00 a.m., Britain and France formally declared war on Germany.

Hitler's power diplomacy has failed in this encirclement of Poland. What follows, of course, is war.

However, as we observe the situation before and after the opening of this European war, we clearly notice one of its characteristics, which is that neither side in the war, Britain and France on one side, and Germany on the other, has made a large-scale, final determination and preparation to completely eliminate the other's forces. Their war actions, strictly speaking, are still just engaging in armed diplomacy. In other words, in such a war, diplomatic contacts on both sides will never cease, and at every shift in the war situation, there is always a potential possibility of ending the war and reaching a compromise.

What is the most fundamental reason for this characteristic of the war? Undoubtedly, it is due to the huge presence of the socialist state, the Soviet Union.

That is why Mussolini did not participate in the war - this will be the most noteworthy role in the future situation in Europe. (September 3rd afternoon)

(4) Britain's "Preparation"

"Wooo...Wooo...!"..."Wooo...Wooo...!"...

So high-pitched, sharp, and trembling, the sirens announcing an air raid were sounding in the quiet London sky. Listening from my three-story apartment, it seemed as if this alarm system was spread all over the world. That pervasive, undulating, increasingly close and piercing, increasingly distant and faint, trembling sound seemed to fill all the space, extending to the distant, distant, and even more distant...that side of the horizon.

In this sound, you can immediately imagine, or rather, you seem to see, thousands and thousands of people being awakened from their beds at this moment.

Near my residence, there is a siren blaring loudly. In the sky above my residence, several huge balloons suddenly appeared - as if they had suddenly emerged from the ground. (Let me frankly admit; I had not noticed the slightest sign of this beforehand.)

Outside the window, there is a bottomless and boundless darkness. Thickly covering the light of the candle, I am writing this passage in the light of a large, tofu-sized area. But the stairs are ringing, ringing, ringing... - it sounds like someone is coming upstairs. ... (To be continued)

### News from Suzhou and Wuxi: Fear of a Shortage of Auxiliary Currency; Fake Ministry of Finance Plans to Issue Fake Notes

Suzhou Correspondence: In Suzhou, Wuxi, and surrounding counties, there has been a fear of a copper coin shortage for several months. Since June, copper coins have gradually decreased and disappeared completely, leading to a corresponding rise in prices. It is understood that the reasons for the copper coin shortage are nothing more than unscrupulous merchants hoarding and smuggling them for sale to the Japanese, seeking profit. After the copper coins disappeared, the only substitute was stamps, followed by many shops printing substitute notes. However, due to the ease of counterfeiting, up until now, apart from the substitute notes issued by a few larger businesses that are still in circulation, the only substitute for small change is still stamps. Recently, it has been heard that the puppet Ministry of Finance, due to the shortage of auxiliary currency and the disappearance of copper coins, has decided to issue fake copper notes, divided into denominations of one, five, fifteen, and thirty (cents). However, because there are fears of malpractices after these fake notes are issued, it has been provisionally decided as a transitional measure, and they must still be withdrawn. However, the circulation and exchange of these fake notes will be based on the puppet Hua Xing banknotes, with 400 fake copper notes exchanged for one yuan of puppet currency. However, the people still trust legal tender, and 300 fake copper notes can still be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. The circulation of fake copper notes in each area is temporarily limited to 3,000, but the date of issue is not yet fixed, and the people in the occupied areas will have yet another type of chaotic currency product.

### Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Streamlines Broadcasting Education in Various Regions; Petitions the Ministry of Education for Funds to Install Dry Cell DC Generators

(Fangyan News) The Zhejiang Department of Education believes that broadcasting education is of utmost importance during this time of war. In addition to petitioning the Ministry of Education for funds to install dry cell DC generators, the department will also coordinate assistance measures to ensure that schools and libraries equipped with radios can listen regularly. Recently, Director Xu inspected various counties and saw that most of the radios installed in the county offices were damaged and left unused. He met with the personnel in charge of various counties to repair them and listen on time, so as to avoid long-term suspension of broadcast education. Recently, more than 10 radios have been sent to the department for repair. It is heard that the Department of Electrical Education Service repairs radios for radio schools and libraries, only charging a nominal fee for replacement parts. All schools and libraries equipped with radios can send them for repair if they encounter mechanical damage.

### The Key Problems and Improvement Measures for Relief and Education of Refugee Children (Part Two)

— Qian Yonghe

(2) Escorting Personnel Receiving and Transporting Refugee Children: After obtaining transportation, escorting personnel become a major problem. Very few personnel can be dispatched to the vicinity of the war zone by various refugee relief organizations. If a large number of refugee children are transported at the same time, there are many refugee children but few escorting personnel, and it is felt that there is insufficient care. If they are transported in batches, the escorting personnel are insufficient. Escorting personnel must be shrewd and capable, kind and patient, and have the ability to manage children. It is truly rare to find someone who fully meets these conditions. However, there are often cases of people using the name of escorting refugee children to implement personal evacuation plans, carrying luggage, inviting relatives, and not taking responsibility for care along the way. There are also enthusiastic people who do their best to help refugee children and rescue them from danger. However, refugee children often suffer from illnesses or lack of nutrition as they flee, and they cannot withstand the journey. They fall ill on the way, and there are no doctors, nurses, or medicines, leading to deaths. Among the escorting personnel, doctors and nurses are sometimes added with simple medicines, but there cannot always be a complete organization. Refugee children come from various places and have not been trained. Naughty children often cause trouble. Escorting personnel often do not understand the psychology of children and cannot control them, or there is insufficient funding and difficulties in providing supplies. When the refugee children have been escorted to the rear orphanages or educational institutions and nurseries, the resettlement of the escorting personnel becomes a problem. In terms of sentiment and reason, escorting personnel should be given service opportunities after escorting the refugee children back. In terms of the administrative situation of each institution, these temporarily added teachers and staff have various difficulties in terms of economy, personnel, management, and allocation. In addition, lists of refugee children and all transfer procedures are often not clearly handed over due to urgency, which can also cause many disputes.

(3) Temporary Shelters: Wartime refugee children cannot be transported to the rear immediately, so temporary shelters are often established in the rear close to the war zone. In temporary shelters, education is less important, but the difficulty of providing care is extremely serious. For example, in a shelter for 500 children, batches of children are sent from the front lines. People are busy with the medical treatment of sick children, washing clothes, and arranging teams. When they are sent to the rear, people are in a hurry to contact transportation and dispatch escorting personnel. Sometimes the number of children coming exceeds the number of children being sent out. Food, bedding, and all daily necessities are insufficient. Children who come like a flowing stream have not undergone strict training and are even more difficult to manage. Or because the houses are scattered in several places, administration becomes more lax. The director often has the difficulty of being stretched thin. In addition, in the event of enemy bombing, even if there are air-raid shelters nearby, it is extremely difficult and stressful for teachers and staff to lead a large number of untrained children to take cover.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Bulls Close Positions in Droves; British Gold Once Reached 5 Pence; US Dollar Seen at 8.75 Yuan; Sassoon Covered Shorts, and the Market Rebounded Slightly; Trade Surplus is One Reason for Looser Conditions

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC official exchange rate announcement showed that the British exchange rate increased by 1.25, reaching 4 shillings and 25 pence, and the US dollar rose by 4.375, to 7.125 yuan. The rest also showed a consistent increase. The informal market conditions for British and US exchanges continued the looser trend of the previous day. This newspaper predicted last weekend that the British gold exchange rate would break the 5-shilling mark and the US dollar would break the 8-yuan mark, which has already been seen in the facts of the previous days. However, at present, the 5-shilling line for British gold and the 8.5-yuan line for the US dollar seem to be temporarily hovering. As for the reasons for the looser exchange market, it is said that the most important reasons are that a certain party that used to manipulate the market has abandoned its old tricks and shifted to searching for local goods in the mainland for export. And the recent surge in overseas silk prices has led to huge exports of cocoons and silk from this port, and other goods have also changed from imports to exports. Therefore, exporters have to release funds every day, and Hong Kong banks are competing to sell foreign exchange and purchase Shanghai yarn and other goods, and the chips are becoming more and more crowded. And the absorption capacity of banks is ultimately limited, and the HSBC, which is enough to influence the market, is not as strong as before, so a situation of extreme supply and demand has formed. In today's trading process, it was hard as soon as it opened. HSBC had a slight absorption capacity at that time. Later, all speculators in Shanghai, such as yarn and flower gangs and securities gangs, all came to sell, and at the same time, HSBC had no intention to buy, which led to the loosest US dollar price of 8.75 yuan and the British gold price breaking the 5-shilling mark, creating a new recent high price of 5 shillings and 25 pence. However, not long after, foreign firms and Chinese businessmen absorbed some, and the market then rebounded to 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 8.5 yuan. Extending to the noon closing, British gold rose again to 5 shillings and 125 pence, and the US dollar also loosened again to 8.625 yuan. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned tight, the profit absorption became stronger, and the Western businessman Sassoon fiercely covered shorts (it is said that the number reached more than 100,000 pounds), and at the same time, the Hong Kong banks suddenly had the intention to buy, and it fell all the way to 4 shillings and 9375 pence for British gold and 8.1875 yuan for the US dollar. However, by the evening closing, the situation had stabilized. The closing price of British gold was 4 shillings and 96875 pence, which was still 09375 pence harder than the previous day, and the US dollar was 8.3125 yuan, which was also 125 looser than the previous day. In terms of futures trading, there were also those who did it, but the prices had been slightly squeezed together, and the potential was no different from the spot market. The whole day's trading was still strong.

HSBC Official Exchange Rate Announcement Shows Consistent Increase

In the early morning, the London Bank Rate was nearly 25 points longer than the long-term rate, the New York silver price was 375 points higher, the London gold price was stable, the exchange rates for British to US and British to French were both flat, the exchange rate to Shanghai rose by 375 points, the exchange rate to US rose by 375 points, the exchange rate to Shanghai rose by 4 cents, and the exchange rate to French rose by 25 points. The Central Bank's official exchange rates for each exchange remained the same as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 90625 pence for British gold and 8.21875 yuan for the US dollar, which were 03125 pence looser for both British and US exchanges than the previous closing. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams and speculators first came to sell, but at that time, HSBC still had a small amount of absorption capacity, so the looser trend was still slow. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed Hong Kong telegrams and speculator spot British gold at 4 shillings and 9375 pence, and a certain bank also purchased Chinese merchant spot US dollars at 8.8125 yuan. The HSBC official exchange rate announcement showed an increase of 25 points for British exchange and an increase of 4.375 points for the US dollar, and the silver balance tax announcement remained unchanged. After that, speculators such as yarn and flower gangs and securities gangs came to close positions one after another, and Hong Kong telegrams and Tianjin gangs also had strong selling pressure. In addition, HSBC stopped absorbing, and other foreign firms were basically inactive, so it was extremely loose, and the market was chaotic, and the price unexpectedly increased to 5 shillings and 25 pence and 8.75 yuan. Until around 11 o'clock, the Western merchant Sassoon and a certain US bank suddenly took the opportunity to absorb, and at the same time, other foreign firms also had a slight absorption capacity, and it was heard that foreign firms and Chinese merchants also made settlements from it, so the situation rebounded slightly, once returning to 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 8.5 yuan. After 11:30, the absorption trend subsided again, and the potential trend became looser again, closing at 5 shillings and 125 pence for British gold and 8.625 yuan for the US dollar, which was 21875 pence looser for British and 40625 yuan harder for the US exchange rate than the morning opening.

Hong Kong Banks Also Closed Positions Slightly in the Afternoon

There was a certain rumor in the afternoon market, but the impact on the market was that the Western merchant Sassoon came to absorb again, and the profit absorption of British banks suddenly became stronger. In addition, it was heard that Hong Kong banks stopped selling and slightly absorbed, so the trend turned around. It is estimated that Sassoon and the profitable absorbed foreign firm spot British gold at 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 4 shillings and 96875 pence, and spot US dollars at 8.5 yuan and 3125 yuan. After entering, the tightest British gold was once called over 4 shillings and 9375 pence, and the US dollar was also called over 8.1875 yuan. However, the result was the late closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 96875 pence for British gold and 8.3125 yuan for the US dollar, which were the same as the spot prices this month. The November prices were 4 shillings and 921875 pence for British gold and 8.21875 yuan for the US dollar, which were 09375 pence looser for the British and 125 yuan harder for the US exchange rate than the previous day's spot prices. The November British exchange rate was 109375 pence longer and the US exchange rate was 15625 points cheaper.

### Instability Fuels Gold Market Plunge and Rebound: Fluctuations of 200 Yuan in a Day, Dropping to a Low of 3,600 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash "烚赤" (speculative gold) market was volatile. Although the overall decline throughout the day was less than 100 yuan, the turbulence was expanding, with sudden ups and downs mainly due to market instability. The price fell to a low of 3,600 yuan due to a sudden tightening of foreign exchange rates. However, the closing price rebounded to 3,765 yuan. The day's trading started lower, opening at 3,805 yuan, down 45 yuan from the previous day. The market was initially calm, but then a significant easing of foreign exchange rates caused British gold to break through the five-penny barrier, leading to frantic selling. The downward trend was difficult to control, reaching a low of 3,600 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate slightly recovered, and securities firms and money changers entered the market to buy, pushing the price up to 3,760 yuan. However, few remained enthusiastic, and the price fell sharply to 3,660 yuan by the noon close. The afternoon session opened at 3,640 yuan, and the market seemed stable, but then the exchange rate rebounded sharply, gradually pushing the price up to 3,792 yuan. It was reported that Hong Kong firms seized the opportunity to trade, and securities firms bought back a significant amount due to excessive selling the previous day. Ultimately, the market closed at 3,765 yuan, a further drop of 85 yuan from the previous day, marking the sixth consecutive day of decline, with a total decrease of 259 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, reaching several thousand taels. Jewelry gold initially fell and then rebounded, ultimately settling at a decrease of ten yuan. Gold at the customs remained stable.

烚赤 (Speculative Gold) Down 85 Yuan

Starting in the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened weak and listless. Some, hearing of a strengthening of foreign exchange rates, sold at lower prices, with the opening down 45 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 3,805 yuan. Subsequently, the market stabilized briefly, hovering around the 3,800 yuan mark. Around 9:35 AM, news of a significant easing of foreign exchange rates triggered widespread selling, with securities firms, Yuhao and money changers all rushing to sell. The market became chaotic, and the price plummeted by 155 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,650 yuan. Afterwards, another securities firm bought at a low price, pulling it up by 30 yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels at a price of 3,680 yuan. At that time, a certain money changer aggressively sold around 300 taels, pushing the price down by another 25 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 3,655 yuan. Then, a certain money changer suddenly profited and re-entered the market, along with retail investors following suit, quickly pushing the market back above the 3,700 yuan mark. Money changers bought 30 taels at a price of 3,720 yuan. At 10:40 AM, news of an expanding easing of the foreign exchange market triggered another wave of selling, with jewelry firms, securities firms, and money changers rushing to sell, causing another sharp drop of 120 yuan. Money changers sold a total of 40 taels to other money changers and securities firms at a price of 3,600 yuan. After 11:00 AM, news of a tightening of foreign exchange rates spurred buying, with securities firms and money changers stopping sales and aggressively buying. At the same time, it was reported that Hong Kong firms were also buying, quickly driving the price up by 160 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels at a price of 3,760 yuan. Approaching noon, foreign exchange rates suddenly eased again, causing another wave of selling, with jewelry firms and money changers competing to sell, pushing the price down by 100 yuan. Money changers traded 30 taels among themselves, with the closing price for the noon session at 3,660 yuan. The afternoon session opened weak, down another 20 yuan, with securities firms selling 10 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,640 yuan. Subsequently, news of a tightening of foreign exchange rates triggered buying by money changers, immediately pushing the price up by 90 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from jewelry firms at a price of 3,730 yuan. At that time, another money changer and gold shop sold, briefly pushing the price back down to 3,715 yuan. Finally, due to further softening of the foreign exchange market and the buying of securities firms and a certain money changer, the price was pushed up again by 30 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from gold shops at a price of 3,745 yuan. Later, due to a certain money changer selling again, the price retreated by 20 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,725 yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to buy, and it was reported that Hong Kong firms were active again. In addition, with the foreign exchange market softening further and British gold returning to the five-penny mark, the price rose again by 67 yuan. Securities firms and money changers bought a total of 60 taels from securities firms and cash shops at a price of 3,792 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms suddenly sold again, and the foreign exchange market tightened slightly, causing a retreat of 32 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of 3,760 yuan. Then, money changers bought 30 taels from securities firms at a price of 3,765 yuan for the evening close.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Initially Rise then Fall Slightly, Foreign Stocks Initially Weaken then Ease

In the over-the-counter securities market yesterday, various bonds continued to advance. The bullish sentiment seemed determined to see the Category C bonds reach 50 yuan, causing panic among short sellers, to reap the benefits. The market trended upwards throughout the morning and afternoon. At the same time, those covering short positions were also very active. The sharp drop in gold prices provided significant support to the bulls. Category E bonds were not far from 50 yuan, but suddenly fell by more than half a yuan after the close. The reasons given for the initial rise were a misunderstanding that someone had been sent to Shanghai to negotiate peace, and then rumors that someone would take office. In reality, after rising for many days, a slight pullback was to be expected. Yesterday, the market opened at a high price in the morning, and the bulls weakened slightly in the middle of the day, but then rebounded again as short sellers covered their positions. Dafeng and Tongkang were bought heavily, while Yongkang and Lianhe were sold heavily. The trend was firm. In the afternoon, those pushing up prices were numerous, and Tiansheng sold off a bit. Number 11 was also selling, pushing the price up by another two or three dimes, resulting in a further increase of eight or nine dimes. The news was unfavorable after the close, and the price fell sharply by more than half a yuan. Foreign exchange rates tightened again, and gold rebounded by one or two hundred yuan. The situation was complicated and difficult to understand. The future of the bond market is full of changes. Total trading volume for the day was estimated at around 1.2 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.

In stock trading, 20 shares of China National Goods Company were traded at a price of 22.5 yuan, and 100 shares of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory stock were traded at a price of 74 yuan in cash.

The Public Industry Association stated that due to the volatile foreign exchange market and unstable fluctuations, the stock market also fluctuated greatly yesterday. The selling side was active when the market opened in the morning, and prices were weak. However, the decline was halted after the exchange rate tightened, and the market returned to normal stability.

There were no changes in London's Chinese bond and Far East British stock market prices.

London, 23rd: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks were generally stable, with no changes in prices.

London, 23rd: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt were quiet, with no significant gains or losses for any bond.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hoarders Rush to Liquidate, Yarn Market Declines Sharply, Double Horse and Earth Each Drop by More Than 30 Yuan

The yarn market continues to fall sharply, like a river flowing downhill. The market sentiment is very weak because hoarders with weak capital are seeing the forward premiums on both Shilling and American yarn increasing, and the gold price is falling, causing instability in hoarding psychology, and they are rushing to liquidate. At the same time, actual transactions are sluggish, and scalpers take advantage of the situation to push prices up and down, often disrupting the market. As for certain parties in the past who contacted a major factory to promote Double Horse yarn, they have recently abandoned their efforts, causing the decline to be even more severe. However, the profit margin has become slim as the price is now close to the factory's cost.

When the yarn market opened this morning, many brokers gathered, but most were just talking. There was a lot of chaotic shouting to sell. The opening price fell by 30 yuan, with spot Double Horse yarn at 625 yuan, and then 3 yuan less. However, there was little demand for warehouse receipts. Subsequently, as the demand from customers remained weak, and the foreign exchange rate eased, market sentiment weakened further, and many sought to liquidate. The price fell by another 15 yuan, with the lowest price for Double Horse yarn at 610 yuan. As the market was about to close, the continuous sharp decline triggered scalper activity, who bought a few bales, suddenly pushing the price up by more than ten yuan. The final closing price was 622 yuan. According to statistics, 1,860 bales were traded in the first half of the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 32 yuan, Tiannv yarn fell by 19 yuan, and Double Earth yarn fell by 35 yuan. Today, 15 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 290 bales were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows: 1,530 bales by fellow traders, 255 bales by Hong Kong firms, 75 bales to inland areas, totaling 1,860 bales.

### Tonghua (Cotton) Falls Another 7 Yuan, Only One Transaction

The cotton trade has completely ground to a halt, mainly because the foreign exchange rate is easing, and the gold price has fallen sharply, making the calculated price of foreign cotton cheaper. Factories are facing this harsh environment, coupled with the sluggishness of the yarn market, making them more constrained. The cotton market is in dire straits. The basis is different. Tongzhou cotton fell sharply by 7 yuan, with 200 bales bought from fellow traders at a price of 128 yuan, paid in cash and delivered from the warehouse. The total of Tongzhou cotton arriving at the dock was 1,757 bales. The current cotton sales are listed below.

According to another report, the foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been sluggish recently due to the easing of the foreign exchange rate and the sharp fall in yarn prices. Compared to the recent high prices, cotton yarn has fallen by as much as 230 to 240 yuan per bale. Shanghai has a large inventory of cotton yarn. According to various observations, prices are expected to continue to decline. The raw cotton trade has been severely affected by the cotton yarn market. Factories and fellow traders have stopped buying due to the low price of cotton, fearing further appreciation of the exchange rate, so the market is very quiet.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially quiet but then firmed up. The telegram from Bombay was positive, and the market became even firmer. Trading among fellow traders was good, and the textile industry's purchase of raw cotton was still enthusiastic, so recent prices have been firm. However, forward American cotton fell by three to five points due to selling by speculators, Egyptian cotton fell by more than ten points, and Liverpool fell by three points.

### Grains: Rice Prices Stabilize, Initial Rise Followed by Retreat, Showing Weakness, Ke Xian (Rice) Manipulation Depends on Others

The rice market has been hovering around the same level in recent weeks. After the price of various types of rice rose again in the previous dynasty, the market opened yesterday with continued firmness due to various sources, including shipments of No. 5 rice down the river and over 3,000 bales of "baozi" rice by rail. The local rice shops took action, and merchants started to raise prices, creating a tighter situation. However, the appetite of the rice shops was not strong, and the momentum quickly weakened, and the market gradually became more stable and then declined. Therefore, the result was an initial tightening followed by weakening, remaining relatively stable overall, with no significant gains or losses in the closing prices. The opening prices for common Xichang large market new粳 rice was 31 yuan or 30 yuan and 5 jiao, average quality 28 or 29 yuan, broken 粳 average quality 30 yuan or so, substandard quality 27 yuan. Special rice was scarce and without market. Su Tongkun Chang new 粳 high quality 30 yuan, average quality 28 or 29 yuan, broken 粳 transactions rare, opening at only 26 or 27 yuan. Qingjiao Kiln variety 31 yuan and a half, wild rice 31 yuan and a half, Fengjia Baige special 29 yuan and a half, average 29 yuan, 28 yuan and a half, Songjiang substandard Baige 27 yuan, thin and broken original package 26 yuan and a half, 26 yuan, retail 25 yuan, Nangang white rice 30 yuan, early broken 26 yuan, special Yangjian 24 yuan, substandard to 21 yuan, special Lujian 24 yuan and a half, substandard to 22 yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian 19 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, Nanjing No. 1 Jian 20 yuan 3 fen, No. 2 19 yuan 8 jiao, No. 3 19 yuan and a half, Wuhu special Jian 20 yuan 2 fen, substandard to 19 yuan, Chen Bianyuan has become less popular recently, with extremely weak sales and a lack of high-quality rice in the market, presenting a flat and weak market, opening at 30 yuan, 29 yuan for average quality, and new Baiyuan is wider in distribution, and is seemingly firm, so it still opens at 26 or 27 yuan. Total transaction volume for the city was over 7,000 bales.

The opening buying interest of Ke Xian (Rice) was very strong yesterday morning, but after the Japanese merchants had been selling off for days, they suddenly stopped. The local merchants unanimously raised prices, with prices increasing by 2, 3, or 4 jiao. The market traders took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the Japanese merchants may continue to sell, so the market quickly turned weak, and prices decreased again by 2 or 3 jiao. In the afternoon, trading was balanced, and the market lacked change.

### Flour Sales Active

Flour: Spot flour trading continued to be active yesterday, due to continuous purchases from merchants. In addition to merchants from Beiyang adding more to their inventories, there was also demand from Nanyang, Hong Kong, and Xiamen. The circulating inventory in the market has long been depleted, and wheat prices have been rising continuously, making factories firmer in their selling intentions. In addition to supplying the local market at the original price of 7 yuan 3 jiao, the price for merchant orders was 7 yuan 4 jiao, and the price for re-warehoused goods had to be increased by a few fen to a jiao. It was reported that transactions of one or two thousand bags each were made with Tianjin, Tanggu, Hong Kong, and Xiamen, making the market quite firm. It was found that 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### The Municipal Council Strives to Maintain Rights and Interests, Seeks to Resolve Disputes in West Shanghai, Fessenden Has Already Met With the Puppet Mayor, Situation in West Shanghai Eases Yesterday

According to diplomatic sources, the Municipal Council requested "friendly mediation" from the Japanese consul regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries. They simply wanted the Japanese side to remain a third party, mediating and not continuing to support the puppet regime's actions, which would lead to an escalation of the situation. At the same time, they were prepared to make some concessions and request the convocation of a meeting of the Diplomatic Body for discussion in order to obtain a solution. However, the Japanese side ignored this and refused to submit it to the Diplomatic Body for discussion, so the meeting originally scheduled for the 19th could not be held. Therefore, some believe that this action by the Japanese side was not prudent. The Japanese side's refusal to discuss "legal issues" was generally considered to be expected. When the Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, negotiated this issue with Fessenden, the Japanese side strongly opposed the handover of the roads beyond the boundaries to the Chinese government. Now they insist on transferring the jurisdiction of the roads beyond the boundaries to the puppet "municipal government," which is inconsistent with their previous position. However, both the Diplomatic Body and the Municipal Council are dealing with this issue with a calm attitude, and there is no immediate threat of a breakdown. The development situation yesterday is recorded as follows.

### The Situation in the Concessions Must Not Be Changed

In the past ten days, disputes over road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai have occurred repeatedly. The attacks on the police by the puppet police and "self-defense corps" have placed the status of the concessions in a serious situation. All sectors, both Chinese and foreign, are paying close attention. Yesterday, an official from a certain country stated that after the successive attacks on detectives on the 20th and 22nd, the Municipal Council, in addition to negotiating with the puppet "municipal government," also reported the entire incident to the Diplomatic Body for handling. The consuls of various countries in Shanghai will convene a meeting around the end of this month to discuss countermeasures and seek possible solutions. However, for the time being, they are unwilling to express any opinion on this case. The US government has repeatedly stated that the situation in the Shanghai concessions must not be changed, and British personnel have repeatedly expressed their determination to protect the rights and interests of the concessions. The authorities of both countries are now cooperating to deal with the situation. The current state of the concessions should not change. As for the rumors that the US troops stationed in Shanghai may be stationed in the area west of Shanghai after the above two incidents, it is said that if US troops are stationed west of Shanghai, it would be a matter of adjusting the defense zone. However, the incident west of Shanghai should not be related to the adjustment of the defense zone. The rumor that US troops would take over the defense west of Shanghai is not yet credible, as the meeting to adjust the defense zone has not made any progress.

### Both Parties Held Formal Talks the Night Before Last

The Da Zhong News Agency reporter learned from diplomatic circles last night about the meeting between the chairman of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, and the puppet "Mayor, Chuan Xiao'an, on the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries on the evening of the 23rd. In addition to Fessenden and Chuan Xiao'an, those present that evening included the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and head of the Shanghai Diplomatic Body, Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, and Japanese Consul General Yoshiaki Miura. Therefore, the talks that night had a mediating meaning. It is said that the meeting went well, with few disputes and more suggestions. All parties advocated accelerating the end of the dispute. With the advice and support of the Italian and Japanese consuls, it was decided that the Municipal Council and the puppet "municipal government" should reopen direct negotiations. At the meeting, Chuan Xiao'an also stated that the puppet "municipal government" originally planned to collect vehicle fees on roads beyond the boundaries starting from November 1, but now intends to postpone the implementation. Yesterday, the Italian Consul General also stated to the outside world: (1) The general situation of the road issue beyond the boundaries will not further deteriorate. (2) There is no definite date for the Consular Corps to hold a meeting for discussion. (3) According to the current situation, the United States will not take action on the Shanghai concession issue.

Negotiation Situation Recorded in Western Newspapers

The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that the chairman of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, formally began negotiations with the puppet mayor, Fu Xiaoan, last night (the 23rd) with the aim of resolving the issue of roads outside the boundaries and breaking the stalemate that had lasted for six months. The predictions made by the English "Da Mei Evening News" on Saturday and Sunday have been fulfilled. The talks lasted several hours last night, and both sides expressed "considerable satisfaction". Details of the meeting could not be disclosed today, but it was learned from reliable sources that both Fessenden and Chuan put forward several suggestions. Both parties have announced their desire to properly manage the roads outside the boundaries, and the implementation of law and order should be maintained to ensure the safety of traffic and residents' lives in the area. Therefore, most people feel that the two parties should hold discussions on a large scale in order to clarify the various incidents of this dispute. The suggestions made by both sides should be given great understanding so that the problem can be finally resolved. This morning, reliable sources claimed that Fessenden and Chuan's meeting brought the problem closest to a resolution, as the entire problem requires direct negotiation between the two parties.

Japanese Side Sent Letter to Police Commissioner Bowen

The English "Da Mei Evening News" reported that on Sunday morning, a Chinese police officer was shot dead near the Wujiaochang in Bailinan Road, causing a fierce fight between the public concession police and the "self-defense corps". After one member was killed and seven or eight people were injured, Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter to Police Commissioner Bowen. Today (the 24th), it was learned that the letter was not in the form of a protest, but contained suggestions that the police department could not accept. Police Commissioner Bowen has replied to the letter.

The Situation Eased Yesterday

Since the conflict between the Municipal Council police and the "self-defense corps" occurred in Caojiadu Wujiaochang in western Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd, the concession authorities have implemented special alerts for several days in order to maintain local security. Starting yesterday, the number of armored vehicles stationed there has been reduced from three to two. The number of detectives and puppet police has also been greatly reduced. The curfew has been lifted in the evening. However, the police station still sent a large number of police officers, divided into two red police cars and two No. 3 and No. 5 armored gun vehicles, to patrol Yuyuan Road, Yidingpan Road, Jishifei Road, Bailinan Road, and Kangnuot Road all day long. At the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road, in addition to building a large sand castle at the northeast corner, the British defense forces also built a small sand castle at the southeast corner (beside the gate of No. 993 Yuyuan Road) on the afternoon before yesterday, making the defense stronger.

Japanese Newspapers Fuel the Flames

"Dalu News" stated that yesterday (the 21st), the Japanese newspaper in this port carried a report stating that "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan believed that the public concession police's shooting with Chinese people in No. 1081 Jishifeier Road on Sunday morning was an invasion of the jurisdiction of the "Special Municipal Government". Therefore, on Sunday night, it was decided to lodge a strong protest with the Municipal Council. The protest will point out that the police department did not notify the "Special Municipal Government" in advance before taking action on houses outside the jurisdiction of the police department.

As a result, two Chinese people died and three were injured. According to the Japanese "Dalu News Daily", the Japanese Military Police Department will also negotiate with the Municipal Council. At the same time, the Italian authorities stationed in Shanghai issued a statement to the Allied Press, stating that they believe that the Italian Marines had joined the police department in shooting at the people in the house on Jishifeier Road. Check

The Message About Italian Soldiers Shooting

A certain English newspaper and the French "Morning Post" reported that the Italian authorities issued a statement saying that Italian troops arrived at the scene after the Japanese troops and "municipal government" police and assisted in restoring order as usual without using weapons. In addition, the "Zi Lin Daily" reported that regarding Chuan Xiaoan and the Japanese Military Police Department's "protest" to the Municipal Council, the Director General of the Municipal Council, Philippe, replied to questions before dusk yesterday that he had not received such documents.

Gun Bullet Experts Examine Bullet Casings

Shanghai "Times" reported that gun bullet experts at the public concession police department worked hard on Sunday and yesterday (the 23rd) to classify the bullet casings found at the shooting site on Jishifeier Road on Sunday morning. The authorities hope to be able to find out whether there is a connection between the attack on the Chinese and Indian police on Yuyuan Road on Friday night and the shooting on Sunday morning by using this method. All the standing bureaus have expressed great concern about the issue of roads outside the boundaries. It was confirmed yesterday that the Consular Corps has taken over the handling of the issue of roads outside the boundaries. The secretary of the Consular Corps stated yesterday that although the Consular Corps has not taken definite action, it has formally taken over the handling of the issue of roads outside the boundaries.

### Vehicle Fee Collection on Roads Outside Boundaries Postponed, The Puppet Government Has Decided to Postpone Until Next Year Due to the Unstable Situation in West Shanghai

The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that regarding the requirement for all vehicles traveling on roads outside the boundaries to have a "Special Municipal Government" license, Chuan Xiaoan has agreed to postpone the implementation until January 1 of next year due to the subtle and unstable current situation in the area outside the boundary and after receiving a formal request. The "Special Municipal Government" had originally decided that all vehicles must have a new license starting from November 1. However, due to the recent tense developments in the area outside the boundary and the Consular Corps' letter to Chuan Xiaoan requesting a continued postponement, Chuan reconsidered the matter and postponed the implementation.

### The French Concession Public Works Bureau Donates an Ambulance for the Treatment of French Soldiers

The French "Shanghai Daily" reported on the 22nd that it was heard that the board of directors of the French Concession Public Works Bureau held a meeting on October 17. At the suggestion of French Consul General Baudé and Otchi, they would donate a surgical ambulance in the name of the French Concession of Shanghai to treat French soldiers fighting. It was also heard that a sign would be specially inlaid in the car to prove that it was donated by the French Concession of Shanghai. Before this, at the advocacy of Mrs. Cosmer, the French ambassador, French citizens and some Chinese people in Shanghai donated an ambulance. Including the one from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, Shanghai now has two ambulances donated to the French government.

### Visas for German, Austrian, and Czech Goods Awaiting Clearance, Deadline for Shipping, Wu Bomin Departed Yesterday With Visaed Documents

After the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent Wu Bomin and Chen Shanzhi to Shanghai for the German, Austrian, and Czech goods awaiting clearance to be transferred to the interior of China, they have reached an agreement with French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudé, on visaing and releasing the goods. Chen Shanzhi has already gone to Hong Kong and returned to Haiphong a few days ago. Wu Bomin left for Hong Kong on the China Navigation Company's Dutch ship, Tigelbanki, with Shen Tianling, a representative of various factories in Haiphong, at 3 pm yesterday, and brought with him the visaed documents entrusted by the cargo owners. Cargo owners who have not completed the visa documents are requested to send them to Haiphong before the 31st of this month to avoid the German, Austrian, and Czech goods awaiting clearance being confiscated and confiscated by the Haiphong Standing Bureau due to late registration.

Due to the international political situation, Oxeholm was immediately sent to Oslo, the capital of Norway, to take up his new post and will not return to China. His successor has not yet been appointed, and the Danish Consul General in Shanghai, Hill, will continue to serve concurrently as the Danish Chargé d'affaires in China.

It is understood that the total number of ships of the shipping company has reached fifty-nine, totaling 152,095 tons. However, the Japanese side still believes that this number of ships is insufficient to meet the needs of various routes. Recently, new ships are being added, including twelve ships already decided: Myoko, Zuiho, Kōtai, Ningbo, Uraga, Kōkoku, Kōryū, Kōun, Kōshō, Kōhei, etc., with a total carrying capacity of 44,144 tons.

### Financial Market Improves; Foreign Exchange Eases, Gold Falls, and Government Bonds Rise in the Morning; Exchange Market Contracts Slightly, and Government Bonds Continue to Rise in the Afternoon

With frequent reports of victories in the Hunan-Hubei war, coupled with the government's successful implementation of trade controls and the promulgation of new regulations on gold nationalization, declaring its determination to maintain the currency system and stabilize foreign exchange, the Shanghai financial market has taken a sharp turn. Yesterday's market saw: (1) In the black market for foreign exchange, British HSBC quoted two shillings five pence for sterling and seven yuan one jiao two fen five li for US dollars.

### Soybean and Rice Merchants' Association Resolves to Withhold Brokerage Fees; Rice Boats Intercepted by Japanese Troops and Landed at the Sichuan Road Bridge

The Soybean and Rice Merchants' Association held its 56th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the third session at the Association's premises on Edward Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those present were Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zixiang, Cai Yukun, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Xiangsheng, Fu Qiangeng, She Bingwen, Chen Ziyi, Jiang Hongbin, Zhou Zizhen, Yang Heqing, etc. Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department also attended. Xing Zhigang was elected as the chairman. The resolution regarding how to handle the brokerage fees repeatedly requested by brokers was passed as follows: "It has been found that the customer rice in the Yangtze River area has always been unloaded in its original packaging without withholding brokerage fees. The broker's request is not allowed. However, in this extraordinary period, the lives of brokers are indeed difficult. Based on the repeated requests and the mediation of Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, it is allowed that the seller and the buyer each contribute half a cent per shih to provide relief. Once the situation is calm, this measure will be cancelled and not be used as an example."

Mediation Committee

Regarding the matter of the seven rice industry groups each sending a mediation committee member, the mediation committee members of each group have now been appointed. However, the rice store industry has not yet appointed one. The association has also notified the rice store industry association to appoint a mediation committee member as soon as possible.

Interception of Rice Boats

In addition, rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai from the riverside used to dock between the Jiangxi Road Bridge and the Henan Road Bridge. It is now known that they have all been intercepted by the Japanese and landed at the pier between the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Waibaidu Bridge. The Japanese's intention in doing so is to facilitate taxation.

A Glimpse of Rice Prices

Yesterday, the rice market received more than two thousand more packages of goods than before, but prices still rose by half a yuan or three jiao. The reason is that a small number of rice grains transported to Shanghai in the inner harbor were detained. However, the lowest price of Jiangbei indica rice is still nineteen yuan five jiao.

### Association Discusses Business; In a Talk Style; No Member Congresses to be Convened by Various Organizations During Emergency Times

The Shanghai Color Printing Industry Association believes that the printing prices stipulated in the industry regulations set in December of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) are not practical and have long been a dead letter. Therefore, it convened a temporary member representative congress on July 30 of this year to revise the cost prices for the emergency period and believed that all industries in the city must have the same feeling in this difficult time. Therefore, on August 15, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that exceptions be made to avoid hindering business. It is now known that the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that convening a temporary member congress by various industry associations during this period is not in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Organizations During Emergency Times," and thus the request is not approved. If there is a need to revise methods in terms of business, members' opinions can be sought through discussion meetings. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to make exceptions.

After investigation, it was found that the agency colluded with ronin to issue these to deceive people in the market. Travelers are advised to pay attention and not be deceived again, which may lead to unforeseen events.

### America Should Value Shanghai Trade

— By Baemin

Translated from Millard's Review

American trade and shipping across the Pacific, because of the continuous war within China and the outbreak of the European War, now encounter many new difficulties, and perhaps there will be more in the future. American commerce and shipping from Singapore in the south to Kamchatka in the north have recently been or will soon be subject to various new reductions, restrictions, and controls. The extent to which American commerce cannot freely enter and exit the Far East is unprecedented in recent decades.

The serious economic crisis that Japan is shaking is clearly not causing the Japanese warlords to repent. Not only are the Japanese warlords not ending their adventures in China that have caused this crisis, but they are also making new efforts to concentrate the remaining economic strength of their country to continue the war against China. Japan's buying and selling power at home and abroad is constantly declining, while Japan's military rulers continue to cut off Japan's foreign trade to meet their own urgent needs. Japan's imports from the United States are currently limited to direct or indirect military supplies.

On July 16 of this year, the U.S. State Department abolished the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which will expire in just three months after October 26. There is now little hope of extending the period, or perhaps none at all, and the hope of Tokyo and Washington concluding a new treaty is even weaker. This week, the Allied News Agency reported that Japanese Prime Minister Abe declared on October 16 that he thought the U.S. and Japan might conclude a temporary treaty, but it has not yet begun or prepared for negotiations. As it appears, Japan is unwilling to change its discriminatory policy of excluding American merchants in its occupied areas in China. However, this change seems to be a necessary condition for any new commercial treaty between the U.S. and Japan.

As it appears, on the contrary, Japan will continue to make strong efforts to close the open door in China. For several weeks, the Japanese and their puppet regime have been consulting and preparing a uniform system to exclude Western systems, which means engaging in monopolistic trade and foreign exchange control in various occupied areas. The economic blockade of Tianjin has been strengthened again since the recent retreat of the North China floods. The Japanese are also currently economically blockading the Western commercial interests of Shanghai. Many raw materials and food that continued to be transported from the interior of Central China to the Shanghai concessions during the first two years of the Sino-Japanese War have been blocked by the Japanese in recent weeks for their own interests. The goods that have been blocked now include not only silk cocoons, raw cotton, and tung oil, but even rice, eggs, and bristles. Shanghai's export industry, in which the United States has invested significant capital and is the most important customer for these exports, is now being deliberately driven to a dead end by the Japanese.

The Japanese naval blockade of the Chinese coast is constantly expanding. Zhan'aotou Port near the Zhejiang-Fujian border has recently been blockaded. The Japanese have ordered foreign shipping to leave the port and go further south. The Japanese are intensifying the horror of bombing small ports still in Chinese hands, further isolating Hong Kong from economic exchanges with other ports. Most of the remaining trade between Hong Kong and South China is now concentrated in Portuguese Macau and French Guangzhou Bay. The Japanese army's recent occupation of Shiqi in the Pearl River Delta region has cut off Macau and the adjacent Chinese port of Lapba (transliteration) from contact with the interior, leaving Hong Kong only one route through Guangzhou Bay to enter Free China. The Japanese army is now also preparing to land in the suburbs near the French concession.

American commerce in the British and French colonies on the South China coast has encountered new trade and foreign exchange controls as a result of the outbreak of the European War. Americans are no longer able to freely remit funds in and out of these colonies, nor are they able to freely obtain raw materials there, but the supply of raw materials for American industries is largely dependent on these colonies, especially rubber and tin. As far as American merchants are concerned, the two major ports of Singapore and Hong Kong have lost the true nature of free ports, just as Dalian lost that nature more than two years ago.

In Hong Kong, apart from China, the most important trading partner is the United States, and the United States occupies an absolute controlling position in Singapore's commerce. Singapore's raw material market, like other parts of the British Empire, has been subject to strict price controls since the outbreak of the European War. The prices of rubber, tin, and other goods in Singapore are now being artificially prevented from exceeding the level deemed appropriate by London's economic warfare policy. The prices of these same goods in the United States have risen sharply in recent weeks. The question to be answered later is whether the United States will allow purchases in Singapore at lower controlled prices, or whether the United States will have to purchase at higher prices set according to American price levels.

On the entire Pacific coast of the Far Eastern continent, only one major port remains where foreign goods can be freely imported, exports can be freely shipped out, transit trade can be freely conducted, and at the same time there is a free exchange market that is not subject to any foreign exchange controls. This port is Shanghai. Huge American interests are already in danger in this port, and this port will be of even greater importance to American Far Eastern trade and other commerce. Therefore, it is extremely clear that it is in America's own interests to help maintain at least the openness of this port. Most of America's trade with China is concentrated in Shanghai. Similarly, Shanghai is the center of American commercial investment in China. Americans occupy a share in the administrative organs of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Public Works Department of the International Settlement is chaired by an American citizen.

The Japanese in Japan, the British and French in their colonies, of course have the right to adopt whatever economic plans they choose. The only way left for American commercial interests to seek redress when they are hit by such plans is through negotiation. But the Japanese certainly have no right to do whatever they want in Shanghai, to start an economic blockade, to cut off the connection between the Shanghai market and the interior, and to infringe upon Western interests that are firmly established and whose free activities are guaranteed by international treaties. No country has the right to close the open door in Shanghai. Any country that attempts to do so will not only severely damage American economic interests in the Far East, but will certainly infringe upon American rights and privileges. With the European War now underway, Shanghai remains the most free port in the Far East, greatly increasing its importance. Since the ports of the British and French colonies are already under wartime economic control, then every action Japan takes against Shanghai today is more damaging to American interests. Therefore, American interests in Shanghai must be maintained.

In view of the special importance of Shanghai to American interests, it is entirely proper that the American shipping industry in this city has raised questions with Washington about the current amendments to American neutrality laws. It is now necessary to be very careful to prevent the application of the future characteristics of the new American neutrality laws from being unfavorable to American commercial interests in Shanghai and indirectly beneficial to the Japanese. If the United States completely applies the neutrality laws to the entire British and French territories, and American shipping to Hong Kong and Singapore is reduced or stopped, then only Shanghai will remain as the only important port on the Far Eastern continent to support American Eastern shipping. If the Japanese are taught a lesson in Shanghai and do not interfere with the parts of the Shanghai market that are still managed by the Western countries, then American shipping will enjoy special navigational convenience under American law because of extraterritoriality.

In recent months, American trans-Pacific shipping has been strongly recovering and flourishing. The reorganization of the Dollar Steamship Company into the American President Lines, the recent establishment of the Puget Sound Oriental Steamship Company, and the large-scale shipbuilding advocated by the U.S. Maritime Commission are all important factors in this recovery and prosperity. The U.S. Maritime Commission is now building new-style cargo ships at a rate of fifty-two ships per year or one ship per week. The first new cargo ship was launched a few months ago and is currently being completed. In a very short time, these cargo ships will first appear at sea. Its important trend is to increase American shipping on the Pacific Ocean, and this is not a secret event. In addition, the invocation of the amended neutrality laws, especially the "cash and carry" principle, by the European belligerents will leave a large number of American ships idle, and they will sail into the Pacific to seek alternative commerce.

Under these circumstances, from the perspective of American shipping, it seems that the United States cannot afford to lose its free access to its foothold in Shanghai. However, if the Japanese are allowed to completely suppress the Shanghai market, the result will be the loss of this free access.

### National Construction Savings Regularly Held; Savings Certificates Divided into Six Categories, All of Which Have Been Printed; Limited to Issuance Nationwide Before the End of November

Since the central government designated the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to issue National Construction Savings Certificates, the Savings and Remittances Bureau has begun preparations. It is now learned that six categories of Class A and B savings certificates, with denominations of 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan, have all been printed and circulated to more than 1,000 post offices across the country to be held uniformly before November 30 of this year. In order to promote this National Construction Savings movement, the Bureau has also consulted with local Party and government agencies and local organizations to jointly promote it. It is reported that the central government attaches great importance to this and will organize a National Construction Savings Movement General Association and organize branch associations in various provinces, cities, and counties to specialize in promoting this movement to facilitate the promotion of national construction.

### Japanese Embassy Acknowledges; Hull's Attitude Resolute; Declares American Officials in Shanghai Have the Right to Deal with Unfortunate Incidents

According to the Associated Press news in this city, the Japanese Embassy in this city stated today that the U.S. State Department did issue a statement last week regarding the situation in Shanghai, stating that Shanghai officials have the right to deal with unfortunate incidents, such as attacks on Public Works Department police officers in areas where roads are being built across the border. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this port, Hull did issue this statement, but he said that the opinion that the United States is prepared to intervene in the Shanghai situation is the opinion of the Washington Observer.

### Fickle Woman Dies Under Knife; Three Lovers Cause Uproar; Two Suspects Detained Pending Investigation

At 5:45 p.m. yesterday, a love triangle murder case occurred in the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road Police Station. The situation is recorded as follows:

Du Defa, a man from Yangzhou, 30 years old, is currently working as a partner in the Jinlong Barber Shop at 120 Fuzhou Road. Nine years ago, he became acquainted with Wang Xiuying, a woman from the same hometown, and now lives with her in the front building at No. 23, Lane 181, Yulin Road, Hongkou, with a six-year-old son named Xiaogouzi. But although Xiuying is 34 years old, she is actually one of a

Fickle Woman

In addition to living with Du Defa, she also has two lovers behind the scenes: (1) Liu Linfu, a coppersmith from Yangzhou who lives at No. 183 Elcock Road, is 42 years old; (2) Zhou Yongcai, who works as a foreman at Huishan Wharf and lives at No. 15, Lane 181, Yulin Road. Liu and Zhou have been secretly interacting with Xiuying for many years, but Du Defa is absolutely unaware. On the 2nd of this month, Wang Xiuying suddenly claimed to Du Defa that she wanted to return to Yangzhou soon because her sister was sick. Du agreed. Du usually stays in the shop and

Does Not Return Home Often

When Du Defa returned home on the night of the 17th, he saw that Wang Xiuying was still there and had not gone to Yangzhou. He felt suspicious and thought that Wang had behaved improperly, so he started an argument. After a quarrel, the matter was put to rest. The next morning, Du still went to work in the shop. At 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, Du suddenly received a phone call from Liu Linfu, urging him to return home quickly. Du went back and entered the room, where he saw Liu and Wang Xiuying were both there. Liu said to Du, "Your wife is unfaithful and has been in love with Zhou Yongcai for two years. This time, Xiuying

Used the Excuse of Going to Yangzhou

But secretly lived with Zhou," etc. Du was furious when he heard this and interrogated Wang strictly, but Wang did not admit it, saying that she had nothing to do with Zhou, but had an ambiguous relationship with Liu. If he didn't believe it, he could go to Zhou's place to confront him. After confronting Zhou Yongcai, there was no result. On the morning of the 23rd, Liu invited Du out and went to the Fuyuan Tea House on Zhejiang Road to discuss and decided to buy a sharp triangular bayonet to kill Zhou Yongcai to vent their anger. Liu Linfu then bought the aforementioned bayonet from Mantingfang for two yuan and

Hid it on His Person

They returned home together and asked Wang Xiuying to go out to look for Zhou Yongcai. But Wang did not return for a long time after going out. Liu and Du then followed her out. At 5:00 p.m., they returned without finding Zhou. Unexpectedly, they saw that Wang Xiuying had returned alone. Du then argued with her, but Wang was strong and powerful, and Du was defeated and fell to the ground. He then called for Liu's help. Liu suddenly pulled out the bayonet and stabbed Wang's chest and abdomen several times, causing serious injuries. She immediately fell to the ground, and blood flowed into a river.

Barely Breathing

Neighbors Tao Fuwu and Ren Yuncai reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Detective Wu Jiwen to transport the injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital. She died before arriving at the hospital. The body was sent to the coroner's office. Du and Liu were taken to the police station along with the murder weapon. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the above situation, requesting a postponement because the coroner had not yet examined the body. When questioned, Du Defa admitted to fighting and calling for Liu's help, but did not instruct Liu to stab Wang Xiuying to death. Liu Linfu admitted that he had decided to kill Wang when discussing in Fuyuan, and did not intend to kill Zhou Yongcai. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody pending a further hearing in seven days. The body will be examined by the prosecutor's office and ordered to be placed in a coffin.

### Longtime Loving Couple; Petition for Divorce; Husband Firmly Opposes

Hou Tonglian, a local woman residing at No. 702 Xiafei Road, is 32 years old, well-educated, beautiful, and gentle. She recently hired lawyer Xu Qinfu to file a petition with the Special Second Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Chuan Dianying (currently teaching at Huadong Girls' High School, No. 2, Lane 462, Xiafei Road). It is said that the petitioner was introduced by Wu Fuxiang and Dai Yuchun on July 17 of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) and held a wedding ceremony at the Daji Building in Xiaodongmen, Nanshi. After marriage, the couple had a harmonious relationship and had one daughter and two sons. The family of five depended on the defendant for their livelihood. Unexpectedly, the defendant's attitude suddenly changed recently. He cohabited with a dancer, often leaving home and neglecting the lives of his mother and children. Although she had repeatedly negotiated with him, he ignored her. She had no choice but to file a petition for divorce. The court approved the petition. Yesterday, Judge Liao Yuan summoned both parties to court. After the petitioner stated the above situation, the defendant also appeared in court and stated that he had never delayed the petitioner's living expenses. He had recently been teaching at Huadong Girls' High School, and had not received his salary for two months, so difficulties arose. He firmly disagreed with the divorce. The court verified the statements and ruled that mediation was unsuccessful and that a formal lawsuit could be filed.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: According to Mr. Zhang Lingyun, the concerned party, the news articles published in your newspaper on the 11th and 22nd of this month regarding the "Extortion of Yongsheng Bank Assistant Manager Case" are not in accordance with the facts. Zhang Lingyun is only an ordinary employee of Yongsheng Bank and does not hold the title of Assistant Manager. Furthermore, the organization of Yongsheng Bank does not have an Assistant Manager position. The bank's lending practices are entirely in accordance with the small loan practices of major banks. The report alleging "usurious lending" is clearly malicious propaganda. The statement regarding "the truth" is also contrary to the facts. Regarding the record that "upon seeing that Bi was carrying a self-defense handgun, he feigned ignorance," Bi Haomin's confession to the police is clear and undeniable. The exaggeration and confusion are evident. The distortion of facts has a negative impact. Therefore, we have specifically requested your lawyer to send a letter for correction to clarify the record. We request that your newspaper investigate and publish this letter to the editor for correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Sun Shi'an, October 23rd.

### Preamble to the Premiere of "Blood-Stained Flowers"

— Wei Ruhui

The writing of "Blood-Stained Flowers" is based on Yu Manweng's "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao." Therefore, if anyone asks why it was written, I will answer with the words from Manweng's preface to "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao": "It is written for a purpose."

The contents of this "purpose" have been fully explained in the play, so there is no need to repeat them. This article will briefly describe the simple process of writing this play.

It was two years ago that I went to see the improved Peking opera "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian. In the audience, after revisiting the legendary figure of Li Xiangjun, I remembered that in "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao," there were characters even more proactive than Xiangjun. The first to come to mind was Ge Nen, who remained unyielding to the death, cutting her tongue and spitting blood. Her passionate and inspiring historical story made it necessary to turn it into a historical drama.

So, after returning home, I reread "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao." From Ge Nen to Sun Kejian, from Kejian to Yu Manweng, Wang Weibo, and then from Manweng to Li Shiniang, from Weibo to Cai Ruheng, they became a series of inseparable figures. And these three pairs of characters seemed to represent three different tendencies; the Weibo-Ruheng pair was precisely the "antagonist." So, I decided to use these six people as the central characters, developing the entire history of the late Ming Dynasty based on this principle.

However, due to other work commitments, I only wrote three pages of the original manuscript and then put it aside. It was not until this spring that Mei Yi, the editor of "Huamei Morning Post" ("Langhua"), asked me to write a long story. I decided to take this opportunity to fulfill my wish. So, I worked on it in my spare time, completing two pages of the original manuscript each day and sending them for publication. Soon, Mei Yi returned to "Translation Report," and his successor was Yu You. I could not refuse, so I had to continue writing. In about two months, I completed two and a half acts. Unfortunately, "Huamei Morning Post" ceased publication, and the play was put aside again.

Unexpectedly, inland theater troupes heard about the writing of this play and sent letters urging me to complete it. "China Travel" and "China Relief" looked forward to it eagerly, and "Shanghai Drama Society" had already announced it. Under pressure from all sides, I had to abandon other work and devote myself to organizing and continuing the unfinished parts. I revised it several times, completely changing the original draft.

This play has been assisted by comrades from the "Drama Society," as well as Liu Qiong, Zhang Zhizhi, Yan Fei, Zhao Shu, Fei Chong, and other friends. I am extremely grateful that it will have its premiere in Shanghai. What is particularly rare is that Ruoqing returned to Shanghai after three years away. She came to help as soon as she got off the train, rehearsing day and night, enduring great hardship. Alas! I really don't know how to thank her.

In addition, I would like to thank Wu Yonggang for directing this play with great dedication; Xuan Gang for composing and arranging the music with careful consideration; and Mr. Liu Yazi for correcting many historical inaccuracies. I will never forget them.

The person who assisted in the completion of this play from beginning to end was Yu Ling; the person who gave me the greatest spiritual encouragement was Xia Yan, who is far away in Guilin. We shared life-and-death experiences last year, and I dare not express my gratitude. I will dedicate this play to him.

October 24th.

### Introducing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty"

— Tianwen

Since its performance of "Sai Jinhua," the Shanghai Drama Society has been rehearsing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" and is also preparing to stage "Chen Yuanyuan." Staging historical dramas is indeed adapted to the environment of "this time, this place," but just as film companies compete to shoot costume dramas, we should critically accept the lessons of history and reflect reality as the main condition. Wei Ruhui's seriousness when adapting "Sai Jinhua" and his multiple revisions when writing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" show a conscientious work ethic that is incomparable to those who sell pornography and arbitrarily "reproduce" works.

"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" was originally titled "Blood-Stained Flowers." The first two acts were published in "Langhua" in the "Huamei Morning Post." After the "Huamei Morning Post" ceased publication, the play was not continued. Recently, the Shanghai Drama Society was eager to rehearse the play, so the original author revised the first two acts and continued to write the third and fourth acts. During the time of revision and continuation, because the rehearsal was being rushed, the content was changed almost daily. Now that it is being performed, as stated in "Preamble to the Premiere of 'Blood-Stained Flowers'": It has completely changed its original appearance.

I have read the revised version of the first two acts. For the third and fourth acts, I have only seen the initial mimeographed version. After these two days of all-night rehearsals, there have probably been many more revisions. Now, I will introduce the general situation as follows:

The first act is set on the eve of Shi Kefa's martyrdom in Yangzhou and the fall of Nanjing. Sun Yaxian, a member of the Qingliu faction, indulges in sensual pleasures and falls in love with the famous courtesan Ge Nen'niang because he is jealous of Ma Shiying. However, Cai Ruheng, Ma Shiying's henchman, is constantly monitoring him. When the situation in Nanjing becomes critical, Cai Ruheng naturally becomes a "hero" who understands the times. Sun Kejian is determined not to leave Nanjing, but Ge Nen'niang is a thoughtful and far-sighted heroine. She forces him to leave Nanjing in the chaos by disfiguring herself and threatening to commit suicide.

The second act depicts the conflict between Zheng Zhilong and his son Zheng Chenggong. In Chenggong's reply to his father, he says, "The father betrays Ming, and the son is loyal to Ming. The father cannot force me!" It is after Ge Nen'niang asks for help and is humiliated, and Zheng's mother teaches her son to be loyal, that Zheng Chenggong abandons literature and takes up arms.

The third act is a reunion of old friends in Nanjing. They retreat to the mountains to resist the Qing army through guerrilla warfare. At this time, Cai Ruheng actually comes to persuade Ge Nen'niang to surrender with the argument of "Why must both sides be hurt?" But when the Qing army surrounds them on all sides, they all lead the masses in a vow.

The fourth act depicts the arrest of Sun Kejian and Ge Nen'niang. The Qing general Bolo is bewitched by Nen'niang's beauty and intends to "take her for himself." At the same time, Wang Weibo (who is Cai Ruheng's wife and should now be called Bolo's Chinese wife) also comes to persuade her. But Ge Nen'niang maintains her integrity. After Mei Niang kills Cai Ruheng with her own hands, she also cuts her tongue and bleeds to death.

When watching Zhou Xinfang's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," I felt that the passing of a generation of emperors in such a way was moving. But reading about Ge Nen'niang of "Blood-Stained Flowers" cutting her tongue to curse the enemy and Sun Kejian calmly embracing righteousness makes one only feel resentment! Just as Ge Nen'niang said: "This is a blood debt!"

### Scrip Coupons of the Three Major Companies

Since the issuance of fractional currency notes, the streetcar company's scrip coupons have been gradually withdrawn. Many reputable large stores are also withdrawing the scrip coupons they have issued, but the scrip coupons of the three major companies, like those of the streetcar company, are scattered widely, mostly in the hands of small vendors. The coupons clearly state that they can only be used to purchase goods and cannot be exchanged for cash. However, these vendors will never have the opportunity to step through the doors of the companies. Therefore, these past two days, small vendors have been frequently negotiating with the companies, hoping that they can exchange the coupons for cash. "Sincere" and "Sun Sun" are considering their plight and have stipulated that small vendors be allowed to exchange the coupons at designated locations every morning. "Wing On" has not yet indicated their intention, but they will probably adopt the same method of cashing out. "Wing On" has never issued scrip coupons, but it is said that they collect fractional currency notes at 70 or 80 cents per dollar to use as change.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 17: Learning Extramural Affairs, Reporters Enter a New Realm; Practicing Internal Affairs, the Academy Stages a Play.

Zhu Ai'ren agreed with a "yes." Therefore, the old doctor further instructed her: "When you arrive in Shanghai, observe and act accordingly. Don't rush back on Monday for the sake of things here. We will take care of the hospital and the infant home. You can rest assured. Even if you stay in Shanghai for another week or two, it won't matter. If there is anything urgent, you can call you. It would be best if you could invite Mrs. Su Maiya to come with you." On Saturday afternoon, they still took Zhu Ai'ren's car to Suzhou. These days, the autumn sky is high and clear, and the osmanthus is fragrant. The He sisters saw some villagers on the road using small handcarts to push baskets filled with fresh chestnuts. The He sisters, who grew up in the city, were not very familiar with rural products. But when autumn arrived, they often ate roasted chestnuts with sugar and other things from the market. They asked, "Sister Ai'ren! Aren't these fresh chestnuts? We only know about Liangxiang chestnuts from Tianjin, which are famous throughout the country. Do they also grow chestnuts here?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "The South also produces chestnuts, not just the North. When we were little, we only knew about eating Liangxiang chestnuts. Liangxiang is a county in Hebei province, and it is said that the chestnuts produced in Liangxiang are very small, both glutinous and sweet. Later, we learned that the place where chestnuts are produced in the North is not only Liangxiang, but also the several counties neighboring Liangxiang produce chestnuts. Not only in Hebei, but also in several places in Shandong, chestnuts are produced, and the chestnuts produced in some counties are even better than those in Liangxiang. However, people only know that Liangxiang produces famous chestnuts, so chestnuts from other places are also called Liangxiang chestnuts. Later, during the war, Liangxiang County was occupied, and it seemed that the South would no longer be able to eat Liangxiang chestnuts. But when the chestnuts went on the market, their signs still read 'Liangxiang,' which cannot but evoke a sense of sadness. In fact, many were not produced in Liangxiang, but their taste was no less than that of Liangxiang. It is strange that some people have moved our famous chestnut varieties to their own country, but the chestnuts produced are still not as good as ours. What is the reason for this? Some say it is due to the soil, others say it is due to the climate. I don't understand this, because I am not a horticulturist." He Liyu said, "Okay! We asked you one question, but you gave us a chestnut essay. We are just asking you, does Suzhou also produce chestnuts?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "Actually, I don't understand very well. I think: now that osmanthus chestnuts are on the market, they are probably from Changshu, right? I know that Changshu produces a kind of osmanthus chestnut, whose taste is no less than that of Liangxiang chestnuts in the North, and its shape is also very small, both sweet and glutinous. What's more, it has a kind of osmanthus fragrance, so it is called the osmanthus chestnut."

### Fake "Bureau Chief" Li Dingshi's Bodyguards Mistakenly Kill a Prostitute, Sentenced to Prison, Two Bodyguards Each Sentenced to One and a Half Years

Li Dingshi, the current fake "Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government," from Wuxing, held a banquet at the Meijuan brothel at 26 Pingwang Lane, Pingwang Street, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 9 PM. He invited "Municipal Government" advisor Ikeda Seiji, "Finance Bureau" advisor Kita Shoji, Special Affairs Agency head Sasaki, "Municipal Government" councilor Wang Changchun, "China Automobile Company" director Dong Ming, and others. In the midst of the celebration, three assassins suddenly came upstairs and opened fire on Li, wounding Ikeda and Kita. At the time, Li's bodyguards, Hu Changhai and Zhang Jianzhong, also fired shots after the incident. As a result, not only did the assassins not hit their target, but they also killed a prostitute named Xiao Qiaohong (real name Shen Sanbao). After receiving the report, the Old Zhabei Police Station sent Chinese detectives Wang Shusen and Zhang Bingchun to investigate. The police determined that the location of Hu and Zhang was the small room next to the stairway, which was the only way in and out for the assassins. Therefore, if Hu and Zhang had guarded the entrance at the time, none of the assassins would have escaped. However, Hu and Zhang did not do this. Several minutes after the assassins had fled, they randomly fired more than ten shots out of the window into the alley in an attempt to shirk their responsibility. Because Xiao Qiaohong was unjustly killed, Hu and Zhang should be held responsible for causing death by negligence. Therefore, the two men were detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoquan, explained the facts, stating that when the two defendants fired the shots, the assassins had long since fled. Although the two defendants wanted to shirk their responsibility at this time, they should have paid attention to whether there were people in the alley when they fired the shots. However, they randomly fired, causing the death of Xiao Qiaohong, which clearly constituted death by negligence. He requested that the court sentence them according to Article 176 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the two defendants admitted that they fired at the assassins, but did not see Xiao Qiaohong. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and sentenced Hu Changhai and Zhang Jianzhong to one year and six months of imprisonment each for causing death by negligence as a warning.

### What is Expected of the Drama League

— Xin Ying

The professional drama circles in this city are planning to organize a drama league. This league is initiated by Gu Menghu, Chen Qiufeng, Dong Tianmin, Zhang Siwei, Zhang Yezhi, Li Zhuan, and others, and is currently being actively prepared.

The main reason for organizing the drama league is that newly emerging theater troupes in the city are often heard of, but they disband soon after their establishment. Their organizations are so unsound that a group is needed to connect them and make up for the shortcomings.

Indeed, the most important thing for the establishment of a theater troupe is a sound organization. Otherwise, it will not be sustainable and achieve considerable success. Therefore, we believe that the organization of the drama league by the professional drama circles has considerable significance.

Furthermore, in addition to hoping that the organization of the drama circles is sound, we also hope that every professional drama group can recognize the mission that the drama circles should bear. Everyone can make the drama progress and must not cater to low-level interests, so that the drama still cannot escape the category of civilized drama, or even move backward.

Finally, we feel that the ticket prices for the plays staged by various theater troupes in Shanghai have been set too high recently. High ticket prices cannot be widespread, so many people who love to watch plays cannot afford to see them because of the ticket prices. The professional drama circles cannot ignore this point, right?

### The "China Travel" Star, Ms. Tang Ruoqing, Arrives in Shanghai Quietly: A Meeting Record

— Beini

The news of Tang Ruoqing's arrival in Shanghai was initially unbelievable because everyone knew that she had accepted an invitation from overseas Chinese in Nanyang to perform abroad; however, no one expected that she had quietly arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago!

In order to get some news about the Hong Kong theater scene and also to meet this actress who had been away from Shanghai for more than two years, the reporter visited her at the Shanghai Drama Society one afternoon when it was raining continuously. She graciously answered many questions that people on the isolated island did not know, and also talked about her recent situation. The following is a record of the interview:

I (Tang said herself) The last play I performed in Hong Kong was Mr. Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment." It was a performance to raise disaster relief funds. The venue was the "Queen's Theater." The script was rewritten by Mr. Xia Yan based on the situation in Hong Kong. I played the role of Liu Lizhu. The director was Mr. Fei Mu. The general situation was very good; after finishing "Women's Apartment," I was invited to go south. At that time, the situation in Europe was already urgent. I was stopped when I left for Haiphong and had to return to Hong Kong. At that time, my sister Xiangqing wanted to return to Shanghai to study, and she wanted me to accompany her to Shanghai. It just so happened that I also had some things to take care of in Shanghai, so I decided to accompany her to Shanghai. I originally didn't want anyone to know, but as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I was discovered by several familiar friends and invited to perform in Shanghai as a guest performer.

"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" is a historical drama that Mr. Wei Ruhui recently finished writing. On the third day after I arrived in Shanghai, I met Mr. Wei. Mr. Wei said, "Shanghai Drama Society" is going to perform this play recently, but the role of Ge Nen'niang is still vacant, and they must find me to play it. However, I didn't plan to perform in Shanghai, but under the insistent invitation of Mr. Wei and several heads of the Shanghai Drama Society, I couldn't refuse their kindness, so I agreed. I spent a day reading the entire script and felt that the meaning and technique of the script were very good. The director of this play is Mr. Wu Yonggang. This is the first time I have worked with Mr. Wu.

"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" has already begun rehearsals and is scheduled to be staged on the 25th.

As for my future plans, it's really hard to say. However, after "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," I plan to leave Shanghai and return to Hong Kong. On the one hand, my sister's studies in Shanghai have been arranged, and on the other hand, some miscellaneous matters can be concluded. After a long conversation of one hour, the reporter hurriedly said goodbye.

### A Record of a Theatrical Performance at the Yu Residence

— Only Me

Yesterday, the grandson of Mr. Yu Qiaqing held his wedding at the New Capital Hotel, and there was a grand theatrical performance. Because those attending the performance were all "star players" from various theaters, it caused quite a sensation. The New Capital Theater, which wasn't very large, was packed.

The stars from the Tianchan Stage were the first to perform. Liu Hanchen, Xue Youqin, Gao Xueqiao, and others rushed back to the Tianchan to perform after singing "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness." However, after "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness" ended, originally it was supposed to be Chu Xiaolinghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet." However, Xiaolinghong was unable to arrive on time due to unfinished business regarding gold, so, helplessly, filler acts were performed. There were two filler acts by small clowns: "Breaking the Casserole" by Liu Binkun and Han Jinkui, and "Escorting the Bride and Performing Rituals" by Han Jinkui.

After dinner, "Arresting Cao Cao" continued the performance. Mr. Zhao Peixin's Chen Gong and Qi Junqing's Lü Boshe, all those participating in the Yu residence performance were professionals. Only Zhao and Qi were amateurs. Mr. Zhao's voice is becoming increasingly clear and bright, with a multitude of excellent tones, pleasing to the ear. Even professionals can't match it. Mr. Wang has recently shifted away from specializing in the Kylin style. Although playing the supporting role of Lü Boshe, his light and understated portrayal was just right. He is, after all, an old hand, and his performance was anything but ordinary. Paired with Li Kechang's Cao Cao, it was even more perfect.

After "Arresting and Releasing Cao Cao" came the masterpiece starring three female Dan roles: Wu Suqiu's "Chunxiang Makes a Scene at School," Xiao Linghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," and Zhang Shuxian's "Xin'an Inn." Suqiu's makeup was beautiful, and her expressions and actions as Chunxiang were extremely wonderful. The audience all admired Suqiu's artistry. After "Chunxiang Makes a Scene at School" came Xiao Linghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet." Xiao Linghong's appearance was extraordinarily beautiful, capable of astonishing the audience. She was indeed a beauty. Although her fame and status are not as high as Suqiu's, her performance was no less wonderful than Suqiu's. The Liu Matchmaker from the Three Provinces was particularly "remarkable," with countless body movements, exquisitely detailed. After "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" came Zhang Shuxian's "Xin'an Inn." Because Zhang's stage performance had not yet finished, she was unable to arrive in time, so "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" was delayed and lasted until nine quarters of the hour. Zhang Shuxian has not been in Shanghai for long since arriving from Tianjin. Watching her perform "Xin'an Inn," one can see that her art has considerable foundation and she is not a mediocre person. Shuxian's makeup is slightly lacking, but her martial arts skills are quite commendable, her body movements are also good, and she is good at acting. She can be considered a talent of medium caliber.

The most captivating performance of the evening was undoubtedly the "Battle of Changsha" by Kirin Boy (Zhao Ruquan) and Yuan Shihai. Xin Fang and Ruquan are the giants of Southern opera performers. When two heroes meet, it is not only a match made in heaven, but also Shihai's imposing painted face, which has always been highly praised, complementing each other like a peony and green leaves. That evening, from beginning to end, all three spared no effort, and the audience applauded thunderously. Mr. Yu Qiaqing sat in a corner of the stage, cheering repeatedly, and its brilliance was beyond words. The grand finale was Song Dezhu's "Flooding Jinshan Temple," Dezhu's signature play. It was different in style from the Battle of Changsha, each with its own strengths. The performance ended at four in the morning.

### The Grand Opening of Dahua is Scheduled

— Que Li

The long-rumored Dahua Cinema is scheduled to open on January 22nd, and the construction project will be completed by the 10th of next month. Because the cinema has a long-term contract with MGM, it will exclusively screen MGM's new films from now on. There are currently twenty of them in stock, ready to be screened in sequence. The opening premiere is Jeanette MacDonald's singing film "Broadway Serenade." The next film to be screened is the three-million-dollar Technicolor epic "The Wizard of Oz" (starring Judy Garland). As for "Gone With The Wind," a collaborative effort by Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Vivien Leigh, it will be screened at the end of this year. The long-awaited literary masterpiece "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" (Robert Donat's immortal work) will not arrive in Shanghai until after March.

Prelude to Iron Horse

"Iron Horse" is Paramount Cecil B. DeMille's fifty-sixth masterpiece. This film has considerable historical and educational value. It is said that in the past, tea from China to the eastern United States had to be shipped via South America. Later, when the Union Pacific Railroad was built, it could be shipped directly from the west to the east. President Lincoln always signed A. Lincoln, but when approving this railroad, he specially signed his full name, Abraham Lincoln, which shows how much he valued the railroad. The above picture shows the three main characters in Iron Horse. (Paul)

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Gold and Silver Issue in the Ulong Courtyard Play

However, there are many words that sound the same but have different characters, which requires a lot of guessing. For example, the second sentence above, according to the original meaning, is picking up some chicken feathers to make a feather duster. However, these words come from the mouth of a useless teacher, and he knows that the thug disciples he leads are even more useless than him, so even though he is leading a group of people to capture Xiao En, it is nothing more than gathering some courage (dust). Similarly, in the play "Ulong Courtyard," Song Dezhu (playing Xi Jiao) also had a disagreement with Third Master Song that day. When Song Jiang asked Xi Jiao for the gold in the Zhao Wen pouch, Dezhu responded, "The old lady is going down the steps, squatting (crouching)." This is also a saying with a hidden meaning. According to the literal meaning, because the old lady is old, her joints are stiff, and her hands and feet are not flexible, when going down the steps, with one foot up and one foot down, if she is a little flustered, she will often squat her waist and hold her breath. Therefore, the Dan performer used "cun (store/save/deposit) squatting" with the same sound to answer the male role, saying that the gold called me to store it. In fact, according to the old saying, it means "I have accepted the gold." If Dezhu had learned Cuihua's play, then this line would probably be recited according to Cuihua's original line. My point is that while it is appropriate for junior performers to learn from their predecessors, they must first judge what should be learned and what should not be learned. They must thoroughly understand the plot before making a choice. Dezhu is from a school, so her knowledge is naturally higher than that of ordinary actors. Take, for example, what I said above, "He insisted on changing the line to, 'I'll keep the silver ingot for Third Brother to buy candy.'" In fact, he didn't think about it. Does the real Xi Jiao not even know the difference between gold and silver? Examining his intention, it is nothing more than the originator wanting to add a witty touch, and saying to take a gold ingot to buy candy would be inappropriate, so he devalued the gold and changed it to silver.
