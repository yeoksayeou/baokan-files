### Japanese Officer States that the Battle of Baotou Was Fierce; Chinese Troops Acted Nimbly, Approaching the City; Japanese Regimental Commander Colonel Kobayashi Killed in Action

Beiping Lieutenant Colonel Tonowaki of the Japanese army flew here from Baotou yesterday. He told reporters about the battle of Baotou, saying that the battle was more intense than they had expected. The main force of General Fu Zuoyi's (former Chairman of Suiyuan Province) 35th Army, about 10,000 men, seemed to have advanced secretly, moving only at night, and arrived under the city of Baotou. About 100 men infiltrated the city one by one through the water gate. The Chinese army launched an attack after preparing thoroughly near Baotou. General Fu Zuoyi apparently believed that he could recapture the city, but the Japanese army, anticipating the Chinese attack, completely surrounded them and attacked their rear. Japanese reinforcements arrived by train from the east and forced the Chinese army to retreat westward. Tonowaki continued that the Chinese army suffered 3,000 to 3,500 casualties, while the Japanese army suffered 200 casualties. The actions of the Mongolian army were quite commendable.

Chinese Army War Trophies to Be Exhibited

Wuyuan The first batch of war trophies captured by the Chinese army in Baotou has been transported to Sui and is being exhibited. There are dozens of items, including mountain guns, light and heavy machine guns, and Japanese and puppet flags. A large number of people are viewing them. (Telegram, 29th)

Wuyuan In the recent Chinese army's recapture of Baotou, thousands of Japanese were killed or wounded. Japanese corpses are scattered around the suburbs of the city, making it almost impossible to count. The Chinese have been cleaning the battlefield for days and have discovered the bodies of many important Japanese officers, including Japanese Regimental Commander Kobayashi Kazuo. They could not be transported away. The chaotic and embarrassed state of their retreat can be imagined. It is reported that Kobayashi Kazuo graduated from the 27th class of the Japanese Military Academy and served as a cavalry company commander, cavalry school instructor, and cavalry inspector. He was a research expert in cavalry operations and was fully responsible for the command of Japanese cavalry in western Suiyuan. His death at the hands of the Chinese is a major blow to the Japanese.

Then he returned to the front line. When the Japanese army launched a second attack, the platoon leader continued to fire and again carried a machine gun to the rear. After four round trips, he finally transported all the machine guns back. He also carried back two heavy machine guns from other locations. All the officers and soldiers admired his bravery.

Editorial

### Constitutional Government Next Year

Another year has passed quickly, and it is again time for "New Year's Eve." The history of the Chinese nation's struggle this year is filled with words interwoven with blood and tears, but also many inspiring and encouraging events. Militarily, there have been frequent victories; economically, there has been much construction, which is known to both Chinese and foreigners and does not need to be elaborated on. Even politically, there is a page worthy of special mention and emphasis. Although the general public has focused its attention on military developments and buried itself in the arduous wartime life, thus neglecting politics, its importance is recognized by knowledgeable people. This is the fact that the National Political Council's proposals to promulgate the Constitution early and convene the National Assembly on schedule have been adopted by the Central Government.

China's constitutional movement, of course, varies in content according to the times, but speaking from the beginning, it has a history of more than 30 years. Not to mention the distant past, just since the publication of the first draft of the Constitution in 1934, there have been many twists and turns before it finally came into view. The Central Government was just about to convene the National Assembly on November 12, 1937, when the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out, and it was again suspended. At present, the War of Resistance is in full swing, and military reports are frequent. The sudden decision to implement constitutional government has caused those who are concerned about national affairs to question (1) whether the whole country, both government and people, can "take their time" to engage in the formulation of the fundamental law of the country? (2) Whether it is premature to implement constitutional government before the completion of political tutelage? (3) Whether the Constitution, even if it can be drafted, can be used freely? (4) Whether the implementation of constitutional government during the War of Resistance, when it is important to concentrate will, will inevitably lead to party strife, which will hinder the united front of the entire nation against the Japanese? These questions are, of course, reasonable and cannot be dismissed as unfounded worries. However, after carefully reading the explanation given by Speaker Jiang of the National Political Council in various newspapers last week, one can be greatly relieved. Speaker Jiang believes that (1) during the War of Resistance, we should work harder to build the country, and the passage of the two proposals on the implementation of constitutional government will lay a lasting and solid foundation for the country; (2) promoting constitutional government and implementing political tutelage not only do not hinder each other but are also mutually supportive; (3) precisely because the people cannot use the Constitution freely after it is drafted and promulgated, it is necessary to continue the unfinished work of political tutelage; (4) he believes that everyone will certainly not want to repeat the old habits of past parliaments and, therefore, must adopt a positive and well-intentioned attitude in criticizing the government's performance. Finally, he solemnly instructed: "The effectiveness of the implementation of constitutional government does not lie in the articles and form of the Constitution but in possessing the spirit of constitutionalism!" We recall that since the beginning of the War of Resistance two and a half years ago, many enthusiastic critics have often said that in this War of Resistance, our politics has always lagged behind the economy, especially behind the military. There is evidence for such criticism, especially for certain points in the central and local administration. However, we should not doubt the early implementation of constitutional government because of this. On the contrary, part of the meaning of early implementation of constitutional government lies in promoting politics so that politics can match the economy and the military. We firmly believe that the full-scale War of Resistance promoted national unity in the past, and now we will use the same strength and reason to promote national politics. Not only will it promote it, but it will also lay the spiritual foundation for harmony, public service, and national devotion. From these aspects, Speaker Jiang's statement that equal emphasis should be placed on resistance and nation-building, and that political tutelage and constitutional government should go hand in hand, is not only possible but also necessary. To explain the current early implementation of constitutional government in terms of the entire history of China's constitutional movement, it can be said to be a twist and turn that takes a sharp turn, and the water flows and the channel opens up! Implementing constitutional government and returning power to the people is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "the world is for all," and it is also the destination of the revolution! The Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of next year to promulgate the Constitution and set a deadline of the end of June next year to complete the unfinished procedures for national elections. The former is only a little over 10 months away, and the latter is only 6 months away. Time is like a flowing river and is upon us. Although changes in dates and prospects, there are many precedents in history, and often because of the facts, it is necessary. However, this time during the War of Resistance, the great faith is involved, and the impact is extremely great, so there will certainly be no further delays. However, since the passage of the proposal by the National Political Council, the organization of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the holding of constitutional seminars in various places have been quite enthusiastic, which can be taken as clear evidence of efforts to promote and prepare calmly. At a time when the military situation has entered a major stage and the international situation is turbulent, the Chinese government is responding to both domestic and foreign affairs and has no time to rest. It must also complete the arduous project of implementing constitutional government in the next 10 months. We are willing to express our warm sympathy and, in particular, wish for complete success in advance.

### The Ministry of Finance Revises the Composition and Weight of Subsidiary Coins; Revises the Composition of One-Cent, Five-Cent, and Ten-Cent Subsidiary Coins; and Adds the Casting of Two-Cent Subsidiary Coins, Scheduled to Be Issued Tomorrow

Chongqing The Ministry of Finance has recently revised the composition and weight of one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins and added the casting of two-cent subsidiary coins, and has sent a circular telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, stating: "Subsidiary coins are a medium for small transactions, and there is a great need for them among the people. In recent years, the prices of the main raw materials for coinage have increased, and with the outbreak of the European War, the market prices of metals have increased even more, resulting in the actual value of subsidiary coins suddenly exceeding the legal value by a factor of one. The practice of hoarding and melting them for profit cannot be stopped, and they are even secretly transported to Japan to finance the enemy. In order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and prevent traitors from illegally seeking profits, it is necessary to revise the regulations on subsidiary coins and adjust the composition and weight of various subsidiary coins to facilitate circulation. A plan to revise the composition and weight of one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins has been drafted, and a two-cent subsidiary coin has been added. The plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for resolution and to the Legislative Yuan for review and action. The revised regulations on subsidiary coins have been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the principle has already been decided. It is urgent to cast and issue them in advance to facilitate turnover. In addition to instructing the Central Mint to start casting immediately and setting the date for issue as January 1, 1940, and submitting it to the Executive Yuan for record and distribution, the revised articles 2, 3, and 5 of the regulations on subsidiary coins are enclosed for your information. Please instruct your subordinates to take note of this and make a public announcement." (Yucaiyin of the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, telegram of the 30th)

### American Student Representative Broadcasts in Guiyang

Guiyang Mr. Xiao Lizhi, an American student representative, gave a broadcast in English at the Guizhou Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 28th, entitled "My Impressions of Chinese Students and Free China." He first stated that in the past 13 weeks, he had traveled to various parts of southeastern and southwestern China and visited 15 universities and dozens of middle schools. He was greatly moved by the enthusiasm and love of the youth of the new China, their diligent work, their unity and mutual assistance, and their liveliness and courage. He then stated that he traveled through eight provinces from Hubei to Chongqing and deeply felt that China's human and material resources were extremely abundant and that production and construction had made considerable progress. New bridges, new roads, new schools, and new factories could be seen everywhere, and farmers were especially diligent. The new culture of the new China has laid a solid foundation in the process of the War of Resistance. He then praised the strength of the Chinese people's recovery and said that American students and people should urgently assist in the construction of the new China in order to establish a new world order.

### The British Side Is Anxious to Solve the Tianjin Silver Problem; It Is Reported That British and Japanese Merchants Have a Solution; Cole Is Going to Chongqing to Negotiate on This Matter

London The British government announced last night that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, will leave Shanghai for Chongqing today to discuss with the Chinese authorities the solution of the British-Japanese Tianjin problem and the silver problem in the ports of North China. The British side generally believes that if the Tianjin silver problem can be solved, the Japanese side will lift the blockade of the British and French concessions. It is said that Mr. Butler, the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador, have already talked about the Tianjin silver problem on Wednesday. The Chinese side still refuses to agree to the British proposal to move the silver from the territory under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. According to news obtained by Americans here, the Anglo-Japanese agreement currently in progress will stipulate that 100,000 pounds be taken from the 800,000 pounds of silver stored in the Tianjin Bank of Communications warehouse to be used for disaster relief in North China. The use of this fund will be jointly managed by an Anglo-Japanese joint association, and the remaining funds will be deposited in a certain American bank in Tianjin, or that is, the Citibank of Tianjin. It is said that Tokyo has agreed to this plan, and the American side is now working hard to get the Chinese government to agree to this. The Anglo-Japanese agreement also includes cooperation between the British and Japanese sides in police affairs in Tianjin to maintain the tranquility of the market. (United Press, 30th)

### Sun Ke Recounts the Situation in Europe

Chongqing Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, gave a speech at a joint meeting of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement Association, and the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association on December 23. The original text of his speech was published today. The content described the negotiations among various countries before the European War, many of which have not yet been made public. Mr. Sun recounted the situation of Germany

Annexing Czechoslovakia

The development after that, Mr. Sun said, the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, at that time, proposed to convene a conference of five countries, England, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania, to resolve the situation in Eastern Europe. British Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the time was not yet ripe and suggested that the Soviet Union guarantee the independence of Poland and Romania to replace this conference.

Litvinov

He suggested that the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, jointly guarantee the peace of Europe. When he arrived in Moscow, the negotiations between the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, were beginning. This negotiation failed because England, based on Poland's attitude, rejected the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union that Soviet troops should enter Poland to give them effective guarantees against aggression.

Therefore, it failed.

The Soviet Union then raised the issue of the security guarantees of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. England insisted that the above-mentioned small countries should remain neutral, and at the same time, England further advocated that the Soviet Union should guarantee the security of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and the Soviet Union refused. The Soviet Union proposed that England and France send plenipotentiaries to Moscow for negotiations. Until the negotiations failed, the new Soviet Foreign Minister,

Molotov

He again proposed to start the staff talks between the three countries, and advocated that the two countries, England and France, should send Viscount Gort and General Gamelin to discuss various events with Voroshilov, the Soviet Defense Commissar. Unexpectedly, England and France sent other people to go there, and they did not bring proper credentials.

Arrive in Moscow

A week later, these credentials were sent by airmail. The Soviet Union was quite dissatisfied with the attitude of England and France, and concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. Sun Ke recounted the Far East, saying that when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Moscow, he did not discuss the Far East issue. As for his visit to the Soviet Union, it was in early April, when he was ordered by the government to take the northwest route to Moscow, and left Moscow in July, and went to France via Northern Europe, and returned to Moscow in mid-August, and left the Soviet Union in October, visited Italy, France, and England via the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and returned to China via Italy, Singapore, and Vietnam by plane on November 20.

### Pig Bristle Exports

Chongqing The Central Trust Bureau has been controlling the trade in pig bristles since July. According to news from the Hong Kong Office of the Bureau, China earned foreign exchange worth about 28 million yuan last year by exporting pig bristles. The United States is the main purchaser of Chinese pig bristles. In the first nine months of this year, no less than 10,590 piculs of pig bristles were exported from Hong Kong, worth 5.4 million Hong Kong dollars. Currently, Sichuan pig bristles rank first in both quality and quantity. (Reuters, 30th)

### British Newspaper Reviews the Sino-Japanese War

London Today, the Manchester Guardian published an article reviewing the situation of the Sino-Japanese war, stressing the vastness of Chinese territory, the vast distances, and the lack of important locations, and said that the Japanese army may win many victories, but it is still unknown how to win the war. The Japanese can only effectively control the land where their troops are stationed. The unity of the Chinese has been able to resist all attacks. The large army under Commander-in-Chief Chiang has not been destroyed. The Japanese side has tried every means to inflict a blow on the Chinese army to make it decisively defeated, but so far it has not won any victory that can determine the outcome. Today, fierce battles have occurred in many locations along the 1,500-mile front line, which is sufficient to show the heavy burden borne by the aggressor, who must transport all the necessary supplies for combat from overseas, and still has no hope of ending the war after more than two years of fighting.

### U.S. Groups Oppose Renewing Trade Treaty with Japan; Senator Smith Advocates Restricting Steel Exports

Washington - As the U.S. Congress is set to convene next week, private organizations in the United States have resumed their campaigns against Japanese policies. While pro-Japanese groups have also voiced their opinions, they have failed to gain public sympathy. Other groups have remained silent. The most active group opposing Japanese policies is the Committee to Oppose Encouraging Japanese Aggression, led by Stimson as chairman. The committee recently issued promotional materials stating that "90% of Japan's imported scrap iron and scrap copper, 65% of its imported kerosene, and 90% of its imported copper are supplied by the United States." The document stated, "Since the United States declared the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty, the legal obstacles to the United States stopping the supply of military goods to Japan have been removed. The United States can take action in mid-January next year, depending on whether Congress is deeply convinced that the people intend to stop the shipment of Japanese goods." The California Joint Immigration Committee, which has consistently opposed amending Japan's immigration laws, has suddenly become more active. The committee argues that if the United States enters into any agreements with Japan, it should not take advantage of any failures. (30th United Press dispatch)

Washington - Congressman Smith, a Democrat from Kansas, announced yesterday that he would introduce a bill in Congress to protect the domestic steel industry. If passed, this bill would greatly affect Japan's supply of military raw materials. Smith stated that he hopes Congress will pass a law similar to the Tin Export Control Act passed in 1936. The 1936 law prohibited the export of all tin bars except under presidential license. Although Smith's proposal does not specify which country it targets, Japan would undoubtedly be the country most affected, as U.S. scrap iron exports to Japan account for more than 50% of the total. Japan obtains approximately two million tons of scrap iron from the United States each year. (23rd United Press dispatch)

### Domestic Telegram Rates to Increase Tomorrow

The Sichuan-Guangxi highways include all truck roads in the southwestern provinces of China. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Philippine Vice President Advocates for Independence

Manila - Philippine Commonwealth Vice President Osmeña delivered a speech here yesterday during the Rizal Day celebrations, urging the Filipino people to continue striving for independence. He stated that independence is only one step away and that retreating now would be disloyal to history. However, he emphasized that the pursuit of independence should be through peaceful means. He acknowledged that unavoidable dangers will always exist and that the people cannot simply pass on their difficulties to future generations without a struggle. He argued that without confronting these challenges, the nation would become weak and incapable, unworthy of surviving through its own strength and courage. He also anticipated economic difficulties, noting that even abandoning independence would not necessarily eliminate such problems, as a nation's economic life, like an individual's, is subject to prosperity, recession, and panic. He concluded that Philippine security rests in its own hands and that if the purpose is just, they should move forward. (30th United Press dispatch)

### 150,000 Soviet Troops Reinforce, Preparing for Large-Scale Offensive; Use of Aircraft to Transport Troops Disrupts Finnish Rear Traffic; Finnish Suicide Squad Raids Murmansk Railway Line

Copenhagen - According to news from Helsinki today, the Soviet Union is currently mobilizing 150,000 Red Army troops from Siberia and the Caucasus region and deploying them in the Karelia Isthmus to the Taipale sector to break through the Mannerheim Line. Furthermore, a large number of aircraft are being concentrated in the Leningrad area to coordinate with the new forces and launch a large-scale offensive against the Mannerheim Line. (30th United Press dispatch)

Helsinki - 100,000 Soviet troops launched a fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line yesterday, continuously bombarding Finnish positions with heavy artillery throughout the day. The main Soviet force is advancing towards Viipuri, Finland's third-largest city, a major industrial area and shipping center. The Soviet offensive on the left flank of the Mannerheim Line has been ongoing for three weeks, and they have now changed their strategy, shifting the attack from Viipuri to the right flank. Soviet aircraft are transporting troops to the rear of Finnish lines at night, dropping them by parachute. These troops are dressed in Finnish uniforms and attempt to operate in the Finnish rear, destroying bridges and communication lines. The Soviet Union's application of this tactic is far more effective than that of other countries. I previously witnessed a demonstration in Moscow where 1,000 people landed simultaneously, and even small tanks were dropped using this method. The Finnish military is now paying close attention to this Soviet tactic. There are many lakes and swamps in Finland, but they are currently frozen. It is anticipated that once the weather warms and the ice melts, the Soviet Union will no longer be able to use this tactic. As far as I know, there are secret agents throughout the Finnish positions observing the actions of every citizen, and soldiers are guarding all important routes and bridges day and night. (30th United Press dispatch)

Helsinki - Several Soviet warships have been bombarding the Finnish port of Viipuri in the Gulf of Finland for days with long-range artillery. However, the shelling has stopped in the past 24 hours. In addition, while Soviet army artillery units have been shelling Finnish military positions in the Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish fortifications are extremely strong and well camouflaged, so the shells have not hit their targets. (30th Havas dispatch)

Paris - News received here today from Stockholm reports that a Finnish unit has reached the Leningrad-Murmansk railway line. The railway has been destroyed, disrupting transportation and halting the supply of food to Soviet troops. There was once a mutiny in Murmansk, and the sound of artillery behind Soviet lines led to rumors of a Soviet mutiny. (29th Reuters dispatch)

London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that if it is proven true that Finnish suicide squads broke into Soviet lines and cut off Murmansk, the northern Soviet forces will be in danger of having their supplies cut off. The Soviet supply organization is not good, and even a temporary disruption of traffic on the important railway line will cause the Soviet army to collapse and the front to disintegrate. This fragile railway line winds from Leningrad through Kandalaksha to the Arctic Ocean, and at one point is only 40 miles from the Finnish border, making it very vulnerable to attack. If this point is breached, communication between the Soviet commander and the Red Army fighting on the central and northern fronts will be impossible to maintain. Finnish leaflets dropped on Soviet lines offering rewards to Soviet deserters have been successful, so mutinies are possible in the Soviet ranks, as the Soviet army currently appears demoralized. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### Soviet Mutiny on the Finnish Northern Front; News Unconfirmed

Oslo - According to a telegram received here from Kirkenes in northern Norway, the Soviet troops who invaded the northeastern corner of Finland are still in northern Norway. Rumors of a Russian mutiny have not yet been confirmed. (30th Reuter's East Agency)

London - Semi-official news from Helsinki reports that another mutiny has broken out in the Soviet lines in the Salla district of the northern front. Soviet military aircraft were forced to bomb and strafe the troops in that area. It is said that Soviet infantry units engaged in fierce fighting with each other, and the Finnish side could hear their cries during the carnage. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm - According to news from Salla, two Soviet regiments fought each other today, each mistaking the other for Finnish troops. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### Soviet-Finnish War Report

Moscow - According to a statement released by the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, "There were no major developments on the front on the 29th, but Soviet aircraft bombed Finnish areas with great success." (30th TASS dispatch)

Helsinki - The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating, "Soviet troops launched another attack on our forces at the northern end of the Karelian Isthmus on the 28th of this month and were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with a total of five tanks destroyed." (3rd Havas dispatch)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare to Issue Warnings to the Three Nordic Countries, Forcing Them to Cease Assistance to Finland, Otherwise, They Will Be Considered to Have Violated Neutrality

The Hague - The German and Soviet governments are currently intensifying pressure on the Scandinavian countries in the hope of preventing them from assisting Finland. It is reported that the German government will also issue warnings to these countries in the near future, threatening them to refuse to join the plans formulated by Western European countries. However, the general public in Germany doubts whether this move will be effective. (29th Havas dispatch)

Stockholm - There is a general impression in Berlin that Germany and the Soviet Union have exchanged views on the conditions for controlling the advance to the north. The Stockholm Daily News states that we expect Germany and the Soviet Union to fully cooperate, and this statement is not far from the truth. The two sides have agreed that the Scandinavian countries cannot be a route for aid to Finland; otherwise, they will be considered to have abandoned their neutrality. In summary, the current environment is that the form of aid to Finland from the peninsula will be the standard by which Germany and the Soviet Union determine whether the peninsula countries have violated neutrality. It is expected that German and Soviet accusations of the peninsula countries violating neutrality will be forthcoming soon. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### President Roosevelt Devotes Himself to World Peace, Welcoming Leaders of All Religions to Join Forces, Congress to Reconvene Next Month and Deliver a Speech

Washington - President Roosevelt stated today that he would welcome any religious leader willing to discuss efforts to bring about world peace at the White House. He hopes that religious leaders will come to meet with him to discuss any peace plans they may have in mind. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Washington - Political figures here are now paying close attention to President Roosevelt's speech to be delivered to Congress on January 3, as the speech will be read by Roosevelt himself and will review the international situation. All members of both houses of Congress will be present, and Roosevelt will announce the U.S. government's budget for 1940 for the first time in his speech. Therefore, the Washington political circles are expressing keen anticipation and attention to the declaration. (30th Reuter's East Agency)

### Rumors of Mussolini Visiting the Pope, Italian Official Statement Denies It

Rome - Reuter's East Agency reporters have learned from well-informed sources that the rumors of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini visiting the Vatican have been officially denied. Although Italian newspapers reported that the Pope, in his capacity as "Head of State," reciprocated the visit of King Victor Emmanuel III, he was not received with full diplomatic honors. When Pius XII entered the palace, only Foreign Minister Ciano, the Italian ambassador to the Vatican, Alieri, and senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assisted in the reception. Prime Minister Mussolini was not present. The Pope's visit to the King was meant to show the harmonious relationship between Italy and the Vatican. The absence of the Prime Minister at the event has led to speculation that the Prime Minister will visit the Vatican in his capacity as Fascist Leader to reaffirm the harmonious relationship between Italy and the Vatican. However, well-informed sources have confirmed that this is not true, and there is no such rumor from the Vatican either. (30th Reuter's East Agency)

### Diplomatic Activity Between Rome and Berlin Related to Mediating Peace, German Ambassador to Italy Returns Home for Consultation

Copenhagen - A political correspondent for a newspaper in Berlin reports that diplomatic activity between Berlin and Rome has been quite active recently, which is related to the Pope's speech before Christmas, which condemned violent policies and listed various major principles for establishing a just peace. From Berlin's perspective, the Pope and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are trying their best to prevent the current war from expanding, and to prevent Bolshevism from continuing to expand its power. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has encountered fierce resistance from Finland, and on the other hand, it intends to demand naval bases on the Black Sea coast from Romania, which may be forced to negotiate with it. It can be seen that the crisis posed by Bolshevism is very real. In addition, Archbishop Orsenigo, the Vatican ambassador to Germany, has continued to make contact with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently, as many as six times in a week. Observers in Berlin believe that this matter should be compared with the mutual visits between the Italian King and the Pope, and it is expected that Archbishop Orsenigo may not have made any practical peace proposals to the German government, but rather exchanged opinions to find a basis for mediating peace if necessary. (30th Havas dispatch)

Rome - The German ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, returned home this afternoon for consultation. (29th Havas dispatch)

### Large Numbers of German Army Complete Training Next Spring, Can Be Formed into 240 Divisions, Anticipated Offensive on the Western Front

London - A correspondent for the "News Chronicle" in Amsterdam reports that, according to reliable sources from neutral countries in Berlin, Germany hopes to have 5 million trained or partially trained people enlisted by next spring. According to the current organization, the above number can be formed into about 240 divisions. It is heard that after the training camps, instructors, and weapons are all prepared, they plan to continue to recruit 1 to 2 million people. Neutral observers in Berlin believe that the German side may not be able to provide sufficient equipment for this second batch of recruits. The age of most of these soldiers is close to middle age. However, there is good reason to believe that the lightest and medium-sized weapons and tanks needed for the above 240 divisions can be fully equipped after the military training is completed. Fifty of these divisions will need to be used to defend the German border and maintain order in the conquered areas, with 40 divisions needed in Poland alone. When these 240 divisions are trained, the number of German troops will almost double, because when the war broke out, the total number of German troops was about 2.9 million. Neutral observers further predict that Hitler intends to launch a huge land offensive in the spring. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### British Warship Hit by Torpedo, Only Suffered Minor Damage

London - An official announcement stated that the British warship attacked by a German submarine with a torpedo on Thursday afternoon has now sailed to a port on its own and has not suffered heavy damage. However, in addition to the one missing person who has been reported as likely dead and the one seriously injured, it is believed that the missing person must have died, so the loss suffered by the ship's crew is a total of four missing and one seriously injured. (29th Reuters dispatch)

London - The Admiralty recently announced that one of our "Queen Elizabeth" class battleships was attacked yesterday by a torpedo fired by an enemy submarine, but the damage was very minor and it was still able to proceed as normal. It is reported that in addition to the "Elizabeth," there are also the "Valiant," "Warspite," "Barham," and "Malaya," which were built between 1912 and 1915 and were renovated separately before 1933. Each of these ships has a displacement of 31,000 tons and is equipped with eight 14-inch guns, eight 6- to 12-inch guns, and even twelve guns. Since the outbreak of the war, two British warships have been sunk by the Germans: the battleship "Royal Oak" and the aircraft carrier "Courageous." They still have fourteen battleships, three of which are being renovated. In addition, there are nine more that have already begun construction or are being prepared, two of which can be completed within the coming year. (30th Havas dispatch)

London - A Reuters naval correspondent said that the fact that a British warship was hit by a torpedo but suffered only minor damage has aroused much speculation. In the last war, large warships were often equipped with steel wire torpedo nets, but they were abandoned because they were ineffective in wartime and were replaced with ship protectors. This is placed on the side of the ship, so that the torpedo can only explode outside the actual hull, and the extent of the damage is only to reduce the speed of the warship by one nautical mile. This is obviously an important means of defense against torpedoes and avoids damage to important parts of the warship. Since the last European war, this ship protector has made great progress. All warships equipped with this can resist repeated attacks by torpedoes. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### French Military Position Greatly Strengthened

Paris - According to observers here, France's position at the end of 1939 is far stronger than it was a year ago. From a military point of view, the situation has improved greatly in the past four months. The Maginot Line is no longer just a defensive line, but has become a great fortress line. In front of the original fortress line are now densely packed field fortresses, barbed wire, concrete bunkers, tank traps, and artillery positions. Currently, about one million people are employed in factories manufacturing the latest weapons, especially the most advanced weapons for aerial combat. In the shipyards, they are currently engaged in the construction of three 35,000-ton battleships. As for gold reserves and foreign exchange, they have also increased significantly compared to the start of the war due to a greater recovery of funds. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Second Meeting Between Soviet and Japanese Officials Discusses Trade Issues, Both Sides Exchange Lists of Products for Rotation

Tokyo - According to reliable sources, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, met with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mikoyan, yesterday and exchanged lists of goods that both sides could export when the Soviet Union and Japan establish trade in the future. This is a solid step forward in the path of establishing trade between the two countries. In addition, regarding the fishery issue, Ambassador Togo has already received new instructions issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the two sides can establish an agreement in a short period of time. The Soviet government requested Japan on the 27th of this month to pay off the final installment of the China Eastern Railway as a prerequisite for negotiating a fishery agreement. It is heard that the Japanese side is prepared to give a satisfactory reply. If so, then this long-pending issue of the China Eastern Railway can also be resolved incidentally. The current fishery agreement will expire on the evening of the 31st of this month. Therefore, Ambassador Togo may meet with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov today, and at least demand that the Soviet government establish a "temporary measure" with Japan. However, even if the two countries enter into a state of non-agreement, the relationship between the two sides has greatly improved recently, so a formal agreement should not be difficult to sign within a few weeks, that is, before the start of the fishing season next spring. (30th Havas dispatch)

Moscow - Ambassador Togo met with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mikoyan, at 6 p.m. on the 29th for the second meeting to discuss specific matters regarding the issue of trade between Japan and the Soviet Union. (29th Nichi Domei dispatch)

Tokyo - Newspapers reported that the Japanese authorities urgently issued instructions to the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, to propose new conditions to the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, so that at least a temporary fishery agreement could be concluded before the expiration of the current fishery agreement at the end of the year. The Asahi Shimbun said that there is little possibility that these negotiations will be completed this year, but the current Soviet-Japanese relationship is much more satisfactory than at the end of last year, and it is expected that the temporary state of non-agreement will cause little damage. It is heard that the Soviet Trade Commissioner Mikoyan exchanged a list of commodities that the Soviet Union and Japan hope to export to each other with Togo yesterday to prepare for the proposed trade negotiations. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Dutch Authorities Crack Down on German Espionage Case

Several German Residents Expelled

The Hague - The authorities of Batavia, the capital of Java, Dutch East Indies, recently cracked down on a German espionage case, and several German residents have been deported by the authorities. In addition, a certain editor of the "Min Sheng Bao" in the port, who wrote an article accusing immigration officials of facilitating German espionage, has been investigated by the authorities and found to be inaccurate, and he will be prosecuted on charges of defamation.

### British Government's "Blue Book" Sells Well, Describes the Course of the Outbreak of War

London - After the outbreak of the European War, the British government compiled a "Blue Book" compiling various official documents describing the course of the outbreak of the war. All records related to the relationship between Germany and Poland, as well as the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Germany in August of this year, were published. The book has a total of 230 pages and sells for one shilling per copy. It has sold 300,000 copies in the three months since its release, and continues to sell at a rate of 5,000 copies per day. (29th Havas dispatch)

### Since the Outbreak of the European War, British Air Force Achievements: Escorting Merchant Ships Repeatedly Proves Successful, 58 German Aircraft Destroyed

London – Today, reliable sources have released figures indicating the achievements of the British Air Force in the four months since the outbreak of the war. According to these figures, as of Christmas Day, the British Coastal Air Force has flown 3.75 million miles in 44,000 flight hours. The distance flown each day is greater than the Earth's circumference. The British Air Force has spotted German submarines 107 times and attacked them 57 times. The British Air Force has provided 400 escort missions for group transport ships. Bomber squadrons have flown in formation over German skies 27 times. A total of 90 German aircraft attempting to fly over the British coast or operate in British territorial waters, 23 of which were destroyed by British aircraft, and 3 shot down by British anti-aircraft guns. Since the outbreak of the war, the British have destroyed a total of 58 German aircraft, 51 of which were the result of aerial combat between British aircraft and the enemy. Of the remaining seven, all but one were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns. From the Arctic Circle to the Bay of Biscay in Spain, the Coastal Air Force is responsible for escorting merchant convoys and patrolling around the British Isles to defend against submarines. The significant achievements of the Coastal Air Force also include locating the American ship "Flint City" after 27 hours of flight and rescuing the entire crew of the merchant ship "Campsie." In the first night after the outbreak of the war, British bomber squadrons flew over the industrial areas of northern Germany, dropping 4.25 million leaflets. Since then, they have repeatedly flown to major cities such as Berlin and Potsdam, dropping tens of millions of leaflets without encountering significant enemy resistance. The distribution of these leaflets is of great value, as it shows the German people the truth. The Germans have not yet launched large-scale aerial offensives, so the British fighter squadrons responsible for defending Britain have not had as many achievements as the Coastal Air Force and bomber squadrons. However, small-scale German air raids have all been defeated by British fighter aircraft, so they are in high spirits and eager to try. Before the outbreak of hostilities, the air force staffs of Britain and France held frequent meetings to determine the steps for cooperation between the two countries' air forces. Therefore, within a few days of the outbreak of the war, British bomber squadrons and fighter squadrons were established in French territory. The cooperation between British fighter aircraft and French aircraft has made it difficult for German aircraft to take films over the Maginot Line. British fighter aircraft are also very effective in protecting French ports, so the transportation of the British Expeditionary Force was completed safely and without any enemy interference.

### German Merchant Ships Attempt to Break Blockade: One Intercepted by British Warship

Buenos Aires, Argentina – According to news received by today's newspapers, the German merchant ship "Bahia Blanca" (8,558 tons), fully loaded with coffee and minerals, sailed from here last week, hoping to reach Germany. While attempting to break the blockade line, it was captured by a British cruiser. Yesterday, a British cruiser and several other warships entered the port to replenish supplies. According to the "Volksblatt", when the British warship entered the port, another British warship was docked next to the "Bahia Blanca" to prevent its escape. (Reuters, 29th) Mexico City – The Hamburg-America Line ship "Orinoco" (10,000 tons), currently sheltering in Tampico, is preparing to sail overseas as soon as possible. It has been equipped with a large amount of food and fuel to meet the needs of a long voyage. It is widely believed that the German ship intends to secretly sail out around January 8th. (Reuters, 29th)

### National Mobilization in the Netherlands to Build Defenses

Amsterdam – The Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch Army and Navy yesterday issued an order jointly with the administrative authorities, stipulating that all Dutch citizens between the ages of 18 and 59 must perform the duty of building national defense projects for the military authorities. The required construction of national defense projects includes repairing roads and houses, setting up obstacles, and other military engineering works. Anyone attempting to evade this duty will be sentenced to three months of imprisonment. (Haitong, 30th)

### A Review of the Far Eastern War Situation in One Year: Japan's Strategy Gradually Turns to Passivity

—Observations from the Manila Daily Bulletin—

Manila – The Manila Daily Bulletin today reviewed the events of the past year in the Far East, acknowledging that "China's resistance has not slackened at all during this year. Not only that, but in fact, the Chinese have developed a sense of self-confidence no different from that of soldiers. In other words, they are willing to unanimously support the resistance until Japan's national power is exhausted. The biggest event of 1939, in the eyes of both China and Japan, is that Japan's war against China has gradually shifted from a strategy of conquering China to a strategy of coping with Chinese resistance. However, in terms of trade, it has been beneficial to Japan. Although Japan's expenditures are still huge and its revenues are still low, its monthly deficit is not as large as in 1938. The reason for this is that Japan's aggressive ambitions are not as strong as in the past, and the power of trade has begun to recover, but the benefits are still negligible, only slightly better than the losses of a year ago." (United Press, 30th)

### British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Meets with Potemkin, Will Soon Take Vacation

### Southern Ireland Will Use Harsh Measures Against Rioters, Temporary Parliament Convened on January 3rd, Firearms Stolen in Dublin Recovered

Dublin – The Southern Irish government will convene a temporary parliament next Wednesday, the 3rd, to give the government greater power to deal with the activities of the Irish Republican Army. It is expected that legislation will be introduced at the meeting to allow the authorities to detain prisoners for long periods without trial. Detention centers will be established in various places. About one-third, or six tons, of the ammunition stolen by the Republicans from the Phoenix Park arsenal some days ago has been recovered. (Reuters, 29th)

London – After the theft of the Phoenix Park armory in Dublin, intensive searches by the military and police resulted in the recovery of one-third of the stolen ammunition. The Southern Irish House of Representatives has scheduled a temporary meeting for January 3rd to pass legislation granting full powers to the Executive Yuan to strictly suppress rebellious activities. According to informed political sources, this bill will likely stipulate that the Executive Yuan may at any time indefinitely detain suspected terrorists or suspicious individuals without going through legal proceedings. (Havas, 30th)

London – The House of Representatives of the Republic of Ireland is scheduled to convene a temporary meeting on January 3rd of the coming year to discuss the necessary measures to prevent various rebellious activities. According to political sources, the House of Representatives may authorize the government to establish detention camps to detain terrorists and may detain them indefinitely before handing them over to the courts for legal punishment. In addition, one-third of a batch of firearms stolen from the Phoenix Park armory in Dublin has been recovered. (Havas, 29th)

London – After a group of rioters stole a batch of military equipment and ammunition from Phoenix Park in Dublin, Southern Ireland, on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, military and police authorities immediately conducted a major search around the city. It is now known that 80,000 rounds of ammunition have been recovered this morning (the stolen ammunition totaled one million rounds), but the city is still surrounded by military and police, fearing that these rioters may secretly transport some of the military equipment and ammunition to Northern Ireland. In addition, it is widely rumored that the House of Representatives of the Republic will convene a temporary meeting to formulate various special bills to cope with the situation. (Havas, 29th)

Dublin – Major searches by military and police are still underway in Dublin and surrounding areas. It is now believed that the total amount of military equipment stolen by the Republicans from a military depot on Sunday is no less than 28 tons, totaling 1.25 million rounds of ammunition, packed in 700 boxes. Only 85 boxes have been recovered to date. It is estimated that at least 13 trucks were used to transport the stolen military equipment at the time. The authorities are currently conducting a very thorough search. Because the boxes containing this ammunition are waterproof, it is feared that the thieves have thrown them into the water, so they are currently searching the rivers around Dublin. Despite days of exhaustive searching, no further discoveries have been made. Although a reward of 1,000 pounds has been offered for information, no one has responded. When the Senate and House of Representatives hold a special meeting next week, they will pass legislation to cope with the overall situation, strengthen criminal law, and give the government full power to deal with suspects. Prisons and military police are now preparing for a major arrest of suspects. Last night, police searched a secret radio station and arrested four people in a room. (Reuters, 30th)

### Quiet on the Western Front

Paris – This city's communiqué today stated, "Aerial activity has resumed on the Western Front. There have been minor skirmishes with French forward units. Reconnaissance patrols ambushed enemy patrols in the Vosges (a border region in eastern France), capturing several German soldiers." (Reuters, 29th)

### French New Budget Officially Established

Paris – The budget for the year 1940 (excluding military spending) was recently passed by the House of Representatives with 525 votes, unanimously. Revenues are estimated at 79,246,000,000 francs, and expenditures are estimated at 78,919,000,000,000 francs, leaving a surplus of 327,000,000 francs. According to the budget passed by the House of Representatives some days ago, revenues and expenditures were estimated to be short by 15,000,000 francs. The Senate then made the above adjustments and sent it back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. The House of Representatives has now approved it, thereby confirming its establishment. (Havas, 30th)

### Turkish Government Handling Earthquake Relief, Earthquake Force Strong, Difficult to Recover for a While, Disaster No Less Than the Great Earthquake in Japan

Istanbul – According to current estimates, the number of dead and injured in the Turkish earthquake is at least 30,000. The area most severely affected covers 60,000 square miles, resembling a vast open-air hospital and cemetery. The director of the Istanbul Observatory has warned that there may be another earthquake within the next ten days or longer and stated that the severity of this earthquake indicates geological phenomena 16 miles deep, so it will take a long time to stabilize. The exact situation of this catastrophe cannot yet be estimated because railway tracks are twisted, bridges are collapsed, power lines are cut, and severe wind and snow have made roads icy, hindering reports of deaths and injuries and preventing rescue teams from reaching the disaster areas in urgent need of rescue. The entire Turkish nation is deeply saddened by the news of tens of thousands of deaths and injuries. (Reuters, 29th)

Ankara – According to an official gazette issued by the Turkish government last night, the recent earthquake in Anatolia resulted in more than 20,000 deaths. The most severely affected area was near the city of Erzincan, which suffered a major earthquake in 1784 that completely destroyed it. This tragedy has now been repeated, with 70 percent of the city's population killed. Other severely affected areas include Sivas (population 70,000), Amasya (population 70,000), Kangal (population 20,000), and Pulumur (population 15,000). Tens of thousands of people in the disaster area, after the earthquake and fires, are mostly without clothing and food, crying for help. In addition, trains have been destroyed, and transportation has been cut off. Countless people are dying of famine rather than the earthquake. The Turkish government has now appointed General Orbay as the chairman of the relief committee to actively handle relief efforts. (Haitong, 30th)

Ankara – Local geological experts here claim that this earthquake in Anatolia, Turkey, is the largest earthquake in the world since the great earthquake in Japan in 1923. The result of the 1923 Japanese earthquake was the loss of 200,000 lives. The number already confirmed in this case is over 20,000. The exact number will be known only after the official investigation committee has investigated the matter. (Haitong, 30th)

Ankara – Due to the continuous efforts of the government, transportation with the various disaster areas affected by the recent earthquake has been restored. The various disaster areas are calling for urgent relief. It is said that the current climate is extremely cold, with wind and snow, and many victims are homeless, sleeping outdoors, a truly pitiful sight. A large number of people across the country are voluntarily joining the rescue work and donating money for relief. The Balkan countries have expressed deep sympathy for this major earthquake disaster. The Romanian government has ordered the transportation of building materials worth £10,000 to the disaster area to rebuild destroyed houses. The Bulgarian government has also ordered the transportation of goods and building materials worth £5,000 to Turkey. The King of Greece sent a telegram to the Turkish President in a personal capacity to express his condolences. The Greek Red Cross has telegraphed to the Turkish side, intending to send a fully equipped rescue team to Turkey. At the same time, the Greek government has instructed its ambassador to Turkey to pay 10,000 Turkish lire as the first batch of relief funds. In Athens, Major General Williamson, commander of the British garrison in Egypt, is cooperating with Prince Ali, chairman of the Turkish Earthquake Relief Committee, to transport 20 large army tents to Anatolia and donate £100 of relief funds in the name of the British army.

### The Living Conditions of the Yi People in the Sichuan-Xikang Border Region: United in the Deep Mountains, Estimated to Number Over Five Million

Chengdu Correspondence: Ke Xiangfeng, Dean of Academic Affairs and Head of the Sociology Department at Jinling University, went to various counties in southwestern Sichuan to investigate the actual social life of the Yi people in the Greater Liang Mountains. His travels took him to places like Meishan, Emei, Longchi, Shaping, Ebian, and Mabian, collecting a wealth of materials and specimens. According to Ke's account, the actual living conditions of the Yi people in the southwestern border region of Sichuan Province are as follows:

The Yi people, commonly known as the "Yi tribes," are scattered in the southwestern Sichuan provinces of Leibo, Ebian, Pingshan, Qianwei, and Xikang's Xichang, Yuexi, Zhaojue, Yanyuan, Huili, Dechang, and Mianning counties. Due to their backward culture and lack of communication with the outside world, the exact number scattered is about 5 million. According to local estimates, there are at least one million Yi people in the Sichuan-Xikang area. The Yi people can be further divided into two types: the Black Yi, who have the lowest level of culture, and the White Yi, who are mostly uncivilized Han Chinese with a slightly higher culture than the Black Yi.

The Black Yi's food supply is limited. Because the area they inhabit is mostly high mountains and valleys, they can only grow corn, which is not suitable for growing rice and wheat. Therefore, corn is their main food source. Some grow buckwheat, but the quantity is very small. Rice cultivation is rare. Secondary foods include potatoes, beans, and vegetables. Meat is mainly pork and mutton, with beef, chicken, and wild game as supplements. They eat two meals a day, breakfast around eight or nine in the morning, and dinner in the evening. Because they do not yet use oil lamps, there is no light in the dark night, so they go to bed immediately after dinner, which has become a habit. In terms of clothing, they mainly use woolen fabrics. Men often use white wool shawls to wrap their entire bodies, regardless of the cold or warmth. The shawls come in white, blue, and red colors. Women do not wear trousers, only skirts. The upper garment is fastened on the left, retaining an ancient style. It is also made of wool and is not changed with the seasons, making it difficult to bear the smell of wool. Living conditions are also very simple. They use earth for walls and tree bark for tiles, barely sheltering them from wind and rain. Some use bamboo curtains for walls. Sleeping on the ground has become a habit.

The tribe's marriage customs are very strange. The marriage process begins with an introduction by a matchmaker. Naturally, bamboo doors are matched with bamboo doors, and wooden doors with wooden doors. After permission from both sets of parents, the engagement takes place. Engagement gifts are mainly livestock. The wealthier have more livestock, while the poorer give only a few pigs and sheep. On the eve of the wedding, relatives from both families gather. The groom's family sends a representative to the bride's home to carry the bride back. When this representative arrives at the bride's home, the whole family holds basins and bowls full of cold water and throws them at him. Although the representative becomes a soaked chicken, he is not allowed to enter the door. Finally, the people throwing water smear his face with ash, turning him into a "painted-face general" before he is allowed to enter. That night, the bride's guests drink heavily and eat bean dregs voraciously. After drinking, they sing and dance wildly. When they sing sad songs of separation, they cry loudly when they feel sad. The representative then carries the bride away at dawn. The groom's family also has a banquet and celebration that night. However, the bride returns to her family with the groom that day. After two or three years, the bride returns to the groom's home and begins their cohabitation life. It is not incorrect to call the groom her nominal husband.

They do not have a formal organization and seem to be a kind of clan system. The clan chief is called the "Black Bone," who has the power to control the entire clan, like an ancient chieftain. They also have their own writing, which is similar in shape to Tibetan writing, but the pronunciation is very different. When the clan chief issues orders, he writes the entire text on a wooden board and distributes it to each household. They also have regular markets where they trade with each other, often exchanging cowhide, sheepskin, medicinal herbs, livestock, wild animals, and honey for salt and cloth from the Han Chinese area. Salt is their prized food and is only served to honored guests. They have silversmiths, coppersmiths, and blacksmiths who can make crude metal ornaments. They have no schools, and their intelligence is undeveloped. They lack national and ethnic consciousness, which is regrettable.

Although they are in an uncivilized era and isolated from intermarriage with the outside world, making it difficult to influence them, they are physically strong, fiercely tempered, and possess a strong sense of solidarity. When they fight with other tribes, even if there are new grievances and old grudges, they eliminate their prejudices and unite against outsiders. Therefore, the Yi people have been able to exist until now, and their population continues to grow. If they can be trained, instilled with patriotic knowledge, and organized into an army, they could become a strong force in the fight against the enemy.

Jiangyin Correspondence: The Japanese troops originally stationed in Qiaoji, Lujiabao, Beiguo Changshou, and Qingyang and Nanzha along the Wuxi-Jiangyin line, belonging to the county, numbered twenty or thirty, or fifty or sixty, and were mixed with puppet troops. Now, the Japanese and puppet forces claim that the Jiangyin puppet county government requires more than 10,000 yuan per month in expenses, but there is no income. They want to levy land tax, but in reality, it is impossible. A few days ago, the Japanese suddenly brought six or seven hundred new troops from Taiwan, claiming to the outside world that a division would arrive and be stationed in schools and the Tianhou Temple and Huangni Nunnery outside the city. Their purpose is to station troops in the southeastern villages and forcibly levy land tax. Yunting had no Japanese troops. Dozens were also sent there the day before yesterday. The Chinese guerrillas, upon hearing the news, were prepared. If the Japanese troops arrive in the southeastern villages, they will launch a large-scale attack.

### Jiaxing Yitong Army Reorganized into Water Police

Jiang Shuwei Appointed Captain

Yuyao Correspondence: Jiang Shuwei, the commander of the Jiaxing People's Volunteer Army, repeatedly annihilated Japanese troops in Hejiao and Haiyan, achieving repeated successes. He was subsequently accused to the Provincial Governor by a certain officer stationed in Hejiao. The military authorities of Zhejiang Province, based on the report, and to clarify the actual situation, ordered the unit to be transferred to the province for training. After Jiang received the order, he led all the officers and soldiers across the Qiantang River to Xxx, a place in this county, to carry out training. The Zhejiang authorities also sent people to investigate Jiang's actions to see if they matched the allegations. After six months, the results showed that the allegations were completely unfounded. Therefore, in addition to issuing a commendation, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities formally reorganized Jiang's unit into a water police brigade and appointed Jiang as the captain. Jiang immediately instructed his subordinates to obey and drew up various water area pacification work and methods for protecting aquatic products, which will be submitted to the authorities for approval and implementation.

### Educational Personnel Appointed Township and Village Chiefs, Teachers' Colleges Temporarily Allowed to Accept Students with Equivalent Qualifications

(Chengdu Aviation News) The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to implement the new county system, which requires educational personnel to serve as township and village chiefs, issued an order to all city and county governments and teachers' colleges to make appropriate changes when recruiting new students next year to cultivate grassroots cadres for the new county system.

In order to cultivate these key education personnel, we have telegraphed the Ministry of Education to temporarily allow teachers' colleges to accept 15% of students with equivalent qualifications and raise the age of admission to 25. The Ministry of Education telegraphed back that the method of teachers' colleges recruiting students with equivalent qualifications should be approved, and those over 18 years of age with one year of experience as elementary school teachers may be recruited. In order to cultivate key education personnel for the new county system in the province, a one-year short-term normal school course should be widely recruited to meet the needs. The above should be obeyed and reported accordingly. This order is issued for notification and compliance.

### New and Old Directors of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Scheduled to Take Office on New Year's Day

(Xinghua Correspondence) The Central Government approved the resignation of Han Deqin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, and appointed Ma Yuanfang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, to succeed him. Jin Zonghua was appointed by the Executive Yuan to fill the vacancy left by the Director of the Department of Education. However, due to various reasons, Jin was slow to take over. All departmental affairs are still being reluctantly managed by Ma. After repeated urging, Jin finally decided to take over on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic. Ma, who had repeatedly resigned from the Party Headquarters, had not been approved by the Central Government, so he will also take over the Provincial Party Headquarters in Xinghua on New Year's Day. Ma and Jin are currently planning all the work for the 29th year in Xinghua.

East China has recently had bad luck, suffering repeated defeats. Guest player Luo Douwen has already left Shanghai, and main player Dai Jing is suffering from illness. Cai Shengsen has been suspended. Furthermore, today coincides with the bank's year-end closing, and Zhuang Jia will not be able to attend. Therefore, the arrangement of the lineup is truly a lament of lacking talent. Half of the eleven players are from the reserve team. However, this is giving newcomers a good opportunity. If they fight with all their might, there may be hope of defeating the enemy. In Group C, Hwa team will face Tung Wen; Hwa's lineup is strong, and it will surely inflict a painful defeat on Tung Wen. The order for today is as follows: West Police - East China Association (A) 10:30 AM Yiyuan Park North; West Children - Larks (A) 3:00 PM Racecourse; West Fords - East China (Reserve) 3:00 PM Jiaozhou Park; Youyou - Tung Wen (C) 3:15 PM Jiaozhou Park.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Shorting Near, Holding Distant; Foreign Exchange Swap Slightly Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the informal market for British and American exchange, due to Saturday being a half-day trading day, and the upcoming three-day New Year's holiday, including today, Sunday, there was a total of four days off. Moreover, overseas markets in Britain, America, Hong Kong, and other places are also closed today and tomorrow. Therefore, the spot market on the day was very quiet, with mediocre trading. The trend continued to be slightly tight and soft. However, the futures potential was affected by swaps, fluctuating wildly. Initially, due to the Chinese banks posting swaps, from US$2.1875 to 2.25, the monthly interest rate was 2.89% for the former and 3.33% for the latter. Later, wealthy Chinese merchants, seeing the high interest rates, came to short near and hold distant, posting bids. Furthermore, Hong Kong Electric, due to its short positions for this month, also posted bids, reversing the small step up. By the close, the British gold was only 0.03125, and the US exchange was only 0.09375, with the monthly interest rate being 1%. In half a day, the opening was even, followed by a slight bid by Hong Kong Electric, but without impact. Subsequently, Chinese merchants slightly shortened the distant months, and there were also some scattered settlements. In addition, Advantageous and Jardine also bought in, gradually tightening the market. At that time, the British gold was 4/65625, and the US exchange was 7.625 yuan. Afterwards, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and the situation stagnated before closing, with the British gold still at 4/65625, and the US exchange at 7.65625 yuan. As a result, it was slightly tighter by 0.03125 than the previous day. The futures market moved in the opposite direction to the spot market, resulting in the British gold actually loosening by 0.0625, and the US exchange also hardening by 0.09375.

Hong Kong Short Accounts Also Posting In

Early morning, London large bars saw near and distant terms shrink by 1.875. New York silver prices remained even, and London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates were even for British to American and British to French, and down 0.0625 for British to Shanghai. American to British increased by 0.025, to French increased largely by 0.075, and to Shanghai decreased slightly by 0.005. Central listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 4/6875 for British gold and 7.6875 yuan for US exchange, with no changes from the previous close. After opening, Hong Kong Electric released slightly, but it had little impact on the market. However, swap trading was thriving. Chinese banks successively posted US$1.2875 and 2.25, with monthly interest rates (excluding commissions) of 2.89% and 3.33%, mostly posted in by foreign firms such as Jardine and Advantageous. When HSBC's listing was announced unchanged, the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.0125. Afterwards, due to foreign firms slightly settling accounts, and Chinese merchants also buying distant month US exchange, along with Advantageous and Jardine slightly buying in, the situation slightly tightened and softened. At that time, it shrank to 4/65625 and 7.625 yuan. At this time, short accounts from Hong Kong suddenly posted in, and wealthy Chinese merchants also posted in, with those posting out having disappeared. The swap therefore tightened. Among them, Hong Kong Electric would post in for US$1.25, with a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of 1.62%. At noon, the spot situation was slightly even. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was quoted at 4/65625 for British gold and 7.65625 yuan for US exchange. Next month's futures were 4/625 for British gold and 7.5625 yuan for US exchange. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British and US exchange softened by 0.03125 each, and January futures British gold loosened by 0.0625, while US exchange hardened by 0.09375. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong British Tight, American Unchanged

Hong Kong, 30th (telegram). The exchange market opened steadily this morning, with no change in British or American exchange. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by one yuan (yesterday's close was 317 yuan), to 316 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot rate loosened by 0.025, to 104.25 yuan. At 10:30, there was a softening appearance. The British exchange spot rate shrank by 0.03125, to 1 shilling 2 pence 9375. The distant term remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange spot rate rose by three yuan, to 319 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot rate returned to tighten by 0.025, still at 104 yuan. At 11:30, it was even. Finally, the British exchange spot rate remained unchanged, and the distant term tightened by 0.03125, to 1 shilling 2 pence 90625. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell back down by one yuan, to 318 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Tianjin Exchange Rates Continue to Tighten

Tianjin, 30th (telegram). The exchange market opened firm this morning, with the market slightly tighter and softer than yesterday's opening. British and American exchange spot rates shrank by 0.125 each, with the British exchange at 4/5625, and the US exchange at 7.5 yuan. The Shanghai exchange remained unchanged, still opening at 103 yuan. The Lian banknote informal market was cheapened by one yuan, to 94 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Firm

Yesterday, the trading of British and American gold pounds was not active, and it was the end of the year, so closures were pending, and the market price remained firm without change. British and American gold notes were in considerable demand, and the market situation was quite good. British gold notes rose to 47 yuan, and American gold notes rose to 13.13 yuan. The market situation continued to be good in the afternoon. In the evening market, American gold notes rose to 13.16 yuan. The demand for Hong Kong notes was also brisk, and the market price was firm and high. Canadian notes followed the rise of American notes, closely stepping up. The demand for Japanese gold notes was rare, and the market situation was weak. The evening market was 1.268 yuan. Korean notes were also weak, with the evening market at 1.11 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes rise by 0.25 yuan, American gold notes rise by 0.08 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01 yuan, Canadian notes rise by 0.10 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### High Prices Induce Selling: Gold Prices Rise Before Falling

Yesterday's informal market situation for raw gold was barely satisfactory. According to the potential of the previous day and the tightening of today's exchange market, a continued rise of dozens of yuan would not be unexpected. Unexpectedly, the result was a slight drop of three yuan. The reason is that the next three days are the New Year's holiday, including today, Sunday, for a total of four days off, causing general speculative longs to be extremely willing to close out with thin profits. Furthermore, the appetite of Hong Kong firms was weak. Although a certain foreign bank secretly bought more than 2,000 taels, the supply and demand were still difficult to match. However, the morning opening inherited the momentum of the previous day, rising again by 12 yuan, to 4,170 yuan. Although it once fell back, a certain money exchange suddenly searched fiercely on behalf of a foreign firm. At the same time, a certain bank also followed up, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft, so it once pulled up, reaching 4,185 yuan. Unexpectedly, the high price induced selling. The money exchange was the first to come out, followed by the securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops, all competing to release. Until before the noon close, it had retreated to a low price of 4,150 yuan. The result was a closing price of 4,155 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, and the trend outside the market turned stable, and 4,160 yuan was still difficult to buy in. It was heard that sellers needed to ask for another 10 yuan. Transactions were rarely heard. The morning's transactions reached over 3,000 taels. Silver shop ornaments remained unchanged, and customs gold remained even.

Raw Gold Falls Three Yuan

Since the early morning, the initial opening was good, although the initial opening exchange was even. The market opened and immediately rose by 12 yuan, with securities firms buying 20 taels of gold, at 4,170 yuan. Shortly after, another securities firm and gold shop sold, immediately pressing down by slightly less than 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange, at 4,160 yuan. Afterwards, a certain money exchange suddenly showed a strong appetite, and a certain bank also bought in on behalf of customers, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft, so although securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops all had intentions to supply, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, and were raised by 25 yuan. The money exchange bought 20 taels from a silver shop, at 4,185 yuan. Subsequently, buyers' appetites were satisfied, and another money exchange suddenly closed out on behalf of its firm for profit, soon falling back by 20 yuan. The money exchange sold 30 taels to a securities firm, at 4,165 yuan. Afterwards, gold shops and others bought in at low prices, raising it again by 10 yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange, at 4,175 yuan. Then, the money exchange saw the high price and came to release again, and the gold shops suddenly turned to selling, and scattered longs closed out one after another, falling back by 25 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a securities firm, at 4,150 yuan. Later, the securities firm pulled in slightly again, raising it by 5 yuan, buying 20 taels from a gold shop, with a noon closing price of 4,155 yuan. As a result, it closed slightly smaller by 3 yuan than the previous day, with a difference of 35 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash shops' gold was higher than raw gold by several yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was lower than the listed gold by more than 50 yuan, with few transactions.

Ornament Gold Remains Unchanged Throughout

The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged throughout the day. Datonghang still hung at 420 yuan. New Tonghang was the same as the above price, with the purchase price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Coal: Indian Coal Sales Increase Daily

Since the opening company temporarily stopped selling warehouse warrants the day before yesterday, Indian lump coal has been taking the lead in Shanghai, and sales are increasing daily. Daily transactions reach more than 1,000 tons, and the market price has risen by 10 yuan in a week. Owners are still unwilling to release lightly, intending to be bullish. The asking price for Calcutta lump coal is now 132 yuan per ton, but there are no large quantities of spot goods, in stark contrast to the sluggish sales of stove white coal.

### Grains: Food Security Assured in Shanghai; Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again; 1,700 Tons of Broken Rice Transacted; Sold at Special Low Prices for Price Stabilization

The large quantities of early and late rice that arrived earlier were still being released in large quantities yesterday. It was also heard that the next batch of 13 trucks of goods, such as Huangqiao and Chuanlai Temple rice, had also arrived in Hongkou, but whether they could be transferred out of that area yesterday was still in question. Foreign rice in transit continued to arrive. In the early market, general sentiment was still bullish, and both local and foreign shops were actively trading. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices by more than half a yuan. The price of early and late Nangang rice was 38.5 yuan, and Saigon pointed rice was 38 yuan. The situation at the time was quite tense, but ultimately, with the year-end closing approaching, merchants repeatedly released, and the market was suddenly flooded with goods. Seeing the abundance of chips, merchants were unwilling to enter rashly again, so sales slackened and the market stagnated. The market was difficult to sustain and the price fell back. As a result, the closing prices were 38.2 yuan for early and late Nangang rice, then to 37.9 yuan; 37.5 yuan to 37.2 yuan for Saigon pointed rice; 37.6 yuan to 37.3 yuan for Siamese pointed rice; 33 yuan for broken rice; 36.2 yuan for Tokyo special pointed rice; and 35 yuan decided to 34 yuan for market rice. Although it was still good compared to the previous market, it only increased by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The remaining such as Su Tong japonica rice was still 40 yuan, decided to 39 yuan; Qing Si special thin rice was 40 yuan, and market rice was 39.5 yuan; Feng Xi special thin rice was 39 yuan, decided to 38 yuan; Lu Yang pointed rice was 38-39 yuan; and White Yuan was 41-42 yuan. Because the prices were more expensive than other goods, and all were already at the limit, it was not easy to increase, and only presented a stable situation. Although there were inevitable differences in the quality of the goods, they were too minor to discuss. Statistics showed that the total number of transactions in the city was still limited, with the largest number not exceeding 5,000 bags.

Customer indica rice continued to be silent, and the buying of foreign rice became more and more active. Due to the year-end holiday closures, shops and rural customers were adding supplies, and new arrivals were delayed because orders were not open for the holiday. Sellers were all raising prices. Saigon and Siamese were both raised to 37.5 yuan, and high-quality broken rice opened at 33.2 yuan, which was 0.3-0.5 yuan better than the previous day. Transit goods and original bags were rarely sold. However, in order to facilitate price stabilization, the firms reduced prices and sold batches of No. 2 Saigon and broken rice to the Adjustment Association, totaling 1,700 tons, with No. 2 original bags at 43.8 yuan and broken rice original bags at 35.8 yuan.

Foreign rice is continuously imported. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Zephyr ship brought 5,085 bags directly from Saigon, 12,447 bags loaded from Hong Kong, and the company's Canton ship also brought 13,219 bags from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng ship also brought 10,062 bags from Hong Kong, and another 1,711 bags were transferred to Tianjin. The three ships all arrived at port one after another yesterday morning and are currently being unloaded. (Ancestor)

### Holiday Flour and Wheat: Hoarding is Active

Flour: Transactions were quite active on the street yesterday. Due to the upcoming New Year's holiday and the good market situation, before the factory prices were increased, the buying appetite was stronger. All factories maintained normal retail sales to local dealers, but refused to open to customer buyers. Reclaimed goods were unusually firm, rising by 0.4-0.5 yuan above the factory price. Total transactions in the city were over 20,000 bags. The buying interest in Phoenix Brand flour from Japanese factories was unusually strong. Due to rumors of rising prices in recent days, hoarders took this opportunity to buy in, raising January delivery to 9.08-09 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. It was also heard that February delivery opened at 9.2 yuan, but factories were unwilling to sell at 0.25 yuan above that. Today, 14,900 bags of flour will be shipped to Hong Kong. On January 1st next year, 3,500 bags will be shipped to Xiamen, and 16,000 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat: The market was unusually firm yesterday. Due to the good flour market, sentiment was even stronger. Sellers were unwilling to provide samples for sale, and buyers were also watching due to the approaching year-end, and transactions virtually stopped. The market development will have to wait until after the New Year's holiday.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Optimistic, Foreign Stocks Remain Firm

Securities Dark Market: Yesterday, only half-day trading was conducted, and settlement and market closure were processed in the afternoon. The half-day market conditions showed a stable trend. This was largely due to the Lunar New Year approaching, with four days of holidays. Both long and short positions sought temporary closure. In terms of news, the issuance of gold standard notes was unrelated to public bonds, but most transactions were concluded by retail investors, resulting in a trading volume of 400,000. Buyers still dominated, as ambassadors from various countries would soon gather in Chongqing, unrelated to the Sino-Japanese conflict. The opening market next year is expected to continue to be optimistic. Yesterday's half-day results showed a slight increase of about one or two jiao. The transaction volume was over 400,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Today is the weekly holiday. Holidays start from New Year's Day for three days. The market will resume normal operations from the 4th.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Gauze Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen.

Time flies, another year has passed. Recalling the major reforms implemented by the General Chamber of Commerce last time, with the implementation of the "Written Plate System" for transactions, it has been about a year. This system has proven its effectiveness and achieved remarkable success, earning praise from all sides. Despite the approaching holidays, yesterday's market conditions remained strong and active. Rubber stocks were as booming as before, and interest in industrial stocks also increased. China Merchant bonds and Ewo Cotton Mill stocks were the most active. Transactions in low-priced rubber stocks regained a significant position. However, general stable and strong investors seemed to be turning back to previously beloved stocks, such as British Chairs, Langkats, and rubber. When the market reopens on the fourth day of the New Year, China Merchant's 8% bonds will no longer be listed in the market list, and the company's stock quotation will be the new share price of 10 yuan par value. The delivery of the new shares must wait until the share certificates are printed.

London, 29th: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower range prices. London, 29th: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks only saw HSBC shares fall by 1 pound each, with British registered shares priced at 81 pounds and 50 pence, and Hong Kong registered shares priced at 80 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn: Hoarding Active, Yarn Prices Soar, Jumping About Ten Yuan

The yarn market continued to advance, with the situation becoming more enthusiastic. Market transactions were found to be 80% speculative, mainly involving factory futures transactions for January, February, and March. They were bought and sold in the market, creating a lively atmosphere, but actual sales remained sluggish, leading to increasing inventories. However, raw cotton remained firm and expensive, and hoarders' buying intentions remained strong. The market will be closed for three days from New Year's Day, the 29th year, and will reopen on January 4th, operating as usual.

The opening price of current yarn in the morning was driven by the rising trends in the American and Indian cotton markets, coupled with favorable rumors, attracting more buyers. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 750 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan compared to the previous day, quickly rising to 53 yuan. It was then rumored that there was no significant change in the exchange rate, causing a momentary drop back to 748 yuan. However, a certain firm made some purchases of January and February futures, shifting the trend upwards again. The yarn market fluctuated between 52 and 53 yuan for a long time, finally closing at 753.5 yuan. According to statistics, 1,585 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 10.05 yuan, Tian Nu (Celestial Woman) by 8 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu (Double Earth) by 6 yuan. Today, 95 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. On January 1st next year, 555 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Siam, 280 pieces to Saigon, 220 pieces to Tu Le, 40 pieces to Hai Phong, 30 pieces to Hai Kou, and 60 pieces to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by various regional groups are listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 50, Yunnan: 310

Fellow Traders: 1,200, Inland: 25

### Foreign Cotton Rises Again, Cotton Firms Expect Optimistic Outlook

Transactions in local cotton were relatively scarce. Factories mainly had one transaction with the Japanese-owned Shanghai factory, and no other purchases were reported. However, market sentiment was exceptionally excited due to the renewed upward trend in overseas Indian cotton. Therefore, fellow traders are again expecting a rise in prices. The origin of cotton from Northern Jiangsu is estimated to be 3,370 bales of Tong Hua cotton, 141 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 830 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is listed below:

Dazhongji

23.00, Rong Fengjin: 100 bales

Another Report: Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market showed active trading in the early morning yesterday. Market prices rose by 5 to 6 points compared to the previous day, and then rose again due to purchases by peers and short covering. As a result, the closing market situation was quite firm, with prices rising by 5 to 6 points for near-term contracts and 11 to 17 points for far-term contracts compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose nearly 10 rupees, Kanpur rose over 50 points, and Liverpool rose over 10 pence.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have been very quiet recently. No parties have expressed interest in purchasing. Those holding spot goods are temporarily unwilling to sell, as they firmly believe that the American cotton market will be optimistic again. Factories are preparing to close their accounts as the end of the year approaches, so transactions are rare. The factory price of yesterday's cotton, converted at an exchange rate of 7.5 yuan per US dollar, is listed below:

20-count American Memphis middling: 240.30

Also, Lower Grade: 235.95

32-count: 247.30

Also, Lower Grade: 41.20

42-count: 50.80

Also, Lower Grade: 242.95

### Grains: Japanese Merchants Dump Dalian Soybeans

Oil Mills Purchase 100 Cars

Yesterday, soybean sales were mediocre due to the year-end closing period. Only hoarders made slight purchases at lower prices. The market trended towards tightness due to smooth arrivals. The Tongshi Street and hoarders purchased two cars of Nanjing soybeans, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans, five cars of Dingjiazhou soybeans, and fifty bags of Chongmingsha soybeans, with prices around 2 jiao. It was also reported that Japanese firms dumped 100 cars of Dalian soybeans for January delivery outside the market at a price of 17.5 to 7 jiao.

### North-South Goods: Vermicelli Shows Mixed Trends

Vermicelli: As the goods from Qingdao are still good, prices have increased. Yesterday's market price was 100 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Therefore, Longkou vermicelli was affected and fell by 5 or 6 yuan, currently selling for 120 yuan. There were no significant changes in other miscellaneous goods.

### Japanese Sentry Assaults Beautiful Woman, US Consulate Lodge Protest, Details Telegraphed to US State Department, Japanese Side Firmly Denies Incident

The English "China Press" reports that an official from the US Consulate stated this morning (30th) that although the Japanese Navy spokesman denied that American citizen Miss Donaldson was attacked by a Japanese sentry, the US Consulate in Shanghai had not received a written denial from the Japanese side. A summary of the incident was sent to the US State Department in Washington on Thursday. The official refused to comment on the Japanese Navy spokesman's remarks to reporters yesterday that Miss Donaldson's report "contains suspicious and unfounded accusations," but stated that the US Consulate's protest to Japanese Consul-General Miura on Thursday had not been answered.

US Consulate Note Demands Investigation

The "North China Daily News" reports that the US Consulate-General's note to the Japanese authorities, referring to the incident in which American citizen Miss Donaldson was treated rudely by a Japanese sentry on the west side of the Sichuan Road bridge during the past week, was denied by the Japanese Navy spokesman yesterday (29th). The US Consulate's note requested the Japanese side to immediately investigate the matter and take disciplinary action against the sentry.

Unexpectedly Attacked on West Side

The account stated that according to Miss Donaldson's report, as she was passing over the Sichuan Road bridge to the west side of the bridge, she was struck in the chest by a Japanese sentry without warning, almost falling onto the sidewalk. This incident occurred between 7:50 PM and 8:00 PM on December 20th. The US Consulate's note was delivered to Japanese Consul-General Miura on December 28th.

A View from the Japanese Navy

The Japanese Army spokesman stated that the Japanese Marines had investigated and found that no such incident had occurred. In his opinion, the allegations in the note were questionable. Why had it taken a week after the alleged incident to bring it to the attention of the Japanese authorities? He could not help but have the opinion that the accusation had an ulterior motive and harbored malice towards Japan.

Similar Incidents Have Occurred Before

If such an incident had occurred, it would have been reported to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on the evening of the incident or at least the next day. The Japanese sentry stationed at the location at the time of the alleged incident had been questioned and all denied it. In previous incidents of the same nature, Public Concession police officers stationed on the bridge immediately reported to the Police Department and announced it. Furthermore, the Japanese side always selects capable and well-behaved sentries to be stationed on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek and strictly forbids them from interfering with European, American, or Chinese women.

According to a British naval officer who told reporters yesterday (29th), three of them will soon leave Shanghai and sail to an undisclosed location. Since no orders have been given for the three ships to return to Hankou, they may be heading to Hong Kong. In addition to the HMS Gannet, the HMS Mosquito, HMS Scorpion, HMS Scarab, and HMS Gannet, and HMS Sea Gull arrived in Shanghai from Hankou three days ago. With three of them withdrawing following the five British gunboats that left the Central China waters in early autumn, only two British warships will remain in the Yangtze River squadron stationed in Shanghai.

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to discuss the Tianjin proposal and the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River with the central authorities, was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the British Steamship Company's "McKenna" yesterday morning for Hong Kong and then Chongqing.

### Huang Hanzhi Has Not Left Shanghai

Rumors of Departure for Hong Kong Incorrect

The rumor that Shanghai philanthropist Huang Hanzhi is about to go to Hong Kong on business is a misrepresentation. Mr. Huang is handling charitable affairs in Shanghai, and his affairs are heavy, so he cannot leave Shanghai for the time being. It is said that he is even busier during the winter relief period. The rumor of going to Hong Kong is not known where it came from.

### Today is Year-End, Market Stable

The successor to Colonel Granié as the French Army Commander in Shanghai will be Colonel Caversier, currently stationed in Tianjin, who will come to Shanghai to take over.

### Japanese Indicate to Municipal Council that They are Preparing to Return the Northern District, But it Depends on the Negotiation of Cross-Boundary Roads. The Pseudo-Government's Car Tax is Extended Indefinitely.

United Press of America, Shanghai report: A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said today that the Japanese side is very likely to return the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Municipal Council as soon as possible. The development of this issue will depend on the development of the issue of jurisdiction over

Cross-Boundary Roads which is currently being held between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council. The spokesman also said that the issue of the area north of Suzhou Creek should have been resolved long ago, but it has been delayed until now due to the Kinloch incident in mid-August and the occurrence of various unfortunate events.

Still unresolved, but if the issue of jurisdiction over cross-boundary roads can be resolved, the Hongkou issue can be resolved sooner or later. The talks between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council are progressing well, so this is also a sign that the Hongkou issue can be resolved soon. Also, the English "China Press" reports that after the special request of the Italian Consul-General and Leader of the Consular Body in Shanghai, Mr. Chuan Xiao'an,

To postpone the collection of license fees for cars on cross-boundary roads. In his reply to Mr. Nilon, Mr. Chuan stated that there is no fixed term for the postponement of the collection of this fee, but the "Shanghai Municipal Government" has the freedom to issue a notice at any time

To implement the collection of license fees after fifteen days. A reporter asked the General Manager and Director of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, about the progress of the negotiations between the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the Municipal Council on the suspension of the collection of license fees on cross-boundary roads. Mr. Fessenden replied that this is currently an unrelated matter, but it will obviously be discussed in the future. Currently,

It is gratifying to postpone it. Mr. Chuan is seeking to resolve the outstanding issue of cross-boundary roads first, so he has repeatedly postponed the collection of license fees for cars on roads outside the border. This is the third time.

### French Concession Municipal Council's Budget for the Coming Year Increases by 5 Million Yuan Compared to This Year, and Creates a New "Occupation License Tax"

The French "Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 30th that at the meeting of the French Concession Municipal Council on December 27th, the current budget for 1940 was decided, with total revenues and expenditures of 16.8 million yuan. The budget for 1939 was only 11.98 million yuan. It is also heard that the reason for this large increase in the budget is actually due to

The rising cost of living. The reasons in Shanghai are the increase in freight and the price of imported goods. In addition, the cost of living allowances for officials of the Bureau will also be maintained for a full year. Due to the increase in expenditures, it is necessary to increase tax revenues. There are three items to be added, as follows: (1) Land tax: no increase in the eastern part of the French Concession, an increase of

One percent between Avenue Dubail to Route Pere Robert and Route des Soeurs. An increase of two percent in the French Concession area, plus an additional tax of one percent. (2) House tax: an increase of 13 percent to 15 percent uniformly, plus an additional tax of 2 percent. Therefore, the total house tax for next year will be 17 percent. (3) Other business license taxes are also largely

Increased to adapt to the cost of living within the concession. In addition, a new "General Occupation License Tax" has been created, that is, any individual or company residing in the French Concession, any person engaged in a profitable occupation, must obtain a license and pay taxes, but with some exceptions for exemption. It is said that the establishment of this general occupation license tax is to enable all residents of the concession to share the city tax equally, so as to share the benefits of its safety and protection.

### Brokers Raise Rice Prices Excessively; Huang Renjie Sentenced to Detention; Ordering Broken Rice in Preparation

Rice market brokers Yang Xiling, Huang Renjie, and Sun Yigu of Qinyi Rice Shop, among others, were found to have excessively raised prices at the Fourth Road rice market. The Public Works Department, intending to punish these unscrupulous individuals, filed a lawsuit against the brokers and obtained arrest warrants from the court. Huang Renjie was apprehended through the cooperation of the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, and after trial, he was sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning to others. The other two individuals are still at large, and the police of both concessions are cooperating in their arrest. The authorities of both concessions are determined to crack down on rice merchants who excessively raise prices and will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law should similar situations be discovered in the future.

Circumstances of Detaining Rice Merchants Who Disobey Orders

Since the authorities repeatedly set price limits on rice, the Political Department of the Public Works Department's Police Office has dispatched Chinese detectives to supervise the market daily. On the 26th of the month, Chinese Detective No. 199 of the Political Department, while supervising the rice market, discovered that rice brokers Huang Renjie (age 41, from Pudong), Yang Xilin, and Sun Yigu were transacting deals for Xian rice at 36 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), clearly violating the set price limits. In addition to revoking the three individuals' entry permits, barring them from any further transactions in the market, they were taken to the police station for questioning and severe reprimands. Afterwards, the Public Works Department felt that it would be difficult to effectively enforce the price limits without punishing these individuals as a warning to others. After deliberation by the legal department of the Public Works Department, referring to the Shanghai Municipal Government's official letter of July 31, 1934, which notified the rice industry to comply with the twelve industry regulations, stipulating that in situations such as food price surges, official price limits must be strictly adhered to, a lawsuit was filed against Huang and the others with the First Special Court in accordance with Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations Act. The First Special Court issued an arrest warrant. Yesterday morning, detectives, together with the French police, apprehended Huang Renjie at No. 5 Rue Plessener. He was escorted to the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The Public Works Department's acting lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the facts, saying that the highest penalty under Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations Act was 15 days of detention or a fine of 15 yuan. However, under the current circumstances, merely imposing a fine of 15 yuan would not be enough to serve as a warning and deter hoarding. Therefore, he requested that the maximum bodily punishment be imposed according to law. Chinese Detective No. 199 testified regarding Huang Renjie's negotiation of the Xian rice transaction at 36 yuan per shi at the time. When questioned, Huang Renjie admitted the facts without denial, but said that he already knew his mistake and expressed deep regret. After verification by Judge Shen Shanzeng, Huang Renjie was sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning to others. Huang was then taken away by the police for imprisonment.

Over 10,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Yesterday

Registration for the ordered foreign rice will be temporarily suspended today as it is Sunday, and January 1st to 3rd are New Year's holidays, during which banks are closed. Registration will resume as usual on the 4th.

Meeting Today to Discuss Use of Funds

The Civil Food Adjustment Fund has been increased to 2 million yuan. In addition to the 820,000 yuan already committed, efforts are underway to raise the remaining amount.

The Civil Food Adjustment Association also held its second standing council meeting yesterday. The chairman reported that 170 businesses had submitted applications for registration to order foreign rice.

### Grand Joint Celebration Banquet for British and French Nationals in Shanghai

The "North China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai Royal Air Force Association held a weekly banquet yesterday (29th) afternoon at the association's headquarters in the HSBC Building. Guests included French Consul General Gibautte des Hayes, First Secretary Faulquier, French military attaché Colonel Yefeng, French air force attaché Lieutenant Colonel Natou, commander of the French gunboat Marne Baping, and chief of the French police department Faber.

Lively Atmosphere

The atmosphere was harmonious, reminiscent of the spirit between Britain and France in 1914. Association President Sir Sassoon delivered a speech, stating that it was an honor to have the Shanghai French dignitaries present at the banquet. It showed the world that the solidarity between Britain and France was not mere propaganda. He believed that some of those present had participated in the last World War and expressed hope

to Return to the Front Lines

But the unfinished tasks were now the responsibility of the younger generation. Today, Britain and France were not fighting for glory and wealth, but only for the protection of human dignity. Having drawn their swords, they would not sheathe them until the dictators' desires to enslave neighboring countries and their own people were completely thwarted. Sir Sassoon's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. When asked to toast Britain and France, everyone raised their glasses and

Sang Songs

Baudet des Hayes then rose to give a reply, expressing his pleasure and gratitude. After his speech, the audience applauded. As the banquet was about to end, Sir Sassoon rose again and said that he had something that everyone would be pleased to hear. He had learned that Britain's elite air force squadrons were stationed in major cities and that those fighting in Scotland were the so-called "Banker's Battalion," whose members were all volunteers who had not received extensive training and were transferred to Scotland when the war broke out.

### Kidnapping Case on Avenue Foch is the Work of the Japanese Consulate; Chinese Citizens Kidnapped by Consulate Police; Bureau Protests and Awaits Report for Decision

As for the kidnapped individuals and their printed materials, they were released yesterday afternoon after negotiations by the police department.

### Physicians Establish Ethical Stance; Voluntarily Cancel Prescription Commissions; Serving the Pharmaceutical Industry Should Be Done with Compassion; Please Immediately Remove Old Habits to Benefit Patients

Most pharmacies have traditionally paid commissions to physicians for prescriptions. This practice has been in place for many years and is difficult to change. Now, leading physicians in Shanghai, including Diao Xinde, Wang Wanbai, Wang Shuzhen, Zhu Yanggao, Yu Yunxiu, Xu Naili, Shi Siming, Fu Wenshou, Lu Zhaozhang, Cao Fangshou, and others, have taken an ethical stance and voluntarily initiated a circular to all pharmacies to completely eliminate this bad habit starting from the New Year. It is now heard that the Shanghai Physicians Association and the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Medical Association have taken

Collective Action to Support This Move. Furthermore, renowned major pharmacies such as Wu Zhou and Zhong Xi have also decided to comply after receiving the circular. The circular from the physicians is as follows: "Dear Manager, Since the war began, the cost of rice and firewood has skyrocketed, and the people are struggling to make a living. Although we are part of today's society, we have failed to help the world and save the critical situation. Reflecting on ourselves, we feel deeply ashamed. Since various countries have advocated the 'Moral Re-Armament' movement, and reflecting on the absolute

Moral Standards of Christ, including sincerity, purity, selflessness, and universal love, we feel even more inadequate and ashamed. In this difficult time, we should lead by example and extend this to others. Moreover, serving the medical and pharmaceutical professions should be done with compassion. Now that medicines are expensive, buyers are hesitant to purchase them. To alleviate the suffering of patients, we kindly request that your establishment eliminate all commission payments for our prescriptions, X-rays, and tests from the first day of the 29th year of the Republic. This type of income is unjust, harms others for personal gain, and

troubles our conscience. If we continue this bad habit, it would severely violate ethical principles. We solemnly declare and hope you will take this into consideration and comply. We also hope that you will extend this innovative goodwill to other physicians so that our medical and pharmaceutical professions can, from now on, unanimously adhere to integrity and uphold morality. This is our earnest prayer."

### Japanese Vessel Runs Aground Off Xiaojiao Mountain

Tugboat Sinks; Losses Exceed 10,000 Yuan

The No. 18 Huazhong Maru, a fish transport vessel of the Japanese Huazhong Fisheries Company operating on the Shanghai-Dinghai line, set sail from Dinghai on the 14th of this month to return to Shanghai, towing the Jinyongxing cargo vessel, and also passing by Daishan. Unexpectedly, that night, while passing through the waters of Xiaojiao Mountain, about a li away from Gaoting, due to the darkness and rapid currents, it mistakenly struck a reef.

Captain Asks for Help

The Japanese captain of the vessel immediately sent a radio message for help. It was not until noon the next day that the vessel was able to escape the reef, but the bottom of the vessel had been severely damaged and could not continue sailing. The towed Jinyongxing cargo vessel, being of wooden construction, broke apart immediately after hitting the reef, and seawater poured in. It is said that it was carrying 50 dan of rice and two boxes of matches, all of which fell into the sea and drifted away.

Passenger Drowns

There was a passenger on board named Dai Zhongyi, who claimed to be the "General Affairs Officer of the Daishan Special Municipality." As he was sleeping soundly in the cabin, he tragically drowned. The loss of inspected goods is estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. Upon hearing the news, personnel from Gaoting, Daishan, rushed to the scene of the accident to assist, but it was too late.

### Large Number of Overseas Chinese Arrive in Shanghai

### Group of Bandits Open Fire While Resisting Arrest in Zilai Street; Sixteen Fierce Bandits Raid a Customs Brokerage; Opening Fire to Resist Arrest Results in Two Bandits Being Captured

Yesterday at noon, a large group of bandits engaged in a fight with detectives in the French Concession, firing dozens of shots. Fortunately, no one was injured. The details are as follows:

Bandits Rampage and Rob in Gangs

At 11:40 AM yesterday, sixteen or seventeen bandits, each carrying a Mauser pistol, broke into the Anfeng Customs Brokerage at No. 5, Lane 33, Zilai Street. Several stood guard outside, while the rest split up to rob. In addition to the brokerage being robbed of over 2,000 yuan, resident Hu Zhimei on the second floor lost 560 yuan, He Yunshan on the third floor lost two diamond rings, Feng Shenzhuang lost over 100 yuan, and Gu Qikui's family lost over 100 yuan. While the bandits were searching for loot, the lookout suddenly noticed a large group of detectives arriving and, thinking that the plan had failed, notified the other bandits. The lookout bandits then opened fire on the detectives.

Opening Fire to Resist Arrest; Two Bandits Captured

After the gunfire started, the detectives scattered and began to encircle and arrest the bandits, returning fire. The bandits also resisted arrest forcefully, and a fierce gun battle ensued. The number of shots fired by both sides was like rain, totaling forty or fifty. Residents in the lane, hearing the dense gunfire, fled into their homes. Fortunately, no one was injured by the stray bullets. The bandits, unable to hold out, climbed onto the roofs and fled outwards. As a result, two bandits were captured on the spot, and two Mauser pistols and over ten bullets were confiscated. They were taken back to the police station and are currently being interrogated to identify their accomplices and bring them to justice. The two bandits will be sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution after the investigation is completed.

### Men and Women Commit Suicide in the Asia Travel Agency; Woman is a Guide Society Member

A man and a woman arrived at Room 244 of the Asia Travel Agency at 571 Hankou Road the night before last. The man claimed to be Zhang Chuan, 30 years old, and the woman, Zhang, 20 years old. They were very affectionate and seemed like a married couple. They slept until about 12:30 PM the next day, when, for unknown reasons, they both had suicidal thoughts and committed suicide by drinking poisonous liquid. A waiter discovered them and immediately called for an ambulance to take them to the hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the woman was a member of a certain Guide Society. Due to lack of freedom in marriage, they decided to act as lovebirds who die together.

Chen Liming, a 25-year-old native of Ningbo, was a coppersmith living at No. 2, Baxian Lane, Rue des Soeurs, in the French Concession. Recently, he had lost a lot of money due to gambling and was unable to repay his debts. He had suicidal thoughts and swallowed poisonous liquid at around 5:30 PM yesterday. He was discovered by someone and taken to Baolong Hospital by a friend. He died at 7:15 PM despite treatment.

### Demolition Causes Disaster; Over Ten Japanese Soldiers Injured or Killed

Behind the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, there was originally a Hengjing Temple, with three courtyards in the front and back, and spacious buildings. It was built by imperial decree during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and has been passed down to this day, with a thriving incense offering. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, dozens of Japanese soldiers stationed in Shanghai Middle School went to the temple to dismantle and take wood for use as firewood. Unexpectedly, while they were working, the main hall of the central courtyard suddenly collapsed with a crash, injuring over ten Japanese soldiers on the spot. Two of them died from their injuries, which were too severe to be treated. The others were taken to the Fenglin Bridge Military Hospital for treatment.

### Pseudo-Soldiers Rob a Shop; Two Arrested

Since the implementation of the "Baojia System" in the Pudong area, robberies have become even more rampant every night. At around 2:00 AM yesterday, a group of over twenty bandits suddenly arrived at the tobacco and paper shop opened by Wu Ziquan, a local resident near Shenjia Lane. Wielding weapons, they robbed the shop of over 300 yuan in legal tender and valuable items from the house before escaping. Three bandits were caught by the puppet police because they were slower to escape. After being tortured, six more male and female criminals were apprehended, and two hand grenades and one pistol were recovered. They are currently being interrogated by the "Investigation Detachment." It is heard that they confessed that they were living as fake "soldiers."

### Construction Factory Owner Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping

Xu Chuyuan, a 49-year-old local resident who owns the Jinmingji Construction Factory, residing at No. 36, Lane 362, Daxi Road, was kidnapped by three bandits, each carrying a pistol, while traveling in his own car (No. 9985) at around 8:45 AM yesterday. One of the bandits drove the car. Unexpectedly, the car had special mechanics, which the bandit was not familiar with, so he was unable to drive it. At this time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station had already received the news and quickly dispatched detectives to the scene. The bandits, upon discovering this, abandoned Xu and fled without a trace. Xu was fortunate to escape.

### Public Bus Crushes Pedestrian's Legs

At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road in the Public Concession, a No. 10 public bus, traveling from west to east, struck pedestrian Hang Youcai, 50 years old, at around 8:30 AM yesterday. He was knocked down because the bus was unable to stop in time. The bus wheels crushed both of his legs. The police arrived, recorded the driver's information, and sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment.

### New Zha Bridge Requires Payment of Bridge Tax

Pedestrians on New Zha Bridge traveling from Beizha to the Concession are being forced to pay a bridge tax if they are carrying chickens, ducks, fish, or meat. For example, one chicken or duck requires a payment of 5 jiao (unit of Chinese currency), and one yuan for fish or meat, or sometimes as low as 3 to 4 jiao. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to cross the bridge.

### YWCA Arranges Advance Purchase of Rice for Members

Due to the recent surge in rice prices and the difficulty of purchasing rice, the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road has initiated an advance purchase of rice for its members. It is heard that the price is fixed at 20 yuan per shi. Friends and relatives of the association who wish to purchase rice in advance should contact the association before January 4th or 5th.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

According to Mr. Wu Xinshu, the manager of the Xinxin Copper and Iron Manufacturing Factory, the news item on the Xinzha Road fire in the "Local News" section of the Shen Bao on the 29th of this month, which stated that the fire originated at our factory, is not in accordance with the facts. The fire started in the shantytown and spread eastward, affecting our bamboo fence first and then the factory building. This was witnessed by all the firefighters on the scene. As this concerns the reputation of our factory, we request that you correct the statement in the letter below.

We send this letter on their behalf and hope you will check and correct the information.

Sincerely,
Lawyer Dai Ningrui
December 30th

Weekly Supplement

### Tomorrow

The last day of each year is called New Year's Eve, meaning to get rid of the old and welcome the new, which everyone knows. The last month of each year is also called Deeming Month, as seen in the Book of Compilations of Emperor Yuan of Liang, but it is not often used. So today is Deeming Month New Year's Eve.

After twenty-four hours, it will be "tomorrow," but when speaking of "tomorrow" today, if the meaning is broad, it can also mean "next year." For example, when parting with a friend, "See you tomorrow!" can be changed to "See you next year!" Logically, there is no difference, and at this time, "day" and "year" are interchangeable.

Of course, next year will have a new atmosphere and new developments that we cannot foresee; but what we already know, such as the establishment of Guilin as a city, the collection of excessive profit taxes, and the National Savings Movement, will all begin on New Year's Day, which is to say, beginning "tomorrow."

### European War and Espionage

— Wei

After the First European War, espionage activities of various countries became highly active. Their actions were often unpredictable and difficult to defend against. Although appearing ordinary, their methods were extremely agile, and their attention was deeply focused. They could devise all sorts of methods to accomplish their important missions. The following examples are just a few.

The embassy of a certain country employed a woman with an unattractive appearance, whose daily task was to clean windows. The embassy had always been very strict about guarding against espionage, and no one was allowed to take anything out after work. However, this woman was actually a spy. While cleaning the glass windows, she used five secret actions to wipe the glass, one to the left, one to the right, one up, one down, and one diagonally. Another spy would watch her actions from a distance and quickly record them. Therefore, all the secrets of the embassy were completely stolen by her.

There was a Soviet spy who specialized in using photographic equipment. He lived in a Western-style house near the British government office building and photographed all the discarded paper scraps in the vicinity from the air. It is said that the secrets of the British government stolen by him in this way were not few.

Another Soviet spy used the method of cooking eggs. These eggs were mixed with ordinary raw eggs, coated on the outside with a sugar alum solution, and the inside was written with text using a medicinal solution. Once the egg was cooked, black text would appear.

Many French spies were beautiful women. Their gloves, coat pockets, and seams of their clothes were all places to hide secret telegrams.

Since the invention of infrared light lamps, spies from various countries have known how to use them to transmit signals, and news could be obtained from miles away. Other scientific methods are too numerous to mention.

### If the Battle Line is 1,000 Kilometers...

If the battle line is 1,000 kilometers long, how much manpower, financial resources, and material resources will the attacking and defending parties need?

The attacking side needs at least four million troops, while the defending side needs from one and a half million to two million. The frontline soldiers all need the labor force in the rear to transport supplies. Each soldier of the defending army needs ten people, and each soldier of the attacking army needs twelve people. Therefore, to ensure the smooth operation of the four million attacking troops, the rear needs 48 million laborers.

During a major war, 400 million tons of coal are needed each year. If each miner can dig 0.8 tons of coal per day, then a population of 500 million is needed.

In terms of weapons, what the attacking army needs is:——

Machine guns: 200,000, Large cannons: 45,000

Rifles: 30,000, Anti-aircraft guns: 50,000

Armored vehicles: 40,000, Transport vehicles: 30,000

The defending side generally needs half of what the attacking army needs.

Then calculate the steel needed annually for weapons, artillery shells, etc.:——

The attacking army needs 37.3 million tons, and the defending army needs 15.75 million tons. In other words, each soldier consumes 70 to 80 tons of steel annually.

In addition, a list of indispensable materials is as follows:——

Therefore, war is truly a drain on manpower and resources, especially for aggressor nations. If their gambles fail and they encounter strong resistance, their losses will definitely be more than double, or even three or four times greater than those of the invaded country.

### The Instigators of the European War

### How to Calculate the Day of the Week Next Year

Calculating the day of the week for a certain day next year is extremely convenient. Just count the total number of days from January 1st to that day. (The number of days in each month is fixed in the solar calendar, making it very easy to calculate.) Divide by seven, and the remainder is the day of the week. If there is no remainder, then it is Sunday.

For example: What day of the week is March 15th? January has 31 days, February is a leap year with 29 days (which year is a leap year is also fixed, see the article). March 15th totals 75 days. Dividing by seven leaves a remainder of five, which is Friday.

### Flattered and Alarmed

— Huan Lan

An article titled "Agreable Surprise" in the November 1939 issue of Time magazine is well worth reading; and translating this title into a Chinese idiom is quite accurate. The translation is as follows:

In late October 1939, the Nobel Prize Committee in Stockholm, Sweden, announced the 1938 (delayed from the previous year) and 1939 prizes for physiology and medicine. The physiologist who should receive the prize is Professor Corneille Heymans of Belgium. He discovered that stimulation causes blood pressure to rise and fall, as well as chemical changes that affect breathing. These contributions have greatly benefited the treatment of respiratory diseases.

The medicine prize was given to Professor Gerbard Domak of Germany. This is where the problem arose. It turned out that in 1935, when the Nobel Prize was given to the German tuberculosis expert Achilles Keys, Hitler issued an order prohibiting Germans from accepting the Nobel Prize in the future. This time, the committee was ignorant of the rules and chose another German, causing Professor Gerhart to be at a loss when he received the news.

When he asked the government for instructions on how to handle the matter, he murmured, "Even if I don't accept his prize, the honor of being nominated has already greatly alarmed me."

### Finnish Tidbits

Finland has 65,000 lakes and marshes, which can be used for military defense.

Finland has a population of four million. Seventy-five percent of Finland's exports are timber.

During the harvest season, Finns work especially hard because the sun sets at 11 p.m. If they "rest during the day," the day is particularly long.

Helsinki, the capital of Finland, currently has a population of 300,000, but in 1810 it was just a small village.

The Finnish language is one of the most difficult languages in the world to learn.

### Common Sense About the Earth

— Zhen Ming

The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 92.83 million miles. If you travel by the fastest airplane today, which travels at 240 miles per hour, flying non-stop day and night would take forty-four years.

The distance from the Earth to the Moon is 239,000 miles. If you traveled by airplane in the same way, it would take over forty days.

The center of the Earth is liquid, and the thickness of the outer crust is 50 kilometers.

The atmosphere is at least 100 kilometers thick. Every cubic meter weighs 1.29 kilograms, and every square centimeter of the Earth's surface is subjected to an air pressure of 1.033 kilograms.

Brief Research

### The Origin of the Paper Ring on Cigars

Isn't there a paper ring like a waistband around cigars? The packaging is very beautiful, but what is its purpose? It is said that the origin of this small paper ring is related to women.

Originally, in colonial times, Spanish noblewomen in Cuba casually smoked cigars to show their nobility and ease, but at the same time, they were afraid that the color of the tobacco leaves would stain their snow-white fingers. Therefore, a paper ring was added to the cigar to protect the fingers so that they would not come into contact with the tobacco leaves. However, as it has been passed down to the present, the original intention of using the paper ring no longer exists.

### Artificial Food

The earliest researcher of artificial food was Dr. Maurice Bribois of France. He studied it for ten years, and in 1930, he successfully manufactured fruit powder from fresh fruits such as bananas, apples, and grapes for drinking.

Since the success of Dr. Maurice Bribois' fruit powder, it has aroused the interest of scientists around the world. Soviet scientists are the most enthusiastic. They organized the Artificial Food Research Institute and began practical research in 1934. They had an ideal of reducing the volume of bread to one-hundredth or one-fiftieth while still containing the original nutrients and being able to be stored for a long time without spoiling. At the time, it was just an ideal, and no one believed it would come true.

However, according to a recent report in the Russian newspaper Moscow Telegraph: Soviet scientist S. Y. Karayevoy finally succeeded this spring after five years of research. This was an accidental success. He accidentally made a substitute for bread synthesized from chemical drugs. This thing can be made into powder or lozenges, and every three centimeters in weight can抵半抵 half a pound of black bread. Its cost is only one-fifteenth to one-twentieth of half a pound of black bread.

The success of artificial food is not only a major invention in the scientific community but also a major revolution in the struggle for survival!

### Concluding Remarks for the Year 1939

— Rong Mei

Today is the last day of the Republic of China's 28th year. Time flies so fast. Next year's New Year's Day seems to be right in front of us, without any blurriness. In the blink of an eye, it's the end of the year, and another long year of three hundred and sixty-five days has flown by like this.

All public or private institutions, as of today, finalize the accounts of income and expenditure for the year, which evokes our memories.

In this year, the Second European War terrifyingly broke out. Although currently only England, France, Finland, Germany, and the Soviet Union are in a state of war, a spark can ignite a prairie fire, and the flames of war are very likely to spread. However, we, who love justice and peace, always hope that the god of peace will arrive soon. Even more pitiful is Poland, which was revived after the European War, but was swallowed up by the aggressors this year. Our country's War of Resistance has entered a tense stage. In short, this year is a year of war and chaos, giving us the lesson that "resistance to aggression is the only way to survive."

In this year, Shanghai was surrounded by a speculative and hoarding atmosphere, and the prices of all goods soared in a straight line, leading to a trend of the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer. In short, this year is a year of soaring prices, but it can also cultivate our habit of thrift.

Finally, children also need to take stock today and make a brief review of themselves this year: You are all a year older. I think your parents must love you very much, making new clothes for you to wear, giving you candy to eat, giving you money to spend, and buying toys for you to play with. But have you been studying hard at school? Have you learned more new characters? Have you gained more knowledge? If not, then you are too sorry for your parents. Because they love you so much, they hope that you will study hard. It can be said that their hearts are always on you. How can you not study hard to repay them?

These few superficial words can be regarded as my year-end gifts. Children, after reading the above few sentences, do not treat them as perfunctory reviews. I hope you will correct your mistakes if you have them, and work harder if you don't! And I wish you a happy New Year!

### New Hope

— Yong

A year has passed, and tomorrow will be the beginning of another year. We must also have some new hopes to be our pioneers in the coming year. I can say that your new hopes must be many, and the following are unavoidable.

First, regarding personal aspects, hoping to study harder, hoping to become physically stronger day by day, and hoping to improve character.

Second, regarding the country, hoping for victory in the War of Resistance, hoping for complete territorial integrity, and hoping for a happy life for the people.

Third, regarding the world, hoping that all countries can treat each other with sincerity, and hoping that the world can be at peace.

Children who have these hopes are progressive and good. However, I believe that all of the above are not new hopes. You must be asking: "Why?" Let me answer in a moment. I first want to ask you a question: "When you celebrated the New Year last year, you must have also expressed some new hopes, right? Please compare them with this year's to see if there are any similarities?" At this time, you will surely suddenly realize that the so-called "new hopes" of yours have been old news for several years. At this point, let me put forward a truly new hope. It is also very simple, that is, hoping that you can start from today to gradually realize the hopes you already have, turn them into reality, and not let them become "daydreams" or "fantasies" and be passed down year after year. These few words can be taken as my New Year's gift to you. Please accept them sincerely.

### Mr. Sun Yat-sen Doesn't Forget to Read on New Year's Day

— Chen Sipi

Children: Time passes very quickly. In the blink of an eye, today is the last day of the Republic of China's 28th year. From tomorrow onwards, it will be the beginning of the 29th year. Now, I have written a story about Mr. Sun Yat-sen not forgetting to read on New Year's Day as a small New Year's gift for you!

When Mr. Sun was in Japan, one New Year's Day, his friend came to invite him to go sightseeing. At that time, Mr. Sun was buried at his desk, studying diligently. Seeing his friend come to invite him, he said, "Now that the country is in turmoil, my heart is only on the revolution, not on the mountains and rivers." He declined to go. His friend then said to him, "Today is a New Year's holiday, can't you go out for a visit?" Mr. Sun smiled and replied, "It is precisely because it is a holiday that I have the opportunity to continue reading and gain some knowledge. If it were not a holiday, then even if I were studying national affairs, I would feel that there is no moment of free time!" Mr. Sun did not forget to study even on New Year's Day. How admirable!

Children: After reading this short story above, what are your thoughts?

### Legend of Celebrating the New Year

— Shen

It is said that more than four thousand years ago, there was a creature in the world called "Nian" (年, year). This animal was very large and liked cold weather. On the night of the end of each year and the beginning of the next year, it would come out to eat people. Therefore, people at that time were fearful of it and had no way to stop its activities. So, at this time, everyone treated it as a hurdle, which is now called "Nian Guan" (年關, year-end hurdle). Also, because they escaped being eaten by Nian, the first day of the following year was called "New Year." Later, humans gradually became smarter and thought of a way, which was to hang red things during the New Year's Eve, because Nian was most afraid of red. So, if a family hung red things, Nian would not dare to approach. Thus, humans gained a more stable life. Therefore, even now, in old-fashioned families, red cloth curtains are still hung outside the doors or bedrooms, or red paint is painted on the doors. But they think it is auspicious, which is actually a mistake. Also, why do people say "Congratulations, congratulations" on the first day of the new year? This is because they are congratulating each other for not being eaten by Nian. Also, why do people prepare many dishes? Because although Nian likes to eat people, it will not abandon delicious food. Therefore, humans used this reason to make Nian forget about eating people when it sees delicious food. While it is eating the dishes, humans can escape to avoid death. Later, because Nian's reproductive capacity was weak, it gradually became extinct. Nian no longer exists now. But the preventive measures of the past are still preserved. But because Nian is gone, there are many things to enjoy. For example, the dishes are eaten by oneself, hanging red symbolizes peace and prosperity in all seasons, and congratulating each other is for everyone to have lived another year. Therefore, the meaning of celebrating the New Year now is different from the meaning of celebrating the New Year in the past! It is only the same as the Dragon Boat Festival for commemorating Qu Yuan by eating zongzi and the Mid-Autumn Festival for commemorating Chang'e by eating mooncakes.

### Little Knowledge

— Xin Fang

Time is really like flowing water. After today, another year is over. We all know that what is called passing a year, astronomically speaking, is that the Earth has revolved around the Sun once, taking more than 365 days. How much more exactly? Can all you children answer? It is fixed, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds more. For this reason, there is one leap day in February every four years.

What I have talked about above is all calculated from the solar calendar. As for our old lunar calendar, it takes eleven or twelve days longer to pass a year. Therefore, there are two leap months every five years. This is calculated based on the Moon revolving around the Earth. From this, it can be seen that the solar calendar is much more accurate than the lunar calendar in terms of calculation.

### Blue Dwarf (14)

— Ai Li

Ah Li had remembered everything from the past, and told the old dwarf about it. The old man also spoke a lot, but Ah Li didn't understand much, only understanding a few sentences like "lost" "poor child" "poor child." Finally, he told Ah Li that he also happened to be coming from that village, only to take a shortcut, so he took this road in the forest, but unexpectedly encountered her. After he finished speaking, he held the lamp in his hand high, clearly indicating that he was leading the way and telling Ah Li to follow him.

Strangely enough, just now Ah Li was going back and forth, unable to find the way, but now, under the leadership of the old man, in less than ten minutes, they arrived at the small inn. Poor her aunt and A Li were anxiously waiting for her, running back and forth in front of the store, without any idea what to do. Her uncle, along with the store owner and the coachmen, were carrying lanterns and looking for her in the forest. The innkeeper was comforting her aunt, saying that there was no need to worry too much, because there were no wolves or bears or other wild animals in this area, nor were there any bad people who would abduct children. The little girl must have been tired after a busy day, and fell asleep somewhere in the forest. She would come back by herself after dawn.

The innkeeper actually guessed some of it right. Now Ah Li is back, but she would never have expected that this little girl had been to the dwarves' village in her sleep and was entertained by the blue dwarves. As for the old dwarf who led her back, he was a famous local resident nearby, and he was very kind. Ah Li's aunt thanked him and gave him two yuan, and he went away happily. After a few minutes, her uncle rushed back to see if there was any news about his niece. When he saw that Ah Li had already returned, he was naturally happy beyond words.

Ah Li's return was really a coincidence. It turned out that after dawn, the sky was always dark, as if it was going to rain. Less than half an hour after she returned, a big storm broke out. Her aunt happily said to Ah Li, "You were lucky to come back a little earlier. If you hadn't come back by now, wouldn't we have been worried to death?" Ah Li looked at the terrible storm outside the door and felt very fortunate in her heart. Then, she told her aunt about her motive for visiting the blue dwarves. Her aunt said regretfully, "I shouldn't have joked with you before and said some things about the dwarves, arousing your curiosity, which caused this incident. From now on, I have to be more careful and not joke with you children anymore." So, Ah Li also told her aunt that from now on, she would be satisfied with reading about fairies and monsters in books and would never go looking for real fairies and monsters again.

Finally, she suddenly said with a smile, "Auntie, but I regret not eating the blue dwarves' dinner. The smell seemed very delicious." Her aunt laughed and said, "You must be dreaming. You can't really eat it there." Ah Li pondered for a moment, and then suddenly asked, "Auntie, when you and Uncle and A Li came back last night, did you sing along the way?" Her aunt hurriedly said, "Yes, they wanted me to sing a song 'Home, Sweet Home.' I was so happy that I sang it out loud. Why did you ask about this?" Ah Li nodded and said, "Oh, I see. I thought the blue dwarves were singing, but it turned out to be your voices." Her aunt smiled and gave her a sweet kiss. (The End)

### The Play Lineup for New Year's Day

— Jin Yuanliang

Starting from the year 1940, the theater scene in the isolated island will become more vibrant due to the addition of the "China Traveling Troupe" as a new force, right? The plan for the year lies in the spring. We certainly have no way of knowing the annual plans of each theater troupe, but from the programs performed on New Year's Day, we can always see some clues.

The first thing to mention is naturally the Shanghai Drama Society, which has been fighting in the isolated island for more than a year. After the society started its second long-term performance at the Lafayette Theater with Sardou's "Fatherland" as the first shot, it has been a box office success to this day. From New Year's Day, it was originally said that Jiang Qi's "Chen Yuanyuan," directed by Bai Lang, would be performed. Now that we have confirmed the news, "Fatherland" will be performed through New Year's Day, and perhaps "Chen Yuanyuan" will not be performed until January 4th or 5th.

As for the "China Traveling Troupe," according to the troupe's previous publicity, it was originally going to perform Wei Ruohei's "Empress Dowager Cixi," directed by Wu Yonggang. In addition to Tang Ruoqing and the entire members of the "China Traveling Troupe," Wang Xichun and Liu Qiong were also added as guest performers. Its ability to attract audiences is naturally not weak. However, now it is proceeding cautiously and striving for excellence in all aspects such as costumes and props. Therefore, it has decided to postpone the performance and first stage Wu Yonggang's "Lin Chong Flees at Night." Wu Yonggang originally wrote and directed the film "Lin Chong's Revenge in the Snowy Night," which won unanimous praise. This time, he is already familiar with the subject, so it will naturally be even more extraordinary. Moreover, the troupe leader, Tang Huaiqiu, volunteered to star in it himself. The excellent results can of course be predicted. Tang Huaiqiu is a veteran of the theater world. He has rarely appeared on stage in recent years. This time, he volunteered, and his reputation is even more conceivable.

Then there's Green Bin. Although some people see Green Bin as a civilized drama troupe, it is really impossible to underestimate them because they have been striving to improve and working hard recently. From New Year's Day, they were also originally planning to perform Liu Yixin's "Empress Dowager Cixi." Later, after hearing that "China Traveling Troupe" was going to perform it, in order to avoid competing with them, they voluntarily postponed the performance to January 6th. From New Year's Day, they will present Hu Liaoran's "Miss Piti 金." It is said that this play is a satirical comedy, with various interpolations about the photography studio.

### The Most Popular Play in Shanghai This Year

— Only Me

Another year has passed. The theater scene in Shanghai this year has been particularly lively, even more so than before the war. In total, the play that has been most able to attract audiences and the most popular this year is:

(1) "Battle of Changsha." This play was made popular by Zhou Xinfang and his disciples. Not long ago, Xinfang, Zhao Ruquan, and Yuan Shihai sang it at a private party at the magistrate's office, making it even more popular. So this play became a standard attraction. Zhou Xinfang has performed it countless times this year. Huang Jin'geng's "Beijing opera actors" have all performed this play, and amateur performers also love to sing it. Recently, Lin Shusen performed it on the stage of the Great Theater. Unexpectedly, this "Battle of Changsha," which has become an antique, has had great luck in 1939.

(2) "Er Jin Gong." Because of the popularity of "Battle of Changsha," all the old plays that had not been performed for a long time became attractive plays. In addition to "Battle of Changsha," "Er Jin Gong" is also the most popular play this year. However, this play is only performed by Beijing opera actors in Shanghai. However, because Yan Jupeng, Wang Yurong, and Zheng Bingru all sold out every performance of this play, it is also listed as the most popular play.

(3) "Wen Suchen." This is a miracle in the theater scene this year, and it can also be said to be the greatest achievement of the artist Zhou Xinfang in his decades of theatrical career. "Wen Suchen" has sold out dozens of shows in a row, attracting countless audiences. There is really a saying that "If you haven't seen Wen Suchen, you're not from Shanghai." Even the famous Beijing opera actors who came south one after another rushed to see it. "Wen Suchen" can be regarded as the most popular play this year.

In addition to the above plays, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Yu Tang Chun" still rely on their age and can still cater to the tastes of Shanghai people. As for the supernatural scenery plays, they don't seem to have as much magic this year as they did last year, so they are gradually being eliminated. It is expected that the supernatural plays will disappear from the Shanghai theater scene in 1940, and the old plays may be revived.

New Movie Introductions

### A Hero of His Age

— Qi Hua

"A Hero of His Age" was recently allowed to be publicly screened after some cuts. It is said that it was considered to be overly revealing. Judging from what is now seen on the screen, and based on speculation, perhaps there were exaggerated depictions of confrontations with the military and police. As for the exposure of content, it is precisely what the playwright aimed at in the current deformed society. After being sentenced to fifteen years, Luo Ji eagerly went to see lawyer James upon his release, only to find that James had embezzled his ten thousand yuan in savings. Starting from this hatred, Luo Ji also seized evidence to blackmail James, thereby becoming accomplices. This is an entire social problem, not something Luo Ji's friend Jerry can salvage. However, the playwright, through Jerry, raises the issue of education for homeless children, which I believe is the focus of this film.

Under the vast and bold direction of [Director's Name, assumed to be "寇蒂茲" - Koudiz], the entire film tightly stimulates the audience's heartstrings from beginning to end, without a moment of relaxation. The first part, which introduces the young Luo Ji and Jerry, is also concise and clear. When Luo Ji is released from prison, returns to the slums, and meets Lulu, and when he acts as a referee for a basketball game, the director makes the scene full of fun.

James Cagney's portrayal of Luo Ji, with his agility and casual demeanor, is indeed one of the best performances in all his works. Pan De'aoblin's Jerry, in the scenes where he returns the money to Luo Ji and earnestly pleads with Luo Ji, performs with composure and gratitude.

The six young tycoons all fulfill their duties. The "Wu" girl, An Xiulidan, doesn't have many scenes, but her serious acting is not bad.
