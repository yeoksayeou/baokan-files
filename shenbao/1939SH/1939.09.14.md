### Attempt to Capture Warsaw Ends in Failure: German Forces Change Strategy, Plan New Offensive; Polish Army Recovers Important Town of Lodz, Establishes New Defensive Positions; Rain Season Arrives Quickly, Rendering German Mechanized Units Ineffective

(London) According to reliable sources from Poland, Polish forces have retaken the vital town of Lodz, 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. Polish forces in Poznan and Pomorze, who were in danger of being cut off, have now re-established contact with the main Polish forces southwest of Warsaw. (Reuters, Central Europe, 13th)

(London) The resistance of the Polish forces along the 300-mile front has visibly strengthened. They have not only established new defensive positions along the San River, Bug River, and Narew River, but are also determined to prevent further German advances. Having been stalled, the Germans are now attempting to encircle the Polish forces on the Bug River from both the north and south. (Associated Press, 13th)

(London) Public attention on the Eastern Front is now focused on the German assault on Przemysl, a key city in Silesia. It is widely believed that this move aims to sever Poland's transportation links with its neutral southern neighbors. The starting point of the German northern offensive is East Prussia, with the objective of seizing the important railway junction of Bialystok. The significance of German air superiority is being widely discussed. According to Polish estimates, the Germans are using a total of 5,000 aircraft, 3,000 of which are bombers. The recent loss of its southwestern industrial region has created a serious problem for Poland regarding the supply of munitions. Meanwhile, observers here claim that Germany seems to realize that clearing western Poland is no easy task, as brave Polish soldiers are actively operating west of Warsaw. The bravery of these Polish troops has earned them the reputation of a "daredevil squad." (Reuters, 13th)

(London) Significant developments have occurred in the Polish war over the past three days, leading to notable changes in key areas within Poland. According to an official Warsaw radio broadcast today, recent developments include the Polish forces' escape from the Pomorze region (also known as Polish Pomerania or the Corridor) and the retreat of Polish forces from the agricultural province of Poznan in western Poland. Another Polish source reports that the German command has abandoned its intention to seize Warsaw by force and has ordered its mechanized units to halt their advance towards the capital. Instead, the Germans have launched a new offensive on both flanks of the Polish lines. However, Polish officials claim that the Germans are currently being contained and have made no progress. Another Polish source claims that Lodz, an industrial town 82 miles southwest of Warsaw captured by the Germans on Sunday, has been retaken. Polish sources believe that the German decision to temporarily abandon the attempt to seize Warsaw is due to the concentration of the large Polish force that withdrew from the "Poznan pocket" between Lodz and the Vistula River. It is reported that the Polish forces in Pomorze escaped by breaking through the German lines connecting mainland Germany and East Prussia. This is a significant victory, as the only way out was through the German forces in front. It is reported that these Polish troops from the Corridor, after breaking through the German lines, have made contact with the main Polish forces and are now fighting alongside them. However, the outcome of the battle is not yet known. It is reported that the Polish forces in Poznan province withdrew after repeated fierce battles with the German forces blocking their eastward retreat. The retreat was orderly, and they have not only made contact with their forces southeast of Warsaw but have also reached Lodz. According to Polish official reports, the Warsaw garrison has repeatedly launched successful attacks against the German forces attempting to capture the capital. German forces on other fronts are currently being contained and are unable to make further progress. The German air force, having suffered heavy losses, has visibly reduced its activity. (Reuters, 13th)

(London) Military observers today are paying close attention to the noticeable slowing of the German advance within Poland, attributing it to the dangers posed by Germany's long supply lines. It is estimated that the Germans are advancing an average of 20 miles per day, which makes supply difficult. This rate, even for mechanized units, is considered too high, resulting in troop fatigue, especially for tanks and heavily armored units, which consume the most fuel. This has given the Polish forces an opportunity to dig in and hold their ground, potentially leading to a temporary stalemate. However, observers caution against optimism. The position of the Polish forces in the so-called "Poznan pocket," 120 miles long west of Warsaw and 50 miles wide north to south, surrounded by German forces on both sides, is precarious. Two railways, previously unnoticed in German strategy—the Konigsberg-Bialystok line in the north and the Krakow-Lemberg line in the south—are now attracting attention. These two lines greatly assist the Germans in developing flanking attacks on the Polish new defensive positions between the Vistula and Bug rivers. However, the weather from now on will be greatly beneficial to the Polish forces. According to the Daily Mail, a three-month drought in Poland suddenly ended yesterday with heavy rain, causing significant difficulties for German heavy mechanized units. The Polish Embassy in London could not confirm this report but stated that rain often falls at this time of year. Since the time of Napoleon, Poland has been known for its muddy terrain.

### Civilians and Soldiers Defend Warsaw

A dispatch from the Lithuanian capital in the Swiss Basel Daily News describes the defense of Warsaw, stating that people of Warsaw, regardless of age or gender, are all assisting in building obstacles with old trams, trains, and broken tiles from air raids to protect the capital. A dispatch from Berlin in the same newspaper states that the German side expects heavy losses in the fighting around Warsaw, as Polish forces are operating in small units, constantly disrupting German rear areas. (Reuters, 13th)

### Heavy German Losses

Schaffhausen, Switzerland According to reliable sources, German losses within Poland are far greater than those announced in official reports, and the number of dead and wounded is far higher than anticipated. As a result, there is a shortage of doctors and nurses, and many wounded soldiers have died due to lack of timely treatment. Hospitals and small schools in Vienna are now filled with wounded soldiers. Furthermore, the number of Polish soldiers captured by the Germans is small, indicating that Polish resistance is extremely fierce, with soldiers preferring death to surrender. (Havas, 13th)

Near Radom, in the German rear A German military expert recently estimated that the total number of German casualties since the outbreak of the war is between 12,000 and 15,000, with the heaviest losses occurring in the past two days, as the Germans advanced towards Radom, the San River, and the Bug River, where fierce battles were fought. According to German official statistics, there were also fierce battles on the front lines during the first week of the initial German-Polish contact, so there must have been significant losses in the military formations near Radom and the San River. (Associated Press Special Correspondent, 13th)

Danzig A German tank officer, speaking to a Berlin correspondent of the Politische Zeitung, estimated that German deaths and injuries had reached 15,000, with Polish deaths and injuries at least ten times that number. He also stated that because the Germans could not hold prisoners, they had to shoot all Polish soldiers captured during the war. The Polish people fought bravely, and Germany would have great difficulty conquering Poland. (Reuters, 13th)

### Goering Inspects the Front Lines

(Berlin) General Goering visited Führer Hitler at the Supreme Command yesterday and gave a two-hour report on the activities of the German Air Force in Poland and the plans he had adopted as chairman of the Defense Cabinet Council. He then flew by plane to an area somewhere between Warsaw and the Carpathian Mountains to inspect the air force units fighting in the vicinity. (Havas, 13th)

### Indiscriminate Air Raids

(Berlin) The German Air Force continued to bomb roads, bridges, and railways east of the Vistula River. Three sections of trains at the Krystynopol train station were hit and caught fire. The aircraft factory in Biala Podlaska was also hit and burned. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

(Berlin) Officials here announced this evening that German air force units participated in the fighting near Kutno today, greatly assisting the advance of the army. The railways from Sambor to Lviv, Stryj to Lviv, Krasnik to Lublin, and Warsaw to Bialystok have been bombed and cut. Polish troops and vehicles on the highways from Warsaw to the east and northeast have been attacked. (Havas, 13th)

### Germany's War Against Poland Cannot Be a Swift Victory: Threatens to Bomb Unfortified Cities; Plans to Increase Troop Strength on Both Eastern and Western Fronts

(Berlin) According to an announcement issued today by the highest German military authorities, Germany will spare no possible means to destroy Polish resistance. This means bombing unfortified cities to force Poland to submit. According to a message from the Führer's headquarters, local officials and officers in Poland are now ordering civilians in all towns and villages to resist the German forces. At the beginning of the campaign, the German side stated that it did not intend to bomb unfortified towns, but if these towns turn into battlefields, that would be another matter. This responsibility should be borne by the Polish government and its military leaders. It was also stated that German mechanized units today broke through Polish lines east of Warsaw and advanced south, hoping to cut off the retreat of Polish forces defending Warsaw. Polish forces advancing in Galicia are continuing to attack Polish forces. Nowy Sacz and Krakow have been occupied by the Germans, and the German vanguard has reached Lwow. (Associated Press, 13th)

(Paris) According to military experts here, as the war develops, Germany really needs to increase its troop strength on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. It is rumored that Hitler has decided to recall another 2.25 million men, one million of whom will be sent to the Western Front as reinforcements, and another one million to Poland, in order to destroy Polish resistance as soon as possible. However, as of now, Germany has not yet conscripted manpower from Austria and Czechoslovakia. Judging from the German soldiers who have been captured, the ages vary greatly, indicating that its reserves, regular army, and youth army have all been mobilized. (Associated Press, 13th)

### German War Reports Exaggerate Victory

(Berlin) The German High Command issued a statement today stating that the northern and southern wings of the German forces on the Eastern Front continued to pursue the enemy yesterday. Sambor and Jaworow were occupied. The Polish forces trapped south of Radom have been defeated. Five Polish divisions and two cavalry divisions besieged near Grodno attempted to break out but were unsuccessful. The German forces are concentrating their attacks. German forces have broken through the highways east and southeast of Warsaw and crossed the road from Warsaw to Siedlce, 40 kilometers north of Brest-Litovsk. The Polish 18th Division retreated south from Lwow, moving slowly, and is now fighting the German forces north of the Bug River. (Havas, 13th)

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a war report stating: (1) After the central Polish forces were surrounded by our forces south of Radom, their resistance was destroyed. We captured many prisoners in this battle and seized a large number of spoils. (2) Our southern forces are advancing victoriously towards Rambervillers. (3) Our southeastern forces have occupied Sambor and reached the south bank of the Dniester River, while motorized units have captured Krakowiec. (Havas, 12th)

### Electricity-Controlled Machine Guns: New Weapons Used by German Forces on the Western Front

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Electric, "Daily News" Paris report, according to French officials, the German forces on the Western Front are now using electricity "remote control" machine guns to defend against the French advance. Dr. Yamauchi, professor of mechanical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University, said that he had heard of this weapon, which had been tested abroad, but had not heard of it being used in the military. This machine gun is thought to be controlled by a generator from a distance. However, it is questionable whether it can be used to attack enemy forces. The remote control method has also been designed for use in anti-aircraft guns. (13th Electric)

### Middle-Aged and Elderly German Men Forced Onto the Battlefield: Experienced in Two Major Wars; More Young People Remain Behind

Amsterdam According to a Berlin dispatch in a Dutch newspaper, German men aged 47 and 48 have now been conscripted. Most of these men participated in the World War more than 20 years ago. The German government does not want to conscript young men who are very useful in industry, so as not to disrupt the domestic economy. Moreover, since many young men have not received military training, they feel that it is better to conscript middle-aged men. (Reuters, 13th)

### London Evacuates Government Agencies; Cabinet Members Remain in Capital to Work; Paris Zoo Relocates

(London) According to official sources, some government agencies that can operate normally without being located in the capital and without impairing their efficiency will now be moved from London to other places. It is reported that about 7,000 to 8,000 people will move out of London with them. As for the government itself, it will remain in London. All matters directly related to wartime affairs will not be relocated. (Reuters, 13th)

Beijing The Paris Zoo has also followed London's example and evacuated completely. The most valuable animals have been transported to various provinces, and various poisonous snakes and less important animals have been slaughtered. (Havas, 13th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that a general political department will be established soon. (Reuters, 13th)

### Heavy Artillery Fire on Western Front; British Forces Join Combat; French Forces Advance on Siegfried Line; Fierce German Counterattacks Repelled

(Paris) According to French military reports released here, British forces fought for the first time on the Western Front lines today. A large contingent of well-equipped British troops are now participating in the war. All French newspapers tonight published news of the British troops being baptized by fire in prominent positions. (Reuters, 13th)

(Paris) The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 19 stating, "Yesterday, both air forces were very active, and the enemy artillery bombarded throughout the night." (Havas, 13th)

(Paris) According to sources here, since the French forces occupied the Forêt de la Warndt, the momentum of their advance has become more obvious. Saarbrucken is now under real threat. According to the French General Headquarters, French forces are currently continuing to advance between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, using many tanks. (Reuters, 13th)

(London) According to qualified sources here, this time the British forces were transported to France in such a way that the German side did not detect it at all, just as in 1914. However, in this era of wireless communication and long-range aerial photography, the difficulty of keeping secrets is far greater than during the last troop transport. Military observers here all believe that today's British Expeditionary Force, from the perspective of its size and equipment, is more important than the forces sent to France at the beginning of the last war. The new expeditionary force has not yet participated in combat. According to military observers, Germany originally planned to use the Netherlands and Belgium to protect its flanks and hold onto the defensive works between Luxembourg and Switzerland, waiting at leisure. But this scheme has been disrupted by French strategy. In the first week, French strategy forced the German forces to be completely exposed, so the French forces advanced safely. French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has used this to create a kind of formation that is at the pinnacle of heavy defense, and it has long been heard that this defense can be used to open up various lines of concrete attack. All observers also believe that in order to attack Poland, the German forces have transferred the defending troops from the Siegfried Line to the east, so they may feel that it is difficult to hold onto their old positions in the future. The driving force of the current war is in the hands of the French. (Reuters, 13th)

(Paris) At a time when the Polish forces are putting up a tenacious resistance to the German forces, the French forces have posed a great threat to the German forces, having broken into the "no man's land" between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The French front line has advanced from the Moselle River to the Rhine River, especially in the three areas of the Moselle-Saar front and the Vosges Mountains, where the French forces have made great progress. In the Vosges Mountains, the French front line has crossed the German border and directly approached the Siegfried Line. Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the Battle of the Marne, and the French forces continued to carry forward the spirit of Marshal Foch, inflicting heavy blows on the German counterattacks. After the German forces failed to attack the triangular positions of the Maginot Line between the Saar and Moselle rivers, their military strength has been greatly weakened. The center of gravity of the war on the Western Front has shifted to between the Moselle and Saar rivers. A war report released here yesterday stated that "there is constant contact between Saarbrucken and Blieskastel over twelve miles. Although the German counterattacks were fierce, the French forces have always maintained a superior position. The German forces launched an attack with three of their most elite divisions and achieved great success." (Associated Press, 13th)

(Paris) The famous reporter Maurice recently continued to comment on the situation of the war between France and Germany in the Le Petit Parisien, briefly stating, "Our army's offensive against the city of Saarbrucken is becoming increasingly concrete. This place is an important center of German industry and is now under serious threat. Residents are being evacuated. In addition, the German public bulletin has acknowledged that our army's artillery has bombarded the Saarbrucken airfield. Our army's artillery has continuously bombarded the suburbs of the city and the area northwest of the airfield in the past 24 hours. It is expected that the time when the German forces withdraw from the city and defend the northern positions is not far away." (Havas, 13th)

Editorial

### The High Cost of Living in Shanghai

In recent days, the cost of living in Shanghai has been rapidly increasing again. This time, the price increases are not limited to imported goods from overseas, nor are they limited to daily necessities such as rice, oil, firewood, and coal; even various public utilities are increasing their prices. Furthermore, some stores in the market are either limiting the quantity of certain goods sold or even temporarily suspending the sale of certain commodities. The development of this situation naturally has a significant impact on the residents of Shanghai. Since the destruction of the "August 13th" battle, various industries and businesses in Shanghai have not returned to normal prosperity; most of the residents have not regained their original productive capacity. Whether the society can bear this continuous economic pressure is a major concern for the public.

The rise and fall of prices are usually determined by the supply and demand of commodities; changes in the domestic currency value can also have a considerable impact. This is a natural economic phenomenon. In general, people believe that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai is due to the sharp contraction of the black market exchange rate, coupled with the outbreak of the European war and the difficulty of transportation in Shanghai. These are certainly sufficient reasons. However, in reality, there is another cause that cannot be ignored, which is the psychological effect of the general merchants and people. In the speculative psychology of a few industrialists and businessmen, they yearn for the easy profits during the First World War and deliberately raise the prices of various foreign goods; they even prefer to temporarily suspend transactions and hoard various foreign goods. They hope that, as in the past, the prices of things like dyes and fuses will rise to more than 400 times their original price; but they do not know that the economic and military capabilities of Germany this time are far less than they were in the past, and it may not be able to sustain the last European war for such a long time. At the same time, they are also aware of the volatile situation in the Far East, and they also use the excuse of difficult transportation of domestic goods to raise prices. In addition, ordinary residents, because of the continuous increase in prices, are dominated by a sense of fear. To avoid the losses of continued price increases, they try their best to store various supplies necessary for life. This sudden increase in demand naturally accelerates the rise in prices. This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out that today's Shanghai is no longer the Shanghai of the First World War period. In the past, Shanghai had extensive connections with the vast inland areas economically, so after the interruption of Eurasian transportation, it promoted the extreme prosperity of Shanghai's industries and businesses. Therefore, a part of the raw materials and tools urgently needed by Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles that could not be produced domestically were able to rise sharply in price. However, the current Shanghai exists under special circumstances. The economic relationship with the occupied areas is simply a risky undertaking; and commerce with the inland areas is severely restricted due to special circumstances. Relatively speaking, the only free thing is foreign trade. If Shanghai's overseas transportation is cut off, it will inevitably become a truly isolated island. At that time, the raw materials that Shanghai needs will of course have no way to purchase, and Shanghai's commodities will have no market to sell. Where can high-priced foreign goods be sold, and various daily necessities may not be easily bought and sold at high prices. In short, the soaring prices caused by speculative psychology are not only an illusion but also a suicidal policy. As for ordinary residents storing commodities, it is also close to ignorance; because after the stored commodities are exhausted, will they not suffer the same impact of rising prices? Moreover, whether prices will continue to rise is used as a reason for storing, but whether prices will continue to rise is fundamentally a question.

The rise in prices during extraordinary times is a common thing. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, prices in the Chinese mainland were higher than before the war. After the outbreak of the European war this time, prices in countries such as Britain and France also rose immediately. Such an increase in prices is a consistent trend in all industrial sectors, and the impact on the lives of ordinary people is relatively small; moreover, under government control, there are appropriate measures to deal with it, and it will never be allowed to cause a major social crisis. However, the current Shanghai, due to its complex international relations, has invisibly become a free city; the laws and regulations of the Chinese government cannot be enforced temporarily, and only a few unscrupulous merchants are allowed to engage in speculative activities in the market; in addition, Shanghai's industries and businesses, under the current circumstances, cannot establish close ties with any place. The unresolved problem of food rice for a long time is a good example.

In the past, we have requested the authorities responsible for public security in the concessions to strictly monitor Shanghai's economic activities, and we have also requested speculative merchants to abandon the attempt to profit from disasters out of human sympathy, but due to the limitations of the facts, the effect has been minimal. In fact, dwelling on how Shanghai is and how it is is not of much significance; fundamentally, one should ignore how safe Shanghai is and how prices are, and go to the southwest as much as possible and go deep into the interior. Build a future paradise with your own labor and money. If you want to solve the difficult problems of national industries and businesses during wartime, you can only try your best to move capital inland, so as to avoid the various exploitations and oppressions of the special environment, and at the same time, you can also receive various help and rewards from the government. In that case, you can not only get rid of the exploitation you can encounter in Shanghai, but also fully assume the responsibility of a national standard.

### England and France Thoroughly Cooperate in Politics and Military to Overthrow National Socialism

The Two Countries Held a Joint Military Meeting Yesterday, Chamberlain Reported on the War Situation to the House of Commons

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the details of yesterday's Supreme Military Council meeting to the House of Commons today, saying that the purpose of the meeting was to allow direct personal exchange of opinions between the British and French commanders in the earliest possible stage of the war. Both sides fully studied the current situation and discussed the plans to be taken in the near future. Meetings will continue to be held when necessary, so that the two countries can maintain the closest possible contact on all key aspects of conducting the war, and of course, exchange views on the current situation of the two countries. The Prime Minister said, "I am very happy to assure the House of Commons that the public opinion on both sides of the English Channel is completely aligned. The people of France and England are not only determined to fully respect their obligations to Poland, but also determined to persist to the end, ending the intolerable pain of living under the threat of Nazi aggression, as a one-time solution. French comrades, like us, are a nation that truly loves peace, but they realize that there can be no peace until Hitlerism is completely eliminated, which is no less than our own." The Prime Minister then briefly described the current situation on the various battlefields, saying that "new evidence of the determination of the overseas autonomous territories is now being transmitted every day, not only in words, but also in actions. Several steps of a far-reaching nature have been taken in the military and civil affairs, all of which are moving towards a single goal, that is, to carry out a common aspiration and fulfill a common mission." The Prime Minister continued, saying that the number of foreign countries declaring neutrality is increasing, but the European armed alert, which was caused by the direct threat of the Nazis to civilization, has not been relaxed. The Eastern Front is still the main center of operations. The German army seems to be trying to win a quick victory on the Eastern Front to avoid being forced to transfer troops to the Western border to cope with the threat of an attack by our allies. The reason why Germany has not been able to move troops to the West so far is due to the indomitable spirit of the Poles, who are not subdued by the material pressure they have encountered or the absolute superiority of the German air force. On the Western Front, the French army has begun a systematic advance, which is a major and significant initial phenomenon. The French side, of course, maintains silence on this, but what has been discovered so far is that the French army has achieved complete success. There is now a certain statement saying that the British Expeditionary Force has fought with the enemy on the border. Although this statement is not very accurate, the British army has indeed arrived in France, but has not yet participated in the war. As for the air force, normal reconnaissance and patrol work continues. Several squadrons of the Royal Air Force are now operating from French territory. The British Air Force continues to conduct reconnaissance flights over German skies and has obtained a lot of useful information about the activities behind the German lines."

United Party member Adams rose to speak and asked whether the government was considering issuing a statement on the war's aims, including helping the Czechs break away from German rule.

The Prime Minister replied that the best way to know the government's war aims was to refer to the various principles it had published, and that Britain had joined the war to safeguard these principles. The Prime Minister went on to mention his telegram to the former Czech President Benes, which stated that "the various principles that led us to join the war are expected to triumph and enable the Czech nation to break away from foreign rule." (Loud cheers) (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)

### Details of the Supreme National Defense Council Meeting

(London) The Anglo-French Supreme Military Council met yesterday and confirmed the determination of Britain and France to wage the war with all their human and material resources and to provide all possible assistance to the brave and resistant Poland. This was the first meeting held in France since the outbreak of the war. The British representatives were Prime Minister Chamberlain and the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Admiral Chatsfield. The French representatives were Prime Minister Daladier and General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces on the Western Front. The Italians took military aircraft between England and France. The purpose of the meeting was to directly exchange views on the current situation and the plans to be adopted in the future. According to observers, the fact that this first meeting was held less than ten days after the outbreak of the war shows the long-standing close relationship and absolute trust between the governments of Britain and France. The personal contact between the authorities of the two countries also demonstrates the intention of the two governments to cooperate effectively in order to implement their well-prepared and rapidly implementable plans. Londoners learned of the news of the meeting between the British and French authorities and the landing of British troops in France, which has aroused a very good impression, recognizing this as clear evidence of Britain and France actively preparing to move towards their common goal. (Reuters, 13th)

It is reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly advocated at yesterday's meeting that no separate peace should be made with Germany, so that even if all of Poland falls, the war will not be stopped as a result. It is generally believed here that Germany wants to break the Anglo-French cooperative front by means of an indirect solution, but since Chamberlain and Daladier have announced their close cooperation, the two countries must provide all kinds of assistance to Poland. In addition, the Supreme Council also studied the status of Italy as a neutral country. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Sir Chatfield traveled to France on the Royal Air Force's fastest aircraft, which had an average speed of 300 miles per hour and was protected by a squadron of fighter jets. It was learned here that the meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street until late last night. The Supreme Council will be held from time to time in the future. (Associated Press, 13th)

(Paris) The French semi-official circles attach great importance to the joint meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme National Defense Committee, saying that this meeting was technically prepared in advance by the military authorities of both countries, and will continue to be held in the future. The actions of the two countries are both parallel and integrated. The last paragraph of the communique praises Poland's heroic resistance and declares that Britain and France are determined to provide full assistance, so that Germany will not be able to use its divisive tricks. In short, the war between France and France will not be localized. In addition to the cooperation between the various parts of the British Empire and Britain, Britain and France are also jointly planning to deal with Germany economically, in order to cut off its sources of supply. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Paris) The newspapers in this area have unanimously praised the joint meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme National Defense Committee, saying that this is the best answer to the speech given by German Aviation Minister Goering on the 10th of this month. The hope that the country's authorities want to avoid defeat and thus conduct peace talks has vanished. In addition, the military cooperation between Britain and France was very slow at the beginning of the First European War in 1914, but it has now been completed quickly, which is a good thing. The right-wing newspaper "Le Petit Parisien" reported that the statements made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier in their respective parliaments have now been reiterated in the joint communique, and their nature is more solemn. Since Hitler has taken the risk of being unscrupulous, which is deeply hated, Britain and France will never allow him to evade responsibility and escape all consequences. The right-wing newspaper "L'Action Française" reported that "This communique is of great significance. In other words, Britain and France will never make peace with Germany alone, and will continue to fight until Poland has completely regained its freedom. All these countries will provide full assistance to the heroic Poland." The right-wing newspaper "Le Temps" reported that "Prime Minister Daladier secretly went to a place between Paris and London at 9 a.m. yesterday to meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and returned as early as 5:30 p.m." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Britain Will Not Recognize Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia and Danzig

It is Only Regarded as a German-Occupied Area. Czech Soldiers Refuse to Fight and Are Disarmed. Czechs in France Are Organized into an Army

(London) The Foreign Office issued a statement stating that the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia, the Slovakian state, and the Free City of Danzig should all be regarded as German-occupied areas. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Paris) According to news received by French semi-official sources from Bratislava (formerly in Czech territory), a large unit of Slovakian soldiers refused to board a train to the Polish front yesterday, with soldiers saying they were unwilling to fight the Polish. Several people were arrested in the Bratislava barracks, and it is now known that Slovaks who are aviators are not allowed to fly aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

The Hague "People's Newspaper" recently reported that the number of Slovakian soldiers who fled to Hungary because they were unwilling to fight against Poland has reached as many as 10,000, all of whom have been sent to Gaja City by the Hungarian government for shelter. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Paris) Czechs throughout France are now enlisting in the ranks one after another. The French authorities plan to form two divisions of Czech troops to fight alongside the British and French armies. They will be trained by 600 officers and non-commissioned officers who fled from the Czech Republic in March. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### People of New Zealand Eagerly Enlist

(London) The Information Department issued a statement stating that the subjects of the New Zealand self-governing dominion have been very enthusiastic about enlisting in the army in recent days. The authorities plan to recruit thousands of new soldiers there, but on the first day, more than 2,100 people signed up, so it is expected that the required number will be recruited within a few days. In addition, the original quota of 18,000 reservists in the autonomous territory has now been increased to 30,000. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

The United States Considers Its Attitude Towards Navigation Issues

### American Aircraft Will Expand Market in China

(Washington) According to news here today, in the first seven months of this year, 86% of U.S. aircraft exports were to countries such as Britain and France, totaling US$108,000,000. However, since the outbreak in Europe, the U.S. neutrality law has taken effect for the warring countries, so 86% of U.S. aircraft exports have been stranded. The only remaining aircraft markets for the United States are China, South America, the Netherlands, and India. According to experts, China's civil aviation still has the potential for continued development, so the United States may as well sell its remaining aircraft to China.

(Washington) President Roosevelt gave a speech at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, on August 19 last year, stating that "The Americas are no longer a distant continent that cannot be shaken by overseas disputes. If Canadian territory is threatened, the American people will not stand idly by." The President told the press that this speech also applies to the territories in the Americas held by European countries, such as British Guiana, British Honduras, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Pierre. The essence of the Monroe Doctrine has always been to prevent new empires from plundering the territories of American countries, or plundering the territories in the Americas held by European countries, and my speech at Kingston University only reiterated this traditional attitude of the American government. Now that the American government and the other countries of the American continent get along very well, and they are also on friendly terms with the European countries that originally held territories or islands on the American continent, the United States does not want to see other European countries have intentions on these territories and islands. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Washington) The scope of the American Monroe Doctrine has been expanded by President Roosevelt to include the territories of European countries in the Western Hemisphere. This was announced by Roosevelt in his speech yesterday. He said that the United States has promised to defend Canada's integrity and prevent foreign attacks.

### The New Abe Cabinet Announces Its Political Program, and the Prime Minister's Power Is Increased

(Tokyo) The Abe Cabinet's political program and policies were officially decided on the 12th. Prime Minister Abe paid a visit to the Emperor at 11:30 this morning and presented them. The contents were announced at noon as follows: "The current cabinet will continue to work hard to adjust diplomacy and strengthen national defense, stabilize the lives of the rear, and implement the following key tasks in the current serious situation: (2) The fundamental policy places the core of policy on handling the China Incident and adhering to an independent position abroad to deal with complex and delicate international situations. Domestically, it will strive to enrich military preparations and cultivate basic national strength, and integrate and concentrate all internal and external policies on this purpose, with the expectation of realizing the unity of Japan and Manchuria and a new relationship between China and Japan. handling the China Incident, handling the China Incident is an unchangeable fundamental policy that has already been decided. Japan should go on to assist the establishment of a "new government" and cooperate in implementing appropriate policies in order to achieve the purpose of handling the incident. (3) Comprehensive economic power: Due to the current tense international situation, expand productivity to achieve self-sufficiency in defense resources, and at the same time strengthen the trade system to adapt to the new situation.

(4) Refreshing various systems: In the overall national strength, government and civilians cooperate to make the connection between various departments of the government closer, and to handle systematic political affairs quickly is an urgent task at present. Therefore, consider appropriate policies to refresh various systems and improve their operation." (Domei dispatch, 13th)

(Tokyo) This morning, all Japanese newspapers predicted that Japan's policy towards China would be reactivated. Prime Minister Abe proposed at a cabinet meeting yesterday that a new important legal system should be passed to give the Prime Minister the highest power over his cabinet members in handling important state affairs, and to bear the highest responsibility. It is reported that this state affairs refers to handling the China Incident within the scope of the constitutional provisions, and contains the understanding that it does not infringe on the Emperor's privileges, that is, "supreme command". It is reported that cabinet members unanimously agreed on the need for military, civilian, and political cabinet members to act in unison to promote national policies. Therefore, the Prime Minister will meet with the Emperor today to report on the important changes in national policy and submit the cabinet's major policy guidelines. According to Article 55 of the Constitution, cabinet members are responsible to the Emperor for the political affairs of their respective ministries. The Prime Minister's task is to ensure the unity of the cabinet, but has no active power over his colleagues, which has not changed to date. Therefore, the decision of important national policies is often hindered by the opposition of one cabinet member, which has been seen repeatedly, and even more so in the Hiranuma cabinet.

### Japan's Foreign Trade Has a Large Excess of Imports

(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance today, although Japan's trade with "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China from January to August this year was a surplus, its trade with countries outside the Japanese bloc was mostly an excess of imports. It is estimated that during this period, Japan's surplus from exports to the Japanese bloc reached 127,000,000 yen, but its excess of imports from other countries in the same period was as high as 442,000,000 yen. Therefore, in fact, "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China still cannot remedy the disadvantage of its excess of imports. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

### Imminent US Congressional Session; Factional Strife Begins; Isolationist Congressmen Vociferously Oppose Amending the Neutrality Act

(Washington) The convocation of the special session of Congress is near. Members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives have gradually returned to the capital. Isolationist senators such as Borah, Nye, Vandenberg, and Thomas are planning to obstruct the amendment of the Neutrality Act and have already begun their opposition work. Nye recently released a statement to the various newspapers, stating, "If the United States supplies munitions to the belligerent nations, it will inevitably become more concerned about the outcome of the war. It will also be easier to enter the vortex of war. This is why I oppose repealing the arms embargo clause." Nye also told a Havas reporter, "This clause will probably be repealed in the end. Once the Senate reconvenes, I will try to extend the session so that I can appeal to public opinion and at the same time monitor the government's actions." Borah also firmly expressed his opposition to amending the Neutrality Act and issued the slogan, "Repealing the arms embargo is tantamount to being drawn into the vortex of war." This statement represents the views of the general opposition. According to this faction, President Roosevelt intends to assist the democratic nations of Europe, which violates the true spirit of the Neutrality Act and should therefore be obstructed with all efforts. However, the government still expresses confidence that it will gain the support of a large majority after Congress reconvenes. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Washington) The Chairman of the House Rules Committee, Sabath, recently spoke with President Roosevelt and told reporters afterward that the President would convene Congress for a special session on October 2 to amend the Neutrality Act and repeal the arms embargo clause. President Roosevelt also told reporters, "I am about to issue a statement," but the meaning of "about to" was not specified. Regarding the reconvening of Congress, the date mentioned by Sabath, like the reports in various newspapers, is speculative. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Washington) It was announced here yesterday that Congress would convene a special session at the end of this month. The announcement was made by the Chairman of the House Rules Committee, Pace, after meeting with President Roosevelt. Pace stated that the special session would consider amending the Neutrality Act. At this time, isolationist Senators Borah and Nye vehemently opposed any changes to the Neutrality Act. Nye stated that he would lead a "last-ditch stand" to oppose amending the Neutrality Act, "because amending the Neutrality Act will inevitably draw our country into the vortex of war."

### USSR Holds Significant Weight in the Future of the European Situation; Concentrating Troops and Observing Changes; Rumors of a Non-Aggression Pact Between the USSR and Turkey

Cities of Debrecen and Basel, Switzerland. The correspondent for the Basler Nachrichten in the Latvian capital recently published an article in that newspaper entitled, "Will the Soviet Union No Longer Remain Passive?" It stated, "The Soviet Union has never pretended regarding the Polish issue, but the authorities of that country seem no longer satisfied with this. According to experts, the total number of Soviet ground forces has recently increased to two million men. The number of troops stationed in the military districts of Kiev, Chernigov, Minsk, and Leningrad has increased even more. Moreover, Soviet newspapers have recently shown a tendency to ease their stance toward Great Britain. Therefore, it is generally believed that if the related countries engage in negotiations in the future, Stalin will hardly be content to remain uninvolved." (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Geneva) Political figures here are paying close attention to the news that the Turkish Foreign Minister will soon visit Moscow to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. It is believed that this decision is related to the Turkish Prime Minister's declaration of foreign policy the day before yesterday. Forty-eight hours ago, France released information stating that Turkey would declare war on Germany. However, in view of the Turkish Prime Minister's declaration and the Turkish Foreign Minister's invitation to the Soviet Union, this rumor has been disproven. It is therefore believed here that the Anglo-Turkish pact that Britain hopes to conclude will be difficult to realize in the near future. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement is Virtually a Scrap of Paper

Furthermore, when those countries subsequently order goods from the Soviet Union, they must pay in advance. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Anglo-French-American Monetary Agreement Unaffected by the Current Situation; US Treasury Secretary Releases Statement

(Washington) US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently stated that the Anglo-French-American monetary agreement will not lose its effectiveness due to the new prices of the pound sterling and the franc. In view of the urgency of the current situation, he does not regard the new prices of British and French currencies as competitive devaluations. Britain and France are now respecting the spirit of their agreement with the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Important Meeting of Four Nordic Countries to be Held in Copenhagen; Oslo Convention Conference Concludes

Copenhagen. The Danish government has invited the heads of government of the Scandinavian countries (i.e., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) to hold a summit meeting, to be held in Copenhagen from September 18 to 19, to discuss the four countries' future diplomatic and trade policies toward the belligerent nations. One of the main issues is the future trade relations between the Scandinavian countries and the belligerent nations: whether export trade should be calculated as a percentage or whether an equal quantity of goods should be shipped to both belligerent nations. This is a matter that urgently needs to be decided. It is said that the heads of government of the Scandinavian countries will be accompanied by their foreign ministers and economic experts to attend the meeting. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### Finland Expresses Strict Neutrality; Will Maintain Trade Relations with Belligerent Nations

Helsinki. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko gave a speech on the radio about Finland's neutrality policy, stating, "Finland is determined to strictly adhere to neutrality and avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but will repel any attempts to undermine Finland's neutrality. The status of neutral countries today is different from that during the First World War in 1914. Today, neutral countries have not only increased in number but also are stronger in terms of strength than in the past. Finland will maintain trade relations with the belligerent countries to the greatest extent possible. The only obligation of the Finnish people is to avoid engaging in activities that cause misunderstandings, so that the government can maintain its neutrality policy without hindrance. In addition, the cooperation of the Oslo Convention countries is of great importance to the maintenance of neutrality by each country. No country should disregard the neutrality of other countries and take this risk." (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### Germany Will Send Large Numbers of Aircraft to Retaliate Against the British Blockade; Germany Admits That the Impact of the Blockade is Serious; The London Times Points Out the German Crisis

Copenhagen. According to the Berlin correspondent of a Danish newspaper, Germany will send 3,000 aircraft to bomb British seaports in retaliation for the British blockade. Germany admits that the result of the blockade has placed them in a serious position, but Germany will respond with aircraft and submarines. According to opinions in Berlin, destroying British seaports is the most effective way to counter the British naval blockade of Germany. The German side has declared to all neutral countries that if they do not quickly protest this blockade method to Britain and advise the British government to change its mind, then they will probably suffer the pain of war. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The semi-official Hungarian newspaper Magyar Hírlap recently published a telegram from its Berlin correspondent stating that responsible German officials said that the blockade announced by Britain was "a declaration of economic warfare." The German authorities are considering countermeasures and have ordered the submarine fleet to use [any means] in combat. However, the German authorities [are also] [negotiating] with Denmark to ease the blockade policy. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(London) Today's Times carried an article stating that over the long term, Hitlerism is not only economically and financially fragile but also spiritually unsound, and will inevitably face failure and subversion. Today, Germany's sources of borrowing have dried up, its cash reserves are quite depleted, and it is in dire need of foreign exchange. What the Nazi Party can buy at present cannot even be compared with the German Empire at the end of the Great War. Yesterday, the German mark had no exchange rate in Amsterdam. It is ridiculous for the Germans to claim that as a result of conquering Poland, Germany's coal production can increase by 25 percent, steel production can exceed 2 million tons, and zinc production can reach 100,000 tons. Even if this situation were true, it would not be worth our full attention. During the last World War, the German Empire seized everything in Poland, and the raw materials and food in Belgium and northern France, as well as in the eastern, northeastern, and southeastern war zones of Germany, were all under its control. However, the output of the above-mentioned vast territory (almost four times the area ruled by the Nazi Party) was still insufficient. The British Navy in those days and today is in the same position, that is, implementing a strict blockade to cut off all important sources of supply to Germany. The article concluded that between 1914 and 1918, Germany still had sufficient cash reserves and credit to purchase goods from neutral neighboring countries. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Duke of Windsor Returns to England; First Time Returning Home Since Abdication

(London) The Duke and Duchess of Windsor arrived in Portsmouth from France today. Because the authorities kept the matter a secret, very few people knew about it beforehand. The Duke of Windsor hastily left the country after abdicating on December 10, 1936. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the Duke in Paris last year and told him that if he returned to the country, there would no longer be any political obstacles. However, it was not until recently, when the Duke volunteered to serve the country because of the outbreak of the European war, that he was allowed to return. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(London) According to official reports, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who have been away from England for two years, have now returned to England and are staying at the home of Major Metcalfe.

### He Yingqin Speaks; General Counteroffensive is Not Far Off; Japanese Offensives Will Inevitably Suffer a Crushing Defeat in the Future; Even After Shortening the Front Lines, Their Troop Strength Will Still Be Insufficient

Chongqing. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin told an Associated Press reporter today that Chinese guerrillas are constantly cutting off Japanese transportation lines and intercepting the Japanese army's rear. A full-scale offensive, with Chinese regular troops and guerrillas cooperating with each other, is not far off. In short, all of China's military forces are now prepared for the final general counteroffensive. Although the European war will have a considerable impact on the supply of Chinese munitions, we have accumulated sufficient munitions over the years. At the same time, there are other ways to obtain foreign munitions. Furthermore, many light weapons can already be manufactured domestically. Although the mortar shells used by Chinese guerrillas still have to rely on external supply, other small arms are mostly self-sufficient. As for when we launch our general counteroffensive, we will use a large number of tanks and heavy weapons, because without this, it is not enough to talk about offensive. He Yingqin spoke of future offensives by the Japanese side, believing that they will again suffer a crushing defeat like the Japanese army suffered in northern Hubei in April. The reason for the Japanese army's crushing defeat in northern Hubei was that the Chinese side adopted a strategy of attacking the Japanese army's rear. He also said that if the Japanese army attempts to advance further, they must increase their troop strength to maintain their rear transportation lines. In other words, further advances by the Japanese army would be beneficial to the Chinese side. From a military point of view, Japan has absolutely no possibility of conquering China. If Japan wants to conquer China, it must first eliminate 200 Chinese divisions in one breath. However, from the Battle of Shanghai to the Battle of Wuhan, the Chinese side had gathered as many as 80 to 90 divisions in places such as Nanjing and Xuzhou. The Japanese side at that time used all their elite troops, but they could not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side. Not only could they not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side, but even a single brigade or regiment was not eliminated by the Japanese army. Since the Japanese side could not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side during the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Wuhan, then after the transportation lines are expanded and the terrain is favorable to the Chinese side, it will be even more impossible to eliminate the Chinese forces. Speaking of whether the Japanese side could stand firm if they shortened the front lines, abandoning Guangdong, with the Yangtze River as the southern boundary, the Pinghan Railway as the western boundary, and then crossing the Yellow River to Suiyuan in northern China, He Yingqin believed that this area was still too large for the Japanese side's current troop strength to handle. Moreover, there are many mountains in this area that can serve as bases for Chinese guerrillas, who can continuously attack the Japanese army and gradually deplete them. If the Japanese army carries out "pacification" operations, the Chinese forces in this area will be divided into smaller units, not by division but by brigade or regiment, in order to increase mobility and striking power. He Yingqin continued that the war in Europe and Japan's blockade of China cannot shake China's anti-Japanese war plan for the next two or three years. No matter what strategy the Japanese side adopts, we will definitely resist to the end. If the Japanese recognize that the war against China has ended, and hope to establish a puppet government and withdraw troops, then our supreme leader, General Chiang Kai-shek, will command a large army to drive out the puppets and the Japanese. Speaking of the actual situation of the guerrillas, He Yingqin stated that Japan has a total troop strength of 38 and a half divisions. When Wuhan fell, 31 divisions were sent to China. They also had to guard against the Soviet Union, so in fact they had no troops to transfer. Furthermore, offensive operations are already difficult, because most of the troops now have to protect transportation lines and suppress the occupied areas. The Japanese side is currently most concerned with the "pacification" work of the guerrillas in the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong. Therefore, the troop strength in those areas has obviously increased, especially in Shanxi. However, the Japanese side has launched eight attacks on the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi, all of which have failed. They have also launched three attacks on the Taihang Mountains, all of which have been unsuccessful. The reason why the Japanese side is particularly focusing on the west is that if Shanxi can be captured, the supply to the Chinese guerrillas in Hebei and northern Shanxi will be cut off. However, the Japanese side's attempt is difficult to succeed. In the Japanese army's "pacification" war against the guerrillas, the death ratio between the Chinese and Japanese sides is "two Japanese for every one Chinese." The reason for this is that the Chinese side avoids positional warfare and adopts mobile warfare. At the same time, the Chinese side also selects favorable terrain to fight the Japanese army. According to He Yingqin, based on the results of the Nanyue Conference in November last year, the Chinese military authorities sent 500,000 regular troops to the guerrilla areas to reorganize the guerrilla forces. Therefore, the current guerrillas can truly strike the Japanese side. According to He Yingqin, of the 933 counties that have previously fallen to the Japanese side, Japanese troops are only seen in 521 counties. Japanese troops are never seen in the remaining counties, and the Chinese side holds full authority. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

### Chinese Army in Southern Hebei Encircles Daming

A certain place in southern Hebei. After the two counties of Qingfeng and Puyang in southern Hebei were recaptured by the Chinese army last month, the Japanese troops entrenched in Daming were restrained. Moreover, the Chinese army continued to advance and has now completed the encirclement of Daming. On the 9th, more than 500 Japanese troops from Handan were ambushed and defeated by a certain unit of the Chinese army in Weixian Town and Yangxiaozhuang while on their way to reinforce.

### Continued Fierce Fighting Between Changzhi and Changzi

Xingji: The offensive and defensive battles for Changzi have intensified since the 6th. The Chinese army has achieved successive victories, capturing several key points near Changzi, including Bao Village, Da Li Village, Shangfang Village, Hetou Village, Xiguo Village, and Dongsong Village, directly threatening the southwest gates of the city. Subsequently, they seized the north, attempting to cut off the communication line between Boli, Changzhi, and Changzi. By this point, Japanese losses had reached 1,300 to 1,400 men. Attempting to reverse the declining situation, the Japanese army transferred over 600 reinforcements from Gaohe Town (west of Changzhi) to launch a fierce attack on Shangxiaguo Village (southwest of Changzhi). Another unit, departing from Changzhi via Shangfang Village and Daguan Village, the Japanese army in Changzi also attempted to coordinate a counterattack, re-attacking Dajingjing Village (northeast of Changzi), with over 2,000 reinforcements for Changzi. Currently, a fierce battle is raging between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the area between Changzhi and Changzi. South of Xiatian (north of Changzhi), Japanese ammunition and military supplies are being transported elsewhere in succession, indicating a possible retreat to the north. (13th Dispatch)

### Floods Strike China; Japanese Army Suffers Significant Losses; Most Small Japanese Businessmen Will Go Bankrupt; Japanese Troops Retreat from Most Towns in Hebei; Sino-Japanese War May Have Unexpected Ending

The "North China Daily News" reported from Beijing on August 31st that since the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou a year ago, the political, economic, and military positions of the Japanese in North China have undergone significant changes. At that time, the loss of these two cities greatly shook the confidence of knowledgeable Chinese in the perseverance and ultimate victory of the Chinese government. The Japanese had high hopes that Wu Peifu would establish a truly stable government in North China. However, these hopes soon began to fade, and the desire to establish a united pro-Japanese country in North China became a pipe dream.

There are three reasons for this: first, disagreements among the various factions of the Japanese army; second, the Japanese financial policy caused economic chaos in North China; and third, the Japanese army failed to eliminate the guerrillas in North China. To this day, the hope of establishing an independent country in North China is even more distant than before. A year ago, the grand plans for the revival of companies with Japanese capital reaching countless millions of yen, the construction of railways, the opening of highways, and the development of mines were all announced. Many factories were indeed built in the suburbs of Tianjin, and small Japanese shopkeepers and merchants followed suit, bringing their small savings and hoping to get rich in North China. However, to date, none of these plans have been realized, and most small Japanese businessmen are on the verge of bankruptcy.

The main reason for this situation is that Japanese military experts adopted a policy of attacking the legal tender, plunging the North China financial system into extreme chaos. The "Federal Reserve Notes" plummeted, causing the yen to depreciate as well. The yen capital of companies intending to engage in reconstruction work must now be at least doubled compared to what was announced a year ago. Railway transportation is one of the most obvious signs of deterioration, and it has never been as chaotic as it is now in the past twenty-five years. This chaos is, of course, partly due to the floods that North China encountered this summer. However, even before the floods damaged the railway transportation, there was a severe shortage of all kinds of train cars, and the Japanese could not purchase cars to replenish them due to a lack of necessary foreign exchange. Even worse was the Tianjin flood.

Causing the Japanese huge economic losses, goods worth millions of Japanese yen and a large amount of military supplies were destroyed. Hundreds of houses in the Japanese concession must be rebuilt, and many newly built factories were severely damaged and are completely useless. The capital of thousands of small Japanese businessmen was completely lost. The worst thing is that 2 million customers have lost their purchasing power. The cotton harvest in southern Hebei was completely destroyed. However, when the Japanese army set out to China with the intention of taking risks, one of the baits used to lure Japanese business circles was North China's raw cotton. The Japanese army has been conducting a campaign to suppress guerrillas for more than a year, but has not achieved significant victory. The guerrillas are as active as ever in and around Beijing and in the mountains along the Pingjin Railway. Due to the flood, the Japanese troops stationed in various towns in central Hebei have mostly withdrawn. The Japanese army boasted that the flood could drive out the guerrillas, but they themselves were also driven away. The flood did not help the Japanese army at all. The war in southern Shanxi, which the Japanese army has been conducting for several months, has not been victorious and has been very costly. Although the new Mongolian government has recently been established, the Japanese troops stationed in northern Suiyuan are now under great threat. The Japanese army does not have enough troops to pacify North China, and it is heard that in recent weeks, even more Japanese troops have been transferred from Beijing to the Northeast. The recent signing of a non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was a particularly significant blow to the Japanese military in North China.

Japanese civilians have many complaints about the improper manipulation of Japanese foreign policy by the military, and the Japanese military, not a few weeks ago, was still assuring the whole country that solving all their difficulties lay in forging a military alliance with the then-prevailing anti-communist axis. The recent sudden change in Soviet policy, ordinary people dare not rashly guess what kind of policy the Soviet Union will take in the Far East, but the Japanese military circles here believe that after Germany and the Soviet Union sign the agreement, the Soviet Union will increase military pressure on the border of Manchuria. Even the most arrogant Japanese warlords no longer believe that Japan can fight China and the Soviet Union at the same time, because Japan has been trapped in the Chinese quagmire for two years and its resources have been exhausted. The current military has separated a large number of troops and military supplies to Manchuria front line, will certainly not help the revival and pacification of North China, the Chinese asked recently spread strange rumors, said that the Japanese army will withdraw from China soon, these rumors, of course, only the idea of hope, but the rumors and the pessimism and melancholy of the Japanese here, at least a sign of the difficulties encountered by the Japanese side in North China, some observers, expect that if the Soviet Union threatens "Manchukuo" becomes a reality, and the situation there is getting worse, or will make the Sino-Japanese war sooner than expected.

### Hong Kong Government Implements Control of Public Utilities; German Nationals Reside in Concentration Camp

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the European War, the British government has been very effective in maintaining the security of Hong Kong, an important port in the Far East. The German nationals who had been living in Hong Kong have had their freedom of movement restricted and have been accommodated in a concentration camp. There are 92 men and women residing in the camp. Daily life in the camp is scheduled, and food is supplied as usual. It is also stipulated that relatives of the Germans are allowed to visit on Wednesdays and Saturdays. In addition, everything is treated very well.

Hong Kong and Kowloon are in a state of war, so all public utilities are controlled by the government. This is a necessary measure to maintain wartime security. The controlled items are approximately as follows:

(1) Implementation of Telegraph Censorship: Hong Kong is a transportation hub in the Far East, where people from all directions gather. In order to prevent espionage activities, the government announced the following measures for censorship and restrictions on sending telegrams on the first of the month: (1) The use of codes or numerical codes is prohibited in telegrams. (2) All telegrams must be limited to using one of the following two languages: English or French. (3) The surname or shop name of the sender of the telegram must be included in the telegram and the telegram fee paid accordingly. (4) Registered telegraph addresses must not use abbreviations and must not use any other language other than English or French. After the promulgation of this ordinance, the Hong Kong overseas Chinese considered it inconvenient and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce signed a request to the Hong Kong government to allow the use of Chinese when sending telegrams. The reason is that the majority of overseas Chinese do not understand English or French. If restrictions are imposed, the impact on industry and commerce will be great. Before approval, overseas Chinese generally take their Chinese telegrams to Macau to send them.

(2) Execution of Mail Inspection: The government sent several mail inspectors to the Hong Kong post office at the beginning of the month to perform their duties, and appointed a director to oversee their work. All express, registered, and insured letters are inspected, and once they pass, they are delivered. Ordinary letters, postcards, and commercial documents that are mailed according to procedures will not be withheld, but delays are inevitable. Small parcels, packages, printed matter, and samples are completely suspended from mailing. If printed matter is certified by the chief inspector, it can still be mailed as ordinary mail.

(3) Control of Foreign Exchange: In order to maintain the British foreign exchange resources, the Hong Kong government has implemented restrictions on the transaction of various currencies in the Hong Kong financial market, except for the British pound, from September 8, 1939. Those who want to purchase foreign exchange can only do so through one of the British banks authorized by the Hong Kong government or one of the foreign banks operating in Hong Kong. Foreign exchange can only be sold if the following conditions are met: 1. Needs arising from contracts signed before September 3, 1939; 2. Reasonable commercial needs; 3. Reasonable expenses for travel or personal use. The currencies subject to restrictions include common silver coins of the United States, France, the Philippines, the Netherlands, China, Argentina, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Belgium. Transactions in British pounds and currencies linked to the British pound are currently not restricted. All banknotes, gold coins, securities, and currencies of various countries are strictly prohibited from being smuggled out of the country without special permission from the government. However, Hong Kong banknotes and Chinese banknotes can still be freely transported out with the special permission of the Governor of Hong Kong. Regarding gold coin transactions, private transactions are not allowed without a special permit. It is found that Hong Kong's foreign exchange to Germany has been completely stopped. The price of Chinese national currency in Hong Kong has suddenly risen from 29 to 33 (that is, 100 Chinese national currency yuan is worth 33 Hong Kong dollars).

(4) Control of Food: Food control in Hong Kong is handled by a commissioner. The commissioner is a British person named Thunter. Yesterday, Thunter instructed food merchants not to take the opportunity to manipulate food prices and prohibited overseas Chinese from hoarding. The purchase of rice should only be sufficient for daily use and should not be excessively mixed in, so as not to affect supply and demand. If rice merchants hoard, they will be sanctioned. The Food Control Commissioner has the power to restrict the production, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of food, and, if necessary, to set public prices for food, allowing no unscrupulous merchants to manipulate prices. According to investigations, the current stock of rice in Hong Kong and Kowloon is sufficient for six months. Recently, white rice from Annam and Siam has been continuously transported to Hong Kong. On the 7th, another 15,000 bags were transported in. However, due to the current situation, the price of white rice of upper, middle, and lower grades has risen by more than 2 yuan per 100 catties.

### Negotiations Show No Progress; Japanese and Puppet Authorities Expand Infringement of Rights and Interests

Yesterday, They Again Occupied a Giant Building on Haig Road; The Chief Inspector Expressed His Determination to Maintain Police Authority

The Report of the US Sending Marines to Shanghai Has Been Denied

It was widely rumored among foreigners the day before yesterday that the U.S. government had issued a warning to Japan, stating that the U.S. absolutely could not tolerate Japan's unilateral actions to change the status of Shanghai. However, U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday at a press conference that one of the U.S. foreign policy principles is that "The U.S. opposes any unilateral change to the status of the Far East through the use of force or other means." If this is consistent, international affairs experts deduce that the U.S. will not interfere with the Japanese military's attack on the Shanghai Concessions within a certain scope, and trusts the British and French governments to handle it properly. However, if Japan's actions exceed a certain limit and harm the status of the Concessions, then the U.S. will definitely abide by its promises and take action. This is a proper argument. Unfortunately, just as the Shanghai Municipal Council was beginning negotiations with the Japanese side regarding the extension of roads beyond the boundary and the transfer of police authority, Japanese military police and puppet police suddenly occupied the building at 448 Haig Road again yesterday afternoon and stationed guards in front of the door. Their scope of action is expanding. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:

Washington, D.C., AP, 13th: The U.S. Navy Department officially denied today reports that the Sixth Marine Regiment had been ordered to sail to China.

### Japanese and Puppet Authorities Invaded Haig Road Yesterday

Just as the area around Siccawei Road and Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai had not yet returned to its original state before the 9th of this month, the Japanese military and puppet police, numbering more than sixty, occupied a giant building yesterday afternoon. It can be seen that their desire to be firm is endless. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency inspected western Shanghai yesterday and witnessed the invasion of Haig Road by the Japanese and puppet authorities yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below:

Openly Armed; Parading in Formation

Since before the "August 13th Incident," the Concessions had actively deployed defenses in the Haig Road area. A concrete and steel bunker was built at the end of Shanzhong Road, Route de la Consulaire, and Avenue Joffre to defend. West of Ferguson Road, all roads and alleys were equipped with barbed wire, cutting off traffic with the French Concession, because a large number of puppet police were stationed in that area, and strict precautions had to be taken. Armored vehicles were sent out on patrol from time to time, but the puppet police sometimes openly armed and paraded in formation on Haig Road. Because there was no mutual violation, no accidents occurred.

Occupied Giant Building; Stationed Guards at the Entrance

The giant building at 448 Haig Road occupies a wide area and has the beauty of a garden inside. The building is the property of a Taiwanese man named Lin. Lin passed away several years ago and his family has been living there since. Recently, there was an attempt to sell the house, but no agreement was reached. Two months ago, it was rented out to someone to open a Paradise Club. Preparations were ready and the club was about to open, but the French Concession authorities blocked its gate with obstacles, making it impossible to access. The club was dissolved. Lin's family then obtained permission from the French Concession authorities to move a small part of the barbed wire and moved back into the house. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, more than ten Japanese military police and more than forty puppet police, divided into two military trucks, drove out of Siccawei Road and Ma Lu Bridge and went directly to the front of the building, knocked on the door, invaded, and occupied it. Armed puppet police and two Japanese military police were immediately sent to the front of the door to station guards. The owner of the house is still living inside, but Lin's family seemed to have heard the news yesterday morning and began to move some furniture and belongings out through the servants. After the Japanese and puppet authorities occupied the house, the political department of the French Concession police force sent personnel to investigate and then withdrew without comment.

Building Bunkers; Intent to Stay for a Long Time

In front of the 30th refugee shelter of the Tzu Lien Branch at 11 Siccawei Road, there are still four puppet police stationed, but the Japanese military police and puppet police inside have been reduced to more than ten. Next to the gatehouse of the house, there was a flat house where refugees lived. Yesterday, the puppet police drove out the refugees and converted it into a kitchen. The side door of the house, which was originally a temporary way in and out for refugees and middle school students, has been guarded by two puppet police every night since the night before, paying attention to the entry and exit of refugee students. All those entering and leaving 15 Siccawei Road are plainclothes police, the number is unknown. Sandbags were originally piled up at the entrance of the Xiqu Command Post of the Ma Lu Bridge Japanese military police. Since yesterday, a bunker of bricks and cement has been added around the sandbags. The situation at the staff dormitory of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road and the Siming Villa in Zhongshi New Village on Yuyuan Road remains as it was the day before. However, the number of puppet police at the entrance of the Qianjia Lane opposite Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road has been reduced to two.

The negotiations on the police affairs on Outer Ring Road have now begun. The issues that will be discussed include the power of the "Municipal Government" to set up a police station on Route de Zikawei and to send police to the Outer Ring Road near the Jing'an Temple Police Station. To date, the negotiations have made little progress. At the same time, there has been no development in the western district. The "Municipal Government Police Station" has not continued to send additional police officers to the Outer Ring Road, except for the police officers sent to the Outer Ring Road on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The whole issue is expected to be resolved through negotiations within a few days.

### Negotiations Have Not Made Progress

The "North China Daily News" stated that the negotiations on the Outer Ring Road in western Shanghai were heard to have been in progress yesterday (the 12th), and no solution to the problem has been obtained. However, this matter is still kept secret. It is believed that those participating in the discussion are the consuls of the public concessions, the foreign troops stationed in the western district, and the armed Chinese police and Japanese military police hired by the so-called "Shanghai Municipal Government." As in the previous days, the situation in the district has not changed on the surface. The Shanghai Times also stated that yesterday afternoon, responsible parties heard that the Shanghai Times about western Shanghai.

### British and American Cooperation; Determined to Maintain

The Shanghai Concessions are the only important commercial strongholds of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries, and the interests of the United Kingdom in Shanghai are particularly large. The reporter therefore inquired at the British Embassy Office in Shanghai yesterday morning about the true attitude of the United Kingdom towards the Concessions issue. According to Mr. Dale Ting, the secretary of Ambassador Cole, the United Kingdom certainly cannot give up its interests in the Shanghai Concessions. We firmly believe that although the European War has broken out, the determination of the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate and maintain the status of the Shanghai Concessions is undoubtedly.

### Chief Inspector Bowen; Important Expression

Chief Inspector Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, who bears the highest responsibility for the police administration of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been praised by the Japanese as "currently working hard to resolve the current difficulties." He went to Qingdao on vacation, and his duties were taken over by Smith. He recently returned to Shanghai after a three-week vacation and went to the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 11th to cancel his leave and work. He made an important statement to the visiting Japanese newspaper reporter on the issue of building roads beyond the boundary the day before yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council is determined to maintain the original state of the police power over the extension of roads beyond the boundary. (2) The actions of the Japanese and puppet authorities in building roads beyond the boundary will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion. (3) Considering that the European situation is deteriorating, all countries should jointly be responsible for maintaining the security of the Concessions. Therefore, he hopes that the British and Japanese sides can cooperate in general issues related to the Shanghai Concessions. In addition, Bowen denied that there was friction between the British and Japanese in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and that the Shanghai Municipal Council had no discriminatory treatment towards the Japanese police force. It is currently considering that in the future, when police officers are supplemented, Japanese with equal abilities will be recruited first. ""

### Japanese Spokesperson Denies; Demanding That the British and French Withdraw Their Troops

Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, a Western reporter questioned the Japanese spokesperson at the Japanese news conference about whether they had received any reply from the British and French governments regarding the Japanese request for the withdrawal of troops stationed in China. The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy claimed that Japan had not formally made the above request to the British and French governments. The sleeping China has awakened.

### After the War Ends, China Will Benefit the Most

By American Economist So-Tan

The mainland newspaper reports that Mr. Babson, a leading American economist who was the first to predict the financial chaos of 1929, arrived in Shanghai last night (the 12th) aboard the Coolidge, bound for Manila. He stayed in Shanghai for only two hours, during which his friends in Shanghai hosted a Chinese banquet. This reporter met him at the dinner. According to Mr. Babson, Shanghai will become a world financial center in forty years. Mr. Babson is quite concerned about China's future. He said that while the current war in China is lamentable,

### The End of the War

will benefit everyone, especially the Chinese people, because they will have awakened from a long-standing state of lethargy. The war has had a beneficial result, which is evident in the westward development of China. This is a phenomenon brought about by the war. Mr. Babson also said that if the

Current European War

does not end within three months, it will last at least three years. The American Republican and Democratic parties will use the slogan "We will keep America out of the war" as the basis for the 1940 presidential campaign. However, in Mr. Babson's opinion, no matter which party is elected, it will inevitably have to join England and France in the war. Today, the economic interests that the United States maintains in Europe are less than in 1914. On the other hand, Germany is now

More Able to Endure

than in the last war. The reason for this is that Germany and the Soviet Union have a trade agreement, which allows them to exchange machinery for raw materials, control trade in the Baltic Sea, and engage in foreign trade through neutral Italy. Mr. Babson also spoke about the Far Eastern situation, declaring that he believes China's closed-door policy will not last long and that foreign trade will not be prohibited. The best way for the Japanese to profit from trade now is through foreign capital.

Printing and Dyeing Industry Raises Prices

In Shanghai, in addition to the old-fashioned indigo dyeing and silk dyeing industries, there are more than 60 mechanized chemical printing and dyeing factories and more than 30 yarn dyeing factories, all of which are within the scope of the mechanized weaving industry. They consume a large amount of dyes each year, more than half of which come from Europe and America. Foreign

Dye Businesses

in this city include companies such as the German company Defu Yangxing, the British company Downham Yang Alkali Company's British Dyestuff Corporation, the American company Hengxin Yangxing, and the Swiss company Pei Ya Yangxing. Domestically produced dyes account for very little, only the caustic soda from the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, the sulfuric acid from the Xiangmao Jiangsu Chemical Plant, the sodium sulfide from the Da Zhonghua and Anliang Plants, and a few

Plant Dyes

from the interior. Since the outbreak of war in Europe earlier this month, many capitalists, seeing the unexpected profits made by dye merchants during the last European war, have been hoarding as much as possible. Within two or three days, the inventory of goods in the warehouses of various foreign firms was swept clean, causing prices to skyrocket. Generally, chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and caustic soda (i.e., caustic soda) have risen by

Nearly Doubled

The prices of dyes vary greatly. Several outstanding goods have risen four or five times, and even the lowest priced goods have doubled. This is unprecedented in recent years. In this environment, the printing and dyeing industry in this city has had to raise prices to maintain its capital. It has already been

Decided to Implement

the following measures: The mercerized dyeing factories of the dyeing and weaving industry group will add 40% to the original 10% for mercerization, and 80% to the original 20% for colors (prices for non-fading colors will be negotiated separately). The percentage increase for bleaching is the same as for colors. Other groups are also considering similar measures.

### Maritime Blockade Makes Smuggling Difficult

The Lianxing, one of the patrol boats of the Jianghai Customs that was seized by the Japanese, is now docked in the Huangpu River after being returned by the Japanese. Because the work of intercepting smuggling outside the port is currently extremely difficult. The Japanese had promised to return another patrol boat, the Yunxing, but it had not been returned as of yesterday. The news of the other seized ships is even more scarce.

### British Consulate Denies Handling Jewish Refugees Enlist in British Army

The committee organized by the consulate is to investigate the identity of Jews

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the British consul recently told reporters that the report in a certain newspaper this morning was inaccurate. No committee has been formed to handle the issue of German and Austrian Jewish refugees wishing to enlist in the British army. The committee that is currently working is to assist the British Consul-General in investigating the identity of Jews who wish to do business with British companies. Because the British government does not want to treat many German and Austrian Jewish immigrants and Czechs who oppose the Nazis as "enemies." The purpose of the committee's investigation of immigrants' identities is only for trade. As for British military regulations, they still prohibit the recruitment of non-British people.

### Former Philippine Governor-General Forbes' Second Rice Bowl Declaration

All Proceeds Donated to Chinese Refugees Leaders from All Sectors in America Participate in Leadership

Colonel Forbes, chairman of the American United Relief for Chinese Refugees, will hold a second "Rice Bowl" campaign from October 30th to November 5th to raise funds from Americans to relieve Chinese disaster victims. The main points of Colonel Forbes' declaration are excerpted below:

One Thousand Cities Hold Jointly

Mr. Luo stated that this federation is scheduled to hold a second "Rice Bowl" campaign from October 30th to November 5th in one thousand cities in the United States to raise donations to purchase food and medicine to relieve women and children refugees affected by war, famine, and floods. The first "Rice Bowl" campaign held by this federation last year was very successful, hence the holding of this year's second campaign. However, this time we should make extra efforts to raise donations in the hope that the amount raised will increase, because in the third year of a non-declared state of war, the needs of the general refugees are even more urgent.

Terrible Shortage of Medicine, Clothing, and Food

Most newspapers focus on publishing war news, and do not fully report the dire suffering of millions of Chinese refugees and the reality of their need for clothing, food, and medicine. Although the Chinese government, churches, and relief organizations have tried their best to provide relief, the medicine, clothing, and food needed by the refugees are still in great shortage. This terrible shortage has been clearly pointed out in the news from China. This association is appealing to the American people on behalf of the disaster victims of a peace-loving and friendly nation, hoping for enthusiastic and generous assistance. Many countries have been aided by the United States, such as the disaster victims of the Japanese earthquake, the refugees of the Spanish Civil War, and the expelled Jews of Germany, all of whom have benefited from it.

Sharing the Sweet Dew of Benevolent Donations

Such donations come from goodwill and should also be received. However, the people in China who are affected by the disaster that this association is appealing to for relief should also share the sweet dew. All the proceeds from this "Rice Bowl" campaign will be used for Chinese refugees. The operating expenses of this association are not paid from the donations. Leaders of American industrialists, radio stations, stage, film, and outstanding social figures are willing to participate in leading this campaign. This list will be announced soon, and further news will be reported later.

### Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Continuously Inland Areas Have Also Been Opened

Over 9,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in the Past Two Days Inland Areas Have Already Been Opened with Japanese Notices

Notice of Price Stabilization Dates to Be Issued

After the price of domestic rice soared, Yu Qiaqing and others, in order to maintain the people's food supply, initiated a group purchase of foreign rice for price stabilization, and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance for a foreign exchange of £10,000, thus ordering more than 18,000 bags of Saigon rice, which were shipped to Shanghai and arrived on the 7th, docked at the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road, and have been unloaded. It is now known that the Yihua Yangxing and Hesheng transports, which imported from Hong Kong, brought more than 4,000 bags of foreign rice on the previous day (the 10th). Yesterday, the Jinan transport of Taikoo Company also arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing more than 5,000 bags of foreign rice, which have been unloaded separately. It is said that there will be more shipments arriving later. However, although foreign rice is arriving continuously, the price of rice in this city has not yet fallen.

Rice Stockpile Increases by More Than 10,000 Shi

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council negotiated with the Japanese to open up the source of rice, the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai from various places has been increasing daily. Because supply exceeds demand, the number of rice stored in warehouses has also increased proportionally. The Bean and Rice Industry Guild conducts a survey of rice stocks every week, which is held every Monday. The total amount of rice stored in various foreign warehouses this week has increased by more than 10,000 bags compared to last week.

District Price Stabilization Purchase to Be Implemented This Week

After the first batch of 18,000 bags of foreign rice was shipped to Shanghai, 10,000 bags were distributed by the Refugee Relief Association to various refugee shelters as food for the refugees. The remaining 8,000 bags will be sold at stable prices to maintain the livelihood of the common people. After a meeting of the Rice Merchants Guild, it was decided to hold the sale in five districts, and workers were hired to build reed sheds on open spaces on North Henan Road, Carter Road, etc., as places for price stabilization. It is now known that this project was completed yesterday. According to a person in charge of the Rice Merchants Guild, the date for price stabilization is scheduled for this Saturday and a notice will be issued. Otherwise, it may be realized next Monday.

Foreign Rice Order Registration Continues

After Qing Qiaqing and others initiated the Food Maintenance Association to advocate ordering foreign rice to stabilize rice prices, various factories and groups entrusted the Accountant Association on the fourth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association Building to handle the registration procedures from the 25th of last month. By the 10th of this month, it had reached more than 10,000 bags. The initiators have decided to place the order first because the quantity to be ordered is sufficient, and request that the groups that have already obtained the forms fill them out immediately. As of yesterday, there were a total of more than 60 companies, with more than 11,000 bags. However, because some groups requested a postponement of the deadline, the association decided to continue handling the registration. As for the first meeting of orderers, they will be directly notified to participate after the initiators have made a decision.

Abundant Supply Leads to Price Weakness

Yesterday, 4,877 bags of rice were listed on the rice market, including 228 bags of japonica rice and the rest were indica rice. As for the market price, indica rice was quoted one yuan higher in the morning market, but fell back one yuan in the evening market. The best was sold for 35.5 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice dumplings were sold for 34 yuan, and local glutinous rice was sold for 33 to 34 yuan. Japonica rice was less available, so the price was more stable, with special grades opening at over 40 yuan. However, this price cannot be used as an official market price because only a few bags were traded. In general, the prices of various items will continue to fall, which is due to the abundant supply.

Rice and Grain in Production Areas Have Been Opened

According to a probe by a reporter from Da Guang, the new rice from the late-season rice harvest in the rice-producing areas of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will soon be available. It is expected that all of the latest late-season rice will be available within two months. This year, due to the favorable weather conditions, the harvest is no less than in previous years. After the rice and grain from various places were illegally blocked by the Japanese puppets, the farmers and merchants in the inland areas were in distress, and the situation became increasingly uneasy. As the new rice is about to be available, merchants from various places have protested severely to the Japanese puppet "authorities." As a result, the Japanese have posted "notices" in various counties such as Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, and Kunshan, allowing merchants to freely trade and transport. However, the taxes are extremely heavy, and the general rice merchants still cannot afford it.

### Huangpu River Rises Can Avoid Overflowing

Still Need to Guard Against in Case of Wind and Rain

Yesterday morning, due to the moon's proximity to the earth, a sudden high tide occurred, with a magnitude of 12 feet. Fortunately, the weather was clear and the tide did not reach the shore. There will be another high tide at zero hours this afternoon, with a magnitude of over 11 feet, so low-lying roads will still be flooded at that time, causing trouble for pedestrians. Also, from the 15th, there will be two tides every day in the Huangpu River, morning and afternoon, with a magnitude of about 12 feet. If there is wind and rain, the tide is likely to flood the shore, and it will not return to normal until the 20th.

### Reduced Import Tax Rates All Customs Offices Ordered to Implement

Effective from September, Reduced by One-Third Until the End of the War

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs, saying that since the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago, the people have endured hardships and sacrifices, which the government deeply appreciates. In order to make the necessities of life

Affordable

The Ministry has approved that from September 2nd of this year, all imported goods, except for the goods prohibited from import as listed in the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods during the Emergency Period promulgated on July 1st, shall be levied with an import tax of one-third of the current tax rate.

Effective Period

Until the end of the war, in addition to sending telegrams separately, you are requested to comply with the regulations and publicize them to the public. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Inspector General of Customs yesterday and learned that all

Occupied Areas

Customs offices have been ordered to implement the regulations one after another. However, in the occupied areas such as Shanghai, it is feared that it will be difficult to comply with the regulations due to obstacles in implementation.

### Woman Electrocuted While Ironing Clothes

Gu Tian, a woman from Ningbo (35 years old), lived at No. 1 of Maoxingfang on Haige Road. Yesterday at around 2:00 PM, while ironing clothes with an electric iron, she touched the electric current and fell to the ground. Her family members quickly rescued her, but she was unconscious and barely breathing. They immediately hired a car and rushed her to the hospital for treatment, fearing for her life.

### Coal Supply Uncertain Market in Chaos

Coal Briquette Vouchers Now Controlled by Hoarders Navigation to Wenzhou Open Fuel Supply Not Expected to Be Lacking

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, foreign transportation has been blocked, and transportation is not without difficulties. After the source of domestic coal to Shanghai was cut off, coal merchants rushed to order coal from coal-producing areas such as Annam and India to transport it to Shanghai to make adjustments. However, due to high costs and tight foreign exchange, all coal prices have been rising steadily for the past year. Now, the authorities in various European countries have controlled coal exports, resulting in a sharp reduction in coal shipments to Shanghai recently. The coal market has no goods to meet the market, has suspended trading several times, and prices have risen to record highs. In addition, speculators are hoarding goods, people are bullish, and the order is quite chaotic.

Outbreak of European War Encourages People

According to news from the coal industry, the market situation tended to be clear in the previous week, and the exchange rate was relaxed and costs reduced, and the market originally had hopes of easing. However, the outbreak of the European war encouraged people, and the source of supply was uncertain, causing the market price of various coal blocks to soar. The estimated price of Haifeng No. 1, 2, and 3 coal blocks has reached over 100 yuan, Hebei screened coal is about 90 yuan, and the stockpile of Hongji coal is not large, the market supply and demand are very different. Currently, there are no goods arriving in Shanghai, forming a market with no transactions, and black market trading is rampant, and top-grade small coal is even more scarce. However, coal merchants are taking the opportunity to be active, hoarding goods, and waiting for a good price to sell. It is reported that the current coal in Shanghai is about 400,000 to 500,000 tons, mostly bituminous coal. Various industries and factories have suffered huge losses due to the rising prices of coal blocks, and are very anxious.

Coal Briquette Price Increases Due to Manipulation

The price of coal briquettes on the market has been increasing daily, with some selling for more than four yuan per load. This has not only disrupted the market but also harmed the livelihood of the common people. The Coal Briquette Industry Association agreed on the market price on September 3, with a wholesale price of 67 yuan per ton and a retail price of 3.7 yuan per load. It has not changed in the past ten days. Unexpectedly, black market trading has recently occurred on the market, with prices opening at 80 yuan per ton, and the retail prices of various coal shops are inconsistent, and the situation is extremely chaotic. The reason for this is that the factories have sold too many fixed-order vouchers in the past, and most of these vouchers have fallen into the hands of speculators who are hoarding goods and unwilling to release them, causing a panic of shortage of goods on the market. In order to seek relief, the association has convened a meeting of various factories to discuss and organize a price evaluation committee to formulate a solution to the issued vouchers, with the aim of stabilizing market prices and reducing the burden on citizens. According to the investigation, although the European war has started, the source of foreign coal has not been hindered. For example, Tongcheng Company's Guba filings, Hancheng Yangxing's Xinhong filings, and Yitaixing and Dalongxing's Hongmu filings have all arrived in Shanghai in large quantities. The raw materials are sufficient, and the factory's output can also be increased, so speculators cannot manipulate the market, and the market price will stabilize naturally.

Shen'ai Ship Loads Charcoal to Shanghai

The source of charcoal fuel in this city has always relied on supplies from Wenzhou and other places. Since the Shanghai-Oujiang route was cut off, the source was cut off, causing prices to gradually soar. However, the wholesale price of raw Wenzhou charcoal is only 3.6 yuan per load, but after being transferred to hoarders, the market price is as high as about 10 yuan per load, and the citizens are deeply distressed. It is now known that the trial voyage of Shanghai-Wenzhou was successful, and the first batch of charcoal loaded by the Shen'ai ship, more than 6,000 loads, may arrive in Shanghai around the 15th and 16th of this month. The other ships will also transport charcoal to Shanghai one after another, totaling more than 50,000 loads. From then on, the fuel problem in this port can be solved.

### Guerrilla Areas Convert to Foreign Goods Ban on Transportation to Inland Areas

Parcels Mailed Before the Ban Allowed to Be Imported After Verification

Measures for banning the import and transshipment of certain foreign goods have now been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance as follows: (1) Goods manufactured in guerrilla areas using banned foreign goods as raw materials are also subject to the ban. (2) If a postal parcel contains banned foreign goods or goods manufactured in guerrilla areas using banned foreign goods as raw materials, if the customs verifies that it was mailed abroad or in the guerrilla area before the import ban was implemented at the port of entry, it should be allowed to be imported immediately.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Congestion Additional Ships Added

Yilong and Taikoo Ships Resume Shanghai-Fujian Routes Navigation on the Oujiang River Still Running Smoothly After Opening

The flourishing transportation of cargo between Shanghai and Ningbo is all caused by the long shipping schedules. If the previous shipping schedule of one trip every other day were followed, there would be no such cargo traffic and passenger congestion. Therefore, the large number of passengers and cargo is all due to long-term accumulation. The Lihe Yangxing Moufu ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 9th of last month and sailed to Zhenhai again on the 16th. It was previously heard that it would return to Shanghai yesterday, but it had not been imported by the evening. The company has no definite news. According to the calculation of the return date of this ship, it has exceeded more than a month, and according to the departure date, it has been 29 days. It is heard that it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai today.

Number of Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Increased to Nine

The Xin'anna ship, which has newly joined the shipping route, will be on her maiden voyage this morning, and the Ende ship of the company will be changed to depart at 4:00 PM today. The Haida ship has also joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. After unloading the foreign rice yesterday, she will temporarily sail to the Yangshupu River and moor. She is scheduled to return to the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road on the 15th to load Ningbo cargo and depart for Zhenhaikou around the 16th or 17th. The number of ships currently sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route has increased to nine.

British Company Resumes Shanghai-Fujian Route

The Shanghai-Fuzhou route has been suspended for a long time. Now the British Yilong Company has designated the Shenhua ship to load cargo and passengers in Shanghai this morning and sail directly to Fuzhou. She will anchor at Mawei outside the Minjiang River. She also plans to dispatch ships to resume the route with Quanzhou. It is heard that the British Taikoo Company will also dispatch ships to operate the Shanghai-Fujian route.

Dispatch Ships to Operate Shanghai-Wenzhou

After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was successfully trialed, the Xinxiangtai ship of the British company, which is represented by the Taichang Yangxing, sailed directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 10th. A telegram was received yesterday morning that it had arrived safely at the Wenzhou wharf at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Also, the Shenfu ship of the British Yilong Company loaded cargo in Shanghai yesterday and sailed directly to Wenzhou. The Shen'ai ship is currently docked in Wenzhou to load cargo.

### German Nationals Still Moving Public Concession

The Shanghai branch of the German Rickmers Line Shipping Company, located at No. 9 Edward Road, is now said to be moving to No. 620 Fourth Road in the Public Concession today (the 14th) after receiving friendly advice. The company's ships

Before the Outbreak of the European War

regularly sailed between Germany and the Far East. Since the outbreak of the war, most of the ships have been docked in the port of Hamburg, with one avoiding to Japan and one still in Wusong. Also, in the past few days, French small shops and

German Nationals

moving into the Public Concession in the French Concession have been very crowded, causing the hotels and apartments in the Public Concession to be full. However, Rickmers is the first of the large commercial firms to relocate. The Shanghai Nazi People's Relief Association and the German Women's Association have recently

Formed an Inquiry Office

located at No. 226 Nanjing Road to help German nationals who have relocated locally and German nationals who have come to Shanghai from other places to find housing and exchange information.

### Shanghai Domestic Goods Industry Plans to Establish a Joint Issuing House

The Shanghai domestic goods industry believes that the outbreak of the European War will reduce the number of imported goods coming to Shanghai, which is a good opportunity for the development of the domestic goods business. Therefore, they have jointly planned to establish a joint issuing house for domestic goods manufacturers. They have selected Nos. 356 to 358 Nanjing Road as the site, which is being renovated and arranged. Lin Kanghou has been appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee, and Liu Junlin, Zheng Dongshan, Chen Yongfang, etc. have been appointed as the directors of the preparatory office, which is located in Hengmaoli, Tianjin Road. Registration of participating manufacturers will be handled from now on, but only domestic goods manufacturers who have passed the review of the association will be allowed to participate.

### Central Shanghai Bank Telegraphed Request to Issue Subsidiary Coin Vouchers

All Sectors Request Early Issuance to Facilitate Circulation While Relieving Jiangsu Merchants' Difficulties

The Central Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coin vouchers, which have been printed by the American Yongning Company. It was originally intended to be issued as soon as possible, but the issuance was temporarily postponed due to the discovery of sample prints on the market. The head office of the bank has instructed the Hong Kong office to make serious representations to the company that printed the vouchers. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with banking circles yesterday and learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, in response to requests from all sectors, is looking forward to the early issuance of subsidiary coin vouchers to facilitate circulation and relieve the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants. It is heard that it has telegraphed the head office again, requesting that the printed subsidiary coin vouchers be stamped and circulated, and that other appropriate measures be taken.

### Gamblers Repeatedly Lost Large Sums Sent Letter to Gambling Den Demanding Explanation Den Owner Sent Five People to Reply Could Not Find Chen by Surname at Dafa Hotel Japanese and Korean Handed Over to Japanese Police Chinese Arrested by Police

The "Zi Lin Daily" reported that yesterday (the 20th) just after 7:30 PM, one Japanese, one Korean, and three Chinese entered the Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Wei Dafa Hotel and asked in which room a Mr. Chen (traveling accent) was staying. The hotel manager was behind the counter and searched the guest list, but there was no one with the surname Chen. At the same time, he recognized one of the five people as a Japanese. Not wanting to cause trouble, he telephoned the police station to report it. A squad of police officers arrived a few minutes later, equipped with a

Japanese Translator

who questioned them. According to the five people, Mr. Chen lost a large sum in a certain gambling den ("歹土") and sent a letter to the den owner demanding an explanation for his large loss, leaving the Dafa Hotel as his address. The five people were sent by the den owner to explain to Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen seems to be a frequent gambler at the den. In recent weeks, he lost a large sum and returned home.

Sent a Letter to the Den

owner demanding an explanation and said that he could go to the Dafa Hotel at 7:30 PM last night to compensate him. Only he himself knows the reason why he demanded an "explanation." The den owner undoubtedly did not want to leave "歹土", so he sent five people to "explain" to his gambling customer. The detectives investigating the case heard what the five people said, which seemed quite strange, so they notified the police department of the Japanese Consulate. A few minutes later,

Japanese Police Arrived

and questioned the five people separately, learning that what the five people said was completely true and finding that none of the five people were carrying weapons. The Japanese consulate police took the Japanese and Korean away, and the other three Chinese were taken to the Maitland Police Station for questioning.

### Dysentery Outbreak Unprecedented in Recent Years

This year's dysentery epidemic in this city is very rampant, which is rare in recent years. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital yesterday, in the past three days, the hospital's outpatient department has discovered 218 more dysentery patients. According to Mr. Deng Qingshan, the director of the hospital's medical affairs department, the source of dysentery is caused by careless diet and is transmitted quite quickly. Therefore, residents should not drink unboiled water, eat raw or cold food, and especially avoid contact with patients in order to prevent the spread of the disease.

### Husband and Wife Quarrel; Wife Hangs Herself

Shen Zhongyi from Pinghu, around thirty years old this year, and his wife Shen Peiying, thirty years old this year, lived in the attic of the Tongfeng Coal Shop at No. 203 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. On the 12th, around noon, the couple suddenly started arguing and fighting, eventually wrestling each other to the Xiafei Police Station. After questioning by the detective, Shen Zhongyi was detained for assaulting his wife, while Shen Peiying was released and sent home. Yesterday, at 11:00 AM, Shen Peiying returned home from the police station and had another argument with her husband. Afterwards, he left. After her husband left, Shen Peiying was overwhelmed with emotions and became suicidal. She hung herself with a rope on the bed frame in the room. At 1:00 PM, the second landlord, Shen Cao, discovered it and called neighbors to help, but she had already stopped breathing. The French Concession police were notified and sent her to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her. After examining the body and finding that her husband was missing, the body was collected and buried by the charity hall.

### Honest Advice is Hard to Swallow; Assaulting a Mistress; Reconciliation Out of Consideration for Past Affection Leads to Case Dismissal

Zhao Yangchun, a Suzhou native residing at No. 672 Baike Road, had been living with a young woman named Yao. Their relationship was harmonious and they appeared to be a loving couple. However, Zhao had a gambling addiction and spent almost the entire day gambling. Zhao Yao repeatedly advised him against gambling, pointing out that it not only cost them money but also wasted time and neglected their responsibilities. However, Zhao did not listen to her advice, leading to frequent arguments in recent times. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, she again advised him not to go gambling, which angered Zhao. He suddenly became violent and assaulted her. She was injured and immediately reported it to the Xin Zha Police Station, which sent detectives to take the injured woman to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, a lawsuit was filed against Zhao Yangchun for assault. The case was heard yesterday by the First Special District Local Court. Because the injuries Zhao Yao had sustained had already healed, and because she was also mindful of their long-term cohabitation, she did not want to let such a minor matter ruin their relationship. After questioning in court, since both parties had reached an understanding, the court ruled that the case would not be accepted.

### National Doctor Qi Linsheng Found Not Guilty of Rape

Chen Wang, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Lafei Road and Luban Road, previously hired lawyer He Yongsheng to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. She accused Qi Linsheng, a Henan native and national doctor working at Yongyu Lane, Lafeide Road, of enticing her nineteen-year-old daughter Chen Sanken to leave home and hiding and raping her on October 7th of last year. After interrogation by Judge Sun Penghuan, Qi was found not guilty.

### Owner of Heji Sand and Gravel Company Pelted with Feces; Three Arrested, Released on Bail Pending Further Investigation

Ying Zongqi, a Ningbo native and owner of the Yuji Yellow Sand and Gravel Company at No. 24, No. 191 Beijing Road (nicknamed "Little Ningbo," residing at No. 5 Yongle Lane, Kai Zi Road), was walking down from the sand and gravel industry tea party at the Changle Tea House, No. 500 Fuzhou Road, at 5:50 PM on the 11th of this month, and was about to get into his private car when several people suddenly stepped forward and blocked the car. One of them threw an iron can full of fecal matter at Ying, covering his face and head with the yellow and white substance. At the same time, another person stepped forward and snatched the 1,990 yuan in legal tender that Ying was holding. At that moment, Chinese police officer No. 3423, who was on duty nearby, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, and the rioters scattered and fled. The legal tender that had been snatched was scattered on the ground and was not lost. Afterwards, Ying reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, saying that he recognized the perpetrators as Fang Changgen, Wu Aji, Cao Gengui, Shi Jinsheng, Shang Aming, and others, all Ningbo natives engaged in the yellow sand and gravel business at No. 405 Dajin Road and No. 536 Sichuan Road. The reason for the attack was competition in the same industry and a failure to obtain a loan. Detective Zhang Keqin went to the Changle Tea House on the 12th and arrested Fang, Wu, and Cao. The other two, Shi Jinsheng and Shang Aming, were still at large. Yesterday, they were brought to the Criminal Court 4 of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu charged them with violent coercion and public humiliation, requesting that they be punished according to the law. He also requested an extension to investigate the accomplices. Ying Zongqi and his partner Xia Hexin, as well as the car driver Liang Yonghu, separately identified the three defendants as being present at the scene. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, he ordered a postponement for further questioning and granted bail of 500 yuan or a guarantee letter for each defendant, who were released pending further investigation. The lawyers for the defendants were Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Wu Linkun.

### Gang of Robbers Caught

### Old Man Commits Assault with a Knife

Zhou Zhenfang (23 years old) from Jiangbei, who had been running a noddle stall downstairs at the Haifang Tea House at No. 424 Haifang Road, employed a helper named Zhou Xuesheng. Yesterday morning, around 5:00 AM, Yu Chengqing (57 years old), a resident of the same address from Huai'an, suddenly attacked both Zhou with a cleaver, inflicting serious injuries. Afterwards, they were taken to the hospital for treatment. Yu was arrested at the scene. It is reported that the reason for the attack was that Yu's daughter-in-law had been having an affair with Zhou Zhenfang's brother, Zhenxiang. Yu found out about it and was furious, forbidding his daughter-in-law from going downstairs. Zhenxiang then ordered his younger brother to take advantage of opportunities to communicate with her. However, the scheme was discovered by Yu, so he attacked Zhou Zhenfang with a knife. Zhou Xuesheng tried to dissuade him, but was also injured.

### Insulting a Young Girl Punished

Huang Zhiying, a sixteen-year-old girl, was walking alone near No. 195 Lane, Maigen Road, at around 6:30 AM the day before yesterday. It was just dawn and there were few pedestrians. Two young men, Guo Jinfu (from Ningbo) and Zhu Jianfu (from Wangbei), stopped her, made fun of her, and insulted her in various ways. A nearby police officer heard her cries for help and rushed to the scene, arresting Guo and Zhu and sending them to the First Special Court. Because the case concerned public morals, the hearing was closed to the public. As a result, Judge Zai sentenced both defendants to punishment for public indecency.

### Countless Problems with Vouchers; Counterfeit Vouchers Continue to be Discovered; Case of 50,000 Counterfeit Vouchers at Heji Company Uncovered, Three Arrested, Witnesses Summoned for Further Investigation

Heji Company, an organization formed by fourteen stores including the Jingan Paper Store at No. 1921 Jingan Temple Road, issued one- and two-cent vouchers, redeemable for goods, with a total of 480,000 vouchers printed, worth more than 7,000 yuan. Since the implementation of the vouchers on July 3rd, which lasted for two months, it had been going smoothly. However, on the 3rd of this month, it was discovered that counterfeit vouchers of the same type were being used fraudulently in the market. The police of the Huishi Police Station arrested three suspects, Qiu Xigen from Qingpu, Peng Ruixiang from Haimen, and Wang Yichen from Suzhou. 24,000 counterfeit one- and two-cent vouchers were seized from the Haining Printing House, founded by Qiu Xigen at No. 1008 Haining Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to court for a continued interrogation. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that there was still one major offender at large. When questioned, Qiu confessed that he was asked by defendant Peng Ruixiang to print 50,000 vouchers, and he did not know they were for fraudulent purposes, pleading for leniency. However, the testimonies of Peng and Wang were evasive. Judge Huang ordered that they remain in custody and scheduled a further hearing with witnesses for investigation.

### Robbery and Murder Case; Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing

Wang Arong and Shen Guilin, robbers from Hangzhou, together with Qian Dechang, who is still at large, used weapons to stop and rob Chai Yunlong and Cai Jingxiao, employees of the Hengbiao Woolen Goods Store on Tianjin Road, Xiangfen Lane, in front of No. 335 Sichuan Road at around 1:00 PM on the 29th of last month. They stole 6,000 yuan in cash and shot at Cai, intending to kill him but failed. Chinese police officers No. 1436 and 2566 arrested them, along with the stolen goods, and brought them to the police station for investigation. They were sent to the First Special Court for detention. Yesterday morning, the case was filed with public prosecution on charges of robbery and attempted murder. Judge Qian presided over the trial in Criminal Court 1. Defendant Wang Arong testified that the pistol was borrowed by Shen Guirong from Pudong, and that Qian Dechang, who is still at large, was the instigator. He claimed that they did not know that Chai Yunlong was carrying a large sum of money, and that Qian Dechang found out about it and asked them to rob him.

### Robbery on Fuli Road; Gunfire as a Show of Force Upon Departure

At 11:00 PM on the night before last (the 12th), five bandits, three of whom were armed, broke into the home of Guan Peirong, a resident of Sunjiabang on Fuli Road. They robbed 170 yuan in cash. As the bandits were leaving, they fired two shots into the air as a show of force.

### Severe Flooding in Tianjin; Ninety Percent of Residents Affected; 600,000 People Homeless

Sun Shengying, Honorary Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, sent a letter from Tianjin, detailing the severity of the flooding situation. No less than ninety percent of the residents have been affected, and 600,000 people are homeless. Currently, relief efforts are divided into four areas: the British and French Concessions, the Japanese Concession, and the city area, each operating independently. However, there is not enough strength, mainly due to a lack of funds to purchase food, clothing, and medicine. Medicine is especially important, as it is essential to prevent the spread of the currently rampant epidemic. The victims in areas outside Tianjin are even more pitiful. Farmers have a small amount of leftover seeds, but they will soon run out. If they are unable to sow seeds in the future, all the land will become barren. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and people lack clothing to get through the winter. Starved and frozen, how can they prolong their lives? Currently, prices in Tianjin are expensive, having increased by 60 percent, making relief efforts even more difficult. The society remitted 20,000 yuan to Tianjin a few days ago, but this is only a temporary measure. What is urgently needed is generous donations from all sectors of society, sent to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society at No. 97 Renji Road, to provide widespread relief. The committee is managed by Mr. Han Ji, manager of HSBC; Mr. McKay, manager of Citibank; and Mr. Zhi Songsun, manager of the Bank of China (acting with Mr. Jing Lanshi), and Mr. Yan Chengde, manager of China United Trust Company.

### Zhang Guangyu Family Hall; Lawsuit over Ancestral Property Lease; Defendant Found Not Guilty of Defamation; Judgment on Invalid Lease Scheduled

At the end of Tushanwan Yude Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, there is an ancestral graveyard of the Zhang family, shared by the descendants of the first, second, and third branches of the Catholic Zhang Guangyu Family Hall, covering an area of approximately twenty mu.

to build a dyeing and weaving factory, with a lease term of fifteen years and an annual rent of 2,250 yuan. Upon learning of this, his nephews Zhang Guanghe and other family members Zhang Yunlong, Baolu, Haihe, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin jointly hired lawyer Tang Yingsong to publish a notice opposing the lease. They also jointly hired lawyer Zhu Yisheng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Zhang Yucang and Tan Xingbo of Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, seeking confirmation that the

### Lease Contract is Invalid

After seeing the newspaper announcement, Zhang Yucang filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing lawyer Tang Yingsong and Zhang Guanghe, Zhang Yunlong, Baolu, Haihe, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin of defamation, requesting that they be investigated according to the law, stating that the first defendant, representing the other defendants, published an announcement on the 28th of last month accusing the plaintiff of privately engraving the Guangyu Family Hall seal and privately leasing the land to Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, violating Article 828 of the Civil Code, etc., constituting defamation. Judge Zhu Chuzhe opened a court session and

### Summoned Both Parties for Trial

As a result, he found that the

defendants' publication did not constitute a crime, as the dispute between the parties was over the leasing of land and was being litigated in court. Yesterday, he ruled that Tang Yingsong, Zhang Guanghe, Yunlong, Baolu, Haiqiao, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin were all not guilty. As for the civil case, Judge Yu Changzi held a hearing on the 6th of this month and ordered a postponement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu continued the hearing. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First,

### A Descendant of the Third Branch of the Zhang Family

Zhang Jinfan, stated that he had filed a request to join the lawsuit, arguing that the defendant should not have leased out the ancestral graveyard land without authorization, and requested a ruling confirming that the lease contract was invalid. The court asked the plaintiff's lawyer, who had no objection to Zhang Jinfan's joining the lawsuit. After questioning the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered them to make their arguments and announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the verdict for the 16th.

### Word Meaning and Composition

— Xiao Ren

Even now, some conservatives are worrying about young people, saying that writing in colloquial style is more difficult than writing in classical Chinese, because many word meanings in colloquial style come from classical Chinese, just as French evolved from Latin. Therefore, only by truly understanding classical Chinese can one avoid making mistakes when writing in colloquial style. The practical application of this theory is that Chinese teachers ask students to read classical texts and write classical essays.

In fact, this theory is based on Mr. Zhang Taiyan's ideas. However, Mr. Taiyan's argument is even more thorough. He said: most of today's colloquial language is ancient language, and most of today's characters are ancient characters. If you don't understand "Xiaoxue" (Etymology), you will definitely make a complete mess when writing in vernacular Chinese. Today's conservatives have only modified it a little.

However, no matter how you put it, this theory is ridiculous. If one studies ancient texts to "understand" language and characters, or even to understand "Xiaoxue," that's fine. But conservatives insist that it's for practical application. That's where the problem lies.

It is a fact that each generation's language is transformed from the language of the previous generation, and no one can deny it. But the reason for the transformation is because of this need. Naturally, some word meanings are the same as in the previous generation, but those word meanings can remain because modern people can still understand them. As long as you understand, you can naturally use them. It is unnecessary to bother tracing those roots, which is simply meddling. Because once you start tracing, you will inevitably go further and further. The most thorough result is that all commonly used loan characters cannot be used. As soon as you start writing, you must first think about what the original meaning of each character is, which will inevitably make you nervous, and modern articles cannot be written.

There is only one purpose for writing: to convey one's thoughts to modern people. And reading articles is also just to see your thoughts, and incidentally to see if you have conveyed your thoughts at all. Authors do not write for the sake of word meanings, and readers do not read for the sake of word meanings. Therefore, even if you "understand" all the word meanings in classical Chinese, it is irrelevant to writing modern articles. Even if you completely "understand" that a certain character is "pictographic," a certain character is "ideographic," and a certain character is "phonetic loan," it is also irrelevant to writing modern articles. Asking young people to first learn classical Chinese thoroughly, or even memorize the "Shuowen Jiezi" (Etymological Dictionary of Chinese Characters), before starting to write modern articles is naturally good for classical scholars and etymologists, as everyone has something to eat, but young people themselves will be deceived and have no chance to succeed.

Comparing ancient Chinese to Latin is not really accurate. But even with Latin, in France and other countries with related languages, it is not generally understood. Latin is only an elective subject in schools, and if you ask a French person or someone from another country, they will always say that Latin is difficult, and never say that their modern national language is more difficult than Latin. French also has ancient texts, which can be compared to ancient Chinese, but that kind of writing has long become an antique, and the works have all been translated into modern French.

In the final analysis, if these Chinese characters still exist one day, we will always use these conventionally used loan characters, and "miswritten characters" will increase, which is the so-called transformation, and the distance from the original meaning of the characters will become greater day by day. Although conservatives can temporarily suppress young people, their efforts will ultimately be in vain.

However, I am not opposed to people understanding ancient texts and mastering "Xiaoxue." I am just saying that it is a matter for experts, not for every young person who wants to be able to write in the national language. Experts can "understand" more deeply and "master" more thoroughly, and be able to write inscriptions on bronze vessels and oracle bones, but they have absolutely no right to ask others to learn from them. Moreover, even experts, if they want to publish their research results, must write them in modern writing. Mr. Taiyan used ancient characters to write articles throughout his life, but he could not completely use them, and he was still using loan characters. Only Mr. Qian Xuantong once copied Taiyan's "Xiaoxue Dawen" (Questions and Answers on Etymology) using "Shuowen" characters, but it seems that only he himself and Taiyan were the readers.

These are actually common sense. But the reason why I finally say this without avoiding superficiality is because the conservatives' theory is too far from common sense.

### The "Maginot" Line of Belgium

— Hua

In recent years, European countries have spared no effort in preparing for war and have built defensive lines on their borders. Although Belgium has declared that it will remain neutral in future European wars, it has still built defensive lines on its borders. These defensive lines are built opposite Germany's Siegfried Line, connecting to France's Maginot Line in the south and the Netherlands' fortifications in the north.

Its organization can be divided into two sections: (1) the Waterline (in the north) and (2) the Fortress Line (in the south).

The function of the Waterline is to use the special conditions of the land to flood the area at any time to effectively prevent the enemy from penetrating. This line runs from Liege to the Dutch border and is composed of the Meuse River between Belgium and the Netherlands and several canals: the Jueian Canal, the Aebert Canal, and a so-called connecting river. The largest project among them is the Albert Canal: in May 1933, King Albert of Belgium began to excavate the first section of this canal, from Liege to Hasselt. Two years later, King Leopold and Queen Astrid excavated the second section from Anvers to Hereuthals. The third section was initiated by the current King of Belgium and was completed a few months ago under the protection of the British and French fleets. This river is 122 kilometers long from Liege to Anvers and has six locks. If necessary, the locks can be opened to repeat the Yser River incident. (Note: In 1914, the Yser River lock manager opened a large amount of river water to prevent the German army from advancing.)

The Fortress Line was almost built at the same time as the French Maginot Line. However, due to the need to maintain secrecy, many people still do not know about this solid line of defense.

The plan to build this Fortress Line was decided after many fierce debates. Some people advocated building a very deep network of cement trenches in accordance with the previous effective strategy of resisting tanks. However, others believed that such fortifications were insufficient to defend against the ever-changing tactics of modern warfare, and they strongly supported the plan adopted by France: to build a continuous series of fortifications, equipped with underground bomb shelters and the latest weapons. As a result, they used a mixed approach of the above two plans, mixed with the defense methods used by Germany before the last World War in the Metz architectural flower-shaped line (grands festons).

From Longwy to Liege, this undulating forest plateau was originally a reliable natural barrier line, so it was only necessary to build considerable fortifications to cut off bridges and key points, install hidden gun emplacements to control roads, and place many landmines to make it sufficient for defense. Now Liege's old castle has been transformed into a new style, but the real Belgian Maginot Line joins the Meuse River on the Dutch border 15 miles east of the city. As for the areas that can be attacked by tanks, they have long been equipped with a large number of obstacles. The foremost are landmines, behind the landmines are fences, and behind them are long rows of wide barbed wire. In addition, there are many tank traps scattered everywhere. All of the above are set within the range of automatic weapons and armored artillery. Countless tunnels are dug deep in the land to connect the caves where the firing devices, air pipes, and exits are installed.

The underground equipment has electrical equipment for ventilation, heating, and lighting, as well as elevators, armories, supply depots, food storage rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and infirmaries. Some tunnels are even 100 meters below the ground. (Abridged translation from the Paris Illustration)

Now, I miss the bridgehead of my hometown.

I have seen a flock of autumn geese skim across the long sky, and the idle clouds in the field weave into a pleasing picture. In the stream that is constantly sounding, the familiar sound of the boatman rowing comes.

Under this bridge, a few boats rushing to the early market are gathered.

"Hum--yo!"

A stirring echo reverberates in the silent riverside.

With a quiet and refined bridgehead, I like to walk there alone and look at the vast clouds and sky.

"Morning! Came so early today?"

Because I often go to the bridgehead, the old villager who scoops duckweed by the stream is used to asking me with a smile.

"How about you? Is business good?"

"Well! In these years—how can things be good."

Hearing a deep sigh, the water surface slammed, as if the fish in the stream jumped onto the shore.

Since then, the old man's words have been interrupted.

I remember a long day when I went to teach in the city and always walked to the bridgehead when I came back on vacation. I still saw the old man sitting by the stream, silently watching the duckweed drifting with the water.

"Long time no see! Morning."

This has become his catchphrase. He always says "Morning," even though the time I see him is not morning but dusk.

Late at night, I quietly dragged my shadow to the bridgehead again. The old man by the stream was gone. I looked at the autumn night sky, remotely listening to the village drum, and occasionally in the depths of the reeds I heard startling, sharp sounds.

"Is it the cry of a goose?" I seemed to be moved.

The moon is round and the pure white light shines on the sleeping village. There is no commotion on the riverside. Only the chirping of crickets accompanies the sound of the water, playing the nocturne. A light breeze blows through the willows on the opposite bank, and my hair also drifts like willow catkins. The shadow of the moon gradually moves into the water. The bright reflection pierces my eyes and my face. Looking closely, it looks more like a silver plate, a string of pearls, sometimes no different from the one in the sky. However, the wind stirs the calmness of the water, and the moon in the stream also transforms into a line of ripple-like halos, and then transforms into hundreds and thousands of points, scattered on the water surface.

"Squeak--" A sudden squeak, the leaves also fluttered.

Deeply, I scratched my hair and thought.

Now, I have not seen my hometown for a long time, nor have I seen the bridgehead and the old man who scoops duckweed, and I cannot hear the sound of the geese in the autumn night. However, no matter if it is separated by three or five years, with my remembrance, I long for the safety of the lovely bridgehead from afar.

I expect it to be healthy and stubbornly exist, standing on that riverside.

Poems

The sanxian music from the street at night caused me a sleepless night.

The sound of the qin is sad and depressed, like a rainstorm, like flowing water, the rapid and slow rhythms combine into a messy medley. I love to listen, but soon I finally get tired of it.

The deeper music adds to the desolation of the late night.

I cannot fall asleep sweetly, I listen carefully to the footsteps of the qin player. In his stumbling steps, the clouds and smoke at the end of the world feel even heavier, heavier to him.

Darkness walks into the window lattice, I turn on the electric light, and simply spread out a piece of manuscript paper, wanting to write a poem.

The hazy sky is surrounded by a hazy night, the metropolis is in turmoil; unfolding that side of guilt and shamelessness, exposing this side of cries and moans...

Looking at the light yellow light, this is the revelation of light!

Having dipped the ink, I want to write about the qin player on the street, he is my beautiful sentence, and moreover, a person's wandering fate needs me to remember it.

Write it! In the middle of the night, looking back at the back of the qin player, he is hugging the sanxian and crying.

What is he crying about? Perhaps there is a touching story.

The ink has dried, I dip the pen tip into the water bottle for the second time, at this moment I write, no, how do I write

A young couple on the front floor has just returned, the giggling laughter mixed into an unpleasant atmosphere, and the radio is singing: Looking through the autumn water, but not seeing her...

Vulgar songs made me drop my pen, and the hatred in my heart wanted me to shout and yell in disgust.

The result is insomnia, a sleepless night, there is a blank piece of paper on the desk, a page of wordless poems.

### Two Poems

— Shi Di

Black Bat

In the dusk, the net of night is densely woven,

Shuttling through the mysterious sky;

Gently lower a net,

Only leaking out the twinkling stars in the gaps.

Autumn soars boundless,

Gathering its wings, hovering, and then soaring straight up,

Dragging a long skirt with peacock tail feathers across the earth;

Night march, occasionally with a flash of fire shining.

Wearing the sky clothes of boundless black fluff;

Oh, the black bird that eats mosquitoes on the autumn night

Take advantage of tonight, the trembling under the darkness——

Open your big mouth...

Morning

—Scene in the Countryside——

The morning breeze blows a little poem askew,

Coiling around the top of the farmer's chimney.

The night leaves behind a wisp of green smoke,

Low houses, cloudy trees, vast and boundless.

Smearing the cow with shallow green in the east,

Rippling sunshine on the river;

The crescent-moon-colored floating clouds flow like a broken boat,

Startling a pair of white gulls in the pond reeds.

The first ray of light shines,

Adorning the treetops with brilliance.

Under the loofah rack in front of the square,

There are already busy bees working.

Arts and Entertainment World

### The Present and Future of the New Spring and Autumn Drama School

— Li Tongyu

"Does art have temporality?" This question has been hotly debated by many people. But regardless of whether art has temporality, when an art can exist in a certain era and be supported by the public, at least this art has historical value, has technical advantages, and is worthy of being appreciated and studied.

Taking drama as an example, there was a confrontation between new drama and Beijing opera 30 years ago. At that time, new drama unfortunately failed, while Beijing opera still captured the largest number of audiences. In the last decade, spoken drama has risen again. Before the war, the China Travel Troupe, the Experimental Theater, and amateur drama clubs all shone brightly in Shanghai, attracting a large audience. In particular, the China Travel Troupe achieved the greatest effect from Beijing to Shanghai, to Hankou, to Guangdong, and countless cities of all sizes, giving the general public a new impression of spoken drama. In recent years, spoken drama has established a solid foundation.

However, can the rise of spoken drama lead to the decline of Beijing opera? Undoubtedly, Beijing opera has existed for so long that no one can deny its historical value. The new theory of art believes that the existence of art in a certain era must be coordinated with the political, economic, and social trends of that era. In other words, the direct effect of art is to promote politics, society, and economy. However, the Soviet Union, where this theory originated, not only welcomed Mei Lanfang with the greatest effort, but also reissued the complete works of Shakespeare and Tolstoy after the success of the revolution and the change of social system. They are accepting their heritage.

Now to the topic. The New Spring and Autumn Drama School started with the purpose of training Beijing opera students, but later also recruited spoken drama students. Today, when classes officially start, it has become a school that teaches both Beijing opera and rehearses spoken drama. According to the responsible principal, the goal is to melt new and old art into one furnace, take its essence, and carry it forward. This great ambition is worthy of admiration. However, it is a very difficult task to combine Beijing opera and spoken drama into a new opera. The principal, Ms. Pan Wangji, is a famous figure in the Beijing opera amateur world, and the professors hired are mostly senior figures in the spoken drama world. This effort should have good results in the future. Naturally, whether it is Beijing opera or spoken drama, the basis of artistic theory is the same. In particular, the New Spring and Autumn School, which "melts new and old drama into "the furnace," should pay special attention to the essence of art, so that students, in addition to understanding performance and singing, also understand the artistic value of new and old dramas. In fact, becoming an extraordinary artist is indispensable to ignoring the importance of artistic theory.

The New Spring and Autumn School was founded by Ms. Pan Wangji at her own expense, and the preferential conditions for students exceed all previous precedents for drama schools. In today's era of scarcity of dramatic talents, the training of this new force will be a major event worthy of attention in the drama world.

### Zhang Eyun After Arriving in Shanghai

— Yunyun

Zhang Eyun arrived in Shanghai last week from Tianjin. She met with reporters yesterday and was asked about the news of the flood in Tianjin. She said that the water came after the play had ended, and she returned home safely. She did not have to take refuge on the roof, and the second floor of the China Grand Theater was not flooded. It is unlikely that she had to take refuge on the roof. The news in Shanghai is undoubtedly a misrepresentation.

Zhang Eyun is still living in the Jin Lao Mansion in Chujiaqiao this time. She will soon perform at the Huang Jin Theater. The issue of her supporting actors is not easy to solve, because there is no old male role and a lack of young male roles at the Huang Jin Theater. Many plays cannot be performed. The young male role can be played by Shan Tongshan in a cross-dressing role. Once the issue of the old male role is resolved, she can take the stage. She has recently been suffering from an eye disease. It is said that she also suffered from it when she came to Shanghai at the end of last year. After treatment, it has taken effect and will recover in a few days.

New Movie Introduction

### New Four Daughters

— Qi Hua

“Daughters Courageous”

The story of "New Four Daughters" is very touching: a husband who ran away from home and wandered for twenty years, when he returns to his warm family, his four daughters have already grown up. But his wife is about to marry a wealthy businessman who has been passionately in love with her for twelve years. The unfolding of this tragedy is not limited to simple love; the return of this wanderer will destroy the happiness of the entire family, and also damage the future prospects of the four daughters. Thus, the husband who left home twenty years ago finally sacrifices himself and, on the day of his wife's wedding, embarks on the journey again, continuing his wandering life.

The role of the husband who left home twenty years ago is played by Claude Rains, and the role of the wife is played by Fay Bainter (we will never forget that she is the mother from "Virgin's Anguish"). They portray the conflicting psychology under the clash of emotion and reason very deeply and movingly. In particular, Claude Rains' "close-ups" when returning home and when saying goodbye to his wife are able to express his inner pain through the expressions in his eyes and at the corners of his mouth.

In these two scenes (returning home, leaving home), the director uses a contrasting technique to strengthen the tragic atmosphere. For example: the four daughters shaving their new father, the family happily dining together, the wanderer suddenly returning home. After dinner, while everyone is chatting and laughing happily, he sits alone in a corner; while everyone goes to the dance hall, he collapses wearily in a chair. When leaving home, the scene also depicts the joy of the whole family, while Claude Rains quietly leaves, and the whistle of a train sounds in the distance during the wedding. At the same time, the director is able to fully express the psychological state of each individual.

However, the development of the whole play seems not tight enough, because it also has to portray the love lives of the four sisters, and also strengthen the relationship between Priscilla Lane and John Garfield. On the whole, "New Four Daughters" is a good play.

The scenes of the four sisters are just a foil here, and none of them achieve anything particularly outstanding. John Garfield's role, although small, is very steady.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Separation and Reunion of Wang Keqin and Zhang Xun

Before Zhang Xun resumed his position, in order to test whether the soldiers under his command supported the restoration, he deliberately released information in Tianjin saying that the General had shaved his queue in Beijing and that the President had bestowed an official title upon him, and that he had resolved not to think about restoration any longer. Who knew that when his soldiers heard this news, they all discussed it one after another. Some said that even if the General shaved his queue, they would not want to shave theirs; others said that if the General returned to Xuzhou and insisted on them shaving their queues, then they would scatter and go back to what they were doing. Therefore, when Zhang Xun got off the train, all the queue-wearing soldiers on the platform and along the route (Zhang Xun always cleared the streets when he went out, cutting off pedestrians) first paid attention to his queue. However, he usually sat in a green sedan chair, wearing a melon-shaped hat and a long gown and mandarin jacket, with a pearl on his hat. When he first got off the car, some people could see that his queue was still hanging behind his head, but once he sat in the sedan chair, with the melon-shaped hat covering his hair, it was impossible to see whether he had cut off his queue or not. When the sedan chair was carried out of the platform for only a few steps, the soldiers were all discussing and craning their necks to look inside. He thought that this was not a safe way, so he had an idea and quickly wrapped his queue from the back of his head to his chest so that the soldiers could see it from afar. So, cheers were heard along the way, saying that the General's queue was still there, and that the brothers would catch and chop up the rumor mongers later. (100)
