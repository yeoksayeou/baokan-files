### Japanese Army Declares Intention to Blockade Hong Kong; Japanese Troops on Western Guangdong Line Concentrated in Guangzhou, to Reinforce Northeast Defense; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recaptures Shicao Village, Cutting Off the Bo-Jin Highway; Japanese Army Ambushed in Paishi Tang, Hubei Province, Two Motorboats Sunk

Tokyo: According to news from here today, a spokesman for the Japanese army in South China stated that a highway was recently built from Kowloon to the Chinese mainland, exclusively for transporting military supplies to the Chongqing government. Therefore, the Japanese army must cut off this road to isolate Hong Kong. At the same time, if Britain stubbornly supports Chiang Kai-shek's rule, Japan's military actions will be unavoidable. However, after the blockade begins, civilians will suffer more, as food will clearly be insufficient. (Nineteenth, Associated Press dispatch)

Guangzhou: The Japanese Army Information Bureau announced this morning that it has discovered a secret transportation line between Chinese in Hong Kong and those on the Chinese mainland, passing through Hong Kong. Japanese troops occupying Shenzhen and Shatoujiao have discovered methods for transmitting information to Hong Kong. It is claimed that after the telephone lines in the area of the railway destroyed by the Japanese army in February were repaired, the Chinese army used them until the Japanese army reoccupied the area. It is also claimed that the Chinese built a road from Shatoujiao to Hong Kong, connecting with Shantou, and all goods were transported to the mainland along this road. Therefore, the Japanese army believes it should seal off the border from Bao'an to Shatoujiao to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. (Nineteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Hong Kong: As a result of Japanese military actions near Hong Kong, food panic has been felt near the Hong Kong border and in the markets, and prices are gradually rising. Japanese soldiers are now guarding key points at the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and restrictions on the transit of goods are extremely strict. (Nineteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Hong Kong: Since the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen, Nantou, Shatoujiao, and other places, transportation with Hong Kong has been completely cut off. The Japanese army has also strictly prohibited the transportation of food and vegetables into the New Territories in these areas. Therefore, the prices of vegetables in Hong Kong have skyrocketed, indicating that the purpose of the Japanese army's actions is to intensify the blockade of Hong Kong. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Hong Kong: Foreign news reports that the British government, in order to maintain its interests in the Far East, will soon dispatch a battle fleet to be stationed permanently in Singapore, and will use Hong Kong as another base. The main guns of the fleet's capital ships will range from 13.5 to 15 inches in diameter. There will be six capital ships bearing the white ensign. The arrival of this fleet will not weaken British naval power in the North Sea or the Mediterranean, and its prestige in the Far East will be greatly enhanced. It is also learned that twenty British, French, and Australian warships will gather in Singapore harbor before the end of the month. (Nineteenth, special dispatch)

Hong Kong: It is reported that many Japanese troops from the western Guangdong border have been transferred to Guangzhou for concentration, preparing to reinforce the Northeast defense. In addition, four Japanese warships carrying more than 2,000 Northeast puppet troops arrived in Jiangmen and landed at Beijie, apparently for troop rotation. It is rumored that three Japanese soldiers from Shenzhen crossed the British border in pursuit of Chinese refugees and were detained and disarmed. The Hong Kong military has not acknowledged this. (Nineteenth, special dispatch)

Yichang: The war in central Hubei has become quiet. Although the Japanese army in Qianjiang occasionally comes out of the city to harass, they are all repelled by the Chinese side. In the Luohansi area, the Japanese army has attempted to cross the river secretly several times, but failed. (Eighteenth dispatch)

Wengyuan: Three Japanese warships off the coast of Shayu Chong, Huiyang, have sailed elsewhere on the nineteenth. There are no traces of the Japanese army in Bao'an City and the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Chongqing: According to news from here today, the Japanese army in central Hubei has recently increased, and its operational bases have also been strengthened. The purpose seems to be to launch a new offensive westward to capture Yichang. However, this Japanese attempt is unlikely to succeed. (1) Because the Japanese army in central Hubei has been attacked by the Chinese army in recent weeks, and its communication lines are becoming increasingly weak. (2) Yichang is one of the Japanese army's targets for attack, and the Chinese side has long been aware of this, so defensive works have been adequately arranged. If the Japanese side wants to attack, it will suffer extreme losses. The Chinese side anticipates that when the Japanese side attacks western Hubei, it will also have operations elsewhere, with major actions in Guangdong, South China. (Nineteenth, Associated Press dispatch)

Tongguan: Jincheng has been under attack by the Chinese army for several days, suffering many casualties. Over two thousand Japanese troops, reinforced from Bo'ai on the fourteenth, launched a counterattack against the Chinese side with intense artillery fire and the use of poison gas. The Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, repeatedly thwarting the Japanese army. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs. A part of the Japanese army sneaked to the vicinity of Nanshi Dian, northeast of Jincheng, the other day and was intercepted by the Chinese army, with over a hundred casualties. Nanshi Cao Village, south of Jincheng, has been recaptured by the Chinese army, and the Bo-Jin Highway is cut off. Four or five hundred Japanese infantry and artillery troops from Tianhu Pass and the Jinmiao area sneaked to counterattack, and after another brave charge by the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until noon on the seventeenth. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Xiushui: At the ball field more than ten miles southwest of Wuning, a skirmish occurred between the Chinese and Japanese armies on the morning of the eighteenth, killing more than twenty Japanese officers and soldiers. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Changde: A certain unit of the Chinese army, in conjunction with the local regiment headquarters, launched attacks against the Japanese army encountered in Taolin, Zhongfang, Yunxi, and other places for several days, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers and seizing many supplies. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Xi'an: More than a thousand Japanese troops in the Liujia Village and Aoxiang Village area, southeast of Yicheng, launched an attack on the Nanma Village and Qilipo area at noon on the fourteenth. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated along their original route. (Nineteenth dispatch) In Shashi, on the morning of the fifteenth, more than 30,000 Japanese troops sneaked to harass the vicinity of Changshou. The Chinese army met them with a head-on attack, and after two hours of fierce fighting, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese army took the opportunity to suddenly launch an offensive, attacking in multiple directions, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and killing many Japanese soldiers, whose corpses littered the countryside. The Japanese troops fled in panic. At the moment, the Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to advance towards the Jing-Zhong Road. (Nineteenth dispatch)

### Over a Hundred Japanese Planes的分批襲川湘 Attack Sichuan and Hunan in Batches; Jiading and Liuyang Bombed; Details of Losses Under Investigation

Chongqing: This morning, over a hundred Japanese bombers flew upstream from Hankou, some of which flew to western Hunan, while the remaining eighty were divided into two teams, one with fifty-three planes and the other with twenty-seven, entered the Sichuan province border and flew towards Chongqing. Several teams of Chinese fighter planes, upon hearing the alarm, immediately took off to prepare for interception, flying very high, so the number of Chinese planes could not be estimated, but it must be very large, because the sound of the planes was deafening. The weather was clear and visibility was good, which was favorable for the defenders. The public all predicted that there would be a fierce battle in the sky. However, after the Japanese planes appeared in the southern suburbs of the occupied city, they did not attempt to cross the Chinese plane line, but continued to fly west and dropped bombs in Jiading, and some planes circled over Zigong. After some time, they flew back to their downstream base, without dropping bombs on the city of Chongqing. (Nineteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: At 10:20 this morning, an air raid alarm was issued here, lasting for four hours, until 2:30 in the afternoon when the alarm was lifted. However, the Japanese planes did not fly into the city's airspace. According to semi-official sources, it is confirmed that one hundred Japanese planes departed from Hankou, but twenty-five of them flew to Liuyang, Hunan, to bomb, and seventy-five flew to the Sichuan border. It is also learned that Japanese planes flew to Jiangjin, sixty miles southwest of Chongqing, and the extent of the bombing losses is still under investigation. (Nineteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Luoyang: At 10:00 on the morning of the nineteenth, eight Japanese planes sneaked into the airspace above Luoyang City from the north bank of the Yellow River. After intense shooting by the local air defense forces, they dropped eight bombs and flew southeast via Linru. The losses were minimal. (Nineteenth dispatch)

Editorial

### A Way Out of Distress

Recently, Shanghai citizens have generally felt a bit distressed. The reasons for this distress are nothing more than two: one is the oppression of life, and the other is the threat of the environment.

The oppression of life did not begin today, but it is currently accelerating and intensifying. From food, fuel, and cloth to all daily necessities, prices have more than doubled in one or two months. Those who live on salaries, of course, are all lamenting; even those who run industrial and commercial enterprises are feeling the strain due to the increase in their own costs and the reduction in general purchasing power. As for the general working masses and the tens of thousands of unemployed and refugee groups, their suffering is, of course, indescribable. As this situation progresses, a great crisis will inevitably be lurking in the isolated island society, which everyone can feel.

However, the oppression of life is still obvious and easy to recognize; as for the threat of the environment, the signs are subtle, but the seriousness of the content is no less than the former. Recently, rumors have been spreading that the Japanese side has new intentions for Shanghai. The so-called new intentions may be like the "blockade" of Tianjin. Although a Japanese spokesman issued a statement on the sixteenth of this month denying the blockade, saying something like "a blockade is possible, but it may not happen"; however, judging from the recent intense statements in Japanese newspapers in Shanghai, advocating the takeover of the Special District Court, advocating the confiscation of Chinese merchant banks, and criticizing the supply of the isolated army, etc., we can see the intentions of the Japanese side, and there are some clues to be found. Looking again at the method of controlling vegetables recently announced by the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai, stipulating that vegetables from Puxi must first pass through Hongkou when they arrive in Shanghai, although this matter has not been implemented as scheduled, it has not been declared abandoned. There is also the sudden rise in the price of rice in Shanghai, although it is said to be due to the manipulation of hoarders; but according to the statements of villagers who came to Shanghai, all said that because of various restrictions, rice from the surrounding villages could not reach Shanghai. This fact can be seen as a harbinger of a blockade, or, to put it more seriously, this is a kind of invisible blockade, or a chronic blockade. Looking again at the anti-British demonstrations on August 13th in Hongkou, western Shanghai, and various suburbs, and openly distributing leaflets in the sky against Chiang and against Britain; and in a corner of the lawless zone, thugs have recently been rampant, and even the swords pointed at an innocent Dane, Mr. Krogh, who was killed. According to Western newspapers, this was also the work of thugs in the lawless zone, in order to intimidate the general foreigners in Shanghai. Judging from various situations, the threat of the environment is indeed intensifying, just like the oppression of life. In short, although British Chamberlain's concessions on the Tianjin issue have not satisfied the greed of the Japanese warlords, it is possible, though not inevitable, that the Japanese warlords will seek further compensation in Shanghai. Moreover, since the Japanese military in China cannot continue to advance, there have been repeated rumors of changing new strategies recently, among which the fundamental eradication of international forces in the Far East is one of the so-called new strategy contents. Therefore, the current eagerness to solve the Shanghai issue and attempt to destroy the last fortress of international forces in the Far East is, of course, one end of the Japanese strategy. This is sufficient to show that the Shanghai citizens' understanding of the environmental threat cannot be regarded as an over-consideration.

Having distress, we must seek a way out. Wandering and hesitating is not a way out; suicide and surrender are not ways out either. The way out is specific, different according to each person's needs and abilities; but before finding a way out, there is a common principle, that is, psychological calmness. Calmness is not bowing to fate, nor is it waiting to be slaughtered, but using a calm mind, analyzing the current situation with reason, and then, according to subjective and objective conditions, choosing one's own way out.

The oppression of life and the threat of the environment, although seemingly two completely different things, actually have the same way out. Because the soaring black market exchange rate has led to the high prices of goods, and the limitation of sources has led to the lack of commodities, although the nature of the event is economic, the reason for the event is political. Therefore, the progress or relief of the state of life oppression will inevitably change with the environmental threat situation, and the key to the so-called way out of distress is only in the environmental end. Speaking of the situation of Shanghai's environment, there is certainly the possibility of becoming a second Tianjin, but it may not be realized immediately. Because Shanghai is, after all, the last fortress of international forces in the Far East, and it is also the last line of defense for the Japanese to attack international forces in China, and it is not like the British concession in Tianjin, which is only related to one country, Britain. If it is launched, it will involve many things, and I am afraid it will be out of control, and the Japanese side has no confidence in whether the result is good or bad; therefore, although the Japanese side is eager to plan for Shanghai, they dare not act too hastily. However, even if you don't have to act too hastily, why not use gradual means to gradually devour it? Therefore, whether Shanghai will be blockaded or become the second Tianjin is only a matter of form; as for the essence, the deterioration of Shanghai's environment will inevitably become worse day by day.

No matter how the recent situation in Shanghai develops, the thorough removal of the evil atmosphere in the environment will inevitably be on the day of China's final victory in the war of resistance, which is inevitable in fact. At present, because Shanghai citizens cannot bear the distress, perhaps some want to leave Shanghai. Leaving Shanghai and going to the inland is certainly the best way out, but it is by no means a generally feasible thing at present. Those who have come to Shanghai from the occupied areas to take refuge may want to return to their hometowns; but it is certainly good to return to places in the countryside that are completely isolated from the Japanese puppets; if you return to the occupied cities, then it is no different from being decorations for the Japanese puppets, and fundamentally it is exactly what the Japanese puppets want, so why bother to fulfill them now? As for those who cannot leave and stay on the isolated island, how to break the distress at present, then only follow the recent admonition of President Chiang Kai-shek to the Shanghai compatriots, that is, to build a strong spiritual fortress. The citizens of Shanghai should remember: only the day of the final victory of the war of resistance is the day when the citizens of Shanghai truly get rid of their pain, so the current task is only to be of one heart and one mind, to build the will of more than four million citizens into a strong Great Wall, on the one hand, to constantly fight against the environment, and on the other hand, to use all our strength to support the government and promote the early arrival of victory.

### Actual Breakdown of Tokyo Negotiations; Japan to Intensify Blockade of Tianjin Concession; Anglo-Japanese Representatives' Meeting Ended Unhappily Yesterday; Japanese Military Decides Tianjin Japanese Army to Act According to Circumstances; Britain Notifies the United States of its Views on Economic Issues

Tokyo: After the British government decided to conduct the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the issues of currency and silver reserves proposed by Japan solely on an Anglo-Japanese basis, without yielding beneficial results, the Anglo-Japanese negotiations are now encountering a serious crisis. This decision of the British government is in direct opposition to Japan's opinion. Japan believes that economic and political issues must be regarded as an integral part of the agenda and resolved through negotiation. After the British Ambassador Craigie informed the Japanese representatives of the British government's decision, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma immediately canceled his plans for a weekend getaway, which shows the seriousness of the situation arising from the British government's decision. After a meeting of administrative personnel of the Army Ministry this morning, the Foreign and Army Ministries held a joint meeting. Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki will meet with Prime Minister Hiranuma this afternoon to decide the government's attitude towards the Anglo-Japanese conference. Japanese observers believe that the British government's decision aims to (1) independently establish an agreement on Tianjin police affairs, indefinitely postponing the Tokyo talks; (2) submit economic issues, such as the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender, to an international conference of relevant countries; (3) form a common front with France and the United States, exerting economic pressure on the establishment of a new order in East Asia to protect its own interests in the Far East. According to Japanese observers, Britain underestimates Japan's economic power, leading to such an attempt. Japan absolutely cannot accept the British decision. At the same time, almost all Japanese newspapers demand that the Japanese government immediately stop the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the beneficiary of the success of the Tokyo negotiations is Britain, while the success or failure of the negotiations is not of great concern to Japan. Since North China is now in Japan's control, once Japan declares its determination to protect its interests with all its strength, it makes no difference whether Britain accepts Japan's declaration or not. The Japanese government should stop the Tokyo negotiations at this time to avoid repeated delays and being manipulated by Britain. Moreover, the sufferer after the failure of the talks is Britain, not Japan. The Miyako Shimbun pointed out that there are two reasons for Britain's delaying policy: (1) Trust that the Danzig issue can be resolved peacefully; (2) Want to wait and see what policy Japan will adopt towards the new European situation. Japan should urge Britain to reopen the meeting within a limited period to prevent Britain from changing its attitude and destroying the meeting after the Danzig issue has a result and Japan's policy towards Europe has been decided. If Britain does not comply with this request, the responsibility for all consequences of the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese conference will be borne by the British side. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Tokyo: After an important meeting of administrative personnel of the Army Ministry this morning, it is heard that it has been decided to allow the Tianjin Japanese army authorities to consider how to resolve the Tianjin issue, as it is believed that the negotiations on the Tianjin incident have actually broken down. According to the Army Ministry's opinion, the Tokyo talks were held at the request of the British side, with the aim of seeking a resolution to the Tianjin dispute. Japan has long stated that the Tianjin issue can only be resolved if Britain abandons its policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek. Now the British side proposes not to discuss economic issues and wants to postpone the Tokyo talks, which is nothing short of a breakdown of negotiations. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo: The Army authorities convened a joint meeting of provincial and departmental leaders on the morning of the 19th, and solemnly discussed the future strategy of the Anglo-Japanese talks. As a result, it was decided to proceed according to the established policy with the following attitude: (1) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks are aimed at resolving the issue of the blockade of the Tianjin concession and are held in response to the British request. In order to achieve this goal, and due to the necessity of ensuring the security of the local army, it is an absolutely necessary condition for the British side to abandon its policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek and resolve the security and economic issues of the concession. (2) Although Britain has largely acknowledged general principles and security issues in accordance with Japanese demands in this meeting, it has constantly postponed the discussion of economic issues, putting the meeting in a state of suspension. Therefore, the Tokyo talks have in fact broken down, and there is no other way to negotiate in the future except to shift the negotiations to the local level. (3) The Japanese local army authorities have repeatedly stated that in order to establish security in the concession, the relationship between security and economic issues is inseparable, and Japan will not recognize any separation. (4) Therefore, if the British side suddenly repents and expresses sincerity to the Japanese side, but because the meeting has ended unsuccessfully, the future measures can only be freely undertaken by the local army authorities, and the result will be the strengthening of the blockade of the concession, which is of course the case. (Dōmei, 19th) London: The British government has openly stated to Japan that the issue of Chinese silver and token currency will not be discussed alone by Britain without the participation of other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. At the same time, it will continue to lend 3 million pounds to China. Current affairs observers believe that Britain has decided to abandon its policy of appeasement in the Far East and is no longer prepared to make any concessions to Japan. This is significantly different from when Britain concluded a preliminary agreement with Japan and expressed its willingness to hand over Chinese suspects. The reasons for Britain's hardening attitude towards Japan are: to show close ties with the United States' Far East policy, as the United States has already announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and at the same time, when Britain surrenders again in Tokyo, it will purchase a large amount of silver from China. Furthermore, in order to dispel the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain and promote the early establishment of a tripartite military alliance, Britain must also adopt a tough attitude towards Japan, as the Soviet Union has largely regarded the Anglo-Japanese talks as another appeasement policy. According to a senior official here, Anglo-Japanese relations are gradually moving from a cloudy secret state to a stormy stage. Japanese sources here say that Japan is determined to reject the British proposal to resolve the currency and legal tender circulation issues through a Nine-Power Treaty conference. (Associated Press, 19th)

London: Non-British diplomatic circles predicted last night that after Britain refused to discuss the currency system and silver issues with Japan alone, the talks between Britain and Japan in Tokyo would break down. Japanese sources here believe that the British government's decision will strengthen the position of Japanese militarists and bring Japan closer to the Italo-German military alliance, which is the goal of the Japanese military. Well-informed sources said that Britain's decision to refuse to negotiate with Japan on the issue of silver and currency in North China was made solely by the British government. However, Britain will consider the views of relevant countries, including the United States and France. Britain also notified the United States, France, and China of its new decision. When the British government sent a new instruction to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie yesterday, it instructed him to immediately notify the Japanese government, saying, "Continuing to negotiate the silver and currency issues separately between Britain and Japan will not yield beneficial results." The new instruction also hinted that Britain supports reconvening the 1937 Brussels Conference (the Nine-Power Treaty signatory conference). In its note to Japan, Britain indicated that while it acknowledges the issues of silver and currency, it cannot stand aside when the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and other relevant treaties make any final discussions on the current situation in China. The relevant powers must be given the opportunity to express their views on these issues. A British government spokesman stated here that the British Ambassador to Japan notified the leader of the Japanese delegation, Kato, "If economic issues are to be discussed further, both sides must be prepared to consider the views of the relevant powers." The spokesman explained that there has been progress in the negotiations on the agreement to maintain order in Tianjin. He believes that the agreement can be signed separately, but he frankly doubts whether the Japanese side will agree to this. News from Tokyo confirmed the spokesman's belief. (Associated Press, 19th)

Washington: Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters today that the British government had notified the United States government that Britain had refused to discuss various economic issues with Japan in the Tokyo talks, as such issues involve other countries and the United States is also concerned. This was stated in Secretary of State Hull's statement on June 19. As for convening a conference of signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss China's economic and monetary issues, this is a possibility, but no one has yet contacted the United States on this matter. (Havas, 18th)

London: Regarding the Tokyo talks, after the British government refused to discuss the currency issue, the Daily Express recently published an editorial, expressing its delight at this firm attitude, stating, "The British government's refusal to discuss economic issues related to the whole of China with Japan is the right thing to do. Although there are anti-British protesters shouting threatening slogans around the British Embassy in Tokyo, Britain will not be moved by them. At this time, the British government should represent the people and announce to Japan that Japan's oppression by taking advantage of our danger has aroused animosity in Britain and will remain in our memory forever and cannot be dispelled in a short period of time. Once the current situation is clarified, when new problems arise in the world situation, Japan may regret it." (Havas, 18th)

Paris: Well-informed sources here have expressed great approval of Britain's refusal to discuss Japan's demands regarding Chinese silver and currency, recognizing that they are not purely Anglo-Japanese issues. It is said that France has adopted the same position as Britain. The French government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Henri, to explain to the Japanese government that various issues, such as the handover of Chinese silver reserves and the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender, should be negotiated by the relevant countries. It is heard that the British government has notified the Japanese government that it has decided that if the silver reserves and legal tender issues in China are discussed separately by Britain and Japan, there is no hope of obtaining beneficial results. When any further discussions are held on such economic proposals in the future, the views of other relevant countries must be heard. Although the British government has always acknowledged that the issue cannot be ignored when making any final discussions on the current situation in China, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and other relevant treaties must be given the opportunity to express their views.

### Tianjin Haihe River; South Bank Collapses; Special District 1 in Danger of Being Flooded; Water Level Five Feet Above River Surface

Tianjin: Mr. Tretjakew, an engineer with the Haihe Conservancy Commission, recently told the British authorities that the south bank is in a dangerous state. The river water there is one foot higher than the level reached by the 1917 flood. Although various efforts are being made to prevent a breach, the danger of flooding has not been eliminated. If it does flood and the river water rushes in, then Special District 1, the former German concession, will bear the brunt, and then it will inevitably spread to the boundary of the British concession. The British authorities are working rapidly to curb the river flooding. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Tianjin: The threat of flooding in Tianjin began to materialize today. According to an official announcement made by the Haihe Conservancy Commission at 10 p.m. tonight, the south bank has collapsed, and Special District 1 is in danger of being flooded. An official who answered the phone at the Haihe Conservancy Commission provided the above information, but no other details. It is not yet known when the flood will reach Special District 1, but it will probably be within a few hours. Several brave British youths went to the countryside today to observe the flood situation at the risk of their lives. It is said that the flood is rushing in from the bank like a waterfall, and its sound can be heard from afar. It is heard that the water outside the bank is five feet above the river surface, and the ground floors of all buildings in the concession may be flooded. Most stores are now moving goods before the flood arrives. According to various American expatriates who returned to the concession from the countryside, the tennis courts there have been submerged. The water level rose very rapidly this afternoon, and as a result, the gardens of the club have become a flooded area. The racecourse has also been flooded. According to the opinions of the American expatriates, judging from the speed at which the water level is rising, it is feared that the inner bank has collapsed, but this claim has not yet been officially confirmed, because the persons in charge of the Haihe Conservancy Commission are currently outside directing flood prevention work. According to the commission's report, the water outside the flood prevention dyke has risen to an unprecedented height and is continuing to rise rapidly. The southeastern part of Special District 3 is also in danger of being flooded. If the inner dyke collapses, the flood in Tianjin may be two feet higher than the flood in 1917. At the same time, all places along the river have been flooded, but the river water has not overflowed because it has been blocked by the newly built mud dam. In British Central Avenue and other low-lying areas, water is still gushing out of the ditches, and the roads are all wet. Reuters and other companies' residences have piled up sandbags or bricks in front of their doors, hoping to prevent water from flowing in. However, according to a document released by the Haihe Conservancy Commission, the water level in the concession may reach four or five feet, so the above-mentioned protective measures may not be effective. At present, flood prevention work in the concession is extremely difficult due to a lack of manpower. In addition, the price of sacks is soaring. Yesterday, the Beining Railway was blocked by water between Qinhuangdao and Tangshan, but it has now been restored. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Tianjin: The British escort ship HMS Sandwich arrived here this afternoon. Together with the HMS Bittern, which was originally stationed here, there are now two British warships in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

### Chinese Government Concerned About Shanghai Concessions; Japan Plotting Against Concessions; Subsequent Situation Will Become More Tense

Chongqing: Political figures here are paying keen attention to the news from Shanghai that the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic representatives stationed in Shanghai have been ordered to return to Tokyo to receive instructions on Japan's action plan for the Shanghai International Settlement. It is said that Japan is attempting to demand that the concession authorities hand over the "isolated army" and the Chinese Special District Court. Although this news has not yet been confirmed, all newspapers here have published it with alarming headlines, believing that the situation in Shanghai will become more tense. The Chinese authorities will not hesitate to issue statements on the "isolated army" and the court. Government officials have also discussed the attitude to be adopted in the event of a blockade of Shanghai, as the Chinese government is still extremely concerned about the international settlement, but it is not known whether it has exchanged views on this matter with the concession authorities or relevant countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement regarding the Japanese request to hand over the "isolated army" in Shanghai, saying that according to a Reuters report on the 17th, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai are agitating to hand over the "isolated army" housed by the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Japanese authorities. The main reason is that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been bearing the living expenses of this "isolated army" since the National Government was unable to remit funds. The groundlessness of this claim can be immediately proved by the real facts. According to information provided by the British Embassy in China, the Shanghai Municipal Council paid a total of 43,600 yuan for the living expenses of this "isolated army" until the end of March of this year. This expense was ordered to be paid by the Ministry of Finance in April, and the Chinese government also promised at the same time to repay the Shanghai Municipal Council for all subsequent advances for the living expenses of the "isolated army." From this, it can be seen that the so-called inability of the National Government to pay for the living expenses of the "isolated army" is purely a fabrication by the Japanese side. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council has fulfilled its friendly obligation by housing this "isolated army" in the international settlement, we hope that it will continue to provide them with protection in accordance with ordinary practice, and will not listen to the Japanese side's unreasonable demands and arbitrarily extradite them.

### Guangdong Puppet Regime to Launch Anti-British Movement in South China; Demanding Britain to Change its Policy of Aiding China as a Condition; Anti-British Movement in North China Still Expanding

Guangzhou: The director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Security Committee officially announced today that there is a possibility of a violent anti-British movement occurring. The Chinese employed by the British are in danger of being intimidated. It is said that the momentum of the anti-British movement is growing, and he is now trying to prevent it from becoming violent. He has received many submissions from various groups in the city urging local officials to step up the anti-British movement, including demands that all Chinese employed by the British in Shamian be dismissed, otherwise their lives will be endangered. He does not know what to do. The final decision will depend on the outcome of the Tokyo talks. The new regime is willing to maintain friendship with the British, but if the Tokyo talks fail, local officials will no longer be able to curb the anti-British movement. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Beiping: Japanese militarists today tried to include a new element in the anti-British movement in North China. A spokesman for the Japanese army here claimed that Communists are trying to control the anti-British movement. The spokesman said emphatically that the Chinese Communist Party has ordered its members to participate in the movement and cause illegal acts. The reporters did not believe this easily and asked questions. The spokesman replied that the movement is so large that it has not reached a point where the Japanese cannot control it. One reporter asked, "Is the situation already difficult to control?" The spokesman said yes. At the same time, Chinese employees of the British continued to receive mailed letters threatening death. The sender's address on the envelopes was written as "Salvation Army Headquarters," with the intention of facilitating the mailing of the letters. The Chinese employees of Reuters in Beiping also received this threatening letter, which stated that they would be killed if they did not resign immediately. This was the second letter of the same nature they had received in the past few days, which naturally had an impact on those who were more disturbed. Some of them have already resigned, but most are still working, distributing Reuters news throughout the city to European, Chinese, and Japanese subscribers, and still doing translation work in the office.

### Chinese Army Wins Great Victory on Baotou Beach

Yulin: The Chinese army won a great victory on Baotou Beach. The details are as follows: The fighting in the Dacheng West area on the 11th was extremely fierce. On the afternoon of the 12th, eight Japanese aircraft bombed twice. At the same time, more than 30 armored vehicles, covering nearly a thousand cavalry artillerymen, advanced towards Dacheng West, Wantai Hing, and other places, firing many cannons from noon to night. A certain commander who shocked the Japanese army in Dingfugu, Kebao, last year personally went to the front line to command, and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army from three sides. The morale of the Chinese army was high, and everyone bravely rushed to the front. A certain battalion commander who fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Dongsheng City for three days and three nights last year, and finally repelled the Japanese army, was also on the front line of Baotou Beach, fighting with the Japanese army, charging directly at the Japanese front. After six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was attacked by the Chinese army from three sides, suffered heavy casualties, and finally retreated to Dashiwan. The Chinese army captured Qiaolin and Zhaowanggui and other places. The pursuit troops surrounded Dashiwan. From the 13th, the Japanese army tried to defend Dashiwan and dared not go out, only sending out hungry soldiers to scout around. (Dispatch of the 17th)

### Pope of Rome Calls for Peace; Holds Lengthy Meeting with U.S. Postmaster General

The Vatican: Today is the 25th anniversary of the death of the late Pope Pius X. Pope Pius XII received many pilgrims at the Castel Gandolfo palace and blessed them, saying, "At this moment, the people of all countries are once again uneasy and feel distressed. We have worked to eliminate the crisis of war and plan to unite all countries to establish peace based on justice, so as to protect the freedom and honor of all nations. We wish to take this opportunity to pray for peace for Italy, for all of Europe, and for the whole world. We still believe that if all countries can maintain a moderate and fair spirit, they can avert disaster. We hope that the authorities of all countries will not lightly start a war and become sinners for all ages." (Havas dispatch of the 19th)

Castel Gandolfo: Pope Pius XII recently received U.S. Postmaster General Farley at the palace and had a long conversation with him. Postmaster General Farley is a close friend of President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch of the 19th)

### U.S. Authorities Worried About European Situation

Washington: People from all walks of life here, including those close to the White House, are increasingly worried about the latest developments in the European situation. President Roosevelt is taking a vacation on a ship on the Atlantic Ocean and is receiving reports via wireless telegraph at any time. People in the government are all showing signs of worry. Some political observers even say that the current situation in Europe is more serious than it was in September last year. (Havas dispatch of the 18th)

### Latin America's Relations with Japan Follows the Lead of the U.S.

Washington: According to news from here today, Latin American countries are closely watching the relations between the U.S. and Japan. Diplomats from Latin American countries mostly believe that the countries of the Western Hemisphere must take consistent or parallel actions. In other words, Latin American countries must follow the lead of the United States. If the Japanese navy conducts deep-sea exercises off the coasts of Latin American countries, the United States will immediately take defensive measures. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)

### Military Diplomacy Work Together: Germany Attempts to Control Central and Eastern Europe, Heavy Troops Gather on Polish Border, Actively Pushing Encirclement Policy, Romanian People Uneasy

Paris: The French Foreign Ministry continued to receive reports last night of German troops concentrating on the Polish border. German troops continued to be transported to Königsberg in East Prussia, developing towards the Polish Silesian border. This time, the deployment of heavy troops to Silesia gives the German army great power in both the western and northern borders, because Germany already had heavy troops stationed in the western border. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

London: The Warsaw correspondent of the "News Chronicle" reports that 15,000 German army personnel, originally stationed mostly in Bavaria, have now been transferred to Slovakia to concentrate, with some stationed near the Polish border. More than seventy trains of barbed wire have been transported there. The Slovak authorities have also been ordered to accelerate the completion of all military highways leading to the Polish border. In addition, the Austrian troops originally stationed on the border between Slovakia and Germany, because they were friendly with the Slovak residents and the Czechs in the protectorate of Bohemia, were considered "unreliable" by the authorities and have been withdrawn, replaced by troops sent from Germany proper. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: According to sources here, the new military treaty signed between Germany and Slovakia on August 17 does not contain provisions for Germany to increase its troop presence in Slovakia or expand its military activities there. The treaty only delineates the boundaries of military zones in certain areas and corrects geographically unsuitable situations caused by previous treaties. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: Regarding the reports in British and French newspapers that Germany has concluded a military agreement with Slovakia, authoritative sources here have solemnly denied it, stating that the locations where German troops are stationed are all within the boundaries delineated by the German-Slovak agreement in March of this year. No German troops are present in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, but the German military delegation to Slovakia has now been changed to a military advisory group, maintaining contact with the stationed troops. (Haitong Press dispatch, 19th)

Warsaw: The establishment of a military agreement between Germany and Slovakia has been commented on by government figures here, stating that this agreement is tantamount to a military alliance treaty. Although the reality has long existed, the conclusion of an agreement now only legally recognizes it. However, the number of German troops and military equipment in Slovakia will inevitably increase as a result. The intention is clearly to encircle Poland. It is known that the so-called encirclement policy has not been pursued by Western European countries, but Germany is making every effort to promote it. As for the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, recent developments have been satisfactory, and commercial relations are permitted. The Soviet government had previously increased its troop presence in the Polish border area but has now voluntarily withdrawn them, demonstrating the close friendship between the two countries. As for the relationship between Poland and Romania, the alliance treaty between the two countries (established in 1921) in principle only guarantees Romania's eastern border, but when necessary, the scope of military cooperation between the two sides should be expanded. Furthermore, as for the relationship between Poland and Hungary, there has been no change recently, but this place is paying close attention to Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's visits to Germany and Italy with considerable anxiety. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Bucharest: The concentration of German troops in Slovakia is causing concern among Romanians, who fear that Germany may seek to take action in Romania because it has failed to achieve its goals in Danzig. Although Romania has an alliance treaty with Poland, its original intention was to defend against the Soviet Union, not against Germany. Today, Germany can disregard Hungary's consent and use the Carpathian Ruthenia province of Hungary (formerly part of Czechoslovakia) to attack Romania, penetrating deep into the hinterland and cutting off the Polish and Romanian troops into two parts, annihilating the Romanian army in one fell swoop. At that time, not only would it seize large quantities of oil and wheat, but it would also control the mouth of the Danube and gain a foothold on the Black Sea coast. In military terms, it could obtain a good base from which to move troops south and invade the Mediterranean, which would not be difficult. This move is far more important in material and spiritual terms than the annexation of Danzig to Germany. It is rumored that Hungary will soon join the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy, and Germany is exerting pressure on Yugoslavia to allow Germany to control the railway line connecting Vienna to the Italian port of Trieste (passing through Croatia) in wartime. All of these things are causing anxiety among the Romanians. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### Britain and France Remain Calm, Watching the Evolution of the Situation, Reaffirming Their Determination to Resist Violence

Paris: As news of the international situation becomes increasingly tense, mostly from Berlin, Paris remains calm as usual. At the same time, all possibilities have been anticipated and preparations are being made to respond. Britain has granted Poland a credit loan to purchase everything needed for national defense, which is particularly noteworthy. A semi-official statement summarizes Paris's views on the international situation as follows: The British and French governments are now observing the evolution of the situation with great calmness. The positions of the two governments have been stated several times. France and Britain are determined to resist force, regardless of the form it takes. It is not known whether the various news reports reaching Paris are a sign of an intimidation campaign or a test of strength, but France and Britain remain calm and are determined to adhere to their responsibilities. According to opinions in French political and diplomatic circles, the international situation will remain serious for some time. Germany is now continuing its military plans, the slightest hair of which has reached the point of disrupting the national economy and hindering the supply of necessities for civilians. Since August 15, several batches of reservists have been recalled into the military, and there are also reports of important troop concentrations, said to be from East Prussia and Upper Silesia. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's frequent meetings with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop are also a factor that makes people uneasy. The hasty return of the ambassadors to Germany and Italy to their countries and Mussolini's convocation of a meeting of army leaders are also enough to make people uneasy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Paris: As the Axis powers are actively engaged in military and diplomatic activities, responsible sources here have commented, "If any violent actions occur again at this time, no matter where they occur, Britain and France will definitely resist them. The current international situation is indeed serious, and the recent actions taken by the Axis powers are increasingly convincing." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

London: The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, met with the German State Secretary Weizsäcker this afternoon and reaffirmed Britain's position in a firm tone, stating that Britain would definitely fulfill its guarantee obligations to Poland. Britain's position is evident in its refusal of Germany's suggestion to mediate the issue of the Free City of Danzig. Regarding this matter, German leader Hitler said to League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Burckhardt, some time ago that Britain should immediately send a senior official to Germany to discuss the Danzig issue. The British side believes that this matter is exactly the same as Prime Minister Chamberlain's flight to Berchtesgaden, Germany, in September of last year, and immediately rejected it. This is what happened at that time, and it has been kept secret all along, only to be revealed today. However, it is widely rumored that the Vatican or Hungary will mediate the Danzig issue. Upon hearing this, the British side is paying close attention. It is reported that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Rome to hold talks with the Italian authorities is not unrelated to this rumor. Sources close to the government here said that Hungary is a friendly country to Poland and has close relations with the Axis powers. If it can act as a mediator, it would be quite suitable, but whether it can be effective is doubtful, because Germany's attitude is becoming increasingly tough, as State Secretary Weizsäcker made clear to Ambassador Henderson today. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### Britain and France Discuss Treaty Provisions, France and Poland Establish Loan Agreement

London: Regarding Germany's demand for the cession of the Polish Corridor, the British government is responding with practical actions. Yesterday, important British and Polish officials began discussing the final draft of the military alliance. Polish Foreign Ministry legal advisor, Kulski, and the Polish ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, continued to discuss the issue of mutual military assistance with British legal experts in order to determine the final form of the alliance. According to well-informed sources, the validity period of the treaty is usually limited to five years, but it can be extended with the consent of both parties. The British government is now calmly preparing everything to cope with the serious situation within two weeks. It is heard that the British government believes that a European war may not be unavoidable, but the serious crisis is imminent. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

Paris: French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz signed an agreement here, providing Poland with a credit loan to purchase defense necessities from France, totaling 400 million francs. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Berlin Vigorously Promotes the Idea That the Current Situation Is Unbearable, Saying the Key to Peace or War Lies in Britain's Attitude, Nuremberg Congress Decided to Proceed as Scheduled

Berlin: The official newspapers are now daily calling for the current situation to be considered unbearable and for the Danzig issue to be resolved urgently without further delay. Therefore, well-informed sources expect that there will be developments before the National Socialist Party Congress to be held in Nuremberg on September 2, because the current level of propaganda campaign seems unlikely to continue for three weeks. German passersby who have not forgotten the events of a year ago now read the newspaper's tone and expect an incident soon. They believe that in the best case, Hitler can get Danzig without firing a shot, but this kind of success has little significance for ordinary citizens in Germany. In the worst case, Europe may not be able to avoid the whirlpool of war. At the same time, senior German officials in their conversations give the impression that Berlin still cannot be without doubt whether Britain is truly willing to go to war with Germany for Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: The monthly magazine "Berlin Rome Tokyo" published an article giving a serious warning to the world Poland, allowing it to be Britain, and advising them to reconsider their attitude and purpose. It is believed that this article was written by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, so special attention is paid to it. The article stated that the world must understand the effectiveness of the German-Italian alliance, which not only depends on concrete interests and undeniable rights, but also decides on issues related to national honor. The Danzig issue, in terms of its survival, allows the methods used by Britain's intervention in recent months to put it at the forefront, which will eventually become an unbearable burden for German national honor. British policy has made it impossible for the Danzig issue and related issues to be resolved through negotiations between Germany and Poland. Western democratic countries have led Poland to hold an arrogant attitude towards Germany and Germans living in Poland, and have put German-Polish friendship in an extremely tense state. The agitation of the Polish people has also made it impossible for Germany and Poland to calmly discuss the issues. The Polish government is no longer able to control the overall situation in Poland, so the British government has placed the responsibility for resolving peace or war in the hands of the blind and impatient. As for what has already been decided at the Salzburg meeting, the only answer that can be given is that the powers engaged in encirclement, including Poland, can no longer tolerate any moral, political, or other provocative actions against Germany. Our two allied countries will unite as one to curb it. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: There have been many rumors here lately, saying that the National Socialist Party Congress originally scheduled to be held in Nuremberg in early September will now be postponed. Political figures here have denied it. The 25th anniversary of the Battle of Tannenberg is also scheduled to be held as scheduled on the 27th of this month. (Haitong dispatch)

### Germany's Demands on Poland Expand, Want to Restore Pre-War Borders

Warsaw: Most of the 200 National Socialist Party members arrested in Upper Silesia have now been released pending investigation of the results of the charges of being border scouts and engaging in "provocative activities." A Polish official spokesman claimed today that German demands now seem to have expanded, including not only Danzig but also the Corridor and Polish Silesia. Therefore, it indicates that the issue is very broad, stating that Germany wants to return to its 1914 borders. It is rumored here that the German secret police have closed the headquarters of the Polish Overseas Chinese Federation in Berlin and the Slavic Bank building. A team of Polish students going to Monaco for a sports competition was stopped by the German authorities in Bohemia yesterday and forced to return to Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Danzig New Army Parades, Forster Awards Flags

Danzig: The Danzig New Army (whose existence was previously denied months ago) publicly paraded for the first time today, with Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster awarding them military flags. The flags were painted with swastikas and surrounded by Danzig's skull insignia. The army consisted of 1,500 men, had the appearance of a well-trained army, and carried new-style rifles, machine guns, and direct-fire guns. They paraded to the Great School Field. Forster gave a short speech, saying that in the past twenty years, Danzig had no army or fort of its own. The treaty now stipulates that if Danzig's own police force is insufficient, Danzig should be protected by Poland. Now Danzig is threatened by the country it relies on for protection, so it has to establish an army to protect itself. Danzig now has the newest army equipped with the latest weapons. In the current threatening situation, what the Danzig leader is doing is only what any national leader is forced to do. The mere words of the treaty or constitution are no longer applicable. The only thing that suits the actual situation is the willingness of 400,000 people to save themselves. Forster concluded by saying, "You have been called up to defend the beautiful ancient city of Danzig, to resist possible Polish attacks from inside and outside." The commander of the army gave a reply after receiving the flag, saying, "We would rather die in battle than be Polish." (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Polish-Danzig Negotiations in a Stalemate

Danzig: Polish Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, one of the German leaders of Danzig, Greiser, and League of Nations Commissioner to Danzig, Burckhardt, held a meeting today. It is heard that in addition to the customs issue, the status of Danzig was also discussed. It is said that negotiations on the latter issue have reached a stalemate. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Danzig: Yesterday, Danzig officials wore the uniform of the border police for the first time, appearing on the Danzig border. The only difference was that the swastika insignia was surrounded by a skull. These people are now stationed on the border to inspect passports. In the past, this task was performed by ordinary customs officials or Danzig plainclothes police. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Germany's War Preparations Madness: Purchasing Large Quantities of Raw Materials from the London Market

London: Many newspapers have said that Germany has recently purchased large quantities of raw materials in the market here. The "News Chronicle" reported that the country's procurement personnel are willing to make transactions with merchants at high prices. In the case of copper, as of today, 10,000 tons have been purchased in a week, of which 3,000 tons were purchased yesterday. When the market opened, the price was £44 per ton, and by the time the market closed, it had risen to £44 18 shillings and 9 pence. In the case of rubber, the country has also purchased more than 17,000 tons this month, more than doubling its usual monthly needs. 4,000 tons were purchased yesterday, and the price of rubber immediately rose to £8 15 shillings per ton, an increase of 3 shillings and 16 pence in one day. Government and economic figures here are concerned that Germany's actions are sufficient to prove that the country is actively preparing for war politically, and that these raw materials can also be purchased by the British government in wartime. Now that large quantities have been sold to Germany, the inventory here will inevitably be greatly reduced. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### British and French Delegations Visit Large-Scale Soviet Air Force Exercises, Disputes Arise in Talks Between Three Countries' Staff, Soviet Statement Unrelated to Far East Issues

Moscow: A message was published in the Polish newspaper "Polska Gazeta," the "Polish Express," and the "Warsaw Post" these days, claiming that in the Soviet military talks with Britain and France currently underway in Moscow, disputes arose because the Soviet Union demanded that Britain and France provide assistance in the event of a war in the Far East. TASS is hereby ordered to declare that the above message is pure fabrication. There are indeed points of contention between the two sides in the resolution of these negotiations, but they relate to other issues and have nothing to do with the Far East issue. (TASS dispatch, 19th)

Moscow: Yesterday was the Soviet Aviation Memorial Day. The staff talks between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France were suspended for one day to allow the three countries' delegations to visit the large-scale exercises held at the Tushino airfield near Moscow. There were 500 civil and military aircraft performing various complex flight and combat skills. More than 1.5 million people visited. This move by the Soviet Union has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it can impress the British and French delegations, and on the other hand, it can encourage ordinary Soviet youths to join aviation, so as to create a great reserve of pilots. As for the three countries' staff talks, the larger ones will continue to be held this morning. According to the new regulations, a four-hour meeting must be convened every day. The issues exchanged and the events agreed upon in these talks will not be announced. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Moscow: The annual Soviet Aviation Day celebration was held today at the Tushino airfield outside Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of Moscow residents visited the site to watch their country's air force and pilots perform their divine might. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Malenkov, Beria, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Shcherbakov, Badaev, and Rodionov, all the dignitaries attended in person. In addition, there were many guests including members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Soviet heroes, representatives of factories in Moscow, scientists, writers, artists, and members of the diplomatic corps, British and French military representatives, domestic and foreign journalists, etc. The celebration began at 3:00 p.m. First, there was a large review of hundreds of air defense and aviation association training aircraft and sports aircraft, all driven by members of various aviation clubs who were amateur flight learners, such as engineers, technicians, workers, office workers, and housewives. Among them, two teams of training aircraft driven by women performed stunts. Secondly, there was a review of the glider team. At that time, an aircraft towing eleven gliders in a sky train was discovered in the air, and the audience applauded thunderously. Then, two large teams of gliders performed aerobatics, and their skills were exceptionally outstanding. There was also a wonderful exercise by the air force. At the opening, Captain Sholokhov drove a high-speed fighter plane to perform various stunts for several minutes. Captain Koshevoy drove another type of fighter plane to follow, and his skills were also comparable. Then, two fighter planes took off to simulate combat, driven by Colonel Katichayev and Major Golovnya. After the battle, five red-wing fighter planes flew low over the field at the same time to perform a group stunt. Then, a team of bombers appeared under the cover of fighter planes, attacking the factory and aircraft models on the edge of the field. At that time, anti-aircraft guns fired simultaneously in the field, and fighter planes also took off to fight back, and the scene was extremely moving. After this scene was over, many high-speed aircraft of various types flew to the sky over the field, and the audience suddenly saw many marines parachuting down from the air, all impartial and safe landing in the center of the airport. The entire audience expressed extreme admiration for this outstanding skill. The last scene was when Soviet hero Gromov drove the newly completed giant aircraft "USSR L-670" leading a team of airships to fly across the sky over the field. Throughout the entire exercise, the atmosphere was tense and the audience was extremely excited. (TASS dispatch, 18th)

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Visits Italian Prime Minister, Hungary's Joining Not Impossible, Ciano Flies to Albania's Capital

Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky flew to a city in northern Italy for a vacation this morning, and is scheduled to stay there until the 21st. Foreign Minister Ciano flew to the Albanian capital this morning, and will hold a foundation stone laying ceremony for various public utilities offices there. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this morning, lasting for three hours. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. The content of the talks has not been ascertained. According to sources in the Hungarian embassy here, Foreign Minister Csáky was warmly welcomed by the Germans during his visit to Germany and was deeply impressed. As for the rumors that Germany has put pressure on Hungary to induce it to change its policies and take consistent action with the Axis countries, Foreign Minister Csáky laughed it off. The spokesperson went on to say that Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Rome was due to the tense European situation and to take the opportunity to establish direct contact with Italian politicians. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

Budapest: Although the Hungarian newspapers have tried their best to publish news of Foreign Minister Csáky's visits to Germany and Italy, they have not commented on it. Government officials are also quite vague. Political figures have said that the Hungarian view of the European situation has been repeatedly explained by Regent Horthy and Prime Minister Teleki. In short, Hungary is willing to cooperate in friendship with Germany, Italy, and Poland, and to improve relations with other countries, but is unwilling to accept any restrictions that would harm its freedom and independence. Someone said that Hungary's joining the military alliance between Germany and Italy is not impossible, but it may not be realized before Foreign Minister Csáky returns home. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: Regarding the reports in British and French newspapers that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky had previously visited German leader Hitler and presented a "22-point agreement," the semi-official German News Agency has solemnly denied it. According to British and French newspapers, Germany pressured Hungary in the form of an ultimatum to conclude a friendship treaty and military alliance, and at the same time suggested a customs and monetary union, etc. The German News Agency said that Western European public opinion is too credulous to believe in rumors. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### Japanese Shipyard Breaches Contract, Refuses to Deliver Ships, Soviet Union Protests

Moscow: The Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs recently issued a reply to a memorandum from Japan, stating that the Japanese government is suspected of condoning and shielding the illegal actions of the Japanese Matsuo Shipyard in failing to deliver ships ordered by the Soviet Union and refusing to return the deposit of 1,647,750 Japanese yen. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for the Japanese shipyard and its guarantor's breach of contract. (TASS dispatch, 18th)

### British Credit Loan to China, To Be Used to Purchase Machinery, Agreement Said to Be Signed Yesterday

London: According to news from here today, the £3 million loan from Britain to China is to be used for China to purchase British machinery, such as various machines for manufacturing munitions or arsenals, and machines for manufacturing aircraft. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

London: Although news of the signing of the £3 million export credit loan agreement has not been confirmed by British and Chinese officials, reliable sources insist that the agreement was signed in London today. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

London: Financial circles in London issued a message today stating that the British government has delayed approving the £3 million export credit loan to China because it fears that this move will further fuel anti-British movements in Japan. During the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated that Britain must fulfill the principles of this negotiation and cease all economic assistance to China. A British government spokesperson stated at the end of this week that Britain had already signed an export credit loan agreement with China. Bankers here expect that if the Tokyo talks fail, the British government will use the export credit loan to China as a final move. Sources say that in this credit loan agreement, Britain will supply China with machinery for manufacturing munitions, military supplies, and aircraft. British banking circles said last night that the Bank of England has expressed doubts about this credit loan. Furthermore, according to unconfirmed reports, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie reported to the Foreign Office that this credit loan to China would not affect Japan's attitude toward Britain. The Chinese side is very anxious about the delayed signing of this loan, as the full text of the agreement was drafted several weeks ago. The British Cabinet currently considers the crisis in the European war as the primary issue and is unwilling to take further risks in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

### US Asiatic Fleet, Well-Equipped, Remarks by Yarnell

San Francisco, USA: Rear Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, returned here today aboard the President Coolidge. When asked about the situation in the Far East, he replied, "The future is unpredictable. Over the past two years, several unexpected incidents, all caused by the Japanese military, have affected American interests. The sinking of the Panay is just one link in the chain. However, the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet does not need to be expanded. Our fleet has a total of thirty-five warships and six thousand officers and men." It is noted that Rear Admiral Yarnell is known among Americans for his deep understanding of Far Eastern affairs. Congress has awarded him the "Meritorious Service" medal for his outstanding achievements during his tenure. He will soon go to Washington to receive the medal and meet with President Roosevelt to report on the situation in the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### Activities of Japanese and Puppet Forces in Various Parts of Guangdong Province, Zhongshan and Xinhui Continually Violated, Most of the Japanese Troops in Shunde Withdraw

Hong Kong Correspondent: After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and its subordinate areas in Guangdong Province, they implemented a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, using puppet organizations as accomplices, resulting in extreme chaos in the area. The recent activities of Japanese and puppet forces are summarized as follows:

Zhongshan

The post-war work in the recovered area of ​​Zhonghengmen was just completed. On the 9th, Japanese warships launched a large-scale attack on Dieshi in the 3rd district and Guzhen in the 9th district, attempting to send troops to land, which made the situation in Zhongshan tense again. It was found that at about 9:00 a.m. on the 9th, six Japanese gunboats, two transport ships, thirty-four armed fishing boats, and several rubber boats loaded with Japanese soldiers sailed from the outer sea of ​​Jiangmen in the rain to the Hengmen sea, and attacked Zhongshan in two ways: One way bombed Gu Zhen in the 9th district, and the other way bombed the Dieshi and Quanlu areas in the 3rd district. As soon as the merchants and people in Shiqi heard the artillery fire, they fled. Wu Fei, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Area, immediately ordered the local teams to be on strict alert after receiving the report. However, because the Japanese warships were too far away, they did not return fire. Japanese warships fired dozens of shots. At about 11 o'clock, the Japanese planes were unable to come out to help due to heavy rain, and the Japanese boats did not dare to approach the shore, so they temporarily stopped firing. However, the Japanese warships and boats still berthed in the Heng River. At 12:00 noon, they continued to fire artillery and bombard Dieshi and Quanlu. The Chinese army was still preparing for the attack and successively sent troops to increase their defense. Japanese warships fired more than a hundred shots in a row. At about 4:00 in the evening, the sky was still not clear, and the Japanese warships sailed back to Jiangmen, but four gunboats and four rubber boats were left moored in the Yinzhou Lake, and they fired randomly at Muzhou and Xinsha in Xinhui. On that day, Japanese warships fired more than two hundred shots, and many houses were destroyed and dozens of people were killed or injured in Dieshi, Quanlu, Gu Zhen, and Muzhou. There were also shells near Shiqi. One shell fell on the sea, destroying a banana boat, killing one person and injuring two others. Afterwards, Wu Fei, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Area, specially issued a letter to all guerrilla teams in the area, expressing his condolences to the anti-Japanese war in Hengmen, and encouraged all officers and soldiers to continue to fight bravely. Because Zhongshan is located near the ocean, the Japanese may invade again at any time, so they should fulfill their duty to defend the land and strengthen their vigilance. If the Japanese army dares to invade again, they will give them a bigger blow. At the same time, he also issued letters to the chiefs of townships, towns, villages, paos, jias, and all the people of the county, expressing his appreciation to the people of the fourth district of Zhongshan for their enthusiastic assistance in the team's resistance against Japan, and called on all the people of the county to mobilize to form a united front with the team to strengthen the anti-Japanese forces and defend their homeland.

The Zhang mansion on Xinan Litong Street in Sanshui County was occupied by Morita, an officer of the Japanese army stationed there. At 6:00 a.m. on the 1st of this month, a bomb was found on the right side of the staircase of the house. Before it could be moved, it exploded loudly. The stairs and board walls caught fire on the spot and burned fiercely. Japanese soldiers and workers in the house scrambled to rescue, but the fire was so fierce that they could not put it out. Japanese officer Morita and his wife, Katsuyama Kaoru, panicked and jumped out of the window, falling and seriously injured. Morita broke his left hand and right foot, while Katsuyama Kaoru broke her right foot and suffered a shock to her abdomen, which may endanger her life.

Xinhui

The Jianghui war has been going on and off. Chinese and Japanese armies have been confronting each other in strict formation in recent days. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese army in Huicheng built more than a dozen artillery positions on Guifeng Mountain and Xiangshan Mountain to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking Huicheng. Most of the heavy equipment and supplies were also transported to the two mountains for storage. A certain mechanical unit of the Gui Army stationed on Xinhe Road in the Chinese side moved to a certain place early in the morning of the 7th and fired artillery at the Japanese army's position there. The Japanese army also fired artillery to resist stubbornly, and a fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. It lasted from about 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., when it stopped. The rumbling sound shook the mountains and could be clearly heard in Daze and Niuwan. At 7:30 a.m. on the 8th, more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops in Huicheng invaded Mani and Shuchakeng. The villagers immediately beat gongs to warn them, and three or four hundred villagers armed with weapons gathered outside the village to intercept the Japanese and puppet troops, and a fierce battle broke out. The Japanese and puppet troops came fiercely and rushed in twice, but the villagers fought bravely to resist. At about 9:00, the Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Huicheng when they saw that they could not succeed. When the Japanese and puppet troops invaded, the Japanese army in Huicheng also fired artillery to cover them, so many houses in the villages were destroyed. At present, the Japanese army in Jianghui is recruiting rascals and gangsters to expand and compile the "puppet pacification army" to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking because of their weak strength. Those who have been compiled have more than a hundred people. However, the puppet pacification army is a rabble and cannot withstand a single blow. In addition, Japanese warships have been harassing Muzhou in Xinhui County for days. On the afternoon of the 9th, Japanese warships fired more than 30 shots at Muzhou and Xinsha. At 5:00, they retreated to Jiangmen. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 10th, six Japanese warships, armed fishing boats and thirty or forty rubber boats sailed from the outer sea to Yinzhou Lake and fired artillery at Muzhou. The local team fought back with local cannons. The sound of artillery was extremely fierce. At about 10 o'clock, the sound of artillery in Muzhou gradually subsided. On the morning of the 13th, three Japanese warships and several rubber boats sailed from overseas into the Zhongxin border to spy on Muzhou and Aosha. The Chinese army immediately strengthened its coastal defense forces and waited in strict formation.

Shunde

The Chinese guerrillas in Shunde County have been very active recently. They have launched attacks on Japanese camps in Daliang, Rongqi, Chencun, and Guizhou, and have gained a lot. The Japanese army stationed in Ronggui has destroyed the nearby bridges, increased the number of artillery troops to defend, and at the same time, most of the Japanese troops originally stationed in Chencun have suddenly withdrawn, and the defense is now the responsibility of the puppet army. On the evening of the 4th of this month, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas attacked the Japanese army. At about 12 o'clock, they confronted the Japanese army in the southern suburbs of Chencun. The guerrillas fought bravely and wiped out more than 30 Japanese soldiers. Then more than 100 Japanese soldiers from the nearby Lintou Japanese camp rushed to reinforce. The guerrillas retreated when they saw the opportunity. Unexpectedly, in the dark night, the Japanese army that came to reinforce mistakenly thought that the Japanese and puppet troops were the Chinese guerrillas and fired fiercely. The two sides came into contact. After holding each other for twenty minutes, they realized the misunderstanding, but more than a dozen people had been killed or injured. When the guerrillas retreated, they turned to Chencun Houyong and intercepted two Japanese military grain boats. As for Daliang, the county seat, since it was occupied, the Japanese and puppet troops have been extremely fierce, opening up smoke gambling. The traitors and puppet police often have disputes over rights because they collect gambling money. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, seven puppet soldiers were collecting protection fees at the Leli Pai Jiu Hall on Huancheng Road. At that time, the puppet self-police team also came to collect fees, so a dispute arose, followed by a conflict. The puppet soldiers were defeated and fled in embarrassment. Then more than 30 soldiers from the army came to make trouble again, and the puppet self-police team also showed no weakness, summoned more than 20 members of the party, and resisted. The two sides then fought each other. For a time, gunshots were heard, and shops and residents in the city closed their doors and fled, and the order was in chaos. The puppet self-police team was outnumbered and suffered a total of five deaths and injuries before fleeing. It was heard that the puppet army also had casualties. Also, on the 7th, at night, the Chinese army in Guizhou fired artillery at the Japanese and puppet troops in Nantou, firing dozens of shots and destroying many houses. When the Japanese army in Daliang City heard the news, most of them were transferred to the suburbs to defend, and the situation seemed very panic. In addition, the Japanese army in Longjiang recently sent dozens of Japanese soldiers, with five soldiers in a team, to various villages nearby to be responsible for the so-called reorganization and training of the puppet self-police teams in various villages. On the 31st of last month, five Japanese soldiers went to Guisha Township near Longjiang. When they arrived, they immediately ordered all the puppet self-police teams in the township to gather, but one of them happened to go to the fields to work and did not arrive at the gathering. The Japanese army pointed out that they were defying orders and beat them severely, which aroused public anger. The puppet self-police teams rushed forward and surrounded and killed the five Japanese soldiers. So far, no Japanese troops have come to harass the township.

### Accompanying Records of Fengxian Situation, Wu Jiaqiao First Suffered Fire Damage, Qingcun Port Was Also Burned to Ashes

Punan Correspondent: Since the Japanese army occupied Nanqiao, they have paid great attention to defense because they were afraid of guerrilla attacks. Iron gates were installed at each intersection, and steel guns were erected. No one was allowed to enter or leave without a pass. Recently, citizen registration was held and citizen certificates were reissued with strict restrictions. The puppet maintenance association was originally headed by Qian, but Qian resigned because it was not easy to deal with the environment. The Japanese propaganda class then asked Zhu, a puppet section chief from Shanghai, to take over the office. The guerrillas had already disintegrated into smaller units and hid in the four villages. In the past two months, they had contacted the Japanese army more than a dozen times, big and small. The Japanese side felt quite uneasy about this, and specially transferred more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops last week in order to defend it for a long time. The Xi Township established a military station in Xiaotang Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. It is said that the Japanese will open a puppet people's training class and a puppet primary school in the town. A few days ago, the Japanese army patrolled westward from the town and contacted the guerrillas in Wujiaqiao. They set fire to part of the town's houses. The Japanese army used Qingcun Port as a military station in the eastern township. On the 17th, they sent a team to go there. When they found traces of guerrillas in the town, they copied out items stored in Yu's residence and immediately set fire. Fortunately, the wind was not strong and it was extinguished early before it spread. The essence of the town was destroyed by the Japanese army when they passed by last spring. Now it has been robbed again and has become a dead market.

Zhelin Qianjiaqiao, Qicundun, Pingan Lake, and other places where the salt factories are located are all general areas for tax evasion revenue. The Japanese army tried to seize them repeatedly, but they failed to control them due to the activities of the guerrillas. At present, only Zhelin is being stationed and collected by the team. It is heard that due to the abnormal weather this summer and the fact that most of the salt people have fled outside, the salt slabs have been abandoned and there is little production. Therefore, although May, June, and July are busy months, the income is still minimal.

In terms of Fengxian's administration, the provincial government has long assigned a county magistrate to handle affairs as usual. In terms of military affairs, the eastern townships are under the jurisdiction of Yu Taosheng, the magistrate of Nanhui County of the Second Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. Therefore, local affairs are often urged by the Nanhui County Government nearby. Tai Ri Bridge, Zhoujia Lane, Touqiao, and other places were originally garrisoned by the Third Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. After the resignation of Li Zhiming, the captain of the detachment, they were also incorporated into the Second Detachment and entrusted to Gu Shouxin. The western townships west of Qingcun and Xuliqiao are entirely under the control of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and their defense area reaches Yexie Caojing in Songjiang County and Jinshanwei and Shanyang in Jinshan County. Because the area is strategically important, it has more contact with the Japanese.

### Nantong Guerrillas, Killed Japanese Sentry, And Seized a Rifle

Nantong Correspondent: The ×× Brigade organized by Nantong workers, led by intelligence director ×××, went to Tangjiazhai on the afternoon of the 8th of this month with four soldiers, each hiding a pistol, to attack the Japanese army. When passing the Dayangqiao entrance west of the Tangzha River, the soldiers pretended to bow to the Japanese sentry, and then took advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness and shot and killed them with pistols, and seized a Japanese Type 38 rifle, and returned to the team safely. Afterwards, the Japanese army stationed in Tangzha searched all the shops, and it was heard that they were all looted.

### The Situation in Western Shanghai Was Serious Last Night, Conflict Between Puppet Police and Detective Police, Western Detective Chief Jin Shiluk Was Shot and Wounded, Four Puppet Police Were Shot Down, Two Were Injured and Two Were Killed, Security Was Tightened in the Avenue Joffre Area

After a series of cases related to public security occurred near the boundary of Western Shanghai, the police authorities of the police station have paid close attention to it and taken strict precautions. At the same time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which is in charge, has dispatched police cars and armed detective police to patrol the area constantly to maintain law and order. At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday, a police car was ordered to drive to the border area of ​​the concession to inspect. At that time, the police car first went to Connaught Road, and then along the road to the west, searching any suspicious people and vehicles.

Puppet Police Detectives, Invade the Concession

When it was close to 6:00, the police car and detectives had turned into Avenue Joffre, and were about to reach the vicinity of Xinkangli. They saw more than ten puppet policemen and plainclothes men resembling puppet detectives, holding weapons, striding on Avenue Joffre in the jurisdiction of the concession. The police detectives of the police station thought that these people did not know the boundary, so they stopped the car and went forward to explain and persuade them to withdraw.

Ordered to Withdraw, Resistance with Guns

Unexpectedly, more than ten people ignored them, and even threatened to resist with the weapons they held. While they were holding each other, Jin Luke (Kin Look), the Western Detective Chief on the police car, also came forward to persuade them, but they still ignored him, and even threatened to make trouble. The Western Detective Chief turned around and prepared to report to the police station by telephone. Unexpectedly, these people took the lead in firing guns and shooting at Jin, and the bullet entered from the back.

Both Sides Fought, Bullets Rained Down

But Jin was a hundred times more courageous. Although he was seriously injured, he was still able to stand firm and urgently directed the detectives to prepare. But at this time, the puppet police and others shot their guns and bullets at the police car, as dense as a string of beads, so the machine guns prepared on the police car were also fired, and it was like entering a battlefield.

A Squad of British Troops, Rushed to Suppress

The Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene after receiving Jin's report. The British Defense Force Headquarters in the area also received a report of the incident, and at the same time assigned a squad of British troops to suppress it, and immediately blocked traffic in the Avenue Joffre area.

The Injured Detective Chief, Was Sent to the Hospital for Treatment

Seeing that the situation was expanding and seeing that four of their partners had been arrested and shot down, the puppet police and others were inevitably flustered and fled out of the boundary. Jin also waited until a large number of detectives arrived before realizing that he was injured and fell to the ground. The detectives helped him into the car and sent him for treatment.

Four Puppet Police, Two Dead and Two Injured

Two of the four puppet policemen who had been shot down had already died, and two were injured. After interrogation, it was confirmed that one was Ni Liangen, 41 years old, who was shot in the knee, and the other was Zhao Faqing, 44 years old, who was shot in the abdomen and legs. They are now being treated in the hospital first.

A Passerby, Was Shot and Injured

In addition, there was also a passerby named Zhu Changrong (23 years old), who was also shot and injured in the leg. Because it was necessary to investigate, he was also sent to the Public Concession Hospital. After the incident, the situation there was still very serious. The British army was on guard and had not withdrawn, and the nearby inspection work had not stopped.

### Foreign Nationals Inspect Various Coastal Provinces, Excellent Impressions

A foreign national recently inspected Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces and returned to Shanghai. According to his talk, after the coastal blockade, the price of foreign goods has risen slightly, the price of local goods is cheap, and the food supply has been adequately adjusted by the authorities, and there is no shortage. Although planes are constantly bombing various places, the people are accustomed to it, and their patriotic feelings are extremely high. They all understand the meaning of resisting Japan and saving the country, and the people's sentiments are very different from the past. Their transportation mechanism is complete, many new roads have been opened, and the opening time is quite accurate, which is beyond expectations. The future is truly unlimited.

### Norwegian Minister Returns Home This Morning

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post stated that the Norwegian Minister to China, Japan, and Siam, Colonel, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife and is scheduled to return to his country by boat tomorrow (20th).

### After the Black Market Foreign Exchange Contracted Sharply, Import Surplus Has Indeed Decreased Sharply, Although the Shanghai Customs Has Not Complied with the Import Prohibition Order, Exports Have Increased Sharply After Foreign Exchange Tightening

The Jianghai Customs' import and export trade statistics for July show that the value of imported foreign goods was 59,011,6344 yuan in national currency, and the value of exported local goods was 42,117,185 yuan in national currency, resulting in an import surplus of 16,900,9159 yuan. From January to July, the total value of imports was 282,108,1359 yuan in national currency, and the total value of exports was 214,531,909 yuan in national currency. Although the Jianghai Customs in the occupied area did not comply with the measures to prohibit the import of goods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance due to the special circumstances, the import of goods was greatly affected due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange. Therefore, the import of foreign goods in July decreased sharply. For example, the import in May this year was 73,512,896 yuan, and the export was 34,454,784 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 39,058,112 yuan. The import in June was 67,737,500 yuan, and the export was 25,681,341 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 42,056,159 yuan. Compared with July, the import of goods has decreased and the export of goods has increased, and the overall import surplus has decreased sharply.

### The Authorities Maintain Food Supply for the People, Focusing on Unblocking Sources, Mr. Yu Qiaqing Ordered Tribute Rice to Relieve Difficulties, Commercial Bank Does Not Engage in Rice Business

The rice market has been closed for two days. Most of the rice sold by rice shops in recent days is rice that has been hoarded by hoarders for a long time. There are both superior white and Ke Xian rice, but Ke Xian rice is the most. According to the rice color observed by the rice industry, it has been hoarded for a long time and recently sold. As for the future of rice prices, it mainly depends on whether inland transportation is convenient or not.

Commercial Bank, Does Not Engage in Rice Business

The warehouses of commercial banks in the city have always been engaged in the business of storing goods, and grain is also one of the goods. Therefore, it is inevitable that the food is stored in the warehouses. The authorities of the concession once conducted a strict investigation of the amount of rice stored and the names of the owners in the warehouses of the banks. The banks reported the truth, which proves that the banks themselves do not engage in the rice business, which is very clear. The rumors about the commercial banks hoarding rice are not true. In the current situation, food rice is necessary for the people's livelihood, and it is not the same as other goods. Banks themselves specialize in legitimate business and do not engage in hoarding rice.

Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Ordered Rice to Relieve Difficulties

It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the seriousness of the food situation in Shanghai and the lack of good measures by the authorities for a while, there are more than 80,000 refugees in the boundary, and problems have arisen in the supply of food. Therefore, he joined forces with various groups and enthusiastic people to raise funds to order Saigon rice for relief. There are a total of 18,000 bags of Saigon rice, including 10,000 bags under the name of the Refugee Relief Association and 8,000 bags under the names of various groups, which will arrive in Shanghai on September 2nd. There is a saying that 8,000 bags of them will be sold at a fair price.

The Authorities Focus, On Unblocking Sources

The authorities of the two concessions are still paying attention to unblocking the sources to maintain food supply for the people, and there is no intention to order foreign rice. According to foreign reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities are discussing facilitating the transportation of food rice to Shanghai, which is currently underway. As for the rumor that the Shanghai Municipal Council has ordered Saigon foreign rice, it is not true. According to the information obtained in this morning's investigation, it is not easy to transport rice to Shanghai recently.

### Vietnamese Railway, Resumed Traffic, Highway Still Difficult to Pass

The section of the Vietnamese National Railway from Hanoi to Dongdang was washed away by mountain torrents, destroying more than 11 kilometers of roadbed, so that vehicles could not pass. The details were once recorded in this newspaper. Now we have received a communication from Haiphong that the roadbed has been urgently repaired by the engineering department and was completely completed on the 8th of this month. All passenger and freight transportation has resumed, and everything is as usual. As for the highway in that section, it is still difficult to pass for the time being.

### Obstruction Occurred, Sailing Delayed Several Hours, Return to Europe Time Unchanged

The Changxing Company's Russian Post ship arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 PM today. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the North German Company's express mail ship, "Hohos Duster," managed by the American Most Time Foreign Firm, departed from Europe for Shanghai on the 13th of this month, heading to Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, etc., according to the

Scheduled Route

It was supposed to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM today and set sail at 11:00 AM tomorrow, returning to Bremen, Germany. The last passenger tender was scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM this morning. However, it is now learned that when the ship set sail from Kobe, the machinery suddenly

Experienced Obstruction

It was immediately repaired, but the sailing schedule has been delayed for several hours, so the arrival time in Shanghai must be postponed until 4:00 PM before it can enter the port and dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take the tender, arriving at the New Customs Wharf at 6:00 PM. As for the

Return to Europe Time

It remains as originally scheduled, with no changes. In addition, the Java Company's new mail ship, "Zizhi Lianjia," arrived in Shanghai for the second time from Batavia. It passed Xiamen yesterday and is scheduled to enter the port at 7:00 AM this morning, docking at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared passenger tender, arriving at the New Customs Wharf around 9:00 AM. The ship will be berthed in Shanghai for three days, loading and unloading passengers and cargo, and is scheduled to depart on the 24th, heading to Xiamen, via Hong Kong and various parts of Southeast Asia, before returning to Surabaya.

### Fractional Currency Notes to be Issued Day After Tomorrow, Universally Accepted in Shanghai, Tobacco Exchange Industry Yesterday Sent Letter Requesting Group Exchange, Substitute Currency Stamps Eagerly Awaiting Flexible Recall

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Central Bank, by order of the Ministry of Finance, is issuing fractional currency notes of 1 fen and 5 fen denominations, with an initial batch of 500,000 yuan. The Yongning Company has completed the printing, and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will issue them. Yesterday, inquiries at the bank revealed that the fractional currency notes will be issued the day after tomorrow (Tuesday). The bank will issue a public announcement at that time to inform the public. The method will be the same as the issuance of subsidiary currency notes, with legal tender as full backing.

Tobacco Exchange Industry Requests Exchange for New Notes

The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, considering the imminent issuance of new notes by the Central Bank, and planning to set the quotas for each industry to exchange for new notes, in order to prepare for business needs and alleviate the difficulties of its members, specifically sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday, requesting permission for group exchanges. The general idea of ​​the letter is roughly as follows: "Our members number more than 2,000, of which more than 100 are members of the industry association (ie, large firms). When your bank issued copper subsidiary currency, we entrusted the association to be responsible for handling and distributing the matter on your behalf, seeking equality. Now that the new notes have been transported to Shanghai and are ready to be issued, our association members, numbering more than 100, would like to request your bank to allow each to receive 200 yuan of fractional currency notes, so that they can be used for business purposes and can be distributed to various colleagues (small firms) at any time, so as to make full use of them and circulate them in the market."

Various Substitute Currencies Can Be Recalled Immediately

The substitute currency notes issued by the Public Concession and French Concession tram and automobile companies are very large in number, and some are circulating in the business community. According to inquiries from various relevant parties yesterday, the currency of the two concession tram and automobile companies began circulating when copper coins were in short supply. The original intention was for business needs. Now that the Central Bank has 500,000 yuan of new notes ready to be issued, after the Central Bank's notes circulate in the market, the substitute currency notes can be completely recalled and invalidated.

All Sectors Eagerly Awaiting Recall of Stamps

According to further inquiries by reporters from the Daguan News Agency, the biggest recipients of this 400,000 yuan stamp problem are generally poor traders and vendors, followed by small businesses and stalls. Currently, rumors are circulating that stamps will be discontinued and cannot be exchanged for cash, causing extreme panic among these merchants. As a result, they are arbitrarily seeking to exchange them for cash at low prices. Until yesterday, some were even seeking to exchange 130 or 140 stamps for one yuan of legal tender. This is a matter of great and far-reaching concern to the livelihoods of laborers. It is hoped that the postal authorities can deal with this issue flexibly and recall them as much as possible.

### National Government Appropriates Funds to Handle Wartime Military Insurance, Divided into Transportation Military Insurance and Land Military Insurance, Funded by the Ministry of Finance and Undertaken by the Central Trust Bureau

In order to adjust wartime trade, develop production in the rear, replenish resources for the War of Resistance, and ensure the safe transportation of agricultural, industrial, and mining products, the National Government specifically ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate 20 million yuan in funds to the Central Trust Bureau, with 10 million yuan specifically used as a fund for handling wartime transportation military insurance business, and 10 million yuan specifically used as a fund for handling wartime land military insurance business. After receiving the order, the Bureau has already formulated and implemented measures for handling wartime military insurance. Details are recorded as follows:

Guizhou Stipulates the Scope of Wartime Military Insurance

### Coal Prices are Expensive, Affecting Industry, Demand for Coal Dust is Extremely Large, Impacting Production Costs of Related Factories

According to a report from the Jianghai Customs, from January to June of this year, the quantity of imported coal blocks was 133,727 tons, with a value of 5,452,540 gold, equivalent to 13,066,789 yuan. After the source of national coal was cut off, coal merchants ordered huge quantities of foreign coal from coal-producing areas such as Annam, Taiwan, India, and Australia to be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The market is open from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day, with more than 300 participating firms. Previously, there was an evaluation committee for the coal market, but it was dissolved after the war. Market prices are all determined by each firm based on the cost of shipping and commission. At first, the order was orderly, as in the past, but after the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market, the prices of foreign coal were high, and coal prices in the market soared. Various industries have also felt that the expenditure on purchasing fuel is too large. It is heard that the coal industry, due to the special environment in Shanghai, is thoroughly investigating whether there is any other coal mixed into the goods for dumping.

### Izumo Ship Moves Berth, Said to Prevent Arson, Zhaoshang Wharf Storing Large Amounts of Military Equipment, Strange Fires Occurring Frequently in Hongkou Recently

The Japanese naval flagship Izumo has been berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf, a Japanese merchant in Hongkou, north of the Suzhou River estuary. This was decided after returning to Shanghai from patrolling the Yangtze River and remaining in its original location. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, it suddenly changed its berth to the Zhaoshang Middle Wharf on the east side. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and have made many speculations. According to someone from Hongkou, this move is purely to prevent the so-called "arson group." The reason is that the Zhaoshang Middle Wharf was occupied after the Shanghai war and used as a major base for storing military equipment. This is still the case today. Recently, strange fires have been occurring frequently in Hongkou. It is suspected that the arson group is coming from Pudong, taking boats along the waterway and taking the opportunity to land on the Bund in Hongkou. It is feared that the ammunition depot at the wharf is not adequately guarded and that people may cross the Huangpu River, go to the wharf, and commit arson. This is considered extremely serious, so the Izumo ship was moved to the wharf to prevent "arsonists" from Pudong.

### US Transportation Experts Arrive in China to Adjust Highway Military Transport, Experts Will Be Responsible for Adjusting and Handling Matters of Maintaining Smooth Freight Transport

According to the Continental Daily, US Treasury Counselor to Shanghai, Mr. Nicholson, departed for Hong Kong yesterday (the 18th) to meet with three US transportation experts who are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong this week by clipper ship, to reorganize the

Chinese Transportation

affairs along the Burma and Vietnamese highways. The three are Sheehan, Vice President of the Chicago Casein Transportation Company, as well as Mr. Barry and Mr. Butter, all of whom are known as leaders in the transportation industry. This decision was made by US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to resolve the less-than-smooth automobile freight situation,

This Situation

that is causing important supplies to be blocked on the road from Chongqing to the sea. The United States' assistance to Chinese transportation is in response to a request from the Ministry of Communications of Chongqing. Washington received this request and immediately began investigating, selecting these three Chicago personnel. They will serve as

Advisors to the Ministry of Communications

The Central Government announced on August 10 the establishment of a Highway Transportation Bureau, with general offices in the southwest and northwest, to manage highway engineering and related matters. According to recent reports from the mainland, transportation in Haiphong, Vietnam, is quite congested.

### Freight Rates on Shanghai-Ningbo Line Increased by Another 50 Percent, Three Price Increases Totaling a Doubling, Passenger Ticket Prices to be Revised from the 25th

Since permission was granted to anchor outside Zhenhai Port and resume navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, ships have successively resumed sailing. Initially, due to restrictions on the entry and exit of goods and passengers by the authorities, business was slack. Recently, the authorities have understood and relaxed the restrictions slightly, so shipping has slightly improved. However, there is a shortage of barges in Zhenhai, which takes a lot of time to load and unload goods, and the sailing schedule is delayed for a long time, resulting in huge losses for the company. In order to compensate for the above losses, the companies have

Increased Prices Repeatedly. From the day before yesterday (the 18th), freight rates were increased by another 50 percent, calculated based on the freight rates before June 22. Including the 25 percent increase on June 22 and the 25 percent increase on August 1, plus the 50 percent increase on the 18th of the previous day, the total increase is a doubling. For example, the freight rate for general cargo is 18 yuan per ton, and the new price is 36 yuan, plus the public welfare donation and barge fee of 50 percent, the total price per ton is

54 yuan, which is six times higher than the pre-war price, which is a considerable expense. The companies are very concerned about the safety of passengers getting on and off outside Zhenhai Port. Recently, they have agreed with the Tianbao Ship to undertake the connecting transportation between Duo Zhen, which has already been implemented. The passenger ticket prices have been agreed upon by the Zhongyi Company and the Lihe Foreign Firm and will be revised from the 25th. First class (large cabin) is 30 yuan, second class (official cabin) is 12 yuan, third class (room cabin) is 9 yuan, and general class is 4.5 yuan. However, the fares of the Far East Company are

Slightly different, with first class at 20 yuan, second class at 10 yuan, third class at 8 yuan, and general class at 5 yuan. Export of Hana was implemented yesterday. The Taikoo Yingzhou Ship only loads cargo and will not carry passengers for the time being. Although it has received the fare increase letters from Lihe and Zhongyi Companies, it has not yet been decided. The fare from Ningbo to Shanghai is slightly higher, with first class (large cabin) at 35 yuan, second class (official cabin) at 15 yuan, third class (room cabin) at 12 yuan, and general class at 5 yuan. There are currently

Six ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, including the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu Ship, the Zhongyi Company's Ende and Deping Ships, the Far East Company's Hana Ship, the Yihua Foreign Firm's Baoli Ship, and the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou Ship. As for the New Beijing Ship, it will not operate for the time being.

### Finance: Exchange Rate Lingers; Speculators Spread Rumors Again; Generally Not Believed

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC listing was announced, with no changes. In the grey market for British and American exchanges, the situation was initially quite stable. After 9:45 AM, as Japanese commercial banks and foreign firms came to cover their positions, and Western firm Sassoon also aggressively covered futures, the situation gradually weakened. At one point, British gold was the tightest, having been quoted at 3/16375. The American exchange was the weakest, having also been quoted at 6.5625 yuan. Subsequently, as Western firm Sassoon suddenly resold spot British and American exchanges, the situation returned to normal. As a result, the British exchange was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the American exchange was slightly weaker by 0.03125. August and September futures showed no gains or losses. In the middle of the day, speculators spread rumors that there would be drastic changes in the exchange rate next Monday, but most operators did not believe it. Furthermore, amid the active support of China by Britain and America, and with the instability in Europe, they did not dare to immediately increase their positions, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in limited trading throughout the day.

Japanese Firms Covering Positions, Sassoon Reselling

In the early morning, the London spot exchange was up 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the far term. The New York silver price rose 0.125, and London bullion remained stable. Exchange rates for British to American and British to French were both stable, while British to Shanghai was up 0.0625. American to British and American to French were both stable, while American to Shanghai was up 0.05. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3/164375 for British gold and 6.6875 yuan for the American exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After opening, HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 3/164375 from its counterparts, and the situation was extremely stagnant. When the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt from minor taxes. After this, Japanese commercial banks and foreign firms competed to cover their positions, and Western firm Sassoon also purchased futures, so the market weakened. It is estimated that the Japanese banks and foreign firms covered positions with advantageous British banks and certain American banks for spot British gold at 3/1640625 and spot American exchange at 6.625 yuan. Subsequently, Sassoon purchased futures British gold for September at 3/16 and 2/1696875, and American exchange for the same month at 5.8125 and 5.75. Later, spot British gold was once quoted at 3/16375, and the American exchange was also quoted at 6.5625 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, Western firm Sassoon suddenly sold spot British gold at 3/1640625 and 3/164375 to HSBC and other foreign banks, and then sold spot American exchange at 6.625 and 6.6875 to a certain bank and Datong. As a result, the situation returned to normal. It was already noon. Extending to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 3/16421875 for British gold and 6.65625 yuan for the American exchange. British gold for the current month was 3/16375, and the American exchange was 6.5625 yuan. British gold for September was 3/16, and the American exchange was 5.8125. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the American exchange was slightly weaker by 0.031225. British and American exchanges for August and September futures showed no gains or losses. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

Tianjin British and American Exchange Rates Slightly Lower

The Central Bank's exchange rate remained unchanged at 128 yuan. The "Joint Notes" grey market price was down 3.5 yuan to 99 yuan.

Bullion Market Calm

Yesterday's grey market situation for immediate delivery of bullion was similar to the previous day, hovering around the closing price of the previous night. At the opening, bullion shops were very willing to sell, and buyers and retail investors were unwilling to buy, so the opening price immediately fell to 4,525 yuan. It then declined further to a low of 4,520 yuan. After 10:00 AM, news of a weakening foreign exchange market stimulated buying sentiment. Tianjin and Hong Kong dealers commissioned their agents in the market to compete to buy, and certain money exchange firms and banks also bought on behalf of their customers. As a result, the market price once rose to a high of 4,590 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, news of a return to normalcy in the foreign exchange market led to a resurgence of selling. A certain gold shop came to sell on behalf of speculators, and the underlying trend once again declined. Extending to the noon close, the market fell by 5 yuan. There was no formal market in the afternoon, but there were also few changes outside the market, and prices remained between 4,550 and 4,560 yuan. About 600 taels were traded during the day. There were no changes in gold jewelry prices, and bullion and British gold remained stable.

Bullion Down Just a Little by Five Yuan

From the morning, per tael (ten liang), the initial opening was met with dampened spirits. Bullion shops were eager to sell, and the foreign exchange market was very stable, so under the cover of selling pressure, the price immediately fell by 35 yuan. Bullion shops sold 20 taels to money exchange firms for 4,525 yuan. It then continued to fall by 5 yuan. Bullion shops made 30 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,520 yuan, the low for the day. At 9:45 AM, news of a weakening foreign exchange market stimulated buying sentiment. Certain bullion shops and securities firms aggressively bought on behalf of their customers, and certain money exchange firms also absorbed on behalf of wealthy merchants, and the underlying trend suddenly reversed upwards. Soon after, it soared by 70 yuan. Cash shops made 10 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,590 yuan, the high for the day. Thereafter, dealers adopted a selling and buying stance, and once hovered between 4,570 and 4,580 yuan, creating an opportunity for retail investors to scalp. Around 11:00 AM, news of a return to normalcy in the foreign exchange market led to an increase in sellers. Certain gold shops and speculators came to sell, and the market weakened. Money exchange firms made 20 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,545 yuan. Approaching noon, the situation slightly recovered. Other shops made 20 taels of mutual deals for 4,555 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The difference between the high and low was 70 yuan throughout the day. The current price of bullion at cash shops was 10 yuan higher than that of immediate delivery bullion, and the current price of silver bullion was 65 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Still at Original Price

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged. Datong Bank remained at the original price of 460 yuan, and Xintong Bank was at 458 yuan. Purchase prices were reduced by about 10 to 20 yuan.

Bullion Stagnant

London, 18th - British bullion remained stagnant as before, at £7 8s 7d per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks remained unchanged.

### Call Loan Rate Low, Discount Rate Also Falls

Yesterday's bill discount rate continued to fall. Throughout the day, it hovered around 190 yuan per thousand, with a high of 192 yuan and a low of 187 yuan. It remained at 190 yuan in the afternoon, 2.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The Money Industry Association's call loan rate suddenly fell by 0.01, hanging at 0.017 in both the morning and afternoon, it is said.

### British and American Silver Prices Rise

London, 18th - The silver market was limited by Indian and speculative buying. The market was stable. After closing, India continued to absorb slightly at the listed price. The spot price for large bars of silver rose 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the far term. The New York silver exchange stated that American spot prices rose 0.125. Also, the Bombay silver exchange stated that the Indian silver market was calm, with no gains or losses in both spot and futures prices. Only 50 contracts were traded, it is said.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Stable: Trade with Shanghai — Dependent on the Size of the Trade Deficit

Although Shanghai's monthly trade deficit decreased from 42,056,000 yuan in June to 16,909,000 yuan, a reduction of 25,147,000 yuan, it cannot be said that the drastic reduction in the black market exchange rate was successful. However, it is still too costly for Shanghai to burden China's foreign exchange fund with an expenditure of more than 16 million yuan. However, it can be predicted that Shanghai's trade deficit from August onwards will be less than that of July, because the impact of the drastic reduction in the black market exchange rate on trade will inevitably be greater than that of July. As for Shanghai's black market exchange rate, although it is more stable than before, it is difficult to stabilize it unless the difference between Shanghai's import and export values is roughly balanced, or the difference is within the range of several million yuan.

### Rumors of Rising British and American Gold Notes

Yesterday's foreign currencies: the supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were not strong, and the market was stable. Only the American dollar slightly decreased, while British and American gold notes were firm and rose, likely due to the tightening of the foreign exchange rate. The supply of Hong Kong notes was relatively smooth, and the market price eased. The demand for French franc notes was strong and popular, while Japanese gold notes were firm. The evening price was 1.18 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was not smooth, and the market was quite popular. The evening price was 0.995 yuan. Other currencies were stable due to weak supply and demand on Saturday. The association did not open trading. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose 0.08 yuan, American gold pounds fell 0.05 yuan, American gold notes rose 0.019 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell 0.001 yuan, French franc notes rose 0.003 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Weakness Inside and Out

Yesterday's grey market for securities turned weak again. The rising trend could not be sustained, indicating the weakness of investor sentiment. Internationally, the situation was tight and relaxed at times, and the exchange rate situation was increasingly tight. Domestically, the war was at a stalemate, and government bonds were not being considered and were difficult to rally, which was largely the reason. Small players in the market were merely taking advantage of the environment. Yesterday's trading was still extremely sluggish. Large investors were absent early in the day, relying only on sporadic transactions from retail investors. Most of the buying and selling was short-term in nature. Although Lian Hongkang and Tongkang bought in yesterday, and only Lianyi and Yongkang were sellers, the market still appeared weak. As a result, it fell by a small amount of 0.025 to 0.06 yuan, and 96 fell by a small amount of 0.015 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 200,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Exchange trading totaled 50 shares at a price of 25.5 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the public exchange continued to weaken, with the prices of many stocks falling slightly. However, the trading volume was very limited. Anxiety over the European situation was the only driving force behind investor unease, as there were no other factors that could explain the decline in the market. Also, due to the weekend, most traders wanted to reduce their long positions to avoid unexpected risks.

The listed market prices of London British firms' Far East companies' stocks on Friday, the 18th of this month, fell slightly. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares continued to fall by 0.5 pounds to 72 pounds. Gula Craig rubber stocks fell by 7.5 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence. The remaining stocks remained unchanged.

The London Chinese foreign debt market prices on Friday, the 18th of this month, remained unchanged.

### Food: Rice Market Closed

Native Indica Rice: Two batches totaling 3,400 to 3,500 bags arrived yesterday by ship. There is still a whole batch of 8,000 bags that are expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow. However, all the goods were unloaded at Hongkou. Other small-scale merchants who transport and sell the goods are still few in number. As for the shops and households on this street, yesterday was even more active. Although the rice market was closed in the morning, the association and those who purchased directly in batches were offering higher prices to compete for the goods in the afternoon. As a result, it was reported that Jing Indica rice was sold at 29.5 yuan. Ordinary Indica rice also reached 28.5 yuan, coarse Indica rice was about 26 yuan, and brown rice was 24 yuan, it is said.

### Flour Mills Restricting Sales to Customers; Trade in Recycled Goods Booming; Higher Than Mill Prices by About 0.2 Yuan

Flour continued to be brisk. After the mills only supplied retail customers on this street and restricted sales to other customers and wholesale transactions, the trade in recycled goods on the market was quite brisk, due to the favor of customers. Yesterday's mill price was 6 yuan in cash, while recycled goods were higher than the mill price by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan, it is said.

Wheat was also in great demand. Shipments arrived from all directions, and demand was also quite strong, causing the market to rise by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Fufeng and Liangfu mills purchased 20 truckloads of Danyang and Wuxi wheat. Stockholders purchased 10 truckloads of wheat from Guantian, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Longtan. The highest price was 9.48 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Tense Atmosphere in Hong Kong and Guangdong; Cotton Yarn's Rising Momentum Halted

The yarn market started rising but then retreated. This situation has been going on for three days, but market sentiment is still not bad. Most believe that the raw materials are expensive, so they are optimistic about finished goods. However, some believe that prices have reached a high level, and that those who have profited have already made a lot of money, so small stockholders are gradually selling when prices rise. However, those who are serious buyers remain calm. Recently, the range of fluctuations has been within 10 yuan. 20-count special Jincheng is approaching the 800 yuan mark at 795 yuan.

As for the current situation of yarn, the opening price in the morning was based on the 20-count Shuangma brand from the previous day. Because of the shortage of spot goods, market sentiment was still enthusiastic. However, the prices of other new brands of yarn rose accordingly. The 20-count Shuangma foreign bonded goods rose by more than 5 yuan to 780 yuan. Buyers of warehouse receipts were very enthusiastic, pushing the price beyond 700 yuan to 705 yuan. Shortly thereafter, news that business from Guangdong was sluggish due to the tense atmosphere in Hong Kong and Guangdong caused the market to suddenly weaken, falling by 7 to 8 yuan. It is estimated that 1,035 bales were traded in the half-day. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 2 yuan, and the price of Muyang fell by 2 yuan. Today, 50 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 55 bales will be shipped to Haiphong. Tomorrow, there will be another 10 bales shipped to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by various dealers are listed below:

Counterparts: 490; Hong Kong: 105

Mainland: 420; Fuzhou: 10

Jiangxi: 10; Total: 1,035

### Cotton Inventories Declining Daily; Spot Goods Tight, Not For Sale

The trade in Chinese and foreign cotton has become quiet. Since prices are too high, manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the demand is shallow. Only Yong'an and Hongzhang mills purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton at a price of 112.75 yuan, all of which were sent to the mill in cash. Counterparts' interest in mutual transactions is not as strong as in the past. However, the cotton inventories on the market are decreasing daily. As for foreign firms, the prices they are offering are still high. Some spot goods are tight and not for sale, so market prices continue to rise. 640 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived from northern Jiangsu. 150 bales of Indian cotton continued to arrive, shipped on the Da Ying Company's Rajiputana (transliteration) ship, and were imported at 6:00 PM yesterday, docking at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading. The selling situation is recorded on the left.

Another news report from the Shanghai port stated that the market has been rife with rumors that customs taxes will increase starting next month. As a result, dealers do not plan to sell their spot goods, and mills are deeply concerned that the rumored tax increase will become a reality, which will increase cotton prices. As a result, they have been eager to buy in recent days. In the end, because there are not many inventories in Shanghai, prices have not been able to ease.

Foreign cotton market prices in New York City were firm in the early morning due to speculative buying. In recent days, because of the brisk sales of textiles, spot transactions have been increasingly active. The purchases of overseas cotton merchants in the market have also slightly increased. Weather reports from cotton-growing areas are bad, so market prices soared by 5 pounds sterling yesterday. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 25 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 pounds sterling.

### Oilseed Cake: Crude Oil Soars; Opening at 71 Yuan; Soybean Oil Falls Initially but Recovers Later

The oil market has been highly volatile. Soybean oil initially fell but later recovered. Crude oil has seen a sharp rise due to scarce arrivals and inventories, which is unprecedented in the market. The price of Qingdao barrel crude oil rose sharply by 3 yuan in one day. The highest price has reached 71 yuan. It is estimated that more than 400 pieces of Jiaozhou basket crude oil were traded, with prices ranging from 55.5 yuan to 56 yuan. Transshipment prices ranged from 54 yuan to 56 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai basket crude oil were sold for 54 yuan to Hong Kong dealers. In addition, more than 100 barrels of Qingdao barrel crude oil were sold for prices ranging from 69 yuan to 71 yuan. 30 barrels of Kobe barrel crude oil were sold for 67 yuan. Soybean oil initially fell by 1 to 2 yuan. In the afternoon, Hong Kong dealers began to buy, which stimulated market sentiment. Stockholders bought in, and prices rose again by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. It is estimated that more than 600 pieces of various oils were traded. For details, please refer to the market price section.

2,360 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 19th. Another 1,315 bags were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th, 610 bags on the 21st, and 445 pieces of crude oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Silk and Tea: Pingshui Rough Tea Gets Good Price

Since the Silk and Tea Management Office sent personnel to provide guidance, the refining process of Pingshui rough tea has shown initial signs of success. However, it is still made by hand. The high price of special rough tea is sustainable, which is unprecedented in more than ten years. Currently, the lowest price still needs to be 36 to 37 yuan, so tea farmers are all delighted. Tea merchants have also made a profit of 10%, it is said.

Coal prices in this city are soaring. Indian coal is arriving steadily. The King Edward, managed by Jardine Matheson, loaded 7,054 tons of coal from Calcutta, India, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 21st) morning, docking at buoys 32 and 33 for transshipment and unloading. (Year)

Kailan lump coal and fines are scarce, and market inventories are thin, seeing frequent increases. Kailan No. 1 lump has been quoted at 66 yuan, No. 2 lump 55 yuan, No. 1 fines 48 yuan to 50 yuan, and No. 1 fines 43 yuan. The above are all transactions between counterparts, with shipments from Pudong warehouses, an increase of 6 to 7 yuan per ton compared to the beginning of the month.

### Dried Goods: New Longan Meat 110 Yuan

The first batch of more than 20 pieces of new Hainan longan meat that arrived the day before yesterday was reportedly sold by dealers yesterday at a price of 110 yuan, which is also a high price. Dried seafood fell in price, and it was sold at 60 yuan. After the price was reduced, the sales were quite brisk, it is said.

### The Current Difficulties Facing Shanghai's Raw Silk Industry

— Qu Yang

Currently, the price of silk in Shanghai has increased fivefold compared to the early days of the war; the export volume has doubled compared to the first year after the war; and the profits from silk production have risen to one hundred percent. Who can deny that such a prosperous scene is an unprecedented boom for the Shanghai silk industry? However, why do people in the silk industry, from factory owners to workers, say that this is the end of the silk industry? How can this doomsday appear in such a prosperous guise? Is it truly a case of "when things reach an extreme, they revert"? Furthermore, should we merely wait passively for this doomsday to arrive? Of course not. Therefore, people in the silk industry should take advantage of the present situation to carefully consider all aspects of the silk industry at this stage, analyze its fundamental characteristics, predict the potential crises it may face, and study how to respond so that the Shanghai silk industry can overcome difficulties and embark on a bright future. What is presented here is merely a glimpse of the bigger picture. The author's intention is to draw attention to this issue from both industry insiders and outsiders, and to encourage further research into this problem. Now, I will briefly express my humble opinions, hoping for corrections from readers.

(I) After the war, the trend of the Shanghai silk industry is abnormal, and its prosperity is pathological.

Statistics of Shanghai Silk Factories Before and After the War

We remember that before the war, there were 44 silk factories operating in Shanghai, with a total of 10,086 silk reeling machines. During the war, 34 silk factories were destroyed by the flames of aggression, with 6,836 silk reeling machines. Only 10 silk factories survived, with 2,562 silk reeling machines. In the past two years, new silk factories have sprung up in the concession areas like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. To date, adding these to the surviving factories, the total number of silk factories in Shanghai is 35, with a total of 6,222 silk reeling machines. Given such a short period of time to restore the above figures, the speed of the Shanghai silk industry's recovery after the war should be praised. However, why is its trend said to be abnormal?

Successful Reconstruction of the Silk Industry After the War

Shanghai has become an isolated island, and its inherent economic center should have moved inland. Because Shanghai, after becoming an isolated island, has many special and complex conditions that we can utilize, the industrial and commercial enterprises within it, besides those that benefit from these conditions, cannot obtain the freedom of raw materials and finished products, or transport them. In other words, all industries in Shanghai after the war, if they do not move, will inevitably become indirect or direct economic appendages to it. This is why the industries in occupied Shanghai must move inland. However, our Shanghai silk industry was too negligent, and even went further to try to rebuild its "business" in the "urn."

Under this mentality, although the movement to rebuild the silk industry after the war was vigorous, its development direction was inevitably speculative, pessimistic, and aimed at temporary luck. We probably have not forgotten that in the early days of the silk industry's revitalization after the war, the saying "silk factories only have eight months of life," which was widely circulated and regarded as clever, was a typical portrayal of this sentiment. In fact, the Shanghai silk industry could only survive on this dead-end foundation.

The prosperity brought by the initial survival was the day and night production of raw silk. Under the principle of rapid silk production, rapid disposal, and rapid profit, although the quality of raw silk was disregarded, and although the reduction in Japanese silk production of 20-22 denier last year was ignored, and Shanghai's silk of the same denier was not given the opportunity to sell abroad at a better price, the fact is that the export volume of raw silk last year rose to 37,596 piculs, exceeding the first year after the war by almost double, and almost restoring the pre-war export level. The profit from silk production exceeded the capital amount by one or more times, reaching an unprecedented level of prosperity.

What is the second phenomenon that follows this prosperity? It is a transition from a speculative, pessimistic, and opportunistic mentality to a risky, bold, and all-in action. This further pathological characteristic can be easily found in this year's spring cocoon purchase situation.

Pathological Development of Shanghai's Silk Industry

Exchange rate fluctuations began in August last year, with the first drop from one shilling and two pence to eight and a quarter pence; the second was in early June this year, further decreasing to six and a half pence; the third was recently, dropping to three and a quarter pence. As for silk prices, following the tightening of foreign exchange, the price of White Filature XB 20-22 denier rose from 760 yuan per picul in January of the previous year to 1,200 yuan in August of the same year. From June of this year to the present, the price of silk has risen from 2,000 yuan to 3,800 yuan. This second foreign exchange contraction is now happening at the end of the spring cocoon purchase, and the industry is facing strong detention and bargaining over the "transit" issue.

In early June this year, according to our newspaper's cocoon news, the inconvenient transportation of spring cocoons in the interior (including between inland areas, and inland areas and Shanghai), the "control" and destruction of cocoon factories, led to a concentration of the cocoon market and a sharp drop in cocoon prices. The price of spring cocoons on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line fell to 45 yuan. Based on this cocoon cost, including all expenses, the cost of silk per picul was only 700 yuan. If it were sold abroad at the then market price, each picul of raw silk made from fresh cocoons could earn a profit of over 600 yuan. However, in reality, because Shanghai silk merchants valued the high profits, they were more generous in response to the other party's extortion. As a result, the other party became more greedy and took further advantage, and the issue of spring cocoon transportation went beyond the scope of "donations and taxes" and began to involve discussions about confiscation and release percentages.

So, will the Shanghai raw silk industry compromise again at the cost of pain? The answer is possibly yes, because the degree of compromise in the Shanghai silk industry will increase and deepen with the high profits from silk production. The reason for this is self-explanatory.

### The Problems of School Enrollment and Employment for Children

Jin Ding

During this long, more than fifty-day summer vacation, children who have just graduated from elementary school are undoubtedly contemplating the issue of school enrollment and employment. What kind of school should children preparing to enroll in? What kind of job should children preparing for employment take? This is indeed an issue worth studying and considering.

I believe that children preparing to enroll in school should first investigate whether the school's content is substantial, whether the teaching is strict, whether the school spirit is excellent, and whether the fees are reasonable. If most of these points are considered satisfactory, then they should register and take the exam without any hesitation. If most of these points are considered unsatisfactory, then they should carefully consider and choose a school that meets the standards. This is my personal opinion for children regarding school enrollment.

As for children preparing for employment, you should know that reading is the preparation for employment, and employment is the practice of reading. Being forced by circumstances to discontinue schooling is nothing to be sad about. Because after employment, as long as you have determination and perseverance, you still have the opportunity to read and study anytime, anywhere. However, what occupation is suitable for your personality and can develop your strengths is something that should be considered before employment. In my opinion, children preparing for employment should first publicly explain their aspirations and strengths to their parents, teachers, friends, and relatives, hoping that they will have a basis when recommending occupations for you. As for the children themselves, they should also have a preliminary understanding of the ideal job content, so that they will not feel the pain of being unable to start once they enter the door of this occupation. If every employed child can do this, then they will definitely reduce many unnecessary losses on the path of employment. In short, the problems of school enrollment and employment for children are indeed worth studying and considering. Parents, teachers, friends, and relatives of children should take responsibility to solve this important problem for these innocent and inexperienced children. The above remarks are just suggestions for everyone's reference.

### Why

— Wang Pei

Why: Why can airplanes fly in the sky? Why can wireless electricity transmit sound? Why can electric lights automatically emit light? Why can a day have night? Why after incubation, will goose eggs hatch chicks? Why do trees and flowers wither in winter? Why this? Why that? "Why" is infinite. Only "why" is energetic, progressive, and only "why" can enrich life, improve society, and create the world.

Why can the steam from boiling water push the kettle lid and invent the steam engine? Why will electric sparks occur at both ends of a broken current copper coin, thus inventing incandescent lamps and arc lamps? In short, no matter how big or small the matter is, as long as it goes through the "why" experiment, there will always be a novel creation, and the world will naturally progress with "why"!

Mr. Hu Shi also has a paragraph in his "New Life" that means: "A person's life, only after experiencing "why," does that life have meaning. A meaningful life is called a new life."

Children! Do you want to live a new life? Then don't forget "why"!

### Abandoning the Boat and Boarding the Car

Ming Er's Refugee Diary - Thirty

In the boat cabin, the refugees were all done with dinner and the air in the cabin suddenly became tense. The housewives from all three families were packing their eating utensils and tidying up their belongings, because this was the last night they would spend on the Jiangshan ship. They all closed their eyes, rested their minds, and no one slept soundly.

"Don't sleep too soundly. We will have a lot of work to do as soon as it gets light. We have to pack up our bedding, eat breakfast, move our luggage, and we need to get to the bus station as early as possible. So we have to work quickly and carefully, because we heard that the buses don't run regularly. Sometimes if we are lucky, a bus will run, but some people have been waiting in hotels near the station for many days and still haven't caught a bus. We will have to rely on our luck then," Mr. Zhang muttered incessantly.

"Why don't they run?" one of them asked. "Because during the war, in our industrially backward country, military equipment is naturally insufficient, and buses are one of them. So civilian buses are used to supplement them, and as a result, civilian buses are in extremely short supply and have to be suspended," Mr. Zhang replied, assigning the work to everyone.

The refugees waited for the east to turn white, they had waited on the Jiangshan ship for a full seventeen days. Before dawn, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li jumped ashore to negotiate about the bus, leaving Ming Er's father to manage everything on the ship. As soon as the rooster crowed, the people on the ship seemed extraordinarily busy. Ming Er's mother led her young siblings, stepping onto the shore from the narrow plank, and the other women also followed ashore. Ming Er's brother monitored the boatmen moving the luggage in the cabin. Ming Er stood on the shore and counted the number of luggage items according to the luggage list, separating the luggage of the three families and piling them up separately by the boatmen. This chaotic scene lasted for about half an hour. Finally, Ming Er's father checked everything one by one, inspected the cabin again to make sure nothing was left behind, and paid the boat fare to the boatman. But the boatman was not straightforward. When disembarking in Hangzhou, it was stated that the boat fare and all the wine money were included, but when he was leaving, he asked for wine money and firewood money. After a lot of arguing, some money was still added, which shows that they were really petty.

With a lot of effort, they finally managed to send a large group of refugees and a large pile of heavy luggage to the bus station. When they got there, they saw a sea of people and luggage filling the entire narrow station, it was really packed like sardines.

Mr. Zhang squeezed out of the crowd and happily reached Ming Er's father: "Our luck is really good, there are two buses today. The ticket office over there is extremely crowded. It's really unexpected, the ticket seller is my old classmate, I got the tickets without much effort, otherwise we might have to wait for two or three days. Your luggage is over there, ask them to move it. The bus is going to leave at eight o'clock this morning, but there are a lot of us, the ticket seller suggested that we go in two buses, it would be better."

Ming Er's father was overjoyed to hear this and said: "Great, this is your great achievement, we must reward you." "No, your contribution is also great, so many people and luggage came to the station together, otherwise, even if I bought the tickets, it would be useless. This is the benefit of our cooperation." So this large group of refugees were separated and squeezed onto the bus, heading straight towards their destination like flying.

Interesting Little Handicraft

### Goldfish Wind Chime

— Xinsheng

Children, the long summer vacation is coming to an end soon, and you will soon be going to school to study new books. Here, I will tell you how to make a small toy of a golden banana wind chime as a small handicraft for the summer vacation. Its production method is very simple, and the materials are all available to you.

Materials: A sheet of thick drawing paper, a strip of green satin (14 inches long), two peas, several threads (40-50 inches long), watercolor paint, glue.

Method: First, refer to the attached drawing and draw two pieces of thick drawing paper, 1 and 2. The width of 1 is four centimeters, and the length is from thirty to forty centimeters. 2 is divided into two strips, each strip is one centimeter wide, and the length is slightly longer than 1. After drawing, apply the color immediately, the colors of 1 and 2 must be different. If you want to make it more beautiful, you can use colored paper instead. First glue 1 into a circle, and then glue the two strips of 2 separately on the edges of the two sides of the circle. Then, use thick paper to cut goldfish (red, gold, yellow, black, white, and flower colors are all acceptable) two tails, green paper leaves two pieces, wind chimes (yellow) three pieces according to the attached drawings 3, 4, 6; first fold the goldfish according to the dotted line, and then glue them together, and then hang them on the round paper circle with two sections of silk thread (as shown in the attached picture): Then bend the three pieces of wind chimes and glue them together. After the above pieces are completed, you can thread a long thread through the middle ends of the round paper circle so that it can be suspended. Two green leaves are threaded in the thread section above the circle, and a green pea (5) is embedded under each leaf. This bean must be soaked in water first so that it can be threaded through; with the pea, the two leaves will not overlap. In the thread section below the circle, in addition to tying the paper wind chime, a light blue soft satin (7) is hung at the tail end, and the words "Made by so-and-so" can also be written on the soft satin. If there is no soft satin, you can use a hair tie made of colored silk thread instead. In addition, if you tie two small bells on the long line, then when a breeze blows: the goldfish dance, the wind chimes turn, the ribbons flutter, and the clear sound of the small bells is added, it is really very interesting?

Children, why don't you make a few "Goldfish Wind Chimes" and hang them under the window of your studio or under the corridor for decoration? If you give it to your good friends, they will definitely be very welcome!

### Goldfish Wind Chime

### In the Realm of Animals (14)

— Xin Qing

They both still fell down, falling down, constantly falling! The road seemed particularly long, particularly far! At this time, the night had passed, and the morning came, the sun shone brightly, but they were still falling down, falling down, Peng Qi kept shouting "Ah! Ah!" Lev also kept barking "Woof woof woof", the bell on its collar kept ringing, until later it was pulled to the top of the river, Peng Qi was taken aback, and before he could shout for help, he and Lev fell into the water together. Lev could swim, and after a while, it swam ashore, but Peng Qi couldn't swim. He took a mouthful of water and sank to the place where he used to drown dogs. Peng Chun suffocated and couldn't breathe, gasping for air, struggling in the water, just like the miserable scene he had seen with his own eyes when he drowned dogs before. He didn't know that he would actually perform it himself, which was really unexpected! He kept struggling in the water, suffocating even more severely, his head seemed to explode, but he couldn't shout, because his mouth was blocked by the water.

Peng Qi struggled in the water, his two hands frantically grabbing at the surface of the water, grabbing something that floated by, but it was useless, because it was the corpse of a dead dog, which he had thrown into the river last night. This scare was even more severe than the cold water stimulation. He thought that he might drown here and rot with the dead cats and dogs he had abused to death. At that time, on a tree nearby, a crow kept croaking, "Serve him right! Punish him well!" Many frogs were sitting on the river bank, looking at the corpses of those animals, croaking madly, "Throw stones at him! Throw stones at him!"

A pike was swimming back and forth nearby. It didn't have any ill feelings towards Peng Qi, because it had enjoyed several delicious meals by relying on Peng Qi's cruelty. But this pike was as selfish as ordinary animals. It was waiting for an opportunity to eat Peng Qi as well.

The more Peng Qi struggled, the more he sank. All the cruel memories of the past, like watching a movie, flashed through his mind one by one, and the endless flowing water kept rushing over him. He remembered the first big bee he had killed, and he also remembered sticking a thorn into the nose of Knox. Everything, everything, surged into his heart like a tide, seeming to be settling his cruel old debts, causing him to suffer infinite pain in his conscience, and unknowingly he hated himself.

After a while, he suddenly floated up from the water, floated to the surface of the water and exhaled, seeing the blue sky, how beautiful it was! He also heard a rail calling in the field, that field was the place where his two little sisters wanted him to pick lotus fragrant flowers. After a while, in a daze, he seemed to see Knox's smooth and lovely head also floating and sinking in the water. He was suddenly startled and muttered to himself, "No no no! God is above, I have never killed it!"

So he sank again. He thought of his home, thought of his father and mother, and thought of his two little sisters, whom he often bullied, killing the animals they loved, seeing them cry in a hurry, and mocking them. He also remembered how, during last summer's vacation, they welcomed him back home, their hats were filled with flowers, and they made flower rings and put them on the donkey's two long ears. He also remembered how he stabbed the donkey with a wooden stick with nails in it, stabbing it so that it ran around and jumped, causing his little sisters to scream, but he thought it was very fun! Oh! He remembered again how he usually avoided these two innocent and lively little sisters, preferring to be with that uneducated and evil little blacksmith, and he felt very proud. Then he suddenly remembered the very comfortable bed he slept on every night, his mother had to bless him by the bed every night; who knew that he would be sinking in the water at this moment, accompanying the cats and dogs he had killed before!

At this moment, he floated to the surface of the water again, and suddenly saw Knox's head, no more than three feet away from him. He also saw those clear brown eyes, earnestly staring at his face. He couldn't help but feel anxious in his heart, secretly thinking, "I usually abuse it, maybe it's here to retaliate against me." But he didn't care, because his body and mind had already suffered so much pain, and he was not afraid of any more pain being added to him. He just raised his eyes, intending to give his home a final look. Just then, a lark flew over, flying into the air, but Peng Qi sank into the water again.

### Introducing a Large Batch of New Performers to "Geng Xin" Stage (Part 1)

— Wei Wo

The day before yesterday, I received a letter from Mei Hua Guan Zhu, the representative of "Geng Xin" Stage who went north to invite performers. He said that Gou Huisheng was temporarily unable to come south. The first batch of performers for the "Geng Xin" autumn opening has been confirmed, including female roles Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Xiaolan, Li Yanxiu, as well as famous performers Chen Shaolin, Li Duokui, etc. Covering male, female, painted-face, and clown roles, every category is represented. The abundance of talent is no less than the golden period after the autumn cool. However, there are quite a few unfamiliar faces to Shanghai audiences, so I am introducing them as follows:

Wu Suqiu

Wu Suqiu rose in the capital's opera scene in just a few years. Wu's art is not comparable to Zhao Jinrong and Hou Yulan who graduated from opera school, but her appearance is beautiful, and like Lu Sujuan, she is known for her beauty in the northern music scene, so she is also popular. Wu is a disciple of Gou Huisheng, and her outstanding works include Xun school operas such as "Xun Guan Niang" and "Hua Tian Cuo". She has been with Li Yuchun's Yongchun Troupe for a long time. Last year, she left Yongchun Troupe and signed with Zhang Yijun. This time, she resolutely accepted the invitation to "Geng Xin." This is her first time coming south. Seeing the popularity of Li Guiyun in Shanghai, Wu Suqiu will surely be very popular with Shanghai audiences.

Zhao Jinrong

Zhao Jinrong is a top student from the Beiping Opera School. The opera school has three outstanding female performers: Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu, and Hou Yulan. Among the three, Jinrong was the most popular when they were in school. Jinrong was the mainstay when the opera school performed in Ping. After Jinrong left the school, Dezhu succeeded her, and after Dezhu left, Yulan began to succeed Dezhu and solely take on the responsibility. Zhao Jinrong's performance has been passed down from famous performers such as Yu Yuqin and Wu Fuqin. She excels in both Qingyi (serious female role) and Huashan (vivacious female role), and her appearance is considered excellent, earning her the title of "Female Mei Lanfang." While in school, she, along with martial arts actor Wang Jinlu and bearded male actor Wang Rulin, formed a three-legged stool and were outstanding talents of the opera school. Her art is far above Hou Yulan. Since Yulan was able to become extremely popular in Shanghai, Jinrong's popularity can be expected without question. Although "Geng Xin" has invited as many as four female performers this time, in practical terms, only Jinrong is worth noting.

Zhao Xiaolan

Zhao Xiaolan is a disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. She has come to Shanghai twice before, but she did not become popular either time. The year before last, she joined Zhou Xinfang's Yifeng Troupe, and gradually began to attract the attention of opera lovers, but soon after, she left Yifeng Troupe and returned north. Xiaolan's voice is excellent. However, she studied Shang's style too much, which backfired. It is said that Xiaolan is diligent in her studies. After returning to Ping, her artistic skills have improved greatly. A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes. Xiaolan's return this time may be able to refresh the ears and eyes of Shanghai audiences.

Li Yanxiu

Li Yanxiu is a rising star among female performers in the capital, and also a favorite disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. Li's art is comparable to Zhao Xiaolan's. Her high-pitched voice and agile martial arts skills are quite like her teacher. Although her qualifications and experience are not as good as Xiaolan, her talent is fully revealed. Her popularity in Ping is even greater than Xiaolan's. She has created many new operas, such as "Wang Juan Niang", "Jian Qi Yuan", and "Bi Yu Yuan", which have all been greatly appreciated by the general public. Her teacher, Xiaoyun, recently taught her plays such as "Bai Yu Lian" and "Hua Rui Furen". Yanxiu has established herself in Ping, performing at Qingleyuan. Her older sister, Yanbin, also performs female roles, privately studying Cheng Yanqiu's style. The two sisters are known as the "Li Sisters' Two Inkstones" in Ping. The "Geng Xin" invitation representative values her talent and invited her to come with Suqiu, Jinrong, and Xiaolan.

Chen Shaolin

Chen Shaolin is the son of the deceased famous performer Chen Delin. Shaolin studied under the famous performer Zhang Chunyan. Chunyan is one of the few talented performers in Liyuan (the opera world) today. With Yang Yan's superb drama skills, Shaolin's art is not ordinary. Shaolin once came to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu. At that time, Shaolin's art was still immature, so it failed to attract the attention of Shanghai audiences. Shaolin's singing and recitation are quite commendable, but his acting is too rigid and his eyes lack expression. In addition, his experience and insight are not enough. His art is slightly better than Guan Shaohua, who was invited to the Tianchan Stage last time. Shaolin has been away from Shanghai for three years. With Gao Shenglin's rapid progress, it is expected that Shaolin's art must be different from the past and must have improved.

The association's purpose is pure and the methods are perfect. From now on, the city's performing arts community will be able to pool their efforts, support each other, study art, discuss knowledge, seek happiness for themselves, and contribute to the public good for society. The future is bright and unlimited. The meeting adjourned at approximately 2:00 pm after a group photograph.

Random Notes on Performers

### From Stage to Screen (Part 2)

— Silver Flute's Notes

—Oral Account by Ms. Yuan Meiyun—

The plan to go to Chongqing did not materialize, but we went to Hong Kong, which was the farthest "trip" in my life. We stayed in Hong Kong for more than two months, and took the opportunity to shoot a film called "Miss Tomboy," directed by Yue Feng. It was later distributed by Xinhua Film Company.

While in Hong Kong, Zhu Qingxian, the owner of Nanyue Film Company, asked me to join Nanyue and sign contracts for several films. While I was still considering, Mr. Zhang Shankun of Xinhua arrived in Hong Kong and asked me to return to my old ways, because Xinhua had resumed filming work in Shanghai. So, we finally returned to Shanghai. The contract with Xinhua Company was signed in Hong Kong.

After returning to Shanghai, I successively filmed four films with Xinhua and Huaxin (the two companies belong to the same system). Recently, we are starting to film "Xi Shi," and this is my first time playing a role in a historical costume drama.

Life in the film industry is not as comfortable as outsiders imagine. The hardships are sometimes unknown to outsiders. For example, when I was in Xinhua, I encountered three films being shot at the same time. "Sunrise" was filmed at the Datong Studio on Gansidong Road, while "Four Pan Jinlian" and "Tears of Love" were filmed at the Xinhua Factory on Albert Road. I had to rush to three locations in one day, and work from afternoon to dawn for more than ten days. No matter how strong a person is, they would not be able to withstand it, let alone me, who has always been weak. So, in addition to catching a cold, I also suffered from severe laryngitis. After consulting Dr. Mi Ziyun and taking seven or eight doses of medicine, I finally recovered.

Injuries during filming are common in film studios. Although I have been lucky, I did suffer a little bit when Yihua Company was filming "Little Sisters." Most film studios have a basement level. When filming "Little Sisters," it was a dark night. I went to the dressing room to change clothes and unfortunately stepped into the air, immediately falling from the ground into the basement, and fainting. The basement was full of nails and pieces of wood, so my knees were injured. Although it was not very serious, when I woke up after fainting, I felt very painful. At this time, I don't need to hide it, it was Wang Yin who jumped down from above and rescued me. —In the six years of filming, this was the only time I had an accident.

Regarding "ribbon-cutting," I need to make a statement here: In the past, I almost "granted every request" for ribbon-cutting, but it is really a "hard errand." If it is an orderly public place, it is fine, but otherwise I will inevitably suffer unexpected disasters. Like the opening of the Shanghai Yimiao Market on Luzon Road, I was greatly burdened. Because the audience was as surging as a tide, completely losing order, if Mr. Chen Kangran had not supported me, I would not have been able to breathe and would have fallen to the ground. Therefore, for the sake of "safety first," for ribbon-cutting, unless it is a charitable event, which is obligatory, otherwise I can only "decline from now on." This may offend people, but I hope people can understand my difficulties.
