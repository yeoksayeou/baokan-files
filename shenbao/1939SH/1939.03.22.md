### Chinese Army Attacks Yánglóusī, People Assist Greatly

(Chángshā) During the Chinese army's attack on Yánglóusī last month, the area was once occupied. According to a certain commander who led the attack on Yánglóusī, when his troops approached Yánglóusī, they still had to cross a small river ten meters wide. Although engineers had built a temporary bridge in advance, the muddy conditions after the rain made it difficult for the large army to pass. Fortunately, while the engineers were working, someone passing by the bridge noticed this shortcoming. Under the leadership of a person surnamed Rèn, everyone gathered rice straw and tied it together, placing it horizontally on the slopes above and below the nail bridge, creating several steps. When the main force passed, even though it was during the continuous spring rain, there was no danger of slipping. Moreover, because the mountain roads in Yánglóusī were winding and difficult to navigate, many elderly mountain dwellers volunteered to act as guides. After reaching the designated location, the attack began. These elderly men remained steadfast and fearless. Furthermore, the assistance provided by the people along the way to the troops in terms of drinking water, food, transportation, and stretchers was deeply appreciated by the officers and soldiers. The courage of the attacking soldiers was thereby doubled, leading to this victory. (20th Dispatch)

Editorial

### World Peace Hinges on Germany

The German leader, Hitler, having subjugated Czechoslovakia, triumphantly returned to Berlin yesterday. Party members and people welcomed him throughout the country. General Göring, representing the country, made a dedicatory speech, saying, "The leader has not only restored the historical glory of the German nation, but also placed Germany on the security of a rock." Göring is the dictator of Germany's four-year economic plan, the speaker of the Reichstag, the Minister of Aviation, and the Governor of Prussia. He is Hitler's only right-hand man and the heir apparent to Hitler in the eyes of the world. For this man to make such a eulogy on this occasion, he must have carefully considered his words, making them perfectly appropriate and not merely idle flattery. However, how can this be so diametrically opposed to the world's perception of Germany and Hitler, and the world's fear for the future of the overall situation? Can this really be explained by "Being a minister of the Hàn dynasty, how can I not say so?" If that is the explanation, then he is merely a flattering sycophant and not worthy to be called a national hero.

Germany's swallowing of Czechoslovakia has been universally condemned as barbaric, violent, sinful, and a breach of faith. Britain, America, France, and Russia do not recognize its legitimacy, in order to highlight its illegality. Britain and France have even recalled their ambassadors to show their disdain. This is an unprecedented shame for the German nation. What glory is there to speak of?

The world's four democratic powers have launched sanctions and are competing to prepare for war. Combining the military and economic power of Britain, America, Russia, and France, who can compete with them? Moreover, the six southeastern countries of Poland, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia share common interests and have advocated for a united front. With their collective strength and the support of many, they can certainly cope on the battlefield. This should be a cause for sleepless nights for those in Germany who are concerned about their country. Furthermore, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, following the President's lead, condemned Germany's actions, saying that Czechoslovakia's misfortune was only temporary. Saying temporary means that there is a way to reverse the situation and implies the prospect of restoring the country. Also, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, known for appeasing Germany and being an unparalleled peacemaker, frankly admitted to being deceived and was overcome with anger. During his speech in Birmingham, he asserted that Germany's unjust actions would inevitably bring retribution upon itself. He also asserted that the German people would one day turn their anger towards the current authorities for the evil they have sown. Is this just an old man cursing like a village woman? He must have profound insight and knowledge, and he must be speaking with substance, with a well-thought-out plan to follow. All of this shows that Germany has made many enemies and built up deep resentment. Once it starts trouble, it will be besieged. It is as dangerous as a pile of eggs. What security on a rock is there to speak of?

Do the German government and people understand this? Today, the world is turbulent and public opinion is seething. Those who hate Germany are gloating, happy that Germany has been abandoned by all and is facing its doom. Those who love Germany are deeply saddened and alarmed that Germany has angered everyone and is facing a calamity. We truly do not know how Hitler is calculating, nor do we know what Göring feels that he still considers himself honored, nor what he relies on that he still boasts of security. We do not believe that Germany alone is intelligent and the rest of the world is foolish, that the difference in intelligence is so great that the world cannot fathom Germany's depth. Then, how will Germany manage this turbulent situation? To say that they have nothing to fear is self-deception. The Germans do indeed have a fearless spirit, but how can spirit alone repel enemies and avert disaster? We deeply admire the German nation. They are intelligent and strong, truly one of the world's outstanding nations. Throughout history, they have made many contributions to the humanities and sciences. We also know that Germany has a glorious history. The power of Wilhelm I is still vivid in our minds. However, since the defeat in the Great War, its national strength has been exhausted. After enduring countless hardships and difficult construction, it has achieved the recent revival. Yet, it has disregarded the lessons of history, disregarded the trust of humanity, and disregarded the survival of other races, and has once again become the target of public criticism. The tragedy of twenty years ago is about to be re-enacted today. The efforts of the past twenty years are about to be destroyed in a single day. Is this not lamentable and regrettable?

On the day the Great War breaks out, no matter how many battles Germany wins, how invincible it is, there is absolutely no hope of achieving final victory. The strategy of defeating them one by one has already failed, and the anger of the masses is insurmountable. Germany will not be spared. Moreover, as the general trend shows, no country or individual is happy about the outbreak of a world war. However, countries have repeatedly said that their tolerance for Germany has its limits. Now, with Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, they have unanimously said that it has broken the limits and they can no longer tolerate it. The fear of Germany's insatiability and the desire to restrain Germany for their own security are widespread and deeply rooted. The peace hoax of Munich will no longer be allowed to be re-enacted in order to seek so-called temporary peace. The old peacemaker is angry, and the international anti-German front is almost encircling Germany several times over. Today, it is difficult to find a glimmer of hope for peace. If there is one, it is that the German government and people can look ahead and behind, assess the situation, and with great wisdom and courage, take the initiative to resolve the problem. If they know that they are causing trouble, why not repent? Repenting for the trouble when the catastrophe is about to break out is the last chance to repent. Today, if Germany can suddenly change its course, and, in addition to words that can no longer be trusted by the world, base its actions on heroic character, display the spirit of sportsmanship, restrain its aggressiveness, strive for humility, and correct the facts with bright actions, transforming its policies frankly, and restricting its expansion, sharing it with the world to see and hear, then it will surely be trusted, understood, and comforted by the world. Even today, Germany still has this opportunity. Moreover, maintaining glory and seeking security depend solely on this opportunity. Opportunities do not come often and are fleeting. It is up to the German government and people to consider it.

Unexpectedly, the enemy greatly reinforced their forces. Commander Yu, with exhausted troops, suddenly faced a formidable enemy, attacked from both sides, and was heavily surrounded. He was seriously wounded but continued to fight bravely, annihilating dozens of enemy soldiers before breaking through the encirclement, ultimately succumbing to his injuries. Only half of the troops he led survived, the rest making heroic sacrifices. Troops have been urgently dispatched to engage the enemy. Acting Commander Yu Ren-zhi was exceptionally loyal and courageous, venturing deep behind enemy lines to carry out his duties.

### Fate of Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Still Unknown

(Tianjin) The Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. T.O.T. O'Neill, 52 years old, was kidnapped by three Chinese individuals from his residence at No. 1 Niuzhuang Road in the former German concession on the 17th of this month. Four days have passed, and there is still no trace of him. The British authorities here are making every effort to find Mr. O'Neill's whereabouts and rescue him. The investigation relies heavily on the assistance of the Japanese authorities. Today, the authorities have agreed to cooperate fully. The kidnapped victim is the manager of Wilson & Co. and one of the most prominent British residents. Outside concerns for Mr. O'Neill's safety are deepening. According to detailed information obtained from a reliable eyewitness, Mr. O'Neill might have been released within minutes of being kidnapped if not for a Chinese policeman and several Chinese bystanders doing nothing. After the kidnappers forced Mr. O'Neill out of the back door of his residence and into a car waiting there, the car engine broke down less than 200 yards away. Curious onlookers gathered around the car. Although Mr. O'Neill had blood on his forehead, indicating his distress, no one came forward to help. A policeman on duty less than 20 yards away also turned a blind eye and did not leave his post. Mr. O'Neill sat in the car with his hands tied behind his back. After half an hour, the kidnappers hijacked a rental car from a car shop not far from the broken-down car on Dagu Road, forced Mr. O'Neill into the car, and immediately sped off towards Dagu. Subsequent investigation revealed that the license plate on the broken-down car was counterfeit. When the kidnappers appeared at Mr. O'Neill's residence, he was on the phone. The kidnappers' actions were no different from those of gangsters in American movies, first cutting the phone line. Mr. O'Neill's wife ran down from upstairs to try to stop her husband from being kidnapped but was struck by the kidnappers and pushed aside. The kidnappers threatened the Chinese cook and servants with weapons before entering the house. After the kidnappers fled, the cook followed them. Although he saw Mr. O'Neill sitting in the broken-down car, he was frightened and didn't know what to do. The general consensus among foreigners here is that the kidnappers are pro-Japanese terrorists. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### Comforting the Troops Association: Work Divided

(Chongqing) After the National Committee for Comforting the Troops Fighting the War of Resistance held a Spring Festival comfort meeting in Chongqing, it dispatched trucks carrying a large quantity of Sichuan-produced pickled mustard and other items to Guangxi due to the large number of wounded soldiers there. Together with the Guangxi Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, they prepared over 15,000 comfort bags and expanded their comfort efforts within Guangxi Province in the early part of this month. Recently, they delivered over 10,000 catties of pickled turnip and mustard sprouts to the front lines in central Hubei via representatives of the 26th Army and 32nd Division, and they will dispatch tens of thousands more catties to the Xiangfan front lines. Moreover, a sudden influx of over 10,000 new recruits are currently undergoing concentrated training and will be dispatched to the front lines soon. The Association has dispatched personnel to investigate and plans to send a delegation to organize a comfort team, bringing a large number of comfort items to comfort them. The Association, recognizing the tense situation on the northern front lines and in Xiangfan, has decided to send separate delegations to comfort them. (Telegraphed on the 21st)

Guilin: The Women's Guidance Committee of the New Transportation Association specially transported 154 boxes of milk, 19 packages of gauze, and 29 packages of cotton to Guilin to comfort the wounded soldiers from Guangdong, requesting Mrs. Li and Mrs. Bai to receive and forward them.

### Military-Civilian Cooperation on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Front Lines

(Changsha) This reporter met a guerrilla commander in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in a certain location. According to him, the anti-Japanese sentiment among the people at the front is high, and the military and civilians are able to cooperate well. The belief in final victory is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and they have been able to genuinely and voluntarily assist the army in tasks such as protecting stretcher bearers. Counting only the combat results of his unit in March, they have killed over a thousand Japanese soldiers, destroyed two Japanese warehouses, seized over 800 rifles and two light machine guns, and captured eight Japanese soldiers.

### Excavation of Zhang Xianzhong's Sunken Silver in Chengdu; Authorized by the Ministry of Finance, but Still No Results

(Chongqing) Currently, the Jianghe Qingjun Company is excavating 100 million taels of silver sunken by Zhang Xianzhong at the bottom of the Dong River outside Chengdu. The reason for the firm belief that Zhang Xianzhong indeed sank 100 million taels of silver at the bottom of the Dong River is based on three points: (1) Zhang collected a large amount of wealth from the wealthy people of Sichuan; (2) when Zhang passed through Shanxi on his way to attack Beiping, he engaged in large-scale looting; (3) after Zhang was defeated in Beiping, he returned to Sichuan through Shanxi. It is believed that he transported all the spoils of war back to Chengdu and buried them at the bottom of the Dong River outside Chengdu. The excavation of Zhang Xianzhong's sunken silver by the Jianghe Qingjun Company is authorized by the Ministry of Finance. As of now, there have been no results. All the excavation workers are prisoners and are not allowed to go outside, being guarded by military police. At the same time, foreigners are not allowed to enter. The company promises that if anything is found, they will donate 80% to the state, and the other 20% will be used for relief. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)

### Guerrilla Warfare Occurring Frequently in Rehe

(Beiping) According to travelers who have just arrived here from Zhangjiakou, the Japanese army has been moving troops frequently between Chahar and Rehe in the past week. Japanese troops moving westward from Chahar Province are incessant. Whether these Japanese troops are being transferred to Suiyuan to prepare for an invasion of the Northwest or to defend against a southward advance by the Mongolian army is currently unknown. What is known is that in the past two weeks, "mutiny" incidents have occurred from time to time among the "Manchukuo" army and the "Inner Mongolian" army stationed in the Suiyuan area. These Japanese troops may have been transferred to Suiyuan Province to prevent the puppet army from "mutinying" again, which is also unknown. The traveler continued, stating that the power of the Chinese guerrillas in Inner Mongolia is growing daily, and their area of activity has gradually expanded eastward. This can be seen in the frequent occurrence of guerrilla warfare in Rehe Province in recent days. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 21st)

### Construction Department Plans to Develop Mineral Resources

(Nanchang) Before the war, most of Jiangxi Province's trade was exported via the Nanxun Railway. After northern Jiangxi became a guerrilla zone, the wartime trade department of the province was established, with transportation via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway highway being relatively convenient. According to estimates by the Construction Department, the total export value for the 27th year of the Republic was approximately 120 million yuan, with rice, tea, tungsten ore, and paper accounting for the majority, representing over 70% of the total value. Looking at the tea and rice items from last year alone, rice exports and sales to Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces reached approximately 1.1 million bags (200 catties per bag), with a total value of 10 million yuan. Exports of Anhui-Jiangxi green tea leaves had a total value of over 3 million yuan, accounting for half. The Construction Department is now actively planning to develop mineral resources and actively export them, and it has established a tin ore smelting plant to extract pure tin for sale outside the province in order to enrich Jiangxi's economic power.

### UK House of Commons Passes Second Reading of Bill to Help China Stabilize Currency; Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon Attends and Explains That This Move Benefits Both China and the UK

(London) The China Bill (stabilizing legal tender) passed its second reading in the House of Commons today, and the attached financial resolution was also approved. The bill provides for the establishment of a fund of £10 million to curb fluctuations in the exchange rate of legal tender against the pound. No objections to the bill were voiced in the House of Commons.

When Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon moved the second reading of the bill, he declared that although the total volume of British trade with China did not account for a high percentage of Britain's total trade with the world, it was worth maintaining and assisting, especially because of China's large population, where even a slight increase in per capita purchases would make a big difference. Since the outbreak of the current war, China's currency system, which was launched in 1935, has been severely tested. China has adopted technically sophisticated methods with careful planning, and overseas Chinese have also provided assistance to legal tender through remittances, donations, and loans. Last year, the legal tender remained stable throughout, with very little disturbance or erosion of confidence. If the House of Commons approves this bill, it can be guaranteed that China will be able to maintain its credibility and tradition in this matter.

Labour MP Lawrence immediately stated that he would support this bill because what is stipulated in it is sufficient to promote British trade, especially because this move can provide practical assistance to China's struggle against Japan. The time may have come when the government should consider taking other actions to strengthen the Chinese people's resistance and curb the extent to which the Japanese attempt to control people's lives. Independent Labour MP Mander also supported the bill, stating that the spirit in which the government is pursuing this matter is too narrow. He deeply regretted that the government should expand its actions to ensure that British trade has free access to this part of the world. The government is now only implementing the resolutions of the League of Nations. Conservative MP Boothby stated that he regretted that this assistance was not realized earlier and that it was insufficient.

Labour MP Smith moved to reject the bill, saying that it would be difficult to curb the fluctuations in legal tender unless the government pursued another political and economic policy in the Far East. The government is derelict in its duty for not taking the lead in providing humanitarian assistance to the Chinese people in order to avoid offending Japan. In the past eight years, the government's policies have always been about colluding with aggressors at the expense of victims. Labour MP Tinker supported the amendment, saying that what the government is doing now is the result of our failure to take a firm stand when Japan invaded China.

National Conservative MP Astor stated that he hoped that no insistence would be made on the amendment. Nothing could inspire the Chinese government and people more than the unanimous passage of this bill by the House of Commons.

Labour MP Burke said that any concessions to maintain the cotton industry, however small, and to help workers maintain the markets they have gained, would be greatly appreciated by the workers. He believed that Japan's struggle would truly begin after the war ended. If the amendment were pushed and the House of Commons had to divide on it, he would vote in favor of the government's proposal. Labour MP Bellenger stated that if the purpose of this bill was to encourage trade between China and the UK, he would support it. At this point, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon interjected, saying that this was indeed the purpose of the bill. Then Bellenger asked whether this fund would be used in cooperation with the United States and France, as in the state of a trilateral currency agreement. The Chancellor replied that other governments had already provided financial assistance to China in different ways, such as the US government currently purchasing large quantities of silver from China. However, with regard to this proposal, he must ask the House of Commons to accept it as our contribution to China.

Treasury Financial Secretary Wallace replied to the debate, saying that the opposition spokesman had acknowledged that £10 million was sufficient for this purpose, and it was also acknowledged in the debate that China's legal tender was not shaken at the moment and that it had been stable for many years, receiving excellent internal assistance. Wallace denied the claim that this proposal was issued to support private banks, saying that the reason for uniting with four banks to manage this fund was that the government could utilize a large amount of ability and experience in this matter, and the four banks also considered it a great honor to participate in this action. Regardless of whether the government could have assisted China in the past, there is no doubt that this bill is a clear and significant assistance to China. He hoped that the House of Commons would pass this bill unanimously, as this action would have a great psychological effect on China. Wallace then mentioned Japan's currency plan in North China and the British government's protest against this plan, saying that what was even more gratifying was that the most qualified commentators all believed that Japan's plan was bound to fail in reality. If the price of legal tender were to be changed from one shilling and six and a half pence to one shilling and two pence, the immediate result would seem to be a halt to export trade. China's legal tender would continue to circulate as usual, except in some towns and railway areas controlled by the Japanese army. As for the place where the fund will be used, it will be in Hong Kong. The £10 million will soon be raised, and the interest income from the fund will be used to subsidize the interest payable by Chinese banks to British banks. The interest rate is currently agreed at 2.75%. If the agreement is continued after one year, the interest rate may increase or decrease depending on the situation at the time. As for the reason why the upward interest rate is not detailed in the proposal, it is because the agreement may continue for several years, and because we do not want to return to the House of Commons from time to time to request approval.

### Japanese Poisoning Weihaiwei with Opium; British MP Questions Government

(London) Conservative MP Haslam asked in the House of Commons today whether the Prime Minister knew that when Britain leased Weihaiwei, there was no opium poisoning in the port and surrounding areas, and that this was also the case afterward, until after the Japanese army occupied it, many opium dens had been opened. Whether the Prime Minister would call the Japanese government's attention to the serious consequences of allowing opium dens to exist and even increase in the Chinese territories occupied by the Japanese army. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, yes, this issue is currently under consideration. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

### Joint Declaration Drafted by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union: Collective Deterrence of German Aggression; Soviet Union Advocates Security System Not Limited to Eastern Europe; Britain Principally Agrees to Convene Six-Nation Conference; French Foreign Minister Bonnet Begins Exchanging Views with Britain

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated today that London and other European capitals are currently engaged in rapid negotiations to draft a joint declaration by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This declaration will explicitly state that should further acts of aggression occur, the collective powers will certainly resist them. This matter has now been initiated by Britain and France, feeling that this is a preliminary measure to prevent any sudden new acts of aggression in the most rapid and effective manner. Since the Soviet Union suggested that relevant democratic countries should immediately hold a conference to decide their attitude towards the new situation created by Germany, Britain felt that the situation was extremely urgent and that issuing the aforementioned declaration would be better than convening a conference, as negotiations to draft a declaration would take less time than holding a conference. The Soviet Union seems to have no objection to the British proposal, but the Soviet Union wants to be sure that Britain and France are truly prepared to act in the event of an emergency. It is estimated that the Soviet Union will make the convening of a conference after the declaration is issued, according to the Soviet Union's proposed method, a condition for joining the declaration. (Reuters, 21st)

(London) Regarding the British government's plan for a collective security system organization in Eastern Europe, after exchanging views with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria, well-informed sources here recently stated that Foreign Secretary Halifax will hold important talks with French Foreign Minister Bonnet today, and Foreign Minister Bonnet will inform him of the French government's views. As for the content of the British plan, the outside world is still unaware. It is reported that it will include a restraint, stating that if Romania and other small countries join and are then subjected to aggression by other countries, other signatory countries will provide assistance. However, whether military assistance is included depends on the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Poland, which are still unclear. It must be determined after British and French authorities hold talks and begin consultations with the Soviet Union and Poland. As of now, only Turkey has stated that it is willing to accept the British plan and is prepared to send troops to assist Romania in dealing with all contingencies. In addition, the British government is also in close contact with the United States and has also inquired about the opinions of South American countries. The reports submitted by British envoys to various South American countries regarding this matter arrived at the Foreign Office last night. (Havas, 21st)

(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claims that people in London are now afraid that the situation will suddenly become tense and catch them off guard, causing the major power conference suggested by Moscow to fail to be held in time. Currently, Britain and France believe that a clear declaration signed by relevant major powers and joined by other countries is the most practical first step in creating a new security system in Europe based on mutual interests. The Soviet Union is prepared to join this effort, but must be certain that Western European powers truly intend to take action. The Soviet Union does not necessarily want to limit the significance of this declaration to Eastern Europe. Yesterday, diplomatic circles believed that Germany's eastward advance had somewhat stalled, but the direction of Germany's future steps may be towards Lithuania. Many believe that Germany will soon annex Memel. Lithuania is not prepared to offer effective resistance, but if Germany's ambitions extend to the mainland of Lithuania, Poland will not stand idly by. According to general speculation, the next major development will be Italy's presentation of demands to France. (Reuters, 21st)

(London) Regarding the Soviet government's proposal to convene an international peace conference, the British government has recently responded that, in principle, the British government completely agrees with the Soviet Union's proposal. A correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency recently learned from well-informed sources that the Soviet Union proposed convening a six-nation conference, namely Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Poland, and Turkey. The British government has notified Moscow, informing them that Britain has no special opinion regarding the location of the meeting, but believes that holding it in the capital of Romania is most appropriate. British political figures have paid close attention to the fact that Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece have not been invited to participate. (Hai Tong, 20th)

(London) The reports submitted by the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Britain to their respective governments all unanimously recognize that the situation is very dangerous, but express that a major war will not necessarily break out immediately. They all believe that Britain's attempt to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union is the most important aspect of British policy. Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to meet with the Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczynski, tomorrow to hear Poland's attitude towards participating in the proposed "alliance to deter aggressors." At the same time, Britain will also inquire about the opinions of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria on forming a common front to prevent Germany from extending its influence beyond the borders of Czechoslovakia. (Associated Press, 20th)

(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning. According to responsible sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax presented a report on the international situation. The Cabinet immediately decided in principle to support Romania and establish a collective security system in Eastern Europe to curb Germany's expansion of influence towards the Black Sea coast. It is reported that the British government is fully organizing a group, the nature of which should be similar to the alliance group used to combat Napoleon I's hegemony more than a century ago. It is generally expected that British and French authorities will jointly issue a declaration after French President Lebrun's visit to Britain (March 21), stating that both sides are determined to prevent new German aggression. (Havas, 20th)

(Paris) According to reports in various newspapers here this morning, the purpose of the recent active and frequent diplomatic activities in Paris and London is to unite Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Soviet Russia to establish a defensive group in Eastern Europe to prevent Germany from advancing eastward. Le Petit Journal reported, "France is directly interested in this effort and is actively building its own cornerstone." (Hai Tong, 21st)

### U.S. Note to Germany Protests Armed Invasion of Czechoslovakia: Considered a Threat to World Security, Unprecedented Sharp Language

(Washington) The United States government formally protested to Germany last night against Germany's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. According to official sources, this note is the sharpest note sent by the United States to another country in peacetime. Some quarters indicate that this protest may cause a rupture in relations between Berlin and Washington. It is reported that the note used direct and fierce language to recognize that Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia violated international law and posed a threat to world security. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Soviet Union Did Not Provide Promises of Assistance to Romania and Poland

(Moscow) TASS is instructed to deny the rumors that the Soviet government recently provided Poland and Romania with promises of assistance in the event that they were subjected to foreign aggression. The two countries did not appeal to the Soviet Union for assistance, nor did they notify the Soviet government of the danger they are currently threatened with. However, the British government notified the Soviet government on March 18 that there were significant reasons to fear that violent action would be taken against Romania, and inquired about what stance the Soviet Union intended to take to deal with this change. In its reply, the Soviet government proposed convening a conference of countries with close ties, namely Britain, France, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, but the British government felt that this suggestion was still premature.

### American Economic Weaponry Can Suffocate Germany

(Washington) People here do not believe that the American authorities can agree to actively participate in the democratic countries' congress. What the American authorities can offer is in the economic and spiritual aspects. As for sending troops overseas to participate in foreign wars, it is not something that the American authorities can agree to. However, the guarantee that American economic weaponry can be used by democratic countries is also sufficient to consolidate the European peace front. (Reuters, 20th)

(Washington) Experts from the Department of Commerce held a meeting today to discuss a report on Germany's economic situation. Secretary of Commerce Hopkins personally presided over the meeting. According to this report, Germany's financial burden has increased significantly after annexing Austria and the Sudetenland. The occupation of Czechoslovakia may not bring significant commercial benefits. The country's cash reserves, including those of Czechoslovakia, amount to approximately $250 million to $300 million. As such, if the country adopts a blitzkrieg policy, it will be in an "advantageous position" due to its preemptive strike. Even in long-term warfare, it can barely support itself financially, but the people's living standards will definitely decline. As far as the country's economy is concerned, it does not have the strength to resist for a long time. ) Havas, 20th)

### Italian Ambassador to Germany Returns Home to Report on His Duties; Göring Visits Italy Again

(Berlin) The Italian Ambassador to Germany hurriedly returned to Rome today to report on the situation to Mussolini. His departure from Berlin was quite secretive. German newspapers have not yet published news of his return. It is reported that the Italian Ambassador to Germany met with Hitler on Monday evening, at which time Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Göring were also present. According to well-informed sources, the Italian Ambassador carried a letter from Hitler to Mussolini on this return trip and should return to Berlin no later than Friday morning. (Reuters, 21st)

(Berlin) German Aviation Minister General Göring went to Sanremo, Italy, today to continue his vacation. (Havas, 21st)

### Franco-German Economic Negotiations Stall

(Paris) According to the Economic News Agency, Franco-German economic negotiations have stalled, and the French representatives have returned to Paris. (Reuters, 21st)

### French President Lebrun and Foreign Minister Arrive in London; Warmly Welcomed by Government and Public

(London) French President Lebrun and his wife arrived in London today for a formal return visit and will remain until Friday before returning to their country. The closeness of the relationship between Britain and France can be seen in the warm welcome from the British government and public. London residents were packed on the streets that the French President and others would pass through, hoping to catch a glimpse of his appearance. Each street was decorated with French flags and coats of arms. The ship carrying the French President, under the protection of British warships and Royal Air Force bombers, passed through a line of warships adorned with flags and sailed into Dover Harbor. Each warship fired a 21-gun salute to express its welcome. The Duke of Gloucester, brother of the King of England, personally waited there to greet them. He and the French President and others transferred to a train to London, arriving at Victoria Station at 3:00 PM. The King and Queen of England, other members of the royal family, the British Prime Minister, and cabinet members were all at the station to welcome them. The King and Queen and the French President and his wife then drove to Buckingham Palace. A formal welcoming banquet will be held at the palace in the evening. (Reuters, 21st)

### British Foreign Secretary's Speech Condemns German Crimes: Who Can Believe that the Czech Republic's Submission Under Violent Oppression Represents the Will of the People? Foreign Secretary Expresses Sympathy for the Czech People

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax today condemned Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia in clear terms in the House of Lords, stating that the various events that occurred in Czechoslovakia before the German military invasion were clearly intentionally created by the German side, and the impact of these events was also clearly intentionally exaggerated by the German side. Although the German side said that Germany was harmed by Czechoslovakia, no one lightly believes it. It seems that differences of opinion between British parties no longer exist when serious issues are at stake. Recent European events have indeed shocked thoughtful people at home and abroad. When the Czech President and Foreign Minister were on their way to meet with Hitler on March 3 and had not yet held discussions, German troops had already occupied two Czech towns. How could this be a meaningless action? The Foreign Secretary mentioned Hitler's announcement that Czech territory was under German protection, saying that there were points to note in the announcement. Although the leader of the new Czech administrative organs was called the head of the Czech Protectorate, and this Protectorate was called self-governing, in administration, Germany stationed an official in Prague who had the right to veto resolutions. In military affairs, Germany stationed troops in Czech territory. In diplomatic affairs, Germany was responsible for Czech diplomatic matters and protecting its people abroad. In customs, the Czech Republic joined the German customs union. In addition, the German government could issue orders and take any measures to maintain peace and order. As a result of these actions, Czechoslovakia can now be said to be completely dismembered. He absolutely did not believe that some leaders in Slovakia could have suddenly made the decision to break away from relations with Czechoslovakia without prior external assistance. The German claim that the Czech President voluntarily surrendered the country is even more unnecessary to refute. Looking at the circumstances when the Czech President went to Berlin and German troops occupied the Czech border, anyone with a little knowledge knows that there was no so-called negotiation at the time. It was just a matter of placing an ultimatum before the Czech leaders under the threat of force. The reason why the Czech leaders succumbed was to protect the people from the tragedy of being rapidly destroyed by aerial bombardment. In this environment, the British government believed that it was appropriate to take some action immediately. Therefore, it canceled the commercial negotiations with Germany and decided to recall the Ambassador to Germany to make the German government aware of the British government's attitude. The Germans cited the past history of the British Empire to defend Germany's actions. However, it should be known that the principle followed by the British Empire is self-government. Wherever the British went, they left a legacy of freedom and self-government, unlike those who destroy freedom. Britain certainly recognizes that Germany has a greater interest in southeastern Europe than Britain, but after forcibly destroying a sovereign country and violating the simplest rules of international conduct, its position has completely changed. The British opposition party accused Chamberlain's Munich policy of being a personal policy. If this means that it was a policy that Chamberlain used all his energy, imagination, and determination for, he should not deny it. But if it means that Chamberlain pursued this policy without the full cooperation of the Foreign Secretary and other cabinet members, then he cannot but emphatically deny it. The purpose of the Munich settlement was twofold. First, in the then extremely difficult environment, to seek a possible fair solution to the real problems that had to be dealt with, in order to preserve European peace. Judging from the information obtained on that day, the government's adoption of this path was certainly correct. Second, to promote greater security for the people of Europe on the basis of mutually agreed consultations, as a way to adjust various disputes in the future. Unexpectedly, this purpose was erased by recent events. On that day, Hitler had used the principle of self-determination as a request, but soon after, Germany had destroyed this principle with its various actions and denied the right to self-determination on which its attitude was based. Regardless of whether the ill-treatment suffered by the 250,000 Germans is true or not, no one can believe that this ill-treatment can only be compensated for by the subjugation of 8 million Czechs. Is German policy about to enter a new stage of attempting to rule non-Germanic peoples? The world is now asking this question. Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, the means it used were different from before. The world has now seen a new trick in international negotiations. Germany encourages separatist trends in other countries, not only for the benefit of the separatists, but also for the benefit of the German Empire. This method is quite simple, and in experience, it has been repeatedly verified. Does the world now have a guarantee that this method will not be applied to other countries? All those who border Germany do not know their fate tomorrow. All countries that cherish their national survival and sovereignty are terrified of the danger of being instigated from the outside to cause internal strife. Now, the Romanian government has denied the claim that Germany presented an ultimatum, but is there anything strange about it? The Romanian government and other governments, in light of the events that have occurred in the past few days, all have great hidden concerns. The Foreign Secretary then spoke in detail about the measures to relieve refugees, saying that the British government should do what it can to alleviate the adverse effects of recent events, but its success will depend on the attitude of the German government. The British people have been willing to promote friendship with the German people for the past several years. The British are not unaware of the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles, but in the past few years, whenever there has been an opportunity to seek understanding, the German government has always taken actions that prevent this understanding from proceeding, such as the events of recent months, which are even more so. The ink on the Munich Agreement was not yet dry, and Germany had already taken actions that shocked the world. Britain's initiation of British-German economic cooperation has been cancelled by Germany's actions last week. When can Britain's attempt be resumed? It is still difficult to predict now. The British government has been taught by recent events, so it has immediately engaged in close and practical consultations with the autonomous territories and other relevant governments on obvious issues. History is full of records of attempts to dominate Europe, but they have all ended in tragic failure. If history can be a lesson, then the German people will eventually regret their actions against Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) When Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, he expressed sympathy for the Czech people, saying that twenty years ago, the Czech people, with the support and encouragement of the majority of the world, regained their freedom, and now this freedom has been exploited by violence. The Czech people are known for their patience, courage, and diligence. In their long history, they have lost their independence more than once, but they have never lost their love for freedom. This is the foundation of independence. Therefore, those who saw the establishment of the Czech state after the Great War will today watch it maintain its entire culture and spiritual freedom under this last and most cruel blow.

### Germany Covets Memel; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Returns from Germany, Says Peaceful Resolution Can Be Expected

Memel, the capital of Lithuania: The attitude of the National Socialist Party in Memel is firm, leading to a serious situation. The Lithuanian Parliament convened an emergency meeting this morning, at which time the government will issue its opinion. Since Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin yesterday, political figures in Lithuania have believed that Germany will assist the German Independent Party in Memel. Lithuanian President Smetona and Prime Minister Mironas have both called on Lithuanian youth to strengthen resistance. (Reuters, 21st)

(Berlin) Political figures here are gradually believing that the return of Memel to Germany has been resolved in yesterday's meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister's visit is said to be a ceremonial visit, but he only left after 45 minutes. (Reuters, 21st)

(Berlin) Lithuanian Foreign Minister Ubšys will leave here today to return to his country. He refused to disclose the content of his discussion with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop regarding the issue of national self-determination in Memel. According to well-informed sources, the Memel issue can be "peacefully resolved" in general this week. According to reports from East Prussia, Germany has not made any unusual troop movements on the Lithuanian border. (Associated Press, 20th)

Memel: It is widely rumored here that the Germans in Memel are now planning to make major demands on Lithuania. Although both sides now deny that any conditions have been put forward, it is expected that the Germans will make the following demands: (1) Lithuania should hand over the management rights of transportation facilities such as the Memel post office, telegraph, and railway, as well as the income from Memel port taxes. (2) German officials in Memel who have previously been dismissed should be reinstated and paid back wages. (3) The Lithuanian garrison and border police stationed in the country should be withdrawn. (Reuters, 20th)

### Britain and Poland Seek Political and Economic Cooperation; Talks Underway in Warsaw

Warsaw: British Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson, after arriving here yesterday, immediately held talks with Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Commerce Minister Roman, Finance Minister Kierzkowski, and Deputy Minister of Commerce Lutosławski. Polish officials recently stated that the main issues discussed by both sides were two: (1) Providing Poland with credit loans so that it can purchase industrial machinery from Britain for use in industrial zones. (2) Providing Poland with credit loans so that it can purchase cotton and zinc and copper minerals from India. In addition, Hudson is said to have presented the Polish authorities with a concrete plan for close cooperation between Poland and Britain and France. (Havas, 21st)

### German Newspapers Launch Fierce Attacks on Britain

(Berlin) The rumors of Britain's planned international collective action have recently aroused criticism from German newspapers. The German press said that if one believes that collective threats can deprive Germany of its desire to extend its national power, then one is making a big mistake. (Reuters, 21st)

(Berlin) Today, German newspapers are all engaged in a fierce campaign against democratic countries, especially against Britain, while other news is placed in a secondary position. The lines between the lines in each newspaper are filled with humiliation, injustice, and arguments. In addition to being full of criticism and condemnation, it is also said that democratic countries are currently gathering to form a "terrified alliance" to surround Germany. The amount of space occupied by each newspaper's campaign is rare even in Germany. Almost no space on the front page of each newspaper is devoted to news of Hitler's triumphant return to Berlin. (Reuters, 20th)

### Promulgation of Substitute Legal Orders: France Begins Partial Mobilization; Calling Up Reserves, Increasing Officer Ranks, Boosting Arms Production, and Forming Indigenous Troop Units

(Paris) After French Premier Daladier obtained dictatorial powers, he began a partial mobilization last night. There are sixteen types of orders for this partial mobilization, all of which were first approved by the cabinet and then signed by President Lebrun last night. Thus, France has, in fact, embarked on the path of industrial and military mobilization. Regarding military orders, there are three types, stipulating that the government has the right to mobilize any number of reserve troops in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, according to an army official today, the government will soon mobilize a large number of reserve troops. It is also said that the government's proposed mobilization plan is far more extensive than the one implemented during the Czech crisis last September. Another order is for the recall of reserve officers, with the aim of establishing an officer corps to expand at any time. Another order is to increase the combatants in the Sixth Military Region of the Maginot Line. (United Press, 21st)

(Paris) Substitute legal orders of a military nature were passed by the Council of State yesterday and have now been published by the Official Gazette. The main points are as follows:

(1) 2,500 army officers are added, bringing the total to 31,600. All generals, military police, officers, and officers in charge of arms manufacturing are not included in this calculation. (2) Formation of Moroccan indigenous troops. (3) Some of the conscripts whose active service is expiring may be ordered to remain in service. In addition, reserve soldiers who have retired for less than two years, and reserve soldiers of all ranks, may also be temporarily called into service by the government. (4) When factory owners receive government orders, they should give priority to manufacturing them, and orders from other private individuals may be suspended in whole or in part. (5) The working hours per week for workers in national defense industries are temporarily increased from 40 hours to 60 hours. When necessary, the government may order further increases. (6) A production bureau is established under the Secretariat of the Ministry of National Defense, with the task of (A) increasing the production of various raw materials related to national defense, and (B) supervising the equipment of national defense industry factories and the allocation of required credit loans. (7) All technical and administrative personnel in arms manufacturing factories who have retired may be recalled to service at any time, without any time limit. After being recalled, these personnel should arrive at their posts within eight days. (8) Regarding military intelligence, the disclosure of any information related to the manufacturing and replenishment of domestic ordnance, air defense, and armaments that has not been announced by the government is strictly prohibited. (9) Regarding air defense matters, the procedures for requisitioning property should be simplified. (10) National defense-related industries may obtain advances of up to 650,000,000 francs in case of special needs. (11) The government may prohibit foreigners from residing in fortress areas and near national defense-related locations. (Havas, 21st)

(London) The British government claimed last night that the French army is maintaining extreme secrecy regarding the mobilization of military experts. However, it is believed that this French mobilization is a preliminary step towards mobilizing 20 to 40 divisions of troops in the future. According to British estimates, 60,000 French military experts will be mobilized in accordance with the decree passed by the Daladier cabinet yesterday, along with reserve officers and all sergeants. It is expected that once the new 20 divisions of troops are armed, they will return to their units to await deployment. The total number mobilized by France in September was approximately 120,000. If the European crisis continues to be tense, the total number mobilized by France will have to exceed this by far. (United Press, 21st)

### French Government Holds Military Conference to Discuss North African Defense

(Paris) After the Council of State passed various substitute legal orders, Premier Daladier convened an important meeting at the Ministry of War, attended by Tunisian Resident-General Labonne, Moroccan Resident-General General Noguès, Algerian Governor-General Le Beau, and Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin. (Havas, 20th)

(Paris) It is reported that the meeting discussed plans for transporting soldiers and military equipment across the Mediterranean in the event of war in Europe, and methods for protecting Morocco. (Reuters, 20th)

### Earthquake in Japan

(Tokyo) At 12:23 PM yesterday, strong earthquakes occurred on the two major islands of Kyushu and Shikoku in Japan. It is reported that the areas where the earthquake was most severe were Miyazaki, Kumamoto, Oita, and Tokushima. Most of the houses in the aforementioned areas collapsed, and many power lines were broken. In particular, almost all the glass windows of shops in Miyazaki and other places were shattered. However, the situation regarding casualties is currently unknown. (Express News Agency, 21st)

### Japan-Soviet Buckwheat Industry Dispute to Reopen Negotiations

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that the fisheries issue with Russia can be resolved satisfactorily, and the current situation will not affect the negotiations. Litvinov and Togo will soon resume these negotiations. (20th dispatch)

### Japanese Emperor Opposes Military Alliance with Germany and Italy; Unwilling to Stake the Nation's Fate on a Single Venture; Supervising National Affairs Breaks Royal Precedent

(Tokyo) The 38-year-old Japanese Emperor Hirohito is now disregarding the precedents of the Japanese Imperial Family and is quite active in directing state affairs. In recent weeks, the Emperor has reversed the behavior of his predecessors and his refined character, and has adopted a posture of supervising national affairs. The Emperor is now unwilling to follow the advice of his advisors and is taking responsibility for making various decisions on his own, guiding the progress of the country with a firm hand. The development of this situation is extremely important for the following reasons: (1) This move is sufficient to prevent the stubborn military from dragging Japan into international difficulties. (2) This move prevents Japan from joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy. (3) This move allows Japan to continue its original political system, without becoming a European-style dictatorship. (4) This move shows that the tense relations between Japan and the democratic countries may improve. According to people close to the Imperial Family, the fact that Japan has not yet concluded a military alliance with Germany and Italy is actually due to the personal decision of the Emperor. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima wanted to consider resigning because the government refused to accept his alliance plan. However, it was later learned that the opponent was the Emperor himself, so he had to obey. According to the Japanese political system, the Emperor is the nation, and the nation is the Emperor. Today's Japanese parliament is merely a vent for public opinion, and its role is not important. In practice, the Emperor is a monarch with absolute power. The usual method is for the Emperor to adopt the opinions of the ministers to rule the country. The power of the government has not yet been grasped by the group with the greatest influence on the Emperor. This power is rotated among various oligarchic politicians. Since the start of the war with China, the military has had the greatest power. However, in recent months, the military has lost its power due to not knowing how to properly handle the China Incident, and internal infighting has also occurred. The Emperor is diligent and has an international perspective. From the beginning, he has taken his duties seriously. Before taking the throne, he traveled the world, which was an unprecedented event among Japanese crown princes. Previously, after the rebellion of young officers in February 1936, when the situation deteriorated, he personally came forward to resolve the dispute. He clearly believes that strict and unified leadership is extremely important during this period, so he has grasped even greater power than his grandfather, Emperor Meiji. The Emperor's daring to take such tradition-breaking actions has encountered many difficulties. He cannot directly obtain information and must rely on the reports of various ministers. Although he can summon anyone at any time, he may not be able to fully understand the opinions of all parties. For example, recently, when Army Minister Itagaki met with the Emperor, he originally said that Wu Peifu had agreed to serve as the chairman of the North China Pacification Government. At the time, Itagaki confirmed this as true news, but the subsequent development of the situation proved that Wu did not make this promise. It is reported that Grand Chamberlain Yuasa Kurahei currently holds considerable power. Although he has not received a formal appointment, he has in fact become a senior statesman. The only senior statesman in Japan, Saionji, is too old to fully participate in national affairs. It is reported that Kurahei advocates improving relations with Britain and the United States and opposes concluding a military agreement with Germany and Italy. (United Press, 20th)

### British Government Replies to Japanese Protest Regarding the Treatment of Japanese Residents in Singapore

(London) The Japanese government protested to the British government regarding the alleged mistreatment of Japanese residents in Singapore on January 25. According to the British government's reply, the search of Japanese residents' homes at that time was carried out in accordance with the law. The police have testified that the Japanese residents intended to carry out actions that would damage Singapore and lead to a disruption of peace. Japanese residents in Singapore have not been subjected to any restrictions other than those imposed on residents of other countries. The dispatch asked the Japanese government to compare the defense plans implemented by Singapore's base with the plans implemented by Japan in its own fortified areas, and it will be known that Singapore's plans are more lenient than Japan's. The article also cites several cases of Japanese police monitoring foreigners and rampant espionage as examples. It concluded by saying that the British government hopes that Japanese residents will pay attention to their obligations of residing in British territory, so as to avoid the need for the British authorities to take any further measures. (Reuters, 21st)

### Hungarian-Romanian Relations Tense, Both Sides on Alert at the Border; German Troops Enter Slovak Territory, Motives Unknown, Rumors Abound in the Romanian Capital, People are Panicked

(Budapest) Relations between Hungary and Romania are not very friendly. Both sides are on alert on the border. However, future developments will largely depend on the overall international situation. It is widely believed that Germany may encourage Hungary in its aim in Outer Transylvania, but everything is currently quiet on the eastern border. (Reuters, 21st)

(Berlin) The issue of the Slovak State remains extremely chaotic. According to news from the State, German troops have entered the country and occupied various places, but the German side has denied this in order to appease Poland. In addition, after Hungary occupied Carpathian Ruthenia, it bordered Poland, but due to the winding mountains along the border, transportation is inconvenient, and trade between the two countries is unlikely to develop, let alone military cooperation. It would be more convenient to go through the Slovak State. Although Germany has recognized the border between Poland and Hungary, it is unwilling to allow the Slovak State to become a sphere of influence for these countries. As for the relationship between the Slovak State and Germany, diplomatic circles here are unwilling to disclose anything, but well-informed sources say that the State will establish an alliance relationship with Germany in terms of military affairs and tariffs, and will become an omnipotent state. (Havas, 21st)

(Bucharest) When Romanian King Carol, the Prime Minister, and the General Staff were meeting in the palace today, rumors spread rapidly in the city, and the people were extremely panicked. They hoarded food and other necessities, and those with deposits in banks rushed to withdraw their deposits, fearing any international conflict. A report regarding Hungary massing troops near the Romanian border has not yet been confirmed. According to rumors, German troops crossed Slovakia in four routes and advanced rapidly towards Ruthenia. The reserves of the Second Romanian Army stationed in the Romanian capital may be called into service at any time. It is also reported that the Hungarian radio station broadcasted to the Hungarian minority in Romania that they (referring to the Hungarian minority in Romania) would soon be liberated. It is reported that the Hungarian minority held demonstrations at various points on the Romanian border, but these demonstrations were dispersed by the police. (United Press, 21st)

### Hungary Prepares for War; Mobilization Can Be Completed by the End of the Month

(Budapest) According to reliable sources, the Hungarian military authorities are implementing mobilization in a systematic manner. It is expected that it will be fully completed by around the 28th of this month. At that time, all young men in the country who have not yet served in the military will be called into service, and vacancies in the regular army will be filled one after another. The newly recruited soldiers should be immediately sent to the border and the Carpathian Ruthenia defense zone to serve. So far, the number of Hungarian troops has doubled. The garrisons in the southeastern regions, especially the garrisons in Debrecen (near Romania) and Szeged (near Romania and Yugoslavia), have been strengthened. However, the garrisons in various places are not in wartime formations, presumably to prevent foreign countries from saying that Hungary intends to invade. (Havas, 20th)

(Bucharest) After the Hungarian government took various military measures, responsible officials here expressed surprise and said that our country has done its best to avoid any actions that could be seen as a threat. The recent slight increase in the number of troops stationed in certain border areas and the conscription of certain types of technical personnel were for two reasons: one is that the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the other is that there is war taking place a few miles outside our border (referring to the Hungarian troops entering Carpathian Ruthenia). Previously, some people urged our government to send troops to Carpathian Ruthenia to participate in the war, but the government refused. This shows that we are truly peaceful. It is rather strange that Hungary is now preparing for war near our border. (Havas, 20th)

### German-Romanian Trade Agreement May Be Concluded Soon; German Goods for Crude Oil

(Berlin) Official sources recently published in the official gazette that the German-Romanian economic negotiations taking place in the Romanian capital have yielded concrete results. Business people believe that the economic agreement must stipulate that Romania will increase its crude oil exports to Germany in exchange for German machinery. (Haitong, 21st)

(Bucharest) It is reported that Romania and Germany have almost finalized a limited trade agreement to be signed on Wednesday. It is also reported that this agreement contains more provisions of the nature of a protocol, and will expand the existing treaty. According to the agreement, Romania will only supply Germany with a small amount of kerosene, which has little to do with what was originally requested. (Reuters, 20th)

(Bucharest) From the statement made by the official circle that the Romanian and German delegations are expected to conclude a treaty within this week, it can be inferred that Romania will soon hold important commercial negotiations with Germany. It is expected that the trade agreement concluded last November will be completed by the conclusion of this treaty. It is reported that according to the new treaty, the two countries will increase the direct exchange of goods, because Germany is unable to pay in currency, so there is this saying. In general, Germany will obtain more kerosene from Romania's oil wells to be opened or existing oil sources. Well-informed sources say that the only welcomed purpose of the negotiations is to expand trade between the two friendly countries. Romania's relationship with Hungary remains friendly, and orders have been issued to border troops to avoid any unfortunate incidents. (Reuters, 20th)

### Pittman's New Neutrality Legislation; Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Begin Review Today

(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman submitted a new neutrality bill to Congress yesterday, advocating authorizing the president to take measures to retaliate against aggressor nations. After this bill was introduced, it was opposed by Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, who said that the Pittman bill could easily involve the United States in war. Pittman also admitted this, but said that if this bill were passed during a major war, it would allow democratic countries to gain an advantage. He believes that the "cash and carry" provision would benefit countries that control the seas and provide assistance to Britain and France. The new bill also stipulates that within 30 days after the outbreak of a war, whether declared or undeclared, the US president has the right to declare the countries involved. After this declaration is issued, if US ships transport passengers or goods to any declared country, regardless of whether the transportation method is direct or indirect, it will be considered illegal. Pittman went on to say that he believes that once this bill is passed, it will often be implemented in the Sino-Japanese war. (United Press, 21st)

(Washington) Assistant Secretary of State Welles today endorsed the introduction of Senator Pittman's neutrality bill, calling it a step towards legality. The Civil Aeronautics Board is now asking Congress to appropriate $7.3 million to train civilian aviation pilots. At the same time, a bill was also introduced in the House today, advocating the implementation of the War Department's request for $272,000,000 to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal. (Reuters, 21st)

### Amidst Japan's Southward Advance Policy: The New Situation in the Pacific - The Democratic Bloc Intensifies Efforts to Address Future Wars - German-Japanese Secret Agreement Seeks Hegemony in Eurasia

Special Correspondence from Hong Kong: The turmoil in the Pacific did not begin today. Over the past seven or eight years, China has been the first to fully play the role of a lamb to the aggressors in the Far East, transforming from a lamb into a fierce tiger during the War of Resistance. However, major powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands have consistently sought temporary ease through appeasement and retreat, causing the aggressors' power to expand day by day, and the crisis in the Pacific to deepen day by day. Now, the aggressors' blades are not only directed at China, but also directly threaten all peaceful nations in the Pacific. Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can no longer seek temporary ease through appeasement, and any further concessions to the aggressors would be tantamount to suicide. This is easily understood. Japan's only way out today is southward expansion. Southward expansion can stimulate domestic morale and cover up the failures of its operations in China; it can threaten Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to seize the colonial territories of white nations in the Far East; it can coordinate with Germany and Italy's intimidation policies to carry out the common goals of the anti-communist bloc. Apart from southward expansion, what other path is there? Because the war against China has reached an impasse, it has no choice but to shift its political and military strategies, from defending in the south and attacking in the north to defending in the north and attacking in the south, from being pro-British and anti-Soviet to being simultaneously anti-British, anti-French, and anti-Soviet. In other words, it is shifting from a continental offensive to a two-pronged approach of both continental and naval offensives. Before this new policy was decided, it underwent several tests. The landing in Xiamen in May of last year and the occupation of Guangzhou in October were both aimed at testing the reactions of Britain and France. The result was the opposite of the Zhanggufeng Incident; Britain and France softened their stance, and the test was fortunately successful. Thus, on November 3rd of last year, Konoe announced the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," followed by the continuous concentration of the navy in South China. The recent landing on Hainan Island proves that the southward advance policy has become actively realized. After landing on Hainan Island, Japan immediately proceeded to establish naval and air force bases in Qiongyai, and dispatched experts from Japan to inspect Hainan, demonstrating Japan's intention to permanently occupy it. At the same time, Japan also used its air force to bomb British territory in Kowloon and the New Territories. Japanese Naval Minister Yonai announced that in addition to continuing the 800 million yen naval construction plan that began the previous year, he would specifically request an additional naval construction budget from the parliament at the end of February to compete with Britain and the United States.

French Newspaper Reveals German-Japanese Secret Agreement

Closely related to this southward advance policy are the secret military negotiations that Germany and Japan have been conducting in recent months. It is very clear that Hitler needs Japan to hold back Britain and France in the Far East, just as he needs Fascist Italy to hold back Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Only in this way can Germany greatly extort Britain and France, even more than it did in Munich. However, what tricks the two Fascist countries are playing is currently shrouded in secrecy. Only the French weekly magazine revealed a little information on January 25th, claiming that Germany and Japan signed a secret agreement in Tokyo on November 20th of last year, which stipulated: (1) If Japan is drawn into a new war due to the China Incident, Germany will provide full assistance to Japan with its army, navy, and air force. (2) Within Chinese territory, wherever Japan enjoys economic privileges, Germany will also enjoy the same rights. Germany will also have the right to dispatch technical and military advisors to the "New China" government. (3) If Sakhalin Island and the Soviet Far East territory are placed under Japanese jurisdiction, Germany should be granted concession rights. (4) Germany may restore its pre-war colonies in the Pacific, but only if it does not harm Japan's strategic security. This is the first part of the secret agreement. The second part stipulates the partition of the Malay colonies, with Germany occupying Dutch New Guinea, the western part of Madura Island, the southern part of Celebes Island, Dutch West Indies Suriname, and British Borneo. However, the British Malay Peninsula up to Singapore, Siam, and the rest of the Dutch East Indies are all designated as Japan's sphere of influence. The secret agreement does not mention the division of the Philippines, Hawaii, Vietnam, India, or Burma, supposedly because they are being reserved for Italy to join the German-Japanese secret agreement and redistribute them. Although this is an unconfirmed report, the fact that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita repeatedly advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact at the 74th Diet session, the fact that Germany is preparing to make a new threat to Britain and France regarding colonies in March, and the fact that Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands are actively expanding their military preparations in the Far East all indicate that the news of Germany and Japan partitioning the Pacific colonies is not entirely groundless. Naturally, these provocative acts by Fascist countries are mostly motivated by intimidation at present, because Germany is unwilling to easily launch a war without the certainty of victory. Japan's main intention at present is still to conquer China and has no immediate determination to attack Britain and the United States. However, when a robber encounters someone pointing a loaded gun at him, who can guarantee that danger will not arise? Today it is intimidation, tomorrow it may be war. In short, the towering waves in the Pacific have already been stirred up.

The Far East Situation Affects Europe and America Naturally, all peaceful countries in the Pacific must unite to impose military, economic, and moral sanctions on the aggressors. In this way, there may still be a glimmer of hope for saving peace in the Far East. However, before a major war breaks out in the Pacific, such sanctions are hardly possible. The rulers of the Pacific countries are now thinking about how to launch or how to cope with a future major war in the Pacific, rather than how to promote collective security and peace in the Pacific. As mentioned above, the three countries participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact—Germany, Japan, and Italy—are planning to divide the colonies of white nations in the Pacific, among which Japan is naturally the vanguard of aggression in the Far East. After the landing on Hainan Island, the country ostensibly most threatened is French Vietnam, but this is only for political and strategic needs. Japan only provokes France, as France is the weaker colonial power in the Far East. Vietnam borders China's southwest anti-Japanese base area, and directly threatening Vietnam is equivalent to tightening the blockade of China and indirectly threatening Britain. However, the real target of Japanese aggression is not French Vietnam, but the British Malay Federation, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia. The rubber and oil needed by Japanese industry and its ideal population resettlement areas are all in Southeast Asia, while the iron in the Philippines and the abundant minerals and wool in Australia are the main objects of Japanese aggression. In addition, Fascist aggressors also intend to use Siam as an important base for attacking British and French territories. Siamese Prime Minister Pibul publicly announced his admiration for Hitler and Mussolini in a radio speech last year. Recently, the German Wehrmacht's official newspaper also said, "If Siam forms an alliance with Japan, the security of French Vietnam will be completely destroyed." If Siam becomes the Hungary of Asia, not only will Vietnam be lost, but Burma and Singapore will also be in danger of being invaded at any time. Under the encirclement of Japan's southward advance policy and the Fascist bloc's aggression plot, the colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands are already under the blade. What policies will Britain, France, and the Netherlands take to protect the security of their territories in the Pacific?

Sincere Cooperation Between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union

Although Chamberlain's diplomacy only knew how to make concessions to aggressors, both in the West and in the East, he has recently begun to realize that peace must be maintained by force. If the British Empire uses force to maintain peace, and does not maintain peace by sacrificing small countries, peace can still be maintained. In order to jointly deal with international thugs, Britain will certainly be able to obtain the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union, especially China in the War of Resistance, which is the largest pillar of peace in the Far East. The British government will sooner or later understand this point: only by supporting China's War of Resistance with all its strength and sanctioning Japanese aggression can it preserve its vast colonies in the Far East. Even if it does not understand it now, reality will teach Chamberlain to understand. As for France's Far East policy, it is making the same mistake as its Spanish policy, trying to avoid the storm under the broken umbrella of "neutrality," resulting in only benefiting the aggressors. Now that Vietnam is surrounded on three sides by aggressors, France is actively strengthening its land, sea, and air defenses in the Far East. Cam Ranh Bay, opposite Hainan Island, is being built into a first-class naval port. Undoubtedly, France's Far East policy will be strengthened following Britain's. As for the Netherlands, it cannot but rely on Britain militarily. Only recently has The Hague passed a large-scale naval construction plan, which is a bit late, but not too late. Roosevelt's Far East policy is completely correct. In recent months, he has delivered many anti-aggression speeches and established the foundation for a Pan-American anti-aggression front in Lima. He submitted a plan to Congress for the defense of Guam and a new four-year military expansion budget. Roosevelt has already seen that the sword of the Fascist aggressors has not yet touched the United States, so the isolationists controlled by the plutocrats still retain some power. However, it can be determined that the United States' Pacific policy will eventually abandon isolationism and adopt a more ambitious anti-aggression line. As Japan's aggression shifts from northward to southward, the Soviet Union's position in the Far East is strengthening day by day. But at present, the lever of the Pacific problem is China. Precisely because China is fighting for democracy and peace, the various ethnic groups in the Pacific will enjoy democracy and peace because of China's victory in the War of Resistance. The Pacific problem was directly caused by Japan's destruction of China's territorial integrity, and it will only be resolved lastingly and reasonably after China recovers its lost territories.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Establish a Shipping Administration Bureau, Branch Offices to Be Set Up in Various Locations

Correspondence from Jinhua: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that the province is located in a coastal area with crisscrossing rivers, numerous ports, and a total of 44,000 ships of various types of water transport, but with no established management agency, proposed a resolution at the Provincial Government Committee meeting to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Shipping Administration Bureau. Wei Sicheng, Director of the Highway Administration Bureau, was transferred to be the Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, and Wang Wenhan was appointed to fill the vacancy left by Wei as Director of the Highway Administration Bureau. Wei is scheduled to hand over his duties on the 15th of this month and then begin preparing for the organization. For the convenience of centralized management, the bureau's location will be set in Jinhua. Under the Director, there will be three sections: General Affairs, Management, and Engineering, as well as an Accounting Office. Five branch offices will be established under these sections, located in Oujiang, Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, Cao'ejiang, and Fuchunjiang, with locations in Yongjia, Linhai, Yin County, Baiguan, and Lanxi, respectively. Wei plans to depart and inspect along the various rivers to formulate a strict management plan.

### Puppet Principal in Qingpu Assassinated and Injured

Correspondence from Qingpu: On the 15th, Jin Honggao of the First Brigade of the Qingpu Puppet Police held his wedding at his residence on Beimenwai Street. Big and small traitors all went to congratulate him. The puppet police, in order to prevent any incidents, were concentrated in the area of ​​Haimen Bridge and Xu Jing Road, tightening security. At about 4:00 PM, Xu Zhengquan, the puppet county middle school principal and principal of the Qingpu Model Elementary School in the city, was shot and injured outside the school gate. The school gatekeeper heard the noise and went outside, but the shooter had already disappeared. Although the puppet police immediately searched the vicinity, they found no clues. Xu came to Shanghai the morning before yesterday for diagnosis and treatment.

### Japanese Troops in Huaihai Lose Contact, Chinese Army Recovers Shuyang, Han Deqin Convenes Military Conference, Fierce Battles in Zhaoguan Dam and Lianshui

Correspondence from Taixian: After the Japanese troops in Yanshao, northern Jiangsu, suffered a disastrous defeat in their previous attack on Haguan Dam, they attempted to attack again on the 14th, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the area of ​​Zhaoguan Dam and Qiuyu Ditch. The fighting continued until the morning of the 15th, and the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. On the 15th, five civilian boats were sealed off, loaded with Japanese corpses and dead horses, and sent back to Yangzhou City. An elite unit of a certain department of the Chinese army on the northern route went straight to Shuyang County, heavily surrounding the Japanese troops in the city. The Japanese stubbornly resisted with superior weapons, but the Chinese army bravely charged and killed, with one soldier being as good as a hundred. The Japanese troops were unable to hold on and were charged into the city by the Chinese army on the evening of the 13th, taking advantage of the victory to sweep the area, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers, with corpses strewn everywhere. Few escaped. The county town was recovered, which was enough to cut off the contact line of the Japanese troops in Huaihai, which is of great military significance. The Chinese army is still actively advancing forward, and there will be new developments in the coming days.

Another Dispatch: Since the fall of Huaiyin, Provincial Chairman Han Deqin convened a military conference the day before yesterday. In addition to the officers of the Yu and Miao departments and the Tax Police Corps, the attendees also included Zhu Aizhou, Magistrate of Siyang County, Hong Jiazou, Magistrate of Liuhe County, and Dai Zhiqiang, Magistrate of Yizheng County. They discussed the equipping of troops and the planning of military provisions in detail, and decided that in the shortest possible time, all units would launch a counterattack simultaneously. After the Japanese troops retreated from Huaiyin County, they arrived at Chenjiaji along the Grand Canal, where they were drenched in heavy rain and were in a very embarrassed state. Military vehicles were trapped in the mud. A Chinese army detachment took a shortcut and suddenly surrounded and attacked the embarrassed Japanese troops, causing many casualties. After Funing was captured by the Chinese army, 2,000 Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in Fangshan Town, north of Lianshui. Japanese planes bombed the areas of Huaiyin, Funing, Yangzhai Town, Goudun, Wuxin Port, and along the Guanhe and Sheyanghe Rivers for days, causing them to become mostly scorched earth, and many innocent civilians were killed and injured.

### The Adaptability of All Things

— Chen Dong

All changes in the world can be said to be for adapting to the environment. If a person feels hungry, they eat food; if they feel cold, they wear clothes; if they are invaded by germs, their body either develops a fever or their white blood cell count increases. Animals often have camouflage colors to prevent enemies from discovering them. Camels have water sacs in their stomachs because they live in dry places. Plants often have hard-shelled fruits or thorny branches to defend themselves. These are all abilities endowed by nature to the biological world to adapt to the environment.

But strangely enough, even non-living things are endowed with a kind of adaptability. If a person twists a rubber band with their hand, it generates a resistance force. When the hand is released, the rubber band returns to its original shape. This is what we commonly call elasticity. Lengthening and compression have the same result. If we tightly compress a snowball, the snowball shrinks its volume in order to reduce the pressure it receives, so part of the snow melts into water because water has a smaller volume. But if the pressure is suddenly released, the water immediately freezes into a larger volume of ice. When a lever bears a heavy object, it is subjected to pressure. In order to adapt to the environment, the lever bends. Because of the bending, the upper part of the lever lengthens, exerting its tensile force, while the lower part shortens, exerting its compressive force, creating a pair of internal force couples to balance the moment of the external pressure.

The above examples illustrate that all things can adapt to the environment and undergo change. Therefore, when humans are subjected to external aggression and rise up in resistance, it is nothing more than a natural response.

### In Defense of Scientists

— Shuichang

Since the World War, we have often heard general criticism from society: saying that scientists have committed sins by inventing various lethal weapons for the use of ambitious people, resulting in a situation where "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones are left to rot." In recent years, with many people in East Asia and Western Europe suffering great sacrifices, subjected to the carnage of airplanes, artillery, bombs, and machine guns, the voices blaming scientists have become louder year by year. But these are all temporary emotional reactions that have clouded reason. Many people believe that scientists should bear a kind of responsibility for inventing something new; that they need to prevent knowledge and methods that may be used for killing beforehand; or that they should keep secrets strictly after invention and absolutely not allow others to use them. According to this, our ancient sage Suiren, who invented drilling wood to make fire, committed many sins. He should have foreseen that later people would use fire to kill, and that there would be fire attacks in later tactics, so he shouldn't have drilled any wood.

The Yellow Emperor invented the chariot, initially pulled by oxen, and later pulled by horses. When two countries fought each other, chariots occupied a very important position. The ancients also said: "The great use of the Rong (barbarians) lies in horses," so Emperor Gaozu of Han had the heroic words "I obtained the world on horseback." It can be seen that chariots and horses were both necessary things for warfare before the 20th century. Chariots should not have been invented in the first place, and horses should not have been domesticated. In ancient times, metal was cast into blades. Blades refer to swords, spears, halberds, and arrows, which can be said to be murderous weapons. Gold is a metal, initially copper, later iron, and finally steel. These metals should not have been invented either.

In the Stone Age, humans used stones as weapons. When everyone learned to use them, in order to resist and survive, they invented the use of bows and arrows. Later, they felt that bows and arrows were not lethal enough, so they invented firearms, such as rockets and fire guns. One step further is the modern gun. Who can say that in the defense against foreign insults, we should not exhaust our efforts to think of various methods of self-defense? If someone said, "We have umbrellas, so it rains in the world," everyone would definitely call him crazy. Then, aren't those who blame scientists and criticize material civilization committing the same mistake?

People who criticize science also insist that modern airplanes and artillery are indeed the crystallization of science. May I ask, what is the difference between creating airplanes for transportation and traffic convenience and the Yellow Emperor making chariots? What is the difference between inventing explosives for opening up mountain mines and subduing fierce beasts and Suiren making fire? Are scientific inventions more beneficial to mankind or more harmful to mankind? Even if scientists are scapegoats, confessing to various unfounded crimes of murder and arson under duress, I'm afraid that when merits and demerits are weighed together, the merits already outweigh the demerits.

Weapons can never be forcibly divided into two types: one for self-defense and one for attacking. Only talking about self-defense without talking about attacking is passive resistance. But absolute passive resistance does not exist. The work of resisting aggression must seek relatively effective methods and strengths of retaliation in order to be sure of success.

In short, scientists can never foresee whether an invention will have improper applications, nor can they prevent an invention from being used by unscrupulous people to do evil. And sometimes, even knowing that an invention may not be beneficial to mankind, because of the special circumstances of the environment, they cannot but strive to proceed. Critics must abandon their subjective attitudes in order to be fair.

### Scientific Anecdotes

— Ji Qian

Great King

Snakes are cold-blooded animals, belonging to reptiles. In the animal kingdom, they are located below birds and above amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders, etc. all belong to this category). Anyone with a little biological knowledge can say this. However, because our country's science is backward, not only ignorant villagers regard them as divine objects, but even scholar-officials worship them, which is both ridiculous and pitiful. For example, there are several kinds of water snakes in the Yellow River, all of which are small in size. The residents believe they are river gods and call them Great Kings. The external structures of snakes differ from each other, so there are various names for the Great Kings, such as the Yellow Great King, the Chestnut Great King, and the Golden Dragon Great King, which appear from time to time. Snakes also have amphibious habits, sometimes living in water and sometimes on land. Occasionally, they move from the river to the shore, where they are seen by residents, who believe that the Great King has appeared. They must report it to the local officials, who send people to respectfully greet it, place it on a jade plate, cover it with yellow silk, and offer incense and flowers for worship in a special shrine, performing operas and praying for it. Men and women prostrate themselves and worship it in an endless stream. After a few days, the snake disappears without a trace, believing that the Great King has ascended. Officials and commoners are apprehensive, fearing that if their piety is not complete, the Great King will be angry and the Yellow River will burst its banks. Once, a Great King appeared and was welcomed into the temple. The offering of opera was in full swing, and the incense was at its peak when it withered and died in the plate. The officials were all shocked and didn't know what to do, so they summoned the boatmen on the river who specialized in welcoming the Great Kings to inquire. The boatman bowed to the officials and congratulated them, saying, "This is very auspicious. When a Great King sheds its robe, the magistrate will have the joy of promotion." So everyone rejoiced and sent the Great King's remains back to the Yellow River.

General

If the snakes in the Yellow River are Great Kings, then the lizards there are also raised up to be called Generals. Lizards are also one of the reptiles, cold-blooded animals, and are more closely related to crocodiles and turtles. Lizards appear in the Yellow River water and on the shore from time to time, and the residents are also devout in their worship, but not as grand as the ceremonies for offering to the Great King.

Biting a Fox

The theory of fox spirits is deeply believed by a group of ignorant people. Foxes are mammals, belonging to the canidae family in zoology. There are various types, such as the red fox, the blue fox, the silver fox, and the gray fox. Their skins are all valuable. Foxes are the most cunning in nature. Novels often say that they can become immortals. The people of our country lack scientific knowledge and actually believe it is true. In a certain place, there was a horse pen where a groom lived. At night, a fox entered and exited his room. The groom was greatly frightened, suspecting that he was being haunted, and developed a heart disease. The fox also liked to be close to him, so he had many nightmarish dreams, and his illness became more serious day by day, eventually leading to death. The master pitied his poverty and let his younger brother succeed him, but his younger brother also died. So this horse pen became a haunted house, and no one dared to enter it. Later, an old man took the job of grazing the horses. The old man was honest and didn't believe in ghosts or foxes, thinking that fox skins could be used to make fur coats and fox meat could be eaten, so he should catch and cook it to satisfy his stomach. One day, the old man fell asleep, and the fox came to his side, close to his mouth. The old man suddenly bit it, and the fox screamed and fled, with its fur falling off, ink on its teeth, and fresh blood dripping, staining the pillow, and his illness was cured.

### Radio Waves to Be Disrupted by Solar Cataclysm

Prediction by Italian Seismologist - 25th and 26th of This Month

The appearance of sunspots occurs in a cycle of approximately every eleven years, and it seems that it is reaching its peak intensity within these one or two years, which is what is meant by the so-called solar cataclysm.

According to a report from the Rome Stefani News Agency, seismologist Benddani claims that "a violent solar cataclysm, with an intensity similar to that of last September, is unavoidable. Our Earth will encounter terrible repercussions, especially in disrupting the balance of electromagnetism and radio communications. This disruption will be widespread throughout the world. Shortwave radio will be severely affected, and reception will be impossible on March 25th and 26th." He also said, "Anyone with a shortwave radio can easily detect this phenomenon by tuning between 15 meters and 25 meters. In addition to radio interference, there will also be magnetic storm phenomena and auroras."

### Heavy!

— (Jin Wu)

Nothing in the world is as heavy as the core of a planet. If your watch were proportionally as heavy to that degree, it would weigh almost a ton and could not be carried. If you put it on the table, it would break the table.

Scientists say that the cores of some planets are so heavy because the material that makes up the core of the planet is much denser than the material on our Earth. In other words, the gaps in that material are extremely small. If you compacted the material that makes up a 180-pound human body so that there were absolutely no gaps inside, then that person would be as small as a pinhead! But this pinhead-sized person would weigh 180 pounds.

### Storing Military Supplies Underwater

— Yu Shang

Military supplies stored in these giant containers, submerged in water, can avoid enemy aircraft bombing.

Gasoline and food, etc., are extremely important during wartime. They can be stored in giant containers, sunk in lakes or riverbeds one hundred feet or deeper, making them invisible to enemy bombers. This is the conclusion reached by the Swiss authorities after conducting several experiments in Lake Thun. During the experiment, a container with a capacity of 12,000 gallons was sunk to a depth of one hundred feet; according to scouts, when aircraft searched from an altitude of over three thousand feet, they could not see any trace of it. Engineers are now planning to use specially designed rafts to quickly raise and lower the containers.

The Mother of Airplanes

The ancients said that dragonflies have six legs and four wings, soaring between heaven and earth. Is it possible that today's airplanes took their shape from this? Half a century ago, Professor Langley of the United States, a venerable figure in physics, paid attention to this and devoted his life to studying the art of flying, wanting to create a machine to travel through the clouds. When he studied this art, those who heard of it ridiculed him, thinking it was absolutely impossible. By the time his machine was built, after repeated trials, it was actually able to take off and be controlled, so he demonstrated it to the public. At that time, the viewers were as crowded as walls, all wanting to see what they had never seen before. Unfortunately, the machine he created was relatively heavy, and the pilot was also careless for a moment. As soon as it took off, it crashed into a ship's mast on the river, the fuselage was shattered, and the pilot fell into the river. The audience burst into laughter, and newspapers reported it as a joke. He was nearly seventy years old at the time, and after this failure, he was depressed and soon died of illness. His disciples and old friends all mourned him. However, the principles he published were accurate and indelible, except that his machine was initially made and not as convenient and sophisticated as those of modern times. Later, the Wright brothers devoted themselves to this study, based entirely on Langley's theories, improved and built, and then a new type of aircraft was born; those who followed continued to improve, and the American aircraft manufacturing industry grew stronger day by day. At the end of the European War, the United States joined the war and launched a large-scale training of the air force, with countless airfields in the country, and its largest general airfield was named after Langley (Langley Field) to commemorate his pioneering work. Therefore, although he was unfortunate in his lifetime, he enjoyed great fame after his death, which is enough to comfort those who have worked hard and whose fates have been frustrated.

Ship for Geomagnetic Research

The Earth is a large magnet, and the Earth's surface is a large magnetic field. The magnetic field strength and direction vary from place to place, so it is necessary to measure it from time to time and draw a geomagnetic map for navigators to use. Britain is currently building a ship for measuring geomagnetism, costing 100,000 pounds, named "Research," which will be completed soon. This ship is built entirely of non-magnetic materials. The hull is made of chestnut wood, and the framework and beams are made of bronze or other non-magnetic alloys. Anchors, cables, and all screws are made of bronze, and even kitchen utensils are not made of iron. No crew member is allowed to carry a steel paper cutter. Although the ship is equipped with a heavy oil engine, most of the sailing relies on sails. The displacement is 650 tons, and with enough fuel, it can travel 2,000 miles at a speed of 6 nautical miles per hour. The ship can accommodate 31 crew members and researchers.

This "Research" is the second non-magnetic ship in the world. The first was the American "Carnegie," which was bombed and destroyed in the Samoan Islands in 1929; she had done 25 years of geomagnetic survey work and made a great contribution to countries all over the world.

Rubber Made from Tomatoes

It is said that Italian chemist Dr. Manri has announced that he has completed a secret method to make a natural rubber substitute from tomato skins. Using this method, 400 tons of tomatoes are needed to make one ton of artificial rubber. However, Italy's annual tomato production is only 400,000 tons, so it can only produce 1,000 tons of "rubber," which is very little, only about one-eighth hundredth of the world's total annual natural rubber production.

### Manjusri and Samantabhadra

— Passerby under the Bridge

Manjusri Bodhisattva and Samantabhadra Bodhisattva are two bodhisattvas. The relationship between bodhisattvas and human life is a fact that cannot be denied now. If you want to relate bodhisattvas to science, I am afraid that the science bosses will be fiercely angry, and the intellectuals will have to curse Amitabha Buddha. Only the abbot will put his hands together and say, good, good, and take the plane. However, Manjusri and Samantabhadra not only still have a relationship with our lives today, but also have a relationship with science precisely because it has come to this day. Which branch of science is related? Genetics, gynecology, obstetrics. Could it be that bodhisattvas keep sons? Oh! This is a great misunderstanding.

When people get married, Manjusri and Samantabhadra are more respected than the officiant, witness, and introducer. They are placed in the center of the hall early, and the guests have to kneel or bow to them. Now you understand, it turns out that this is the so-called harmony. Of course, it is very common to forget one's ancestors, and the old historical basis is waiting for Dr. Hu. Now we only know the meaning of offering harmony, perhaps taking its harmony and union. But the problem arises from here. Are they—Manjusri and Samantabhadra—still husband and wife or monk and nun, or brother and sister? So, using scientific magic weapons and rhetorical means, it may be asserted that they are either sisters or brothers, and there is no other possibility. The origin of this assertion is like this: we first assume that harmony and union are the characteristics of the two people from legends, and secondly, we see that the embroidered portraits on the offering axis have exactly the same appearance and figure. So, according to medical research, they are obviously twins, and they are twins from the same womb. It turns out that twins in the same womb not only have the same appearance and figure, but also the same gender and the same temperament, getting along with each other in perfect harmony. No wonder one becomes a monk and the other also becomes a monk. As for twins with different wombs, that is, twins with two wombs, their gender does not have to be the same, and their temperament does not have to be the same. They often hate and envy each other. According to obstetrical statistics, on average, there is one case of twins out of every eighty births, although it does not have to be twins from the same womb, but it can be determined that there must have been more than one pair of Manjusri and Samantabhadra from ancient times to the present. However, only Manjusri and Samantabhadra participate in weddings in the name of harmony. Why is this so? I think Mencius' words can be borrowed: Zhou's wickedness is not so great; Zhou can represent all bad things and all bad people. This is the emperor's position that made him so. Manjusri and Samantabhadra became bodhisattvas, and their position is not necessarily below the emperor. They represent all fraternal twins. It is possible. So, why do we worship twins as idols? Because twins are relatively rare, rare things are often regarded by people as special magic power, so they are revered and idolized. This is the same at home and abroad. Harmony is a relic of the worship of twins, and this point is probably not wrong.

Today, genetics is advancing and taking the study of twins as one of the important bases, and conception and childbirth belong to the scope of obstetrics and gynecology, making Manjusri and Samantabhadra wear cassocks on the outside and swallowtails on the inside, which are all driven by the times, which is also unique and gratifying.

### Land Sailing

— Da Xing

Even if you are a novice cyclist, you should have experienced the power of headwinds. If the wind is a little strong, you must spend a lot of effort to step forward. If the wind is even stronger, you will feel like you cannot move forward. At that time, you have to dismount, pull the horse forward, and shout repeatedly: "Tiring me! Tiring me!"

However, if it is a tailwind, then you don't have to work hard. The wind will push your back and head straight for Sunjia Village, and you will shout repeatedly: "How pleasant this wind is!"

Now, a slight push on the back is enough for you to ride the wind and waves; if you raise a sail on the car, wouldn't it be even faster? Two teenagers in Florida, USA, did just that, and as a result, they actually realized the miracle of land sailing. This photo was taken when they passed through a street in Miami.

Third Plenary Session on the Fourth Day General Assembly Continues to Report

March 4th was the fourth day of the Third National Education Conference. The third plenary session was held at 8:00 AM, and group meetings were held in the afternoon.

Chairman Chiang Attends the Meeting and Delivers a Speech

The reports on this day were limited to six minutes each. At five minutes, a bell rang to indicate a preview, so the reports ended quickly. After a ten-minute break, it was already 11:00 AM. President Chiang, wearing a grass-green military uniform, arrived with a smile on his face. Everyone stood up to show their respect. The President nodded to the crowd and said, "Please sit down." He then began his speech, first describing the history of the education conference. This meeting has been eight years since the second meeting. Its mission is great, and it is responsible for saving the country and building the country. This means that we must identify a clear goal in education. We should take the Three People's Principles of revolutionary national salvation as the highest standard of education in our country and create a new life for a modern country. The vitality of a modern country is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it can also be said that education is the hub connecting the economy and military force. Therefore, we must take developing the economy and strengthening the military force as the direction of our education. Currently, the most heatedly debated issue in education is the issue of wartime education and peacetime education. I often say, "Peacetime should be regarded as wartime, and wartime should be regarded as peacetime." I also often say, "Wartime life is modern life. In the present era, whether it is an individual or a society, if it does not practice wartime life, it cannot exist and will be eliminated and destroyed." If we understand this meaning, then there is no need for the so-called debate between peacetime education and wartime education.

In order to adapt to the needs of today and conform to the environment of today, we should use the methods of extraordinary times to achieve the original purpose of education, use extraordinary spirit to expand the effect of education, such as our schools at all levels at this time should strive for equipment economy, simple and hard living, and the example of the ancients drawing reeds to teach their children, and catching fireflies to reflect the snow, can be used to inspire and encourage us. In short, do not forget that wartime should be regarded as peacetime, and do not abandon the basics for the sake of emergency. Regarding all specific programs in education, I will not discuss them one by one, but I hope that you will focus on the most basic point, that is, to strengthen the will of our people nationwide and establish our spirit of actively building the country, especially to improve the inherent morality of our nation at all times. We all know that our country is a country lacking in material conditions. In this dangerous and difficult autumn, we should shoulder this extraordinary and huge responsibility. If we do not overcome material goods with spirit, it will not be easy to survive. If we do not use the inherent morality and revolutionary spirit of our nation, if we do not generate this power and create materials through this spirit, it will not be easy to achieve the success of building the country. I believe that as of today, the life of all educators should no longer be like the past, teaching behind closed doors and enjoying a leisurely life. Educators should not only transmit knowledge according to the curriculum and regard it as a basis for personal life or a private career. Today's educators should recognize themselves as soldiers who break through the enemy's defenses, as social mentors who change customs, as pioneers who overcome difficulties, and as sages and heroes who continue the lost and preserve the extinct. We can no longer agree with the past misunderstanding of the independence of education and become an isolated group. Today, when we talk about education, we should integrate education with military, political, social, and economic undertakings.

We should create students who have the awareness and ability to defend the country, defend themselves, and govern the country themselves. We must implement what is said in the Book of Rites, "To be a teacher and then to be a leader", and integrate with politics and society to take responsibility for organizing the people. The ancients said, "Observe each other and do good." How can educators bear to see the ignorance and suffering of the general public in society? I especially need to root in the needs of national economic construction, teach the people to value labor and be able to produce, and especially encourage creativity. All education plans should be coordinated with economic plans, and then our education can become a factor in creating the vitality of a modern country. He then encouraged three things. The first thing is to recognize the meaning of respecting teachers and valuing education, and set an example for young people to influence the people. The second thing is to cultivate national personality standards, and take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor as the common school motto for schools at all levels. The third thing is to unify the trend, concentrate the goals, and strive to realize the Three People's Principles. Finally, I hope that my colleagues in the education sector will be self-reliant, respect themselves, be focused and consistent, and contribute their lives to the great cause of educating the country. (Editor's note: The original text of Chairman Chiang's speech has been published in this newspaper on March 5th.)

Chairman Lin and Others Entertain Members

At 2:30 PM, the review meetings of each group continued. At 4:30 PM, they went to Chairman Lin of the National Government's tea party. Chairman Lin had high hopes for the education conference. "Creating human villages" was the central meaning of his speech. Vice Chairman Chiang took education as a part of politics, and in the future, he should follow the training and handle education as a response. The tea party was elegantly decorated and was all made in China. The most notable thing was the colorful porcelain bowls and dishes. Chongqing has this, which can be said to be a valuable item. In the evening, Minister Ye Chucang of the Propaganda Department hosted a banquet at the Guotai Restaurant. Many of those invited were directors of education.

### Board of Directors Meeting of Zhengfeng Middle School

Zhengfeng Middle School, located at No. 60 West Yanan Road in this city, is known for its diligent management and thriving school affairs. Recently, a board of directors meeting was held at the Da San Xing Restaurant. Over a dozen board members attended, including Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Du Zuozhou, Hu Cuishi, Dai Chunfeng, and Wei Dunyi. Principal Wei Dunyi reported on all aspects of the current semester. The budget for the current semester was approved.

### British Businesses Lodge Strong Protest Against Japanese Puppet Regime's Currency Control, Believing That Japanese Puppets Discriminate Against British Interests, Favoring Japanese Financial Monopoly, Protest Letter Issued by British Chamber of Commerce in the Form of a Announcement

The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce lodged a strong protest against the "Provisional Government's" implementation of the new currency regulations in North China. The protest was issued in the form of an announcement by the Chairman of the Chamber, Sir Marshal, expressing the Chamber's views, stating that this new method was indeed discriminatory against British interests and the most heinous attack on the "Open Door" policy. According to the announcement, on the 11th of this month, the "North China Provisional Government" promulgated currency control regulations, which have been implemented in all important cities and ports controlled by the Japanese army in North China, including Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei. These regulations intend to force the use of "United Reserve" banknotes, which are linked to the Japanese yen, have no adequate reserve as backing, and have no value in foreign exchange. In order to establish the circulation of "United Reserve" currency, the customs prohibits the export of certain goods, including the main export products of North China, must be processed by the Yokohama Specie Bank at the "United Reserve Bank's" exchange rate of fourteen pence before they can be transported out. This regulation automatically establishes a financial monopoly that favors Japanese banks. If commerce can continue on this basis, it will be providing foreign exchange backed by the "United Reserve Bank" currency, which is insufficient to guarantee. The only result of this attempt to stabilize the "United Reserve" currency will be to halt general trade, and may even cause many foreign commercial firms to close down, because foreign merchants cannot operate with currencies that cannot be freely exchanged for foreign exchange. As for the Japanese, their position is slightly different, because they trade with "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, accepting this kind of banknote can purchase supplementary goods from Japan. These regulations will first affect the exporters of Chinese products, but importers of foreign goods (excluding Japanese goods) will soon be affected as well. It is not guaranteed that even if foreign exchange is obtained through exports, it can be used to pay for import prices. As a result, the amount of all imported goods other than Japanese goods will be reduced immediately. Furthermore, even if importers can obtain some foreign exchange, it is difficult to allocate it due to insufficient exchange, and they will be manipulated by the "United Reserve Bank's" unified control and restrictions on foreign imports. This method is in conflict with existing treaties. Therefore, the attempt to enforce unbacked currency in North China will inevitably have a dangerous impact on British merchants' replenishment and sales procedures. If the Japanese succeed in promoting the circulation of a currency linked to the Japanese yen in China, they will place foreign merchants in an unfavorable position, similar to foreign merchants in the Three Eastern Provinces. Therefore, these regulations are indeed discriminatory against British interests and the most heinous attack on the Open Door policy and the principle of equal opportunity, and all efforts should be made to ensure that it fails completely. The British Chamber of Commerce lodges a strong protest against this reckless plan, because this plan will not only damage British interests in North China, but also damage all other non-Japanese interests, and may eventually be affected by its damage in a wider territory.

### Yesterday's Local Memorial: Flags Hung to Celebrate, Promoting the Spirit of Restoration and Supporting the Government's War of Resistance

Yesterday was the "March 21st" local memorial day in this city, which was the 12th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's arrival in Shanghai.

At this time when the soldiers on the front line were fighting bloody battles and continuing their efforts, the whole people decided to fully support the government and complete the war of resistance, and continue to promote the "March 21st" spirit of restoration, so as to dispel the haze and re-gamble on the light.

### The Situation in Eastern Zhejiang Gradually Tightens; Chinese Troops Stand Ready; Japanese Troops Attempt Landings in Xiaoshan; Ningbo and Wenzhou Issue Special Martial Law; Foreign Ships Continue Regular Sailings

After the Japanese warships' attempt to land at Haimen in eastern Zhejiang failed, they repeatedly bombarded Zhenhai, Haimen, and Dinghai, and sent planes to bomb Haimen, Linpu, and other places. Yesterday (the 21st), it was rumored that Japanese troops were again attempting to land on the south bank of the Qiantang River, in a certain area of Xiaoshan County. Japanese planes flew to Wenzhou and indiscriminately bombed the area. The military authorities in eastern Zhejiang have deployed heavy troops along the river and coastal areas, standing ready for battle. The Yong and Ou Rivers will be completely blockaded if necessary. Details are as follows:

Japanese Warships Concentrate in Eastern Zhejiang

Starting on the 18th of last month, Japanese warships concentrated in Jiaojiang, attempting to land at Haimen. After being repelled by the stationed troops, they dispatched more than ten Japanese warships to patrol the waters of eastern Zhejiang, constantly probing Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Shipu, Chuanshan, Sanmenhong, Haimen, and other places, arbitrarily firing artillery and bombing various locations. They sent planes to reconnoiter and bomb Haimen, Linpu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Zhuji, and other places. Since the 19th, when Japanese warships fired over 400 shells at Zhenhai, the number of Japanese warships patrolling the waters of eastern Zhejiang has increased to several.

Attempted Sneak Crossing of the Qiantang River

Yesterday (the 21st), it was widely rumored that Japanese troops had already attempted to land in a certain area of Xiaoshan County via a sneak crossing of the Qiantang River from Hangzhou yesterday morning. The landing attempt was met with a fierce counterattack by the stationed troops. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically inquired with the Shaoxing Seven County Fellow Villagers Association and various shipping companies yesterday, but received no detailed telegrams. They have already telegraphed Ningbo from various locations to inquire about the truth. However, the south bank of the Qiantang River, including Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Ningbo, Cixi, and other counties, is within the war zone. Under the command of General Commander Liu of the Tenth Army Group, defensive works have been built along the river, with heavy troops stationed, standing ready for battle.

Japanese Planes Bomb Wenzhou

Jinhua, Lanxi, Quzhou, and other places in eastern Zhejiang are frequently bombed by Japanese planes. Japanese planes fly to various locations in eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance almost every day. On the 19th of this month, Haimen and Linpu were bombed by Japanese planes, but fortunately, the bombs fell on barren land, causing minimal damage. Yesterday (the 20th) at 9:00 AM, it was reported that four Japanese planes flew to Wenzhou and indiscriminately bombed the urban area, resulting in over twenty civilian casualties. The Xiadong Street suffered heavy losses. However, detailed information has not yet been received by telegram. Shipping to and from Wenzhou remains open. The Baoli Wheel of the Italian merchant firm Yihua has already sailed to Wenzhou at 3:00 PM yesterday.

Evacuation of City Residents Completed

The Chinese military authorities have long had concrete plans for the defense of eastern Zhejiang. The south bank of the Qiantang River and various coastal ports are under the strict guard of the defense commanders of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo. After Haimen and Zhenhai were bombed by Japanese warships, the populations within the cities had already been completely evacuated. Now, major coastal and riverside cities such as Ningbo and Wenzhou have also been ordered to evacuate, and special martial law has been issued, stipulating that from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning, no one is allowed to pass without a special permit and password.

Preparation for Blocking Rivers

Although the Yong River in Ningbo, the Jiao River in Haimen, and the Ou River in Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have already been blockaded, gaps have been left in the blockade lines of the Yong and Ou Rivers to maintain navigation and transportation. Now, due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, the Ningbo and Wenzhou defense commanders have received orders to prepare everything. When necessary, the Yong and Ou Rivers will be completely blockaded. At the Zhenhai blockade line of the Yong River, the old Taiping Wheel has been anchored beside the blockade line, serving to close the gaps in the blockade line. Mines have already been laid in the Ou River.

Moving Stockpiled Goods in Ningbo and Wenzhou

The chambers of commerce in Ningbo and Wenzhou have received orders to notify various industries to quickly move stockpiled goods in Ningbo and Wenzhou to safer areas. Therefore, the Wenzhou and Ningbo communities in Shanghai have temporarily suspended purchasing goods starting yesterday. However, essential goods are still being purchased. It is heard that the Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various industries a few days ago to move goods from the Wenzhou docks and urban areas. The number of goods shipped from Shanghai to Wenzhou and Ningbo has decreased significantly in recent days, while the number of passengers traveling from Wenzhou and Ningbo to Shanghai has surged, mostly women and young children.

Shipping Routes Remain Open

Although there is talk of completely blockading the Yong River and Ou River, it has not yet been implemented as of last night. The Deping Wheel of the Sino-Italian Company and the Hana Wheel of the Far East Company both reported to Shanghai by telegram yesterday that they had safely arrived in Ningbo yesterday morning. However, the Ender Wheel of the Sino-Italian Company is scheduled to sail from Ningbo to Shanghai today (the 22nd), but there has been no telegram report. The Tangsai Wheel of the Huamei Company will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo today (the 22nd), and the Shantait Wheel of the Zhengde Company will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow (the 23rd). As for the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, the Baoli Wheel of the Yihua Company, the Meida Wheel of the Meili Company, and the Tangbei Wheel of the Huamei Company sailed to Wenzhou yesterday (the 21st).

### American Books Shipped to Shanghai Again Torn and Confiscated; Five Volumes of "World Propaganda" Confiscated; Lin Yutang's Work Torn Out; Sino-American Book Company Asks US Consulate to Intervene

According to the Continental Daily News, Mortimer, the owner of the Sino-American Book Company at 160 Nanjing Road, has lodged a second protest within five months with the American authorities in Shanghai regarding the illegal confiscation and tearing of American books and magazines sent here by Japanese inspectors. This protest was filed with the US Consul General Gauss on Saturday morning and has not yet received a response. It is said that the authorities have no time to handle it. The incident involves the confiscation of five volumes of "World Propaganda" by Rice and Huell sent here. Sixteen pages of an article by Lin Yutang entitled "The Birth of New China" published in the supplementary pages of the March issue of "Asia" magazine were torn out. The most recent shipment of American books and magazines arrived in Shanghai on Thursday morning aboard the President Pierce. A package addressed to the Sino-American Book Company was delivered to the company the following day. It was immediately discovered that five books were missing, and the supplementary pages originally in the center of "Asia" magazine had been torn out. Judging from the wrinkles in the ropes wrapping the books and the package's ropes, it is evident that five books were missing. The five volumes of "World Propaganda" were divided into five packages, each containing a novel. Although the novels were delivered to their destination, the books by Rice and Huell did not arrive. The Sino-American Company only received nine copies out of the ten copies of "Asia" magazine originally sent. Magazines sent from the United States are usually rolled up in paper. However, when the Sino-American Company received them, the paper was torn. The post office never unwraps and sends rolled magazines because their ends are not sealed. Therefore, the opening of the magazines immediately aroused suspicion. It was then discovered that an article by Lin Yutang occupying sixteen supplementary pages had been torn out. Yesterday, it was learned that the Dahua Magazine Company at 714 Sichuan Road had also been treated similarly. However, the British firm Biefa Company at 66 Nanjing Road claimed that their mail had not been tampered with. According to the Sino-American Company, this is the second time in five months that they have complained to the American authorities. Last autumn, Mortimer protested the confiscation of Carl Crow's "I Speak for the Chinese" and the tearing out of Pearl S. Buck's article in "Reader's Digest."

### Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Department Annual Report; Foreign Field Staff Make Steady Progress in Learning Chinese

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Department report for 1938 states that the mission of the Chinese language instruction section is to teach every foreign field staff member (including Japanese and Indian personnel) of the Bureau, as much as possible, in the local dialect of Shanghai and the national language of China. Each student is given a three-year tuition fee by the Bureau and an hour's leave each day to study Chinese. Last year there were 25 instructors. To save time, effort, and expense, the Bureau is now using an accelerated and direct approach, ensuring that each student's Chinese language learning is limited to matters related to their duties, with the rest left to them to choose on their own. Students who have studied for three years but fail the highest-level examination may continue to study for an additional year at most. After that, if they still fail, their Chinese language subsidy will be cancelled, and they must pay their own tuition and continue to study in their own time until they pass. Although the situation was not stable last year, the Bureau's staff made steady progress in learning Chinese, which is very satisfactory. The translation section of the Department is divided into two parts: one part translates Chinese documents into English, and the other translates English documents into Chinese. The purpose of dividing into two parts is to make the best use of everyone's strengths in order to translate as quickly as possible, and the results are still excellent.

### Sassoon Goes to Hong Kong

All Circles Prepare to Commemorate with Grief

### Dr. Baker's Impressions of Inspecting North China: Severe Flooding Makes Relief Extremely Difficult; The Japanese-Puppet Regime's Prohibition of Legal Tender Has Been a Miserable Failure; There Are No Smiles on the Faces of People in North China

According to the Continental Daily News, Dr. Baker, General Manager of the China International Famine Relief Commission, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 20th) after a three-week inspection of North China. He told reporters that although the flood situation in North China this year is not as serious as in previous years, most of the people in the area still need to be rescued. The winter harvest is abundant, but farmers' incomes have decreased because only the Japanese army buys cotton, and the Japanese army only pays one-third of the price of cotton. At present, the Japanese army and bandits in North China are spread all over the place, so rescuing farmers is a difficult task. It is no longer safe for those who carry money into the countryside, and valuable items are almost certain to be robbed by bandits. The sluggishness of commerce in small counties is also one of the reasons why this task is difficult. Since money cannot be taken into each county, and there is a lack of banking facilities in these areas, remittances are also impossible. As for the flood situation, a vast area in the shape of a crescent moon to the west, south, and north of Tianjin is still a swamp. Due to the lack of good maps and the inability to reach the countryside, it is difficult to determine the exact extent of the flooding. At present, most of the relief work in North China is handled by missionaries. The organization responsible for handling this work is the North China Adjustment Committee, which is headquartered in Beiping. Foreign churches are all participating in the relief work, and branches of the committee have been established in all major cities. Dr. Baker also said that while he was in North China, the Japanese implemented a new currency method, the purpose of which was to harm the value of China's legal tender. However, the implementation of this measure to date has been a miserable failure. Not only has it failed to stop the circulation of legal tender, but it has also helped to raise the premium of legal tender, which has already risen. The purpose of this method promoted by the Japanese side is to prohibit the public from circulating legal tender. In name, anyone found carrying a single piece of legal tender worth one dime will be fined 10,000 yuan. However, if someone is found by guerrillas to be carrying "joint notes," they will be executed. Foreign businesses are indeed at a standstill. Foreigners now clearly understand that all businesses will eventually be completely controlled by the Japanese. Foreign businesses are now waiting for development. Regarding the Japanese monopoly on wool, Dr. Baker believes that this move will be difficult to achieve. Shops that weave blankets can no longer buy wool on the market. Transportation methods have improved slightly recently, but trains only run during the day and stop running at night. Attacks by guerrillas on stations still occur. Strong fortifications can be seen along the railway, and important locations along the transportation lines are now guarded by the Japanese army and members of the Red Spear Society. Dr. Baker also criticized the morale of the people, saying that very few people show smiles, and no one is seen riding horses on the streets. This shows that they are not forgetting their worries. Many houses are being built in Beiping, mostly owned by Japanese people. Rents have increased sharply, but salaries have also increased. Military trucks in Beiping often drive by in columns, causing severe traffic congestion. A number of Japanese geishas now live in Beiping, and Japanese-owned shops are also increasing rapidly.

### Commander of the British East Surrey Regiment, Ackden, Returns Home

According to the North China Daily News, Lieutenant Colonel Ackden, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the British East Surrey Regiment, which is stationed in Shanghai, has completed his four-year term of office and has been relieved of his duties. He will take the Taikang to Hong Kong at 11:00 AM today (the 21st), stay for three days, and then take the troopship Lancashire back to England. After Ackden leaves Shanghai, his vacancy will be filled by Major Swinton. When the 2nd Battalion arrived in Shanghai last November, Ackden stayed in England due to illness and was temporarily replaced by Swinton as commander. During Ackden's trip to Hong Kong, Major General Grasset, commander of the British forces in China, will host a banquet for him. The command of the British forces in Shanghai will now be temporarily held by Lieutenant Colonel Murray, commander of the 1st Battalion and the West Yorkshire Regiment.

Recently, Yun Jusun, Tao Xiaojie, and others, under "orders," organized the "China Cotton Production and Sales Market" in Shanghai, with a capital of 15 million yuan. It was established this month to buy our cotton products to supply the Japanese. Business circles in Shanghai are paying close attention and are discussing effective countermeasures.

### Various Provinces Establish Food Agencies to Be Responsible for Transportation and Sales to Maintain People's Food Supply; Agricultural Warehouses Established Everywhere to Store Grain; Overseas Chinese in Siam Transport Rice Back to the Country to Handle Price Stabilization

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated food regulation measures, provincial governments established food transportation and sales agencies, assessed prices to maintain the people's food supply, cracked down on hoarding and speculative manipulation, and encouraged morning people to grow rice. A rice shortage occurred in South China, and overseas Chinese in Siam transported rice to handle price stabilization. There will be no shortage of food in the future. Details are as follows:

Various Provinces Establish Transportation and Sales Agencies

All provincial governments have established food transportation and sales agencies in the provincial capital and in larger counties or important grain distribution areas under their jurisdiction. They are responsible for regulating food surpluses and shortages within the territory, assessing rice prices, ordering firms to transport according to regulations, cracking down on rice merchants hoarding and speculating, and registering grain merchants, warehouses, stacks, and factories. They order them to report purchase, sales, and inventory quantities at any time, stipulating that various firms, etc., may not close down, suspend business, or stop work without the approval of the food regulation agency. They determine the amount of food required for several months according to the population ratio and are responsible for storing it.

Agricultural Warehouses Established Everywhere to Store Grain

Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces are actively advocating and urging the widespread establishment of agricultural warehouses to store and mortgage grain. The agricultural warehouses in various places are divided into (1) warehouses operated by the Agricultural Bank itself, (2) agricultural warehouses established by various provincial governments, (3) warehouses established by various banks and money shops, and (4) simple morning warehouses established by various local groups and people. Starting this year, various provinces will do their best to encourage farmers to grow rice, limit cotton fields and winemaking, prohibit other improper consumption, advocate that people voluntarily save food, and promote changes in food types or ingredients, so that there will be no shortage of military and civilian food in the future.

Overseas Chinese in Siam Transport Rice to Handle Price Stabilization

The government has prohibited the export and transshipment of grain to occupied areas, and ordered the South China Rice Industry Company to be responsible for regulating the food supply for the people in South China. This year, a rice shortage occurred in Shantou and other places. Overseas Chinese in Siam organized the Siam Price Stabilization Rice Industry Company and set up offices in Shantou and other places to purchase Siamese rice and transport it to South China for price stabilization. All transportation costs, etc., are subsidized by the company. The first batch of 15,000 bags and the second batch of 10,000 bags have all arrived in Shantou and are being implemented for price stabilization in various counties of Chaoshan, distributed according to the population ratio of each county. It is stipulated that the price per Sima scale is 8 yuan and 40 cents in national currency.

Grain Funds Bank Loans

The food transportation and sales agencies established by various provinces and the agricultural warehouses established by themselves are stipulated not to aim at making profits. As for the funds for grain warehouses, in addition to a part being raised by the governments themselves, the rest has been loaned by the Ministry to various local or provincial banks. At the same time, various commercial banks are making every effort to expand their grain mortgage business. Special accommodation and interest rate reductions will be given to requests for mortgage loans for grain. In the future, most of the agricultural products and grains stored in the banks and agricultural warehouses in various provinces, including wheat, rice, beans, etc., will be mortgaged.

### The Post Office Stops Accepting Heavyweight Mail to Hankou; Printing Samples Are Rejected; Aviation Stationery and Envelopes are Sold

The Shanghai Postal Administration received a report from the Hankou Post Office stating that due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, it has been decided that from now on, the post office will temporarily stop accepting and sending all heavyweight items to Hankou, except for letters and postcards, such as printed matter and commodity samples. Regarding aviation envelopes and stationery, the Bureau previously sold them at various post offices. Recently, in view of the fact that these stationery and envelopes are too heavy and hinder delivery, they have been revised and are now completed and on sale. One envelope and two sheets of stationery are sold as a set for 2 cents in national currency. The Bureau will issue a notice within a few days.

### Traveler Wang Jieren Assassinated at Huizhong Hostel

Shot in the Head, Died Instantly

Rumor Has It That the Deceased Was the Puppet "Director of Shipping"

At approximately 9:20 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on the second floor of the New Huizhong Hostel at 515 Hankou Road. The victim was Wang Jieren, a puppet in the puppet organization. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, a male guest arrived at the hostel and was accompanied by the clerk to room 241 on the second floor for lodging. The guest himself wrote "Wang Jieren, 40 years old, local, businessman" in the registration book. Over the past few days, many visitors came and went, seemingly discussing business transactions. The night before last, he had played cards with several friends until late at night. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Wang got up and was washing when a male guest named Huang Lucai came to visit. After the tea attendant reported it, Wang Jieren, who had just finished washing and was only wearing a coffee-colored knitted jacket and pants, invited the guest in. Because the guest was an acquaintance, they sat down and chatted. Unexpectedly, another man wearing a blue cloth gown suddenly barged into the room and asked, "Is Mr. Wang here?" Wang replied, "That's me." Before he could finish speaking, the man pulled out a pistol and fired at Wang, hitting him in the head. Wang fell to the ground. The man then turned and fled the room. Huang was terrified and screamed for help. By the time the hostel's tea attendants and clerks arrived to investigate, the assailant had long since disappeared. They immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Wang Jieren was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died upon arrival due to the severity of his injuries. Huang and the tea attendant on duty were taken to the police station for questioning, and Huang was temporarily detained for investigation. As for Wang's profession, it is said that he used to run a lime kiln in Huzhou and served as the manager of the Zhenxin Stone Powder Company. He was a native of Chuansha, Pudong, and was only 31 years old. Recently, he had colluded with a certain party and served as the "Director of Shipping Management Office" of the puppet "Transportation Bureau" in this city. Therefore, the reason for his assassination is still subject to various rumors.

### The Truth About Chen Tingsheng's Murder: An Adulterer Killed His Lover Out of Jealousy

Several Suspects Have Been Arrested, Tao Boqing is Highly Suspected

Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, a famous gangster in the former Ma Li Shi area and currently a foreman at the Huaxing Paperboard Factory on Gordon Road, was suddenly assassinated at approximately 7:00 AM on the 20th. Four thugs, one guarding the back door and the other three rushing upstairs into Chen's room, killed him. The assailants fled the scene. Later, the French police were notified and took the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for examination. They also brought the deceased's mistress, Wang Guizhen, and concubine, Cao Ali, to the police station for questioning and to investigate the assailants. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that, based on the testimony of the deceased's concubine, Cao Ali, the police dispatched detectives to the Letian Teahouse in Xujiahui Town at 10:00 PM that night and arrested Tao Boqing, a key suspect, for questioning. It is said that Tao is the lover of Chen's mistress, Wang Guizhen, and the assailants are Tao's disciples. Chen's murder was indeed due to an affair. Yesterday, the police reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the funeral home to examine the body. After examining the body, they began the inquiry. The investigating officers reported the results of the investigation after the incident. Then, Chen Tingfu, the deceased's brother, filed a case, requesting redress and claiming the body for burial. When questioned, the concubine Cao Ali stated that Wang had an affair with Tao Boqing and that she recognized Tao's disciples among the assailants. When questioned, Wang initially denied it but then remained silent. Prosecutor Wang then ruled that Chen Tingsheng had indeed died from gunshot wounds, and the body was handed over to Chen Tingfu for burial. The assailants were apprehended by the police and handed over to the court for handling. After the examination, Wang was taken back to the police station for further questioning. It is reported that after the incident, the police found the murder weapon in a trash can in Haige Lane on Haig Road and a shell casing in the room. Detectives have been dispatched to search for the fleeing assailants. Wang and Tao Boqing will be transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation today after the investigation is completed. It is also rumored that the deceased was a Shanghai soil baron, a disciple of Xiao Hubei, Fan Mouzhicheng said.

(Further News) It was found that the mastermind behind the crime, Tao Baiqing (33 years old), a local, lived in a bungalow in the Triangle area of Xujiahui. He was a local bully who had defrauded Fan Gencai of the Pudong Guerrilla Force out of 300 yuan last year and has not dared to cross to Pudong since. Recently, he became acquainted with Wang Guizhen and often visited her. However, the affair was discovered by Chen's concubine, Cao Ali, who revealed the secret history of Tao and Wang. Chen then investigated secretly without making a sound. Soon, Chen uncovered the affair, and Tao became enraged and quarreled with Chen. Chen returned home in anger and beat Wang Guizhen severely. Chen then discussed the matter with Wang Xinda, planning to break off the relationship with Wang Guizhen. However, Wang Xinda did not express any opinion at the time. Therefore, it was not until recently, when Chen heard unfavorable news, that he prepared to move elsewhere. Wang Guizhen immediately informed Tao Boqing, who quickly devised a plan to kill Chen. Therefore, when Chen was killed, Cao Ali witnessed two of Tao's disciples committing the crime. It is said that the French police arrested more than ten suspects, including Xing Ali, Gen Xiang (nickname Xiaobailian), Wang Liansheng, and Shan Qiuyu, at the Caishi Street Traffic Hotel at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday and brought them to the police station for investigation.

It is said that Wang Guizhen was first married to a tailor surnamed Li, and later married a carpenter foreman, Mr. Jia. After divorcing, she became acquainted with Chen Tingsheng and has been with him for fourteen years. However, Wang has always been romantic and unrestrained, and has had many lovers. Tao Baiqing is her latest lover. It is found that Tao also has a wife and a concubine, who are also said to have been arrested. Tao's father, named Lai Li Tou Bo Qing, is also an unemployed rogue. The arrested suspects will be transferred to the court by the police today for handling.

Wang Xinda's Letter Further, according to a letter from Wang Xinda, the brother of the deceased's mistress, he says: Dear Editor, I read in yesterday's newspaper in the local news column that Chen Tingsheng (aka Chen Sanzi), a gangster in Ma Li Shi, was assassinated at his residence at No. 39 Haige Lane, and that Chen's wife, Wang Guizhen, is the younger sister of Wang Xinda, the former rumored puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Fa Hua Town, etc. I was shocked to read this. I, Wang Xinda, have been peacefully operating a sauce business and have never offended anyone. However, without considering the facts, and based on rumors, last summer, I was labeled as the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Fa Hua Town and published in the newspaper, causing a commotion among the neighbors. I, Wang Xinda, asked myself and felt no guilt, and dared not lag behind others in loving the country. In addition to publishing a statement, I moved to No. 27 Haige Lane last winter to clarify my intentions by not involving myself in Fa Hua Town. As for my younger sister, Guizhen, she first married a Mr. Qian in the same town. After her husband died, she remarried Mr. Chen. I, Wang Xinda, broke off the sibling relationship with Guizhen because she did not uphold the virtues of a woman, and I have no contact with the Chen family. The details in your newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts. I am deeply afraid that the rumors will be inaccurate and confuse the public. I am writing to request a correction. This is my sincere prayer. Respectfully yours, Wang Xinda, No. 27 Haige Lane, Haige Road. March 21st.

### Reason for Assassination of Shuttle Car to Hongkou

Japanese Want Monopoly of Business

Special Use of This Terror Tactic

According to the French Shanghai Daily on the 21st, according to reliable sources, in the past two weeks, there have been repeated incidents of shuttle car drivers being killed on the north bank of the Suzhou River. It is now heard that the reason for these incidents is that the Japanese side has established several transportation companies in Hongkou, attempting to monopolize the transportation business north of the Suzhou River. However, residents in the concession prefer to hire cars from Yunfei and Dalu, two foreign companies, to go to Hongkou. Therefore, the Japanese side intends to use terror tactics to prevent the shuttle cars of various foreign companies from entering Hongkou for business again, in order to achieve their monopolistic ambitions. It is now heard that the shuttle car drivers of Yunfei and Dalu are already greatly alarmed and dare not accept the employment of customers in Hongkou. However, according to the police investigation, the rumors of the aforementioned Japanese terror tactics have not yet been confirmed. Until now, no criminals or clues related to this case have been found. However, in reality, since the crime occurred in Hongkou, the investigation of this case is very difficult.

### Manager of Yitaixing Coal Store Accused of Inciting False Accusation

Falsely Accused Lin Jiabin of Being a Robbery Gang Member, Causing Lin Great Pain and Almost Disability

The Yitaixing Coal Store on Xinzha Road was robbed by multiple intruders on the night of January 15th of this year, who made off with tens of thousands of dollars in French currency. The New Zha Police Station was notified and ordered detectives to bring Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, employees of the store, to various public places the next morning to identify the robbery gang. While passing the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road, Hu and Meng told the detectives that a passenger on the No. 7 bus had a face very similar to the robber who had been watching them with a gun the night before. The detectives then stepped forward and arrested the man, bringing him back to the police station. According to the man, his name was Lin Jiabin, 29 years old, from Taizhou, and he lived at No. 6 Anle Lane, McGillivray Road, where he ran the Fuhua Coffin Factory. He was a legitimate businessman and not a thief. However, Hu and Meng, as well as five other employees of the store, insisted that Lin's face was indeed the same as the armed robber, causing Lin to be detained for eight days and suffer greatly, almost becoming disabled.

After the police confirmed that Lin was indeed not involved, he was released. After being released from prison, Lin believed that he had been wrongly imprisoned because of the false accusations of Hu and Meng, and that Shen Jinzhou, the manager of the Yitaixing Coal Store, should be held responsible for inciting the false accusation. Moreover, because of the wrongful accusation, he had suffered great physical pain and damage to his reputation. Therefore, he specially commissioned lawyer Xu Wufang to send a letter to Shen Jinzhou requesting that he publish an apology to restore his reputation. However, Shen refused to reply to the letter. Lin, left with no choice, hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Lu Qi to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Shen Jinzhou, Hu Tingxiang, and Meng Zhenjia for perjury and false accusation, requesting that they be punished according to Articles 168 and 169 of the criminal law. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. Since the perjury part could not be filed as a private prosecution, only the false accusation part was proceeded with. According to the defendant's defense, Shen Jinzhou knew nothing about the identification, and Lin's face was indeed similar to one of the robbers, so there was a misunderstanding. However, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that a mistake in identification was still plausible, but the defendants still firmly insisted that Lin looked like one of the robbers when they identified him at the police station for the second time, causing the plaintiff to suffer greatly. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate and then announced the conclusion, setting a date for sentencing.

### Assaulting Mother-in-Law, Sentenced to Five Years

Ye A'wu, who lived in Maggie Lane, Maggie Road, in the French Concession, had an argument with his wife, Cao, on March 4th over a trivial matter. His mother-in-law, Cao Xiao, stepped forward to mediate, but A'wu turned his anger on her, shattering her left eyeball and causing her to lose her sight. Cao Xiao sued Ye A'wu for injuring a close relative in the Second Special Court. After repeated court hearings by Judge Li Weishan, yesterday's sentencing was as follows: Ye A'wu was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for causing serious injury to another person.

### Loss of Wooden Boards at the Workplace, Reported to the Japanese Military Police

Failure to Report to the Police Station Infringes on the Police Authority of the Concession, Foreman and Workers Alike Detained and Sent to Court

The Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill is located near Robison Road, Rue Bourgeat, in western Shanghai. The contractor for the construction of the dormitory for the factory's employees is the Japanese Daixin Construction Company at No. 16, Lane 1345, Gordon Road. Ye Linji, a carpenter foreman from Jiangbei, subcontracts part of the construction project from Daixin. The foundation-filling project is contracted by Wang Jinji, also from Jiangbei, and subcontracted to Tongli Transportation Company at No. 613, McGillivray Road. Currently, earthworks are being carried out on a large scale, with masons, carpenters, and earth-moving workers all working separately. However, it was discovered the day before yesterday (19th) that more than 200 wooden boards were missing from Ye Linji's carpentry site, valued at 1,253 yuan in French currency. Because Tongli sent workers to the site every day to dig and move earth, it was suspected that the missing timber was stolen by these earthworkers. Ye did not report the case to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area, but instead, on his own initiative, requested the head of Daixin Construction Company, two Japanese men named Nishitori Kiyoshi and Hamahigashi Fumio, to go to the Tongli Transportation Company and demand that the workers suspected of stealing the boards be handed over so that they could be taken to the Japanese military police detachment stationed at the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill for interrogation. Tongli initially refused to comply. Therefore, Nishitori Kiyoshi returned alone and then brought two uniformed Japanese military police officers and Wang Jinji, who originally contracted the project, to Tongli.

Without listening to their explanations, they took four Tongli workers from Jiangbei, Wang A'er, Shao Lixiu, Shao Guanfa, Wang Er, and Dai Zi, away. The incident was learned by the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area. After the Chinese and foreign detectives thoroughly investigated the matter with all parties involved, they determined that since the theft and the location of the arrest were both within the Public Concession, no third party was allowed to take such unilateral action, infringing on the police authority of the Concession. After the police authorities reasoned with the other party, they brought the arrested Wang A'er and the other three back to the Gordon Road Police Station for temporary detention. Ye Linji and Wang Jinji were also detained for improperly accusing them and were sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Meng Tingke opened a court to hear the case. The police representative, lawyer Qian Xunjiu, stated that the police suspected that Wang A'er and the other four had stolen the wooden boards and requested permission to detain them for further investigation before making a decision. For Ye Linji and Wang Jinji's actions of assisting in the detention of the workers, a detailed investigation was also needed. Since they claimed to have been stolen from, they should not have failed to report to the police station. Therefore, they requested permission to detain them for investigation to ascertain the truth. It was also testified by witness Zhao Feng that the wooden boards were transported away by truck No. 17132. In court, Ye Linji testified that he contracted the project and that wooden boards were indeed stolen from the site. Wang Jinji testified that the arrest of the workers at that time was due to a misunderstanding of each other's language. The other four, Wang A'er and the others, all denied stealing the timber. Judge Meng, after examining the testimony, ordered Ye Linji and the other six to be detained for a retrial on Saturday.

### Already Dismissed Male and Female Servants Attempted to Kidnap Young Master, Foiled

Surnamed Sheng Student from Western District Elementary School Almost Kidnapped

Male Servant Escaped, Female Servant and Driver Detained at Police Station

A foiled kidnapping case occurred near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The details are as follows: The victim was a nine-year-old Sheng student from the Western District Elementary School of the Public Works Department, whose family lived in Jing'an Temple Alley. The student usually had a private car to pick him up from school. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, just as the Western District Elementary School was about to dismiss classes, two people dressed as a male and female servant drove a shuttle car to the school gate and spoke to the doorman, claiming to have been ordered to pick up the Sheng student to return home. After school was dismissed, the elementary school student left the school and saw that the people who came to pick him up were not the current family members, but rather the male and female servants who had been dismissed a long time ago. Moreover, the car was also different. Therefore, the student refused to get in the car and turned back into the school. Upon seeing this, the male and female servants immediately stepped forward to pull him. In a moment of desperation, the student cried out. Fortunately, the school's watchman was alert and immediately ran out to see what was happening. After learning the details, he quickly detained the male and female servants along with the driver and reported to the principal, who in turn reported to the police station. Unexpectedly, due to a slight oversight, the male escaped. Therefore, by the time the detectives arrived, only the female suspect and the driver were taken to the police station for questioning. The Sheng student was then notified by the principal to his family members, who, under the protection of two bodyguards and six servants, rode in two cars and returned home safely. As for the escaped male suspect, the police are currently conducting a strict search.

### Lao Yuchang Earth Company Used Children to Transport Soil

Caught on Public Bus

Continued to Obtain Four More Suspects at Distribution Point

Lao Yuchang Earth Company, located at the end of Connaught Road, Xinkang Lane, a road built across the border in western Shanghai, is jointly opened by several shareholders, including Zheng Chongye, Yao Qisheng, and Chen Xizhang from Chaozhou. It is usually very prosperous in business and has established a distribution point for selling opium soil at No. 641 Hankou Road in the Public Concession, sending people to sell it everywhere. To transport opium soil, they use children under the age of 16 to smuggle it into the Concession from outside the border. Zheng Chongda, the younger brother of Zheng Chongye, and Lin Qiaosheng from Guangdong, both 14 years old, are usually responsible for transporting opium soil. At 10:10 AM the day before yesterday, Lin Qiaosheng was carrying four pounds, three ounces, and one-quarter of an ounce of opium soil from Lao Yuchang Earth Company and riding on the No. 2 public bus when it passed the intersection of Foch Road and Chengdu Road. He was suddenly encountered by Western Sergeant No. 278 and a Chinese police officer who boarded the bus to search. They arrested Lin Qiaosheng and seized the aforementioned opium soil, taking him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After investigating, Chinese Detective Ma Wenda and Lang Chengpei learned that there was a sales agency located at No. 641 Hankou Road. They went to the agency and arrested four Cantonese, Xiao Jingcheng, Zheng Chongda, Yao Xinli, the younger brother of Yao Qisheng, and Wang Zhou. They then went to No. 344 Guangxi Road to arrest Yao Qisheng, but he was not found. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and requested a postponement. After Judge Chuan Lin questioned each defendant, he ordered them to be detained and postponed the retrial to the 28th.

### Finance: Gold Shops and Northern Banks Resume Purchasing, Cash Prices Rise Instead of Fall

Minimal Fluctuations on the Day, Transactions Over 700 Taels

Yesterday, the cash "Xiachi" (raw gold) unofficial market suddenly stopped falling and turned upward. It opened at over 2,060 yuan. Securities firms absorbed purchases earlier, followed by gold shops and a certain jewelry store. As a result, the market price once reached 2,069 yuan. Later, due to the sell-off of foreign exchange and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, the underlying trend was slightly firm, which led to a sell-off by general retail bulls. This caused the price to fall back slightly. In the end, the price rose by seven yuan, but there were many fluctuations in the middle. However, there were no major disturbances, and the overall sentiment was stable. Transactions were average, around 700 taels. Jewelry gold also rose by one yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while British pure gold, etc., fell slightly.

"Xiachi" Unofficial Market Rises by Seven Yuan

Starting in the morning, each bar of ten taels initially rose by several yuan due to the strong buying interest from securities firms. Securities firms first bought 50 taels at 2,064 yuan, the opening price, which was six yuan higher than the previous day. Afterwards, gold shops bought 50 taels at 66 yuan, followed by jewelry stores buying 50 taels at 64 yuan. Then, money changers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores and another money changer bought 10 taels from gold shops, both at 64.5 yuan. Subsequently, Yuhao and a certain jewelry store competed to buy, causing the price to continue to rise. Gold shops bought 100 taels from jewelry stores at 65 yuan. Money changers did 50 taels among themselves at 67 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store bought 100 taels from gold shops, all at 69 yuan. At that time, the securities firms suddenly wanted to close out their positions at a high price, but buyers had stopped buying and were watching from the sidelines, so the price fell back slightly. Securities firms sold 50 taels to money changers at 66 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. It was heard that the price rose to 68-69 yuan after the close, but no transactions were seen. In the afternoon, money changers first bought 50 taels from jewelry stores at 68 yuan, followed by money changers doing 50 taels among themselves at 69 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange was slightly firm, so retail investors again entrusted money changers to sell, causing the price to fall again. Gold shops did 50 taels among themselves at 67 yuan. Afterwards, gold shops bought 50 taels from money changers at 66 yuan. Finally, they bought another 50 taels from money changers at 2,065 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, the price rose by seven yuan compared to the previous close, with only a five-yuan difference throughout the day. Cash gold shops sold at 2,075 yuan and bought back at 2,060 yuan. The current bid price is 50 yuan lower than the previous day's price.

Jewelry Gold Rises by One Yuan

The exchange rate for silver jewelry was initially unchanged, but at 11:00 AM, due to the extremely stable "Xiachi" underlying trend, it was increased by one yuan. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others revised their rates to 210 yuan, while new firms set their rates at 208 yuan and bought back at 202 yuan.

Pure Gold Shrinks by Half a Penny

London, 20th - British pure gold shrank by half a penny per ounce, falling to £7, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. As a result, the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also fell to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 0.3 yuan to 1,207.6 yuan.

### Most Foreign Currencies Slightly Decrease

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rates between the British and American currencies were unchanged. In this city, the foreign exchange market was initially stable, with little change in prices. However, the sudden sell-off of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers caused the banks to have difficulty absorbing them, and the US exchange rate was relatively stagnant. As a result, the market price loosened, but the US exchange rate became firmer. The "Xiachi" market immediately showed strength as the Tianjin banks actively started absorbing, followed by retail investors and gold shops. The market price rose slowly, which was encouraging and swept away the sluggishness of the past few days. However, the Tianjin banks and a certain gold shop took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the upward trend was once again frustrated. In the end, the price rose slightly, and the trend was sideways to firm. Due to the easing of exchange bills, most foreign currencies decreased slightly. Wealthy investors absorbed a large amount of British gold pounds and US dollar bills, and foreign banks also had strong demand. There were very few transactions among associations. Only Ying Feng issued US dollar bills for 400 yuan, which were purchased by Xiang Tai for 200 yuan and Bao Kang for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes decreased by 5 cents, British dollar pounds decreased by 1 dime, US dollar notes decreased by 1 cent, French francs decreased by 1 li, Dutch guilders increased by 2 cents, Canadian notes decreased by 2 cents, Italian lire decreased by half a cent, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Slightly Softens

Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills of exchange was slightly softer. The discount rate per thousand yuan fluctuated between 50 yuan and 50.05 yuan throughout the day, with the final price being 50.025 yuan, which was 0.29 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Fall Slightly

New York silver telegraphic transfers - American spot remained stable. Also, Bombay silver telegraphic transfers - Indian silver regained firmness. Spot prices rose by 5 annas, March rose by 4 annas, and April rose by 5 annas.

### Hong Kong Continues to Sell US Exchange, The Trend is British Flat, American Soft

Yesterday's exchange market saw some buying from foreign firms, but the banks continued to supply abundantly, and there were continuous sell-offs from Hong Kong via telegraphic transfer, especially for US exchange. Therefore, the underlying trend was flat for British exchange and softer for American exchange. However, there were still few changes in the middle, and the volume of transactions was very low. Although there were some sell-offs of Hong Kong exchange by foreign firms and money changers, there were also many purchases by foreign firms and overseas Chinese, so the situation continued to soften.

Initially in the morning, London silver for near and distant dates rose by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold shrank by half a penny, and the exchange rates for British exchange versus US exchange were down by 7 mils, and unchanged against French and Shanghai exchange. US exchange also had no changes against British exchange, but was up by 0.0625 against French exchange, and unchanged against Shanghai exchange. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened at 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16.09375 yuan for US exchange, unchanged for British exchange and up by 0.03125 for US exchange compared to the previous close. After opening, foreign firms were buying, but HSBC, a British bank, had a good supply, so there was little change. Foreign firms settled purchases with HSBC for British exchange at 8 pence 25. The announcement of the balanced tax on silver was raised by 2 li, calculated at 5.25%. Afterwards, foreign electric telegrams from Hong Kong and HSBC continued to sell US exchange to Hua Bi and a certain bank at 16.09375 yuan. The situation remained flat. Near noon, transactions became even quieter, while the activity of Hong Kong exchange in and out was quite lively. Foreign firms settled purchases with foreign firms, Anda, Hong Kong exchange at 55.125 yuan. Subsequently, overseas Chinese absorbed Hong Kong exchange from money changers at 55.25 yuan, so the situation was also flat. At the afternoon close, the banks' selling prices were the same as the morning open.

In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams continued to sell, so the situation became slightly more favorable. They sold to Hua Bi for British exchange at 8 pence 265625. Afterwards, they sold to a certain bank for US exchange at 16.125 yuan. Later, foreign firms bought Dutch Hong Kong exchange at 55.125 yuan, making the situation slightly softer. At the evening close, the banks' selling prices (for foreign firms to settle) were 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16.09375 yuan for US exchange. As a result, British exchange was flat and US exchange was harder by 0.03125 compared to the previous close, while Hong Kong exchange continued to soften by 0.125. The following is a record of the day's transactions: British Exchange (calculated at 1 yuan national currency)

### Securities: Government Bonds Rebound Slightly

Far East Stocks Continue to Fall

Yesterday's securities unofficial market saw a slight rebound after falling for four consecutive days. Because Britain has united with six countries against Germany, the democratic front is very strong, the market price rebounded slightly after bearing fatigue. The prospects are expected to turn around because people's hearts have already changed. Yesterday, Lemao No. 5 had many short-covering trades after the opening, while No. 4 and Tiansheng tried hard to call for purchases. Tianzi and Songmao were both short-covering. The price rebounded by 5-6 jiao in half a day. The afternoon market suddenly cleared, and customer gatherings were extremely rare. Retail bulls slightly sold, and the market price was slightly tired.

Currency Issues

### The Setback of Undermining Legal Tender

— Xiao Hui

About half a month ago, some Shanghai merchants who traded with the North were harboring suspicions that the "Japanese puppets" would prohibit the use of legal tender in North China from March 11th of this year. Especially commodities like raw oil, soybean oil, and raw kernels, mostly transported from Shandong, fueled speculative fervor, and the price of raw oil rose uncontrollably. However, those with a clear mind had already considered one question: Could the foundation of legal tender, deeply rooted among the people, be so easily destroyed? Anyone with common sense knew this was the "Japanese puppets'" wishful thinking. Moreover, using well-prepared legal tender to exchange for unprepared counterfeit currency and military scrip, no matter how foolish or clumsy, and even under oppressive and tyrannical rule, everyone could discern the relative advantages and disadvantages and would seek good fortune and avoid disaster. As expected, the Japanese puppets issued an exceptional statement, which was further confirmed by publications like the "Peiping Political News" (French version). It stated:

"The 'Provisional Government' here previously issued an 'order' to prohibit the use of legal tender within North China from March 11th, but this 'order' has obviously become invalid and has been withdrawn through disguised means. What is this method? It is stipulated that legal tender can still be used within 'bandit areas,' and the so-called 'bandit areas' are the guerrilla zones where Chinese military forces are located."

This passage proves that the Japanese are like silver-plated spearheads, all show and no substance. To help readers better understand this fact, it is worthwhile to make another statement:

Since the implementation of the new currency policy in 1935, legal tender has been fundamentally built on the basis of national credit, unlike before when it relied solely on bank credit. Therefore, legal tender is deeply rooted and backed by strong government credit. How could the "Japanese puppets'" conspiracy succeed? Although they are forced to temporarily use legal tender in the areas controlled by the Japanese puppets, the people are not willing to accept it. Now, let's explain the reasons that favor legal tender's resistance:

(1) Although North China is superficially an occupied area, the Japanese army only occupies a handful of cities. Most of the land is still in the hands of our guerrilla forces. In the guerrilla zones, everything is done in accordance with the central government's regulations for cracking down on Japanese puppet banknotes. The use of counterfeit currency is punishable by death. Therefore, purchasing goods in these areas uses legal tender, and the legal tender system is still established in the vast guerrilla zones.

(2) Counterfeit currency itself has no preparation and cannot purchase foreign exchange. When the Japanese established the puppet bank, they originally planned to use 60 million yuan of silver left in North China as a reserve for purchasing foreign exchange. However, this silver was all stored in banks in the Tianjin concessions and could not be looted.

(3) The Tianjin concessions and the Peiping embassy district welcome legal tender.

(4) Foreign banks refuse to sell foreign exchange with counterfeit currency.

Based on the above points, it proves that legal tender is built on rational economic principles, the willingness of Chinese and foreign people to use it, and the fortress of international credit. Its position is strong and consolidated, and it cannot be easily destroyed by the "Japanese puppets."

Therefore, in North China, legal tender has not only not been driven out by counterfeit currency, but has also increased in proportion. The following is the amount of legal tender circulating in North China before the puppet bank was established and the "counterfeit currency" was issued, and now, nearly a year after the "counterfeit currency" was issued and claimed to be discontinued, according to the Central Bank (unit: yuan):

As of March 5, 1938:

Central Bank 35,874,655
Bank of China 148,902,500
Bank of Communications 70,210,000
Four Banks 1,500,000
China Industrial Bank 1,750,000
China Agricultural and Industrial Bank 1,500,000
Kenting Bank 90,000
Zhejiang Industrial Bank 20,000
Dazhong Bank 560,000
Hebei Provincial Bank 50,000,000
Frontier Bank 50,000
Beiyang Baoshang Bank 3,000,000
Total 313,457,155

As of January 28, 1939:

Central Bank 36,491,705
Bank of China 162,233,100
Bank of Communications 78,500,000
Four Banks 1,500,000
China Industrial Bank 1,750,000
China Agricultural and Industrial Bank 1,500,000
Kenting Bank 90,000
Zhejiang Industrial Bank 20,000
Dazhong Bank 560,000
Hebei Provincial Bank 50,000,000
Total 332,140,805

Comparing the above figures, it can be seen that the amount of legal tender in North China increased by 18,683,650 yuan in the past ten months under the pressure of counterfeit currency. Among them, the 3,050,000 yuan of banknotes from the Beiyang Baoshang Bank and the Frontier Bank were seized by the puppet bank due to the reorganization of the two banks by the puppet bank, so the second figure is 3,050,000 yuan less. In fact, the legal tender of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank increased by 21,733,650 yuan in the past ten months, which shows that it was not reduced by the pressure of "counterfeit currency."

"Counterfeit currency" is a disguised form of Japanese currency. The preparation of Japanese currency itself has been severely damaged and will soon be worthless. Japan's gold reserves are only 200 million yuan, and the original limit of Japanese banknotes was 120 million Japanese yen. Since the invasion of China, it has increased to 1 billion Japanese yen, and recently it has reached 2.2 billion Japanese yen. The Japanese warlords are still demanding an additional issuance of 500 million Japanese yen, making it 2.7 billion Japanese yen. This situation, as well as the skyrocketing prices in Japan, will not only leave them with no financial solutions, but also make the lives of the Japanese people unbearably painful.

Therefore, their plunder in the occupied areas of China will inevitably intensify. However, their promotion of "counterfeit currency" in Central and South China will not only be more abhorred by European and American powers, but also make the Japanese people feel unhappy. The result will inevitably lead to barter trade, with no cash income, hindering their foreign trade. Therefore, the Japanese military's invasion of China will later involve:

(1) Using force to seize all profitable industries in the Chinese war zone;

(2) Using force to control the products of various parts of China;

(3) Using exorbitant taxes and levies to plunder Chinese assets;

(4) Excavating and looting the stored wealth of the Chinese people;

(5) Issuing "military scrip" in exchange for Chinese goods and legal tender.

Recently, the trading of Japanese currency in the Shanghai market has been unusually active. It is currently impossible to discuss the reasons for this phenomenon. It is also impossible to discuss the future of Chinese legal tender and how to deal with the "Japanese puppets'" destruction of legal tender in this extraordinary period. Because if the discussion is too specific or the methods are discussed, publishing it in the newspaper for others to see is tantamount to creating a "Zhang Song's silent map," inadvertently preparing strategies for them to resist and destroy. If what is said and discussed is not "praising achievements and virtues" or "lofty lectures," then what is the value of such essays, dazzling the eyes and ears, increasing arrogance, and only being enough to ruin things? Moreover, talking about things blindly (not looking for lice) and being able to "speak only when necessary, and hit the mark with every word," is it not "exceedingly difficult"? However, if you have real knowledge and insight, why not offer it to those responsible, which is still a good way.

However, here are a few superficial words to observe the future of legal tender:

(1) Legal tender credit has penetrated deeply into the people;

(2) It has gained the trust and support of friendly nations;

(3) It leaves no opportunity for "Japanese puppet" currency to stay;

(4) It allows for the solid political organization of the guerrilla zones;

However, how to control the black market exchange in Shanghai, how to prevent foreign exchange from being used by others while still not hindering trade with Europe and the United States? However, those who are determined to destroy legal tender have not given up, and there will be many changes in the future; words cannot achieve the desired effect!

### Cotton Yarn: Domestic Cotton Supply Almost Exhausted; Mills Turn to Foreign Cotton

Due to the easing of the European political situation and some congressmen in Washington expressing opposition to the dumping of American cotton overseas and demanding that the government order the sale of American cotton overseas to be at the same market price as in the United States, without intentional price drops, the cotton market reacted slightly, rising by more than ten pounds. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than three rupees, and Egyptian cotton also rose by more than twenty pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate did not fluctuate much. When converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 1.25 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 3 yuan.

The transaction of foreign cotton in the Shanghai market has been good for several days, and the sale of yarn has improved. Mills have also made large orders. Yesterday, Shenxin made an order for more than 2,000 pieces of 20-count "Flying Woman" and "Double Horse" yarn, intending to replenish their cotton stock. However, Indian cotton is the most cost-effective for 20-count raw cotton. However, the cost of shipping Indian cotton is high. The amount of Indian cotton shipped to China this year is particularly large. The Indian docks are crowded with Indian cotton waiting to be shipped to Shanghai. Although Indian cotton ships occasionally arrive in Shanghai, the number of shipments is still small. Currently, the supply of domestic cotton is almost exhausted. Buying American cotton is still slightly more expensive. Buying Indian cotton cannot arrive on schedule. Each factory deeply feels the difficulty of buying cotton. Yesterday, only Xinyu had 200 bales of Brazilian cotton spot goods. The remaining factories had no transactions. The cotton prices of yesterday are listed below:

The domestic cotton business is still sluggish, but the selling price is as stable as ever. This is because the yarn market is tired and depressed, the factories are unhealthy, and the foreign cotton exchange price is still cheaper than domestic cotton. However, each factory has not yet pulled in a large amount. Yesterday, Shenxin entered 500 pieces. According to some news, Chinese and foreign factories are negotiating, but nearly 10,000 pieces have already arrived at the factory. Japanese factories have sufficient demand and there is no urgent need to buy cotton, so they have no intention of trying domestic cotton. However, the bottom goods are particularly scarce. Although the source from Subei has not been cut off, the amount is minimal. It is said that six boats of fire-powered cotton from Pudong were blocked from being transported to Shanghai and are currently under negotiation. There is no certainty whether we can release them for transport. Under this environment, the cotton price is quite difficult to loosen. 389 bales of Tongzhou fine velvet cotton arrived at the pier. The situation of the current cotton is recorded on the left.

### Customers Complain of High Prices; 32-Count Single Yarn Falls Back 10 Yuan

Shenxin Opens 2,700 Bales of 20-Count Yarn

The yarn market turned weak because the price of 32-count single yarn, which had been soaring wildly for several days, was deemed too expensive and unreasonably high by customers, so they stopped buying. In addition, the Japanese warships in eastern Zhejiang were constantly harassing, and the exchange rate between Ningbo and Shanghai was tight, secretly raising the price of goods. As a result, people's hearts were hit hard. Although they wanted to do business in many ways, they saw that the facts did not allow it. Some of the floating inventory was spit out, and the market price suddenly fell by 10 to 3 yuan. The price of 32-count "Flying Woman" yarn was 560 yuan. However, when the actual situation is checked, it is still at a peak. As for the 20-count yarn market, the momentum is mediocre because of the increase in inventory and the lack of consumption. As soon as the single yarn price softened, the falling wind started again. In addition, the factory came to open up again. As soon as the籌碼鬆, the goods in hand were sold at the market price. The afternoon was still dull and weak, and the market was tired.

The current yarn situation: At the beginning, the quoted price for 32-count single yarn was 580 yuan, but customers did not buy it due to the gradual increase. As a result, the reaction suddenly rose, customers stopped buying, and the factory quickly changed spinning. As soon as the momentum leveled off, it fell by 10 yuan. The opening price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn did not move and was still 396.5 yuan. Subsequently, the opening of the factory caused people's hearts to relax, and at the same time, the actual demand was not strong, so it weakened step by step. The final price was 393.7 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392 yuan. The market in the afternoon was still leisurely. Due to the rain, customers were scarce. As a result, it was found that each help bought a total of 1,440 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 3.25 yuan compared with the previous day, "Flying Woman" yarn fell by 2 yuan, and the price of single yarn fell by 10 yuan. Only 10-count and 16-count yarn were still as firm as ever. Shenxin Factory opened 1,700 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn and 1,000 bales of 20-count "Flying Woman" yarn. The price was 395 yuan each, and the fixed payment was 40 yuan. Yesterday, 500 pieces of cotton yarn were delivered from Tianjin. The amount of transactions for each help is recorded on the left.

The Japanese yarn market is unusually bleak. Each help's needs are very clear, so people's hearts are calm. Only the recent brisk trade in cloth in the north has enabled the Japanese yarn price to rise one step. The current price of 20-count "Water Moon" yarn is 339 yuan, and the current price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn is 328 yuan, which is 1 yuan weaker than the previous day.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Bean Demand is Weak

Recently, the demand for yellow beans has been quite cold. Sha Huang and Du beans are out of season in terms of the season, but their potential is still on the rise, and the supply will eventually be exhausted. The inventory is drying up (except for Dalian beans), so the price is solid. Yesterday, Chongming Sha Huang made an opening of 50 bales, and the price was 8.5 yuan, a small amount. 50 bales of Pudong Du beans were traded, and the price was 10.3 yuan. More than 100 bags of medium-sized beans were successfully made, and the price was 9.1 yuan. Two cars of Dalian beans were made, and the price was 8.25 to 8.3 yuan, down 0.15 yuan. The April price was also a small 0.15 yuan lower, with four cars successfully opened, and the price was 8.22 to 8.25 yuan. At the moment, the trend of Dalian beans is entirely controlled by Dalian City.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Sentiment is Slightly Weak; Peanut Oil Rises Back 0.5 Yuan

Yesterday, the peanut oil market rose back 0.5 yuan after the sharp decline the day before. This is because the long-awaited arrival is still slim, so囤戶 are reluctant to sell their goods cheaply. As a result, only 30 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, and the price was 29.5 yuan. Soybean oil has become the world of Dalian oil. Yesterday, the Dalian market was closed. The sentiment in this port was weak because the Dalian closing market report fell the day before. In the morning, the potential was weak. No matter the spot, the price fell 0.3 yuan. The transaction increased in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere turned tight. As a result, the market was slightly lower than the previous day, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The market was opened as a whole. 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, and the price was 32 to 32.1 yuan. More than 300 barrels were made in March, and the price was 31.6 to 31.9 yuan. More than 1,000 barrels were made in April, and the price was 31.6 to 31.8 yuan. More than 100 barrels were made in May, and the price was 31.55 yuan.

### Seafood: Sea Worms have Expanding Sales Channels

The previous market for sea worms was quite挺, and those who wanted to buy them were hesitant to move forward, so the sales channels were reduced. However, recently, the price has gradually returned to low, and Jian and Shantou helps have also begun to mobilize one after another. At present, the market price of Ningbo outer mountain worms is 30 to 31 yuan, and Shandong worms are 48 yuan. It is found that the stock of Zhoushan worms here is lacking, and there are only 70 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Market is Affected by the European Situation

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market was closed, and New York continued to be weak. Only Lyon was slightly better, and the silk price went up. New York 83.75 daily silk and 7/8 Shanghai each fell 0.08 yuan. The Guangdong silk market was not open, and both the near and far terms on the exchange fell 0.03 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market price in New York, when calculated, has entered the 1,700 yuan mark, at around 1,650 yuan. The Lyon silk market was slightly better, up 0.5 to 1 French francs. However, due to the unrest in the European situation and people's panic, there were no transactions.

The internal and external silk exchanges in this port were both deserted. Both buyers and sellers were watching the changes in the European situation. An Indian foreign firm entered 5担 of rough local silk, and the price was also weak. In short, the silk market has been strong and stagnant these days.

Another batch of Italian artificial silk has arrived, totaling 1,851 boxes, loaded by the Italian ship Victoria, and arrived in Shanghai on the 20th of the previous day, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading.

### Piece Goods: Factory Cloth is About to Undergo Re-examination; Min Help is Rushing to Load

The demand for domestic cloth plain and dyed piece goods from the Chuan and Yue helps continues to expand. It is heard that the Wenzhou help in eastern Zhejiang received a telegram from the local area stating that it was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the mouth of Zhenhai was also bombarded, causing unrest among the people. They hesitated to buy goods, and the sales of each goods remained in a balanced state. Only Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth factory索价 13.5 yuan for April futures, and spot goods are also trending tight. Small amounts are sold for 13.35 yuan, an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. The Yue help purchased more than 100 boxes of colored twill, 120 packages of fine cloth such as Dapeng Fugui brand, and 100 packages of fine twill such as Fugui Ai brand. The Chuan help purchased more than 3,000匹 of light and dark blue cloth, all transported to Vietnam via Yunnan and Guizhou. The Min help is currently allowed to load goods in two batches for registration purposes, in order to meet market needs. After this, transportation must be stopped and implemented after strict review. The second batch was rushed yesterday, so the help was busy purchasing each goods.

Yesterday, East cloth was due to the lack of customer sales, the local demand was also weak, and those who were short were selling it by opportunity. Fine cloth and fine twill, such as Longtou and Feiyu brands, suddenly dropped by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan per piece. The momentum of sales of lower-grade trumpet fine cloth and寶貝细斜 has been strong, and more than 600 packages have been transacted. Trumpet is sold for 12.05 yuan per piece, and寶貝 is 11.5 yuan. It is heard that Dongmian Foreign Firm 收进 one or two hundred pieces of fine cloth, and people's hearts have recovered, so the sales results of each middle and lower-grade brand are similar to the previous day. Printed goods, such as哔叽色丁花布, are still very easy.

75 boxes of wool fabrics were shipped from Italy on the 20th.

### Ke Xian Cashes in on Low Prices and Buys Again; Foreign Yuan Rice Arrived Yesterday; Japonica Rice Sales are Still Sluggish

Yesterday morning, some of the ke xian 回出, and the market price immediately fell by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan, even close to one 角. However, after a small moment, the new 回 and local零 化 took the opportunity to buy, and the market turned stronger again. The number of transactions increased to more than 3,000 packages. Wu xian opened at 12.9 yuan, and Nanjing's high喊 of 13.2 or 13.3 yuan was not settled. Only 中决成议.

Foreign yuan rice arrived yesterday, and more than 100 packages of rice were sold with the market, and the price was 16.8 yuan, calculated at 160市斤, for consumption of tea snacks and milling powder. Foreign yuan rice has not been sold, and more than 200包 of foreign rice from Saigon opened, and the price is still 17.1 or 17.2 yuan.

The source of杜米 on the river only arrived at number 3, and more than 1,000 packages of car-transported baozi. The囤戶 and local sales markets are still sluggish, so the situation is quite soft. However, due to the rain, the sellers' thoughts are particularly firm. As a result, although the transactions of each goods are limited, the market is barely steady. The prices of thick and thin粳包子货 are not much up or down, only the goods from the river are slightly soft by a few cents to one 角. 杜洋埠尖 and 变元 are still守原盘.

### Grain: After the Factory盤 is Lowered, Flour Sales are Active

The flour market gradually stabilized yesterday. It was found that after the factory盤 was lowered by 0.05 yuan the day before, the customer intake became active. Whole batches of transactions in Tianjin, Yantai, Weihai, and other places are expected to expand. The South Seas幫 went化也绞比前日为贪, and the foreign flour production price was slightly higher. The April futures are full, and the price of May Citibank flour is 2.58 to 2.6美金 per barrel, similar to the previous price. Due to the lack of船位, there are temporarily no transactions. Yesterday, a foreign firm telegraphed the Australian flour Lion brand, priced at 6金镑 per ton, and the price per package must be 4.3 or 4.4 yuan, but there is no reply yet. At a time when the European situation is弥漫 and the price of foreign wheat is soaring, people's hearts seem to be improving, so the factory盤 may be difficult to lower again. The unified market sold 二号粉 and 三四号粉 with 230,000 packages each. The price of 二号粉 is 4.65 yuan, 三号粉 is 4.5 yuan, and 四号粉 is 4.3 yuan. The market may be able to stabilize for a while.

The source of wheat is very rare. The goods on the Yangtze River一带 are almost extinct due to the high production price and the control of a certain party. Occasionally, there are sporadic arrivals near the沪宁路, and the执货者 think that奇货可居, and the shouted price is particularly high, so the factory stomach is not greedy for it. It is heard that the factory 收价 is 6.8 to 7 yuan, while the customer 售价 can reach 7.2 or 7.3 yuan. The formal market still has no 做的开云.

### The European Situation and China's Resistance War

— Mao Lie

I am a thoroughly optimistic person about China's War of Resistance. I believe that no matter how unfavorable the circumstances, as long as we remain united, unyielding, and fight to the end, the final victory will always be ours. So now that the European situation is suddenly rising and the map is changing color, I still hold this optimism.

However, I am not blindly confident. I have my reasons, especially the changes in the European situation, and even the outbreak of war, I think this is more beneficial than harmful to us.

Of course, our enemies will take advantage of the opportunity of the British and French nations being unable to look east to intensify their aggression, and even take advantage of the period when their accomplices, the fascist party members, are being威作福 in Europe, following behind to wave the flag and shouting, and making extra efforts to suppress us, showing their loyalty to their accomplices and to fascism. However, first, our war of resistance was originally using our own manpower and did not borrow a soldier from other countries; second, our material resources will never be exhausted because of the blessed environment; third, the military火, as well as all the needed objects, imported from Europe, were not very many, and even if they are cut off in the future, there are the United States and the Soviet Union as our backing. From these three points of view, to put it negatively, the changes in Europe, whether now or in the future, will not harm us.

What about the positive side? That is, is it beneficial to us? First, to promote the resolution of democracies to unite and crush the dreams of fascist countries, if they still have the strength, they will definitely give us extra help; second, the strength of democracies is ultimately far above that of fascist countries. Once a union is implemented, fascist countries will inevitably suffer setbacks. As a result, our enemies will inevitably become more isolated and weak in the international community; third, in the event of a world war caused by a European war, our resistance war will indeed become a part of the total resistance war of the democracies against the fascist countries. The day the democracies win is the day we win, just as the initial devastation of Belgium will eventually be restored, and the victory of the democracies is beyond doubt. Summarizing these three points, the changes in Europe, whether now or in the future, are only beneficial to us.

Therefore, I was originally optimistic about my country's war of resistance, and I am even more optimistic now.

However, I say again, my optimism is based on our unity and fighting to the end, so we should continue to work hard.

### Welcoming the Morning Sun

— Starfire

——Life of a Newspaper Worker in the Guerrilla Zone

I jump out of bed in a hurry, before the alarm clock has even stopped ringing; I open my sleepy eyes and light a candle. I turn on the radio, and it starts to emit crackling sounds 'tss... tss... cha... cha...'; after a short while, 'Changsha Broadcasting Station...' is reported repeatedly, and this sound is mixed with 'baa... baa...', it turns out that the sleeping sheep have been awakened.

The solemn national anthem plays, followed by singing. We stand solemnly, lower our heads, and recall with deep sorrow the past scenes of thousands of people gathering in the square, singing the national anthem loudly, and saluting the national flag rising straight up the pole. Now, under the shadows of bayonets and bombs, we can still hear the songs coming from our far-away rear. This song can make us shed tears, and even more so, it can inspire us to rise up.

'Now, we begin the news report!...' Each of us grabs a pencil, and brings our ears as close to the speaker as possible. At this time, the clock strikes four, and the sky outside the shuttered window is still dotted with sparse morning stars.

The pen in my hand chases the sound waves leaping out of the speaker, and sheets of white paper are filled with uneven lines and circles, sent out from under our pens.

At this time, all our joy is controlled by the rising and falling sound waves: we are sometimes worried, and sometimes can't help but burst into laughter, even though we know that recording requires a calm mind.

The rooster crows, and the sound of chopping firewood 'gua... gua...' comes from the kitchen. An old man walks out as usual, coughs a few times, and says to us kindly: 'Gentlemen, you're up so early, even earlier than us!' 'Hmm,' we respond absentmindedly as we write. 'Sir, what's the "market situation" that you heard today?' he asks kindly, but he doesn't know that we really don't have time to answer.

'Po... po...' The old man picks up his long-stemmed pipe, filled with tobacco, and extends it towards our candle flame. With his puff, the candle flame lowers. Everything in front of us goes black, and a string of sound waves slips past, never to be caught again; but we won't complain about him, because he's saving a precious match!

The morning light chases away the darkness, washing away the stains on the sky; a round of morning sun is rising, and the dawn wind carries a faint coolness.

Time seems extraordinarily short in the course of work. When the sound waves emitted from the loudspeaker gradually decrease due to the sudden change in air pressure, the morning light penetrates from the skylight on the roof, and the hour hand on the clock face moves to the '6' mark.

Welcoming the morning sun, we walk into the wilderness, stepping on the green grass and wildflowers full of dew. We stretch our chests, inhale the morning air, clench our fists, and strike towards our front.

### The So-called "Peace"

### On the "Pale Face" of "Scholars"

— Yang Yanqi

Whenever "scholar" is mentioned, the idea of a "pale face" always comes to mind. Therefore, I hate the words "scholar"! It's not that I think a "pale face" insults humanity, but that I think a "pale face" is really shameful.

I have always looked down on "pretty boys", not only looking down on them, but also hating "pale faces" to the core. But unfortunately, I myself am in the circle of people who wield pens, which seems to have some connection with "scholars", so there is also a personal relationship, and I can't help but hate "pale faces" even more.

Scholars are the most useless kind of people, which has already been recognized by some people who like to draw conclusions. As for me, I still have a slightly stubborn bad temper, and I am unwilling to bow my head and accept punishment, and I still want to struggle out with a slogan or two. I feel that nothing in the world can be so easily judged, and that even "scholars" can be useful. Fortunately, thank God, someone has made a statement, proving that the pen has the same power as the gun. Only then did I smile through my tears and fall asleep.

But because of this, I hate "pale faces" even more.

Let's try to compare the pen and the gun. The person who wields the gun is not a "pale face", so why should the person who wields the pen be related to a "pale face"? If all the scholars in the world are pale faces, then articles will forever revolve around the circle of private appointments in the back garden. We have to use the pen instead of the gun, we also have to fight, and we also have to have the function of a fortress; we can't hide in the back garden and pace around.

The so-called "literati" doesn't seem to refer to "people who write articles", but to civilized people who have the strength to bind a chicken. Therefore, the concept passed down for thousands of years has made "people who write articles" unable to bind a chicken. As for the pen weighing a thousand pounds, it is just a descriptive sentence for literati to brag.

"Scholars" should quickly avoid "pale faces" and can no longer suffer this strange humiliation. To avenge the shame, to turn over, to seize the pen and raise it to the same height as the gun.

Honestly speaking, the phrase "pale-faced scholar" is not unreasonable. Isn't it true that many people who wield pens are always hiding in their rooms, their faces never seeing the sunlight, and their skin never touching the outdoor air? They just lie on their desks, buried in piles of books, wielding pens, humming; where can there be any vitality? No wonder "pale faces" and "hunched backs" have become the characteristics of scholars. And the products of scholars are always inseparable from desks and piles of books. Occasionally there is a little fantasy, but it is just a daydream on the desk, in the pile of books.

We should "know ourselves", "does man not know himself"? Since we know ourselves, we should move forward on the path we want to take. Some people say "haste makes waste", yes, but if you want to achieve something, you have to walk, if you don't walk, how can you achieve anything? Everyone is guarding a narrow road, everyone is crowded into the same model; in fact, it is just a rat drilling into an ox's horn, a dead end. So, try to walk out of your house, leave your study, and run to the vast world to open your eyes!

The talisman of "pale-faced scholars": "art for art's sake", has already been considered unsound and contradictory; even more so now, we can no longer stick to this inexplicable sentence and use it as a defense for not opening our eyes.

Although I dare not hope to "advance rapidly" immediately, I at least hope that "scholars" and "pale faces" can break away from each other.

May Chinese literati all be strong, well-trained warriors!

### Chen Liang of the Southern Song Dynasty's Theory on Recovering Lost Territory

— Jie

——Random Notes on Reading History——

Historical documents can be regarded as the most valuable legacy left by our predecessors to future generations. These documents are not merely antiques for future generations to admire and sigh over, but the crystallization of the experience of our predecessors, giving future generations extremely profound lessons. For example, the speeches made by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after the War of Resistance Against Japan are not only of great significance at present, but also have indelible value in history even after hundreds or thousands of years. Here, I am going to introduce an important historical document, namely Chen Liang's "Proposal for Recovery" presented to Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty.

Chen Liang was a native of Wuzhou in the early Southern Song Dynasty. He was born at a time when the Song Dynasty was suffering from the invasion of the Jin people. Most of the area north of the Yangtze River was lost to the enemy; the emperors of the Southern Song Dynasty also listened to the appeasement theories of several treacherous officials, only knowing how to maintain a temporary peace and following old customs, with no ambition to recover the lost territory. Therefore, during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, Chen Liang submitted memorials four times, requesting to govern with diligence and to rejuvenate the nation; and requesting to crusade against the Jin people in order to recover the lost territory. The article was tens of thousands of words long, and it was indeed a rare and remarkable piece of writing since ancient times!

The gist of the full text can be roughly divided into three layers. The first layer explains the advantages of resisting the war and the disadvantages of negotiating peace. Why should we resist the war? Because we want to save the suffering people in the occupied areas, to wash away the shame suffered by the country, to welcome back the coffins of Emperors Huizong and Qinzong, and to recover the lost territory. Chen Liang's original text is: "The innocent people are crying and have no one to turn to, so we cannot but save them; the humiliation of the country being invaded cannot but be washed away; the imperial tombs cannot but be returned; and the lost territory cannot but be recovered." Because of these four "cannot but" reasons, we must resist the war! Chen Liang also believed that if we don't recover the lost territory as soon as possible, then after a long time, I am afraid there will be no hope of recovery! He said: "It has been a long time since the southward crossing, and the elders in the Central Plains are dying one by one. Those who grow up in the enemy's land, how can they know that we exist?" This means that "the compatriots in the occupied areas still know how to miss their motherland; in the future, the younger generation will grow up, and I am afraid that they will be subjected to the enemy's enslavement education, and they will never think of their motherland again!" How reasonable is this statement! Just look at the present, aren't there many Taiwanese soldiers attacking their motherland? Chen Liang also gave a wonderful analogy, he said: "In vulgar terms, if parents and ancestors mortgage their property to others, and the children and grandchildren cannot redeem it, then after decades, when things change, they will all petition the government, claiming it as their former property. How can I say that I will mortgage it and then take it back? Then can today's matter (i.e., the recovery of lost territory) be further delayed?" This analogy is so accurate. Just look at Korea and Taiwan, which were originally our country's territory, but have been lost for decades. No country in the international community recognizes that this is Chinese territory anymore; Chinese geography textbooks no longer include Korea and Taiwan in the national territory. In this view, our Northeast Four Provinces should be recovered as soon as possible, and no further delay is allowed!

The second layer discusses the terrain for offense and defense. He believes that the southeast corner is not reliable, and we must fight for the land of Jingxiang. The third layer discusses the scholars who specialize in "theories of human nature", which are impractical and out of touch with the times. He said: "The scholars of today who think they have obtained the study of rectifying the heart and being sincere are all numb people who do not know pain! The whole world is content with the hatred of the ruler and father, and they bow their heads and talk about human nature and destiny, not knowing what is meant by human nature and destiny!" This scolding is so refreshing! Therefore, Zhu Xi at that time also believed that Chen Liang's remarks were "perverse talk." However, in all fairness, although Neo-Confucianism does not help the war of resistance, it is still a norm for personal cultivation. During the current War of Resistance, there are still people who take "pornographic articles" for money, and that is enough to scold them as "numb people who do not know pain."

Short Story

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"I don't think Mayor Chen is that kind of person. Perhaps there's a hidden reason for his taking the position of chairman of the 'Maintenance Society.' We shouldn't wrong him. Now, I want to go back and take a look at my lumber business over there, and I also want to sound him out to see if he's acting from his own heart."

Commander Ye felt that Dao's words were not bad, but he was very afraid that Cai Hefeng would be ignorant of the great cause and would not return after going, so he earnestly told him about the importance of the anti-enemy cooperation movement in the guerrilla area. Cai Hefeng said with a smile:

"I know this. Although I am a businessman, I also understand the great principles of the nation and the country, and I will never go against my conscience to cooperate with the enemy. And if Mayor Chen's acceptance of the chairmanship of the 'Maintenance Society' is not voluntary, I also want to discuss with him how to cooperate internally and externally to recover Hepu Town."

Commander Ye was very happy, and he repeatedly instructed Cai Hefeng to be careful not to fall into the enemy's trap, and to come back as soon as he had a chance.

As Cai Hefeng expected, Mayor Chen's taking the position of puppet "Maintenance Society" chairman was not voluntary, but was forced upon him. Originally, when the × army attacked Hepu Town, Mayor Chen also wanted to escape with his whole family, but his daughter, Xiuyue, was an admirer of Commander Ye, and insisted that Hepu Town would never be captured by the × army. Mayor Chen was an honest and kind person, without any ideas of his own, so he thought "it's better to stay put" and didn't run away. Unexpectedly, Hepu Town fell on the same day, and the streets were full of × troops. It was too late to escape, so he had to close his doors and stay at home, indicating that he would not be involved in external affairs from now on. But a person's name is like the shadow of a tree, and the × side had already taken a fancy to him as the person with the best reputation in the town, who was most suitable for their ideal puppet qualification, so even though he wanted to close his doors, the × side insisted on visiting him.

At first, Mayor Chen was also awe-inspiring in his integrity, and refused to agree to be the chairman of the "Maintenance Society", but the means of coercion by the × side's Pacification Squad Leader were very severe. He saw through that Mayor Chen was a useless honest person, so he used their consistent style, constantly threatening him that if he refused to agree, he would be accused of colluding with "bandits", not only would his property be confiscated, but his whole family would be slaughtered. Under such coercion, Mayor Dong had to violate his own heart and reluctantly agreed in order to protect the safety of his family.

Who knew that even though he had agreed to take up the puppet post of "Maintenance Society", he still could not guarantee the safety of his family. One-Eyed Li also took a fancy to his daughter, Xiuyue, and actually sent someone to propose marriage to him. How could Mayor Chen be willing to marry his flower-like daughter to a bandit, so he naturally refused outright. One-Eyed Li held a grudge in his heart, so he boasted to the × side's Pacification Squad Leader about how beautiful Xiuyue was. The × side's Pacification Squad Leader was originally a lustful person, so he personally came to Mayor Chen to propose marriage. Mayor Chen was secretly surprised, and had to use the words "unequal matches" to refuse, but the × side's Pacification Squad Leader had another set of new terms. He repeatedly said that this was "East Asia Co-prosperity," and the harbinger of "×-China integration," and finally unilaterally presented a betrothal gift and left, declaring that he would come to marry her in two days.

When this news reached Xiuyue's ears, she couldn't help but feel angry and bitter, and wept sadly all night. Although she had never met Commander Ye, her father often mentioned him in front of her, and her heart had long been set on Commander Ye. Later, when the marriage proposal failed, she was secretly disappointed in her heart, and when she heard that Commander Ye's reason for refusing the marriage was to hold the principle of "how can I make a home before the Xiongnu are destroyed," she not only did not resent his coldness, but increased her respect and love for him. She prayed day and night that the War of Resistance would end victoriously soon, so that she could fulfill her private wish of growing old together. Who knew that the great change would come unexpectedly, and seeing that she was in this environment where ghosts and monsters were rampant, there was no way to avoid the ravages of wolves and tigers. It would be better to end her own life as soon as possible, so that she could preserve her pure body. So, while everyone was sleeping soundly at night, she quietly tied a rope to the beam and hanged herself. (39)

Spring and Autumn

### "Five Races United"

— Mu Jie

The abandoned Five-Colored Flag has been brought out again, and along with it, a term "Five Races United" has been introduced. This is similar to "friendship" and "cooperation," good terms that sound very moving. It is said that the content is: There are five major races in "China." Everyone gets along harmoniously, unites together, and strives for East Asian peace, without being incited by others to go astray.

"Five Races United" is of course a good term; however, this content is said to be the case, and the truth is what people all over the world have witnessed. Threatening, enticing, provoking, and alienating, causing the five races to be discordant and engage in internal strife—this is truly the usual trick of invaders. Clearly causing the five races to be discordant, but insisting on saying that the five races are united, why? It is an attempt to cover up the eyes of the world with one hand. However, there are so many puppet "Manchukuo," puppet "Inner Mongolia Government," puppet "Provisional Government," and puppet "Renovation Government." If you want to say that they are not causing the five races to split, but are making the five races united, who would believe it?

On the contrary, the means of causing the five races to be discordant are enough to promote the five races to embark on a path of harmony and unity in the baptism of gunfire: Mongol princes once went south to request participation in the War of Resistance, and Hui leaders also expressed support for the government. Even the Miao people share the same hatred for the enemy and are willing to be the vanguard of the War of Resistance. Recently, there have also been Yi people from the border areas of Sichuan and Qinghai who have not visited the province for more than two hundred years, and they have specially elected representatives to visit the Sichuan provincial authorities and request participation in the War of Resistance. This is an ironclad fact: Tell the invaders that there is no longer such a thing as a division of five races in China. All Chinese people have united, are one family, and are working together to resist foreign aggression. Vicious means will never disrupt the feelings between the five races again. The five races are truly united. This is a valuable harvest in the furnace of the War of Resistance.

In the original intention of the invaders, they wanted to realize their wild dreams through the beautiful name of "Five Races United"; unexpectedly, the five races actually became united. Not only united, but also became one family, without distinction, which is giving the invaders a powerful slap in the face!

### Safe Deposit Box

— Zhang Zhenshan

In Shanghai, where capitalism is most developed, the safe deposit boxes attached to banks seem to have become an extremely important necessity; in the wealthy class, their value is indeed higher than clothing, food, and housing. As long as a person has a little private property, they will inevitably rent a safe deposit box in the bank for storage. Therefore, almost all large and small banks in Shanghai have a department for this purpose, not to mention those with tall bank buildings.

Before "August 13th," renting a safe deposit box in a bank was not only simple, but also cheap, costing only a few yuan for a whole year. But what about now? In Shanghai, finding a safe deposit box is as difficult as finding a house, and it is difficult to rent one even with the help of others. The reason is very obvious, because after the war, the wealthy from all over the country, and even those with a small fortune, deposited their private property in those steel safe deposit boxes in Shanghai to avoid fleeing abroad; as a result, there are so many banks and so many safe deposit boxes in Shanghai, but they still cannot meet the demand. This kind of abnormal development is an indication that all private movable property (gold, silver coins, diamonds, valuable securities, etc.) in the guerrilla areas has been concentrated on the "isolated island." It can not only preserve one's own wealth, but also avoid aiding the enemy. To expand on this, safe deposit boxes in Shanghai also have some assistance in the War of Resistance and the national economy.

Because it has a strong steel and concrete building as the main defense, and a finely made box lock as the internal defense, it can be calm in the face of theft, fire, and other encounters; moreover, the renter of each box and the bank each hold a key, and it must be opened together to be used (the bank does not inquire about the contents inside). Therefore, it can avoid errors and protect the privacy of private property. With such an effect, it is naturally foolproof to store private property in it.

However, a large part of the safe deposit boxes in Shanghai are now being used by speculators and selfish people who lack understanding and faith in the currency system; what they store inside is mostly gold and silver "hard currency," which is not only useless to the country, but also has a considerable impact on the financial and currency system. Speculators buying and selling are not new, so let's not discuss them for now. However, the phenomenon of wealthy people hoarding gold bars, silver ingots, gold pound notes from the UK and the US, Hong Kong dollars, French francs, Singapore dollars, foreign exchange, foreign securities, etc., is always a phenomenon after the war, especially after Shanghai was given the nickname "isolated island" and the market lost control, resulting in the so-called black "market," and wealthy people stored these "hard currencies" under selfish considerations. Today, they buy a few gold bars and some foreign currency, secretly hide them in the safe deposit box, and tomorrow, they buy some more and hide them in the safe deposit box. Over time, they don't know how much "yellow and white stuff" is stored in those safe deposit boxes. Could it be that one of the reasons why gold prices are rising today is because of excessive hoarding?

These "hard currencies" and "foreign currencies" are things related to the economic lifeline of the nation during the War of Resistance. Stabilizing the currency system and foreign exchange requires their strength, but now they are being stored in safe deposit boxes, unable to come out and exert their effectiveness for the country. They have the idea of ​​protecting whole eggs under a toppled nest, which is of course not desirable, and the safe deposit box is precisely the tool that promotes this idea.

However, the fact that safe deposit boxes are being used for various purposes is not unique to Shanghai. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the safe deposit boxes of various Chinese and Western banks in Hong Kong have also been rented out, and HSBC Bank has even increased the number of safe deposit boxes by a thousand this year, and the rental fee has also been slightly increased, but it still cannot meet the demand. Although many wealthy people store treasures in this prosperity, I am afraid that many are being used abnormally by the general public, just like in Shanghai.

### Time Service Report

— Confused

She quickly reports the different seconds while warning you that life is passing away.

What is the question asked the most in our day, and the answer to that question must vary with the passage of time?

"What time is it now?" "How late is it?"

Using the telephone to ask for the time is also a novel and convenient thing in this era. Centuries ago, we had sundials—a Greek invention. Today, we have telephone clocks. With just the flick of a finger, Shanghai, like other major cities, has a time service. "95678" is its telephone number. It can tell you this troublesome question: "What time is it?" This time reporting service in Shanghai is more troublesome than in other cities because it must report in at least two languages—Chinese and English.

If we dial "95678," then we are connected to the time service room—it is located in a special broadcasting room at the Telephone Company at 460 Fujian Road. A Chinese girl sits in front of the broadcaster, staring intently at the clock. Every five seconds, she mechanically reports the exact time in Chinese and English.

Let's pay attention to her. She sits comfortably and comfortably in an armchair, although she must maintain a serious posture and a quick mind. She stares at the clock. Even if we go in, we cannot attract her attention. She simply forgets everything and only stares at the hands circling on the clock face. She looks so quiet; but she is not like an artist's "model." She is a lively fool, and also a stupid actor.

Her voice is low, steady, clear, and in the same tone, over and over again, sent into the broadcaster. She quickly reports the different hours, minutes, and seconds, but she also repeatedly warns you of the terrible fact—life is relentlessly passing away.

Every fifteen minutes, one person is replaced. This shift change is necessary in order to avoid subtle errors. Under long-term concentration, misreporting is unavoidable, because this work is monotonous and boring.

But this telephone can only be given by the speaker to the listener, so she cannot hear your words, and you cannot say "thank you." The reason for this feature is because one voice can be heard by others at the same time.

Another interesting thing is that a red light is always on as long as someone is listening. When no one asks, it goes out, so they can avoid unnecessary reporting and get a few seconds of rest.

Undoubtedly, the time service is considered very convenient and appreciated in the minds of every telephone user, because it provides service day and night. According to a recent survey, 6,380 people call to ask for the time in 24 hours. Translated from the North China Daily News.

(II) Magistrate Wang

Wuxi County was originally a walled city, but over time, most of it had collapsed. In the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates harassed the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Magistrate Wang, upon learning of this, immediately planned to rebuild the city with stone walls, ordering his son, Ke Bao, to oversee the construction, working day and night without rest. Some workers requested a break, and Prince Wang, feeling compassion for them, allowed them a temporary rest. Coincidentally, Magistrate Wang came to inspect the work and was greatly enraged. Discovering the situation, he had his own son beheaded. None of the city's construction workers and many soldiers were not terrified. Afterwards, in just over sixty days, a sturdy city was built. When the Japanese pirates came, they besieged the city for a month before eventually dispersing. The people were safe, and the people of Wuxi, grateful to Magistrate Wang, built a living shrine to him on Mount Hui, and also built a long bridge to commemorate Prince Wang, calling it Ke Bao Bridge. The anti-Japanese hero is renowned, and Magistrate Wang fought bloodily to defend the isolated city. Remember, it was during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, when Japanese pirate troops harassed Jiangnan. Wuxi County originally belonged to Suzhou Prefecture, and its city walls were formed by mounds of earth. When the Japanese troops came to oppress them, the people of Wuxi were terrified. In those days, there was a virtuous magistrate, whose name was Wang Qidong, clearly remembered. He built a stone city to defend against the great enemy, and the work was quickly started, relying on the strength of the masses. Day and night, the work was hard, and people were exhausted, crying out repeatedly. Prince Wang's name was Ke Bao, and he supervised the work, toiling until the third watch of the night. The workers pleaded with Prince Wang, asking for a moment of leisure, hoping their sincerity would be appreciated. The prince was kind-hearted, and allowed the workers a temporary rest. The magistrate inspected the city walls and saw the workers snoring like thunder. He was so angry, his rage burned like fire. Discovering the truth, he was even more indignant. Alas, the iron-faced and selfless Magistrate Wang sacrificed his beloved son, executing justice by punishing his own offspring. The soldiers guarding the city were terrified, and the workers trembled with fear. Working through the night for just two months, a stone city appeared before their eyes. The [Japanese] troops could not breach the city, and the region was protected, the people and animals living in peace. To this day, Ke Bao Bridge still stands, filled with endless sorrow and contemplation of the past, the loyal soul forever associated with the clear springs of Hui.

### After the Rain, Blue Sky

Chapter Six: Praising Renrui, a Deed Supporting Three Talents; Recounting Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes

The two Miss He's also knew that this Doctor Zhang was an old maid who kept her chastity and never married, and also was Zhu Airen's adoptive mother. Zhu Airen was able to have this day entirely because of the training and nurturing of the old Doctor Zhang. And the prosperity of this hospital, the establishment of the orphanage, and the flourishing of this Anle Town, were all due to the efforts of this old Doctor Zhang. Therefore, they also respected her very much. That day, Zhu Airen led them to see the rooms prepared for the two of them. Although the rooms were small, they were very clean and tidy. Fortunately, they were next door to Zhu Airen's room, and they could talk at any time. When it was time for supper, including the old Doctor Zhang, there were seven or eight people at the table, and they ate very frugally. Among them were several female doctors who also lived in the old Doctor Zhang's residence. One of the female doctors, Liu Wenqiu, was the chief physician of the obstetrics and gynecology department, and she was in her forties this year, and had also graduated from the United States. This Doctor Liu was the old Doctor Zhang's cousin, and had never married either. Another female doctor, Ye Chuqing, was the chief physician of the pediatrics department, and she was about thirty years old, and had graduated from the United Kingdom. This Doctor Ye, her husband, was also a famous doctor, and already had a son and a daughter, two children. These two children were all in this orphanage. The two of them, husband and wife, were both engaged in medicine. Every year, only during the summer vacation, they would rest in a secluded place with water and trees, in the open mountains and forests, for two months, living their conjugal life. The old Doctor Zhang joked with the two of them, saying, "You two are like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, meeting on the magpie bridge at that time. However, the celestial stars, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, only meet for a short time, but you have two months, which inevitably makes the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl jealous. Moreover, after people get married, they have a honeymoon once, but you seem to have two months of honeymoon every year." Indeed, the son and daughter of Doctor Ye Chuqing were conceived during this summer honeymoon. After giving birth to these two children, there were still young ladies who asked her, "Doctor Ye! You can have a son or a daughter every summer vacation, so you can get a lot of sons and daughters every year." Doctor Ye Chuqing smiled and said, "Enough! I already have a son and a daughter, which is enough. If we were to have four children, and then eight from four, and then sixteen from eight, such a multiple increase would be terrible after a few generations. So our cattle breeding will stop here." Sure enough, her son was six years old, and her daughter was four years old, and she had no more children afterwards. (67)

The Arts World

### The War of Resistance and the Arts

— Jin Ding

The War of Resistance has reached its second stage, and the road leading away from “final victory” is getting closer and closer. At this critical moment when the “final victory” is about to come, in addition to all the loyal and brave soldiers who defend the country and fight in bloody battles, all sectors of the country should also work together under the guidance of the supreme leader. Of course, the arts world, standing in front of the times, undoubtedly has to shoulder greater responsibilities.

From my point of view, in the arts world during the War of Resistance, in addition to all practitioners striving to implement the twelve “National Covenants” in the recent spiritual mobilization promulgated by the Central Government, they should also, when engaged in their work, insert as much material about the War of Resistance and national construction as possible to stimulate the minds of the general public, raise the emotions of the audience, and increase the audience's confidence that the “final victory” will be achieved. Make every audience member have the belief that "the War of Resistance will be victorious" and "national construction will be successful." This kind of spiritual construction has a very important relationship and influence on the future of the War of Resistance.

In addition to this, the film industry should redouble its efforts in the production of war-resistance films. The environment in Shanghai is certainly difficult and does not allow the opening of films with anti-war content; however, we can send these films to the inland for public screening. Because film is the most popular and powerful weapon in the anti-war cultural movement. The people in the inland need these films so much to increase their anti-war sentiments. As for the drama world and the spoken drama world, in the future, in addition to working hard on their own performances, they should also redouble their efforts in the production of new anti-war scripts; other reform movements, such as Peking opera and storytelling, are also matters of urgent importance. It is hoped that within their own possible scope, they will do more to fulfill their responsibilities for the anti-war work.

In short, the War of Resistance needs the arts, and the arts should not forget the War of Resistance, and there must be an inseparable relationship. Fellow artists, be encouraged.

### Talking about Some Famous Jingpai Qin Masters (Part 1)

— Qiu Jun

The Huqin in Peking Opera is a main musical instrument which cannot be separated for a moment from singing. Because the singing of the actors, except for Kunqu or Chuichang, requires the accompaniment of the Huqin. Generally, famous actors all have their own private Qin masters to help them. Here, I will first introduce several famous Qin masters of the Jing School, which I think the readers who are fans of the Qin would like to hear about.

Xu Lanyuan is Dr. Mei's Qin master. His hand tone is exceptionally round and smooth. He is very proficient in Kunqu. He has been with Wan Hua for many years. He is not only proficient in accompanying female roles, but also has a considerable understanding of male roles. I remember ten years ago, at the Peking Liyuan Association's performance of Wo Wo Tou Disaster Relief Opera, Yu Shuyan and Wan Hua performed You Long Xi Feng and Da Yu Sha Jia. At that time, Lanyuan played the Qin for Yu. The accompaniment of Lanyuan in the Xipi Kuai Sanyan section "Last night I drank too much..." can be described as perfect and seamless, which is amazing to listen to. In addition to playing the Qin, he also founded "Zhu Lan Xuan" in Liulichang, the old capital, to sell southern bamboo and also made and sold Huqin himself. He was especially humble and amiable in his dealings with people, without any airs of the Liyuan circle. He was also a skilled calligrapher and responded to all requests. People always called him "Master Xu."

Wang Shaoqing is the son of the old actor Wang Fengqing. He plays the Erhu with Wan Hua, relying on him as his right and left arm. He first learned Lao Sheng and then changed to Qin. His fingers are firm and crisp, and his wrist strength is extraordinary. He created his own style and became famous in the world. People call it the "Wang School." Today, those who play the Erhu all follow him. Try to listen to Wan Hua's records or stage plays to appreciate its mystery. Wan Hua's tunes are mostly the result of his research with Jiang Miaoxiang. The scene personnel of the Mei Opera Troupe are all under his command. He also plays the Huqin for his father and younger brother (Wang Youqing), such as in the plays Wen Zhao Guan, Zhan Changsha, and Zhusha Zhi. The speed of the bowing, the melodiousness of the support of the melody, can be called a masterpiece. When playing the Qin with his younger brother, he does not use the Erhu, but shakes it casually on the stage, and then adds Qiao San's drums, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. There is no one in the north and south of the Yangtze River who does not know his name. Because he is the second in the ranking, he is also called "Er Pian'er."

Yang Baozhong first sang Lao Sheng, hanging his sword for others as a second-rate actor. Later, he changed to Qin and became a student of Mr. Xi Zigang. He followed Ma Lianliang for nearly seven years. His fingering is clean and neat, and his wrist strength is also extraordinary. He has excellent relations with people offstage and often gets a good head start on stage. He is very strict in supporting Lianliang's tunes, singing support, singing harmony, and supporting the stage. Even the slightest breath, his bowing also pauses and turns in a methodical manner. It can be called a scientific Huqin. It is the opposite of Zhao Guiyuan, Lianliang's former Qin master, who was good at using the wrapping tune method. He also makes and sells Qin now and also has research on Western music. When Shang Xiaoyun performed Modern Girl, he often asked him to play the "violin" and was even more famous in the world for his drumming method of "Yuyang Three Strokes" in Ji Gu Ma Cao. Baozhong can be said to be versatile.

### Storytelling Arena News

— Yuxiu

The owner of the Yi Yuan storytelling arena felt that the arena site was too narrow, which greatly affected business. Recently, he has rented the entire third floor of the Wanshang Tea House at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road as the new site for the storytelling arena. The place is spacious, and the seats have been greatly expanded. In addition to doing the "Day and Night Sessions" completely (only the "Night Session" was done at Yi Yuan), he also plans to open "Early Morning" storytelling sessions to compete with Huiquan and Dazhong. The performers are mostly "Loud Performers," and the lineup is very "Strong," and it will be ready to open as soon as the arrangements are made.

This year, the Puyu Society has very few venues because there are not many members in Shanghai. Recently, there has been talk of greeting members from the Suxi area and opening up the Baihuating Tea Room in the City God Temple market as a new base in the Shanghai storytelling arena.

Ya Lu's "Night Session," the story of the White Snake by Yang Xiaoting and his son, is a perfect combination and is very popular with listeners, with a very strong appeal. The Zhang Fengxiang and his son's show was changed due to the fact that the new book (Record of War Zone Flowers) has failed to gain listeners, so they have reorganized to sing "Yu Qing Ting."

Zhang Hongsheng, who performs "One Show," at the Fengmingtai storytelling arena on Xinzha Road, is very economical in terms of time and pricing, and the attendance is not bad. As a result, Zhang Hongsheng's "Aircraft Heroes" has become a big hit again.

The Wu Xiaosong and Xiaoshi brothers have not shown their faces in the Shanghai storytelling arena for a long time. It is said that they have gone to Pingjin to sell their skills. Zhou Yuquan and Jiang Yueting have also recently received a letter from a certain person in Shenyang inviting them to do "Long-Term Shows." In addition to providing food and accommodation, the monthly salary is 200 yuan. Temporary short-term shows and other piecemeal "extracurricular" business can also be accepted at will without restrictions. After the "Scissors Book" at Huiquan Lou, Zhou Jiang may go north.

Since Fu Chunmu's "Night Session" won the King of Description, Xia Hesheng, the business has indeed improved a lot. Recently, it has been selling "300 bowls" every day, but the "Day Session" is still only 70 or 80.

The puppet organization in the South City, recently, in order to prosper the market, urged the storytelling arenas in the City God Temple to resume business. Although one or two unvirtuous venue owners accepted this proposal, they were all met with rejection when they went to the concession to invite performers, and none of them succeeded.

In Hollywood, there are many things that seem real and seem fake. Here is a shot from "Wuthering Heights": Merle Oberon and Alexander Korda are married. Under the distressed gaze of Merle Oberon's fiance, the guests throw flowers at them. It's really terrible! After the "wedding photo" was taken, Merle and Korda slipped into the actors' dressing room. Korda laughed, but Merle's expression was very serious.

### Gunga Din

— Qi

Although the famous poet Rudyard Kipling's work "Gunga Din" has been around for forty-seven years; however, his vigorous spirit is still deeply imprinted in people's minds, so the sales of this book have never decreased, and it is truly a great work of literature! RKO Pictures saw this point and adapted it into a film. It cost a lot of money to make this film a great work with extreme financial and human resources!

Just talking about the scenery, this scene occupies a very wide area, which is vast and boundless! There are steep mountain roads and strangely dangerous peaks. Speaking of the actors, this is a war movie, with several scenes that do not use guns or knives: barehanded, so the three fighting actors, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Junior Van Dyke, three lively stars, used all their skills to perform.

I don't seem to believe that such good writing can briefly narrate the story of that epic. So I can only tell the outline of a story. It is said that in India there is a very terrifying nation. They are very brave and good at fighting, and they believe in a cruel religion. The number of people killed is very, very high. So the British Indian Army, together with the local Indian Army, worked together to eliminate this nation. It tells the adventure story of three comrades who share life and death, and the heroic act of an Indian child who sacrifices his life for righteousness. Here there is a fierce battle for survival between nations, a voice of injustice for the Indian caste system. There are also the dangerous passes of Indian geography, the situation of garrison life. There are also many humorous jokes that are mixed in the extremely tense atmosphere.

This film is scheduled to be publicly screened at the Nanking Theater in this city today, and it is a work that can eclipse the brilliance of all the works produced by Hollywood in 1928.

### Arts News

Sino-French Drama School

The Sino-French Drama School held its first practical performance at the Great Auditorium of the French Municipal Council on Huanlong Road last Saturday and Sunday. The three plays performed, "Little Hero," had an accurate awareness; "Posing" was sharply satirical; and "Poppy" had profound implications. Therefore, it was warmly supported by people from all walks of life. However, because there were not many seats in the theater, hundreds of people were turned away. It is now specifically scheduled to be restaged on Saturday and Sunday of this week (25th and 26th) in four day and night performances, in order to thank the public for their kindness. The tickets for admission sold by the school in the previous performance are still valid. The location is still the same.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (126)

— Xu Muyun

Discussing the relationship between the Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai based on the story of "Visiting Mother"

According to the lyrics of the play "Visiting Mother," such as the sentence "Tears flow out of Yanmen Pass," it is always said that the pass that Yang Silang passed was Yanmen Pass, and it has been sung like this for many years. In fact, that is really inconsistent with the plot of the play, and the time and geography are all messed up. According to the explanation in the "Ciyuan," "Liao, the name of the dynasty, the surname is Yelv, initially named Qidan, later changed to Liao, lived in Rehe." It also says "Yanmen, the name of the prefecture, originally the Zhao territory of the Warring States period, the Qin and Jin prefecture, now the northern part of the old Daizhou in Shanxi, Ningwu, and the southern part of Shuoping, and the eastern and northern parts of Datong are all within its territory." The Classic of Mountains and Seas says: "Yanmen, wild geese fly out of it, also called Xingling. The area south of Yanmen is called Xingnan, and the area north of Yanmen is called Xingbei. The mountains on the east and west sides are steep and precipitous, and there is a road in the middle, winding and rugged. A pass is set at the top of the mountain, called the West Xing Pass, also known as Yanmen Pass, which has been an important place for garrisoning since ancient times, and is the so-called outer three passes with Ningwu and Piantou in Shanxi. The city of the pass leans against the mountain and follows the danger, standing as a huge defense." For example, the Ciyuan also explains Gubeikou as: "Gubeikou, a place name, is located in the northeast of Miyun County, Jingzhao. The cliffs on both sides are standing, and only one car can pass through, which is the main road from the inland to Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty, the governor of Zhili was stationed here."

First, let's clarify the locations of "Yanmen Pass," "Gubeikou," and "Chengde," the provincial capital of Rehe Province (with a map for illustration). Then, the problem of the pass will be easily solved.

When Silang was sitting in the palace, he and the princess both showed that they were living in the inner courtyard of the palace in the lyrics and lines; it can also be proven by the lyrics "Peonies bloom, peonies release, flowers are red," and the scene of stealing the order on the court, and it can also be known that Empress Dowager Xiao and the princess and others were all in Chengde, the capital of Liao, and did not leave the capital and go to the front line like "King Song's imperial carriage to the northern frontier (lyrics sung by She Taijun)." From these two points of view, and then based on the lyrics "Ride fast and return overnight," we can determine that the pass that Silang passed must be very close to Chengde, so he dared to say to the princess resolutely: "Return immediately at the fifth watch." If there is a journey of one or two thousand miles, I am afraid that even if the horse that Silang is riding is as fast as the imperial horse stolen by Yu Dun (traveling a thousand miles in the day and eight hundred miles at night), it will not be possible to fly back to the Liao capital in time to hand over the order at the fifth watch. But if we compare the above map and study it, Yanmen Pass belongs to the territory of Daizhou and is the same as Ningwu and Piantou, being the three passes of Jin Province. Then, the distance between Chengde and Yanmen, in addition to separating a Chahar province, also has to add the distance from the border of Chahar to Chengde.
