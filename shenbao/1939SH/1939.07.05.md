### Fierce Attacks by Chinese Troops Approaching the Suburbs; Japanese and Puppet Troops in Jiangmen Prepare for Street Fighting; Two Chinese Armies Advance on Foshan, Briefly Entering the Urban Area; Fierce Battle Overnight, Killing Many Japanese Soldiers Before Withdrawing

(Hong Kong) According to reports, the Chinese army's advance on Jiangmen is swift, approaching the suburbs. Commanders Zhang and Wang are both supervising the battle at the front lines. In addition to preparing for street fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops in Jiangmen have moved their supplies onto ships. Furthermore, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Foshan, with two armies entering the urban area. A fierce battle ensued overnight, resulting in the death of one Japanese major and over fifty soldiers, with over eighty wounded. The Chinese army withdrew safely. Guangzhou is surrounded by the Chinese army. (4th Dispatch)

Zhaoqing: Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing each other in their original positions along the Jiangmen-Xinhui line. (4th Dispatch)

Guilin: A powerful unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Xinhui on the evening of the 3rd. One detachment had already entered Xinhui on the morning of the 3rd, and by the evening, it had approached Jiangmen. (4th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to observations by Chinese military experts today, the likely location for future Japanese offensives is Guangxi. The Japanese landing point may be in the Beihai area. This action would allow Japan to cut off the highway transportation between Annam and Guilin. The timing of the Japanese offensive is likely to be before the Guiyue Railway is open to military traffic, i.e., in the latter half of the summer. By this time, the situation in Europe may become increasingly difficult, allowing Japan to launch its adventurous actions in the Far East. However, the Chinese side has always regarded this coastal area as the most important strategic area in southwestern China and has repeatedly expressed its determination to defend it with all its strength. Therefore, if Japan takes this step, it will inevitably suffer a major blow from the Chinese side. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Offend the South Bank of the Xiu River, Suffering Numerous Casualties

Fengcheng: Due to the growing strength of the guerrilla forces in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army has repeatedly launched large-scale encirclement and suppression campaigns against the Chinese guerrilla units. After suffering a setback in their attack from Minshan in early May, they recently dispatched over a thousand infantry and cavalry troops from Anyi and Jing'an on the 30th, launching a major four-pronged attack on the Chinese guerrilla units north of Zhanggongdu on the south bank of the Xiu River. They also engaged in extensive burning and killing in villages near Baxia Liu. The Chinese army, deployed on high ground around □□□□□, waited in formation. The Japanese army launched several all-out attacks, but were repelled by the Chinese army. The fighting intensified into the evening, with the Chinese army growing more courageous and the Japanese army increasingly unable to succeed. They then carried out arson and killings in villages near Boyu Mountain, about five miles east of Yunping Mountain. He Hanwu, a squad leader of the Chinese unit, disregarding his own safety, led his troops around to the rear of the Japanese army and launched a fierce assault, followed by hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army eventually collapsed and retreated to the Meilin area overnight. In this battle, over twenty Japanese soldiers were killed and over thirty were wounded, with many captured. Squad leader He Hanwu also sacrificed himself while leading his troops in the initial assault. However, the villagers near Baxia Liu heard that He's squad had relied on this to preserve their safety. After the villagers heard of squad leader He's sacrifice, they all mourned and paid their respects. (4th Dispatch)

### Japanese Army in Southwestern Shanxi Withdraws North; Communications Line South of Xia County Destroyed; Japanese Reinforcements Arrive in Yicheng

(Chongqing) According to a telegram from Xi'an today, the Japanese army in Yongji and Fenglingdu in southwestern Shanxi has largely withdrawn north. Those who remain, along with scattered units in various locations, number only about 300. When withdrawing, the Japanese army automatically destroyed the communications line south of Xia County. At the same time, the railway from Xia County to Yongji was also dismantled by the Japanese army upon their withdrawal. This action by the Japanese army in southern Shanxi proves that they will not launch any further actions in southwestern Shanxi in the near future. Furthermore, the reason for the withdrawal of the Japanese army here is believed to be due to the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains recently. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to military dispatches from Shanxi Province, since the Chinese army in southern Shanxi recovered Yuanqu, which the Japanese army had attacked repeatedly, they are now advancing north, surrounding the Japanese army that retreated from Yuanqu to Jiang County to defend itself. However, a large number of Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Yicheng, northeast of Jiang County. Yicheng has strong defensive works, so it may be able to withstand the Chinese army's offensive. It is also reported that the Chinese side recently captured over 2,000 Japanese soldiers, including one officer. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)

Xingji: On the 29th, 700-800 Japanese soldiers sneaked from Pianguan to Renshuitou and Shushan Village, attempting to join the Japanese army in Shuoxian and Shenchi in a three-pronged raid on Limin Fort. On the afternoon of the 30th, a Japanese plane scouted over Limin Fort for a long time. Furthermore, 400-500 Japanese soldiers were added to Lougou Fort (south of Pianguan) on the 29th, claiming they would sneak into Sancha Town (south of Lougou). The Chinese army has deployed separately to defend strictly. (4th Dispatch)

(Xi'an) Military news: (1) The Japanese army in Yongji to Fenglingdu has largely moved north, with only about 700 troops and a part of the puppet police force stationed there. Their heavy supplies are being transported north one after another.

### Prohibit Imports of Luxury Goods to Reduce Leakage

(Hong Kong) The National Government announced yesterday a ban on the import of luxury goods such as foreign wines, tobacco, seafood, silk fabrics, cosmetics, clothing, toys, musical instruments, candies, canned food, fruits, and vegetables. It also announced regulations for applying to purchase foreign exchange. Today, someone inquired with the Chinese side responsible here about their opinion on this matter. According to the response, these regulations do not affect the operation and policy of China's Exchange Stabilization Fund. The central government's decision to ban imported goods is not only to reduce the country's annual leakage of 220 million yuan to maintain the balance of international trade but also because most of the prohibited items are produced in Japan. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to someone familiar with China's export trade, the import restrictions recently announced by China will be detrimental to Britain, the United States, and Germany. Last year, goods imported from Britain to China were valued at 170,596,000 yuan, and goods imported from the United States to China were valued at 154,804,000 yuan. Goods imported from Germany to China were also valued at 112,939,000 yuan. As of this year, China's imports and exports to the United States have decreased to 182,000,000 yuan. China's imports and exports to Britain have also decreased to 65 million yuan, and trade with Germany has decreased to 50 million yuan. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Japan Obstructs Wenzhou-Fuzhou Shipping, Deals a Major Blow to Hong Kong; Two Places Fall to the Japanese Army One After Another; Hong Kong's Trade Losses Exceed £1 Million

(Hong Kong) Japan's obstruction of shipping to Fuzhou and Wenzhou is another serious blow to Hong Kong. Last year, the total value of trade between Hong Kong and Fujian was £425,380, and the total value of trade between Hong Kong and Wenzhou was £521,363. Last year, the total value of Wenzhou's imports was £70,030 (compared to £17,310 in 1936), with the following distribution: Hong Kong £7,014, Philippines £5,018, United States £6,240, Great Britain £7,630, Dutch East Indies £27,050. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies will be the most affected. Furthermore, last year, Wenzhou's export trade was almost exclusively dominated by Hong Kong merchants, with payments totaling £514,348 (the total value of the local exports was £520,825). The second-largest buyer of Wenzhou goods was Great Britain, with total purchases worth £3,430. In addition, the export trade of this area also improved last year, with a total value of £520,825, compared to an export total of only £11,145 in 1936. While Wenzhou's trade was booming, the import and export business in Fuzhou remained unchanged. The total value of goods exported from this area was £444,483, with Hong Kong purchasing the majority of them, totaling £403,480. In addition, goods worth £24,800 were shipped to Britain, and goods worth £5,590 were shipped to France. Last year, the total value of foreign goods imported into Fuzhou was £240,231, with products from the Dutch East Indies accounting for the largest share (£41,570), followed by Hong Kong goods (£22,900), British goods (£34,108), and German goods (£31,704). If Wenzhou and Fuzhou successively fall to the Japanese army, the loss to Hong Kong's trade will be around £1 million. (3rd American Associated Press Dispatch)

### British House of Commons Concerned About the Situation in Fujian and Zhejiang; Undersecretary Answers Questions

(London) Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons last night in response to questions that the new demands made by the Japanese Consul-General to the Gulangyu Municipal Council regarding the situation in Gulangyu are currently under consideration. According to his latest information, large quantities of firewood and beans have recently arrived by British ships, and food supplies are also arriving continuously. Labour Party MP Noel-Baker asked whether water barriers had been set up in Fuzhou and Wenzhou and whether the treaty ports in those two locations had effectively been blockaded. Butler's response was barely audible, but it was reported that Butler had said that the situation in those two locations was equivalent to a blockade, and the British government had clearly stated its position on the blockade. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Butler reported on the situation in the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in China, stating that although there were no British ships currently in Fuzhou port, arrangements had been made for British nationals who wished to leave to do so. The Japanese naval authorities had also guaranteed their safe exit by July 6. Regarding the situation in Wenzhou, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Halifax was aware that foreign nationals in the area intended to remain there. At the same time, "the British government's attitude toward the Japanese military's blockade of Chinese commercial ports has been fully explained." An MP then asked whether the Japanese consulate in Shanghai had replied to the protest made by the government regarding the case of Mr. Lilley, the principal of Lester School in Shanghai, who died in a car accident in Hongkou on April 24. Undersecretary Butler immediately replied that Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Halifax had just received a report and was carefully considering what appropriate action to take. He was unable to provide further details at this time but knew that the British Consul in Shanghai had sent a letter to the Japanese Consul, declaring that he reserved all rights with regard to this case." In addition, the matter of compensation for the widow would also be considered. Labour Party MP Price then asked whether Undersecretary Butler was aware that the Japanese military authorities had recently issued a new currency in China, known as the Huaxing Banknotes, which was linked to the Chinese legal tender, with the intention of indirectly linking the legal tender to the Japanese yen in order to economically control China and exclude other countries' trade with China, and whether the government intended to take appropriate measures to deal with this crisis. Undersecretary Butler replied, "Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Halifax is aware of this matter, and the relevant departments are closely monitoring the situation." (3rd Harris Dispatch)

Editorial

### Shanghai's Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals and Prohibition of Imports

Those who live in Shanghai are most concerned about Shanghai's affairs. Generally speaking: Shanghai has become a special area because of various international relationships. However, it does not have an independent life. Its prosperity and decline depend entirely on the overall situation. If the overall situation is precarious, how can Shanghai remain safe alone? If the overall situation is stable, Shanghai will certainly not be in danger alone. In everything, the overall situation affects Shanghai, and Shanghai is not enough to control the overall situation. This is something that everyone can truly understand. To focus solely on Shanghai for the sake of the overall situation is to neglect the root and focus on the branch. To ignore the overall situation and stubbornly focus on Shanghai is to see the fine hairs but not see a cartload of firewood. Both are misperceptions. What cannot be answered in a general way is that due to the differences in time and space, Shanghai has its local and temporary phenomena, just as other localities have their temporary and special phenomena. However, no matter how special it becomes, the root is still inseparable from the overall situation. For example, in terms of public life and the law, if the overall situation can still maintain public and private law, Shanghai will not be in a lawless state. In terms of private life and prices, prices are generally rising, and Shanghai is certainly no exception. However, Shanghai's rule of law and enjoyment are different from other places. What is the overall situation? Shanghai depends on the Sino-Japanese War, and the Sino-Japanese War depends on the international situation.

Now, among Shanghai's special phenomena, please allow me to mention two things: First, after June 22, all Chinese commercial banks in Shanghai were ordered to uniformly restrict cash withdrawals, with each withdrawal limited to 500 yuan per week. All banks have complied. Second, the Jianghai Customs was ordered to prohibit the import of certain non-essential goods. The Commissioner of Customs has reported the difficulties in implementing this in Shanghai to the Inspector General of Customs. These two things can be said to be ordinary measures taken by any country in wartime. The benefits and harms felt by each locality naturally vary, but citizens have an obligation to accept them. Moreover, compared to the rear areas in the interior after the war, and compared to Japan under the National Mobilization Law, the situation of Shanghai's merchants and citizens is no different from "paradise." How can they say they cannot accept the government's orders? As merchants and citizens of Shanghai, they should cherish and respect themselves and strive to adapt to the overall situation. But what is the actual situation? Those who have lost their minds are doing everything possible to buy foreign exchange and indulge their desires by consuming luxury imported goods. Let's put them aside as unworthy of discussion. However, they are ultimately a minority. There are quite a few people whose intention is nothing more than to hoard cash in light of the restrictions on cash withdrawals, believing that protecting their wealth should be done this way. It is important to know that the restriction on cash withdrawals is mainly to prevent the escape of capital. Its side effects can also reduce speculation and waste. Although the impact also causes inconvenience to some legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, restricting cash withdrawals is not the same as prohibiting cash withdrawals, nor is it destroying industry and commerce. Therefore, those who understand that citizens should cooperate to maintain the overall situation must ensure that all phenomena, as much as possible, maintain their normal course. Hoarding cash is not beneficial to oneself but is harmful to the market by affecting finance. The extent of the harm to the market is measured by the total amount of hoarding. Since it is still difficult to determine the total amount, I will not hastily make a judgment. As for the so-called not being beneficial to oneself, it is unsafe and unproductive. The only thing to consider is that social finance and private capital are fundamentally intertwined. The result of hoarding cash is that the total accumulation is large and harmful to the market. In one person's family, how much can ultimately be hoarded? To put it to the extreme, in the event that the market and finance are shaken, what will the hoarded items become? Even with regard to the restriction on cash withdrawals, the first time was August 16 of the previous year, and the current time, June 22, is the second time. The first time, the limit was 5% and the amount could not exceed 150 yuan per week. This time, the limit is 500 yuan per week, so the second time is not more severe than the first. Considering the needs of general life, it can be said that it is very generous. In this regard, what is there to fear from the withdrawal limit? Hoarding cash because of the withdrawal limit is not only failing to consider the overall situation but also failing to consider Shanghai. Prohibiting the import of non-essential goods is something that countries even in times of peace will adopt. This time, the Customs Office has limited 18 groups with 234 tax codes. In terms of the common names of goods, items such as foreign wines, white sugar, canned foods, and woolen fabrics are all included. The Commissioner of Customs believes that Shanghai's situation has many conflicts, and although implementation is difficult, there must be some reason for it. Although Shanghai Customs authorities believe that it is difficult, it is not difficult for the people. Taking foreign wine as an example, if the Shanghai Customs Office wants to strictly prohibit imports, it is not allowed by the facts. However, Customs can import, and the people can refrain from drinking a drop. Observing Shanghai's general lifestyle, there is a lot of waste. Is it due to habit, or is it due to the authorities' indulgence? Now that the ban has been announced, Shanghai's merchants and citizens should not take the Customs Office's inability to ban as an opportunity to enjoy and consume. They should recognize the reasons for the prohibition of imports and forgive the Customs Office's difficulties in implementing it. They should agree to the ban's standards, automatically refrain from using it, and automatically reduce usage if it is absolutely necessary. On the Customs Office's side, although it is said that the ban is difficult to implement, it should also list the categories and names of goods that should be banned but have not been banned and announce them to the public. It also has its responsibilities.

The two matters mentioned above are that Shanghai has a special phenomenon with special restrictions on cash withdrawals, and Shanghai has a special phenomenon but has failed to fully comply. For the general residents of Shanghai, they should consider themselves as a cell in the overall situation and cannot act alone outside of the overall situation. They must also be aware of the necessity of adapting to the overall situation in order to coexist with the overall situation for a long time.

### British Ambassador to Japan Meets with Japanese Foreign Minister to Discuss Agenda for Tianjin Negotiations; Japanese Newspapers Exert Themselves to Propagandize a Strong Stance; Public Rallies Incite Anti-British Sentiment Nationwide; The British Side Says Suspects Will Not Be Extradited for the Time Being

(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, held an informal meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon at 5:30 PM to discuss arrangements and the agenda for the Tianjin issue conference. The first meeting will be held early next week. Simultaneously, newspapers are making propaganda evidently authorized by the authorities, stating the necessity for Britain to correct its pro-Chiang policy and to completely eliminate the possibility of future disputes. In addition, public anti-British rallies are being held in various places in Japan. These actions are gradually inciting anti-British sentiment throughout Japan. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Tianjin) The French authorities have decided to strictly manage the entry of perishable foods such as vegetables and fruits to prevent speculation and monopolization. A Japanese spokesperson, while receiving reporters today, completely denied the incident on July 2nd in which an Englishman, Anderson, an employee of the English-language Tianjin and Peking Times, was stripped of his clothes on Wilson Street in Tianjin. According to Anderson, he was ordered by a Japanese guard to take off his clothes until only his underwear remained, and was struck in the face twice with his passport by a Japanese soldier. The second mate of the Taikoo Wharf, Mr. Griffiths, was arrested by the Japanese on Sunday evening and is still being detained. According to a Japanese spokesperson yesterday, Griffiths was arrested by Japanese military police at 9:10 PM on Sunday night for making insulting remarks to a Japanese soldier. It is reported that the British Consulate is currently trying to secure his release. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Tianjin) The British Consul-General here, Mr. Jamieson, instructed Reuters today to publish a statement that rumors circulating about his recent acquisition of a preliminary plan from Chinese guerrillas are absurd and unfounded. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Qingdao) Anti-British demonstrations were held here again this morning. Slogans and leaflets were plastered all over the city. However, there are no signs of genuine anti-British sentiment among the Chinese. Demonstrators attempted to post leaflets on the walls of the British Consulate, but were prevented from doing so. The city is very peaceful. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Tokyo) The newspapers here today unanimously supported the "Provisional Government" of Beiping's announcement yesterday regarding demands made to the British and French Ambassadors concerning the Tianjin incident. The China and Foreign Commercial News stated that since the British and French concessions in Tianjin have been abused as a base for political conspiracies by the Chiang regime, they have forfeited their rights. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Tianjin) The Chinese-language Yong Bao, published by locals, claimed today that the situation in the British concession in Tianjin is becoming increasingly tense. Li Fulin (transliteration), the head of the water police, has decided to pay close attention to the traffic of ships because Dagu is the gateway to North China, in order to prevent undesirable elements from infiltrating Tianjin, and has specially dispatched a coastal patrol boat to patrol the coast day and night. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Beiping) According to sources from Japanese official circles, the anti-British movement in North China has recently spread to Linfen, Lingshi, and Hongdong in Shanxi Province. In Linfen and Hongdong, some people forced their way into church buildings, and since there were no missionaries, the intruders moved all the furniture away. This furniture is now in the hands of the Japanese army. Missionaries from these three cities have all left for Beiping, presumably due to the anti-British movement. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Tokyo) The Japan Times reports that a widespread movement is currently being organized among the Japanese people to encourage the Japanese government to adopt a firm stance when negotiating the Tianjin incident with Britain. Political circles plan to hold anti-British rallies at fourteen locations in Tokyo on Wednesday and a mass rally in the center of Tokyo on July 12th. Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and other cities are also preparing to hold similar demonstrations and parades from July 15th. The newspaper also stated that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department have agreed not to interfere. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(London) Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, assured the House of Commons last night in response to questions that the British side has no intention of extraditing the four suspects in Tianjin to the Japanese side during the negotiations in Tokyo. As the Tokyo negotiations are about to begin, he had nothing to add to his previous statements on the matter. Labor MP Mr. Noel-Baker asked whether the government would not extradite the four suspects until evidence of a crime was presented. Mr. Butler replied that this matter would be discussed in future negotiations and denied that the government had rescinded its statement that it would not extradite them without substantial evidence of a crime. Labor's acting leader, Mr. Greenwood, demanded that the government provide a firm guarantee that it would not extradite the four suspects to the Japanese side during the negotiations. Mr. Butler immediately gave that guarantee. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(London) The "Provisional Government" of Beiping has made several demands to the British and French embassies in China in order to resolve the Tianjin incident. Well-informed sources here claim that as Britain and Japan are about to begin negotiations in Tokyo with the goal of resolving the Tianjin case, the British government may not respond to these demands. As for the issue of currency in North China, the United States and France must participate before it can be discussed. Japan does not want to involve the United States in order to avoid difficulties, and therefore this issue will not be put to discussion. (Havas dispatch from July 3rd)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of War issued a statement last night explaining the military's attitude towards the British-Japanese talks, declaring that they demand that Britain first, completely cease its support for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, otherwise the negotiations would be meaningless; second, adopt a policy that adapts to the "new situation in the Far East"; third, recognize Japan's attitude towards the Tianjin dispute. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin had obtained the full agreement and support of the highest authorities in Tokyo from the beginning of the blockade of the concession.

### American Universities Enthusiastically Contribute to Help Chinese Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling; Donate $15,000 to Aid Needy Students

(New York) Since the outbreak of war between China and Japan, most of China's schools have been destroyed by war. The United Board for Christian Colleges in China, in order to help young students who have lost their schooling, joined the International Student Service (headquartered in Geneva) and the American Committee last year to form the Far Eastern Student Relief Committee, which collected donations from the education community in various countries and remitted them to China, so that universities that have moved to the west can continue to meet during the war. Dr. W. P. Fennell, chairman of the Far Eastern Student Relief Committee, arrived here yesterday from China and immediately reported the fundraising results to the press. American universities have responded enthusiastically, with 217 institutions generously donating a total of $15,000. Donations are still continuing and at least $5,000 more can be raised. Wellesley College, the alma mater of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, donated the most, with a total of $654. Other donations include $455 from the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, $500 from Union Theological Seminary, $396 from Randolph-Macon Woman's College, $258 from the University of Kansas, $165 from the University of Hawaii, $302 from schools in Northfield, $200 from Anhurst University, $182 from Holyoke College, $306 from Swarthmore College, $322 from Lerin Mall University, $500 from Carleton College, $286 from Ohio State University, and $6,666.66 from the China Relief Committee of the Churches of Christ. In addition, the International Student Service in Geneva has also raised $35,000 from the education community in 20 countries. However, these donations are not entirely distributed to schools. Instead, a committee established by the Chinese YMCA and a delegation led by Dr. Zhang Boling, president of Nankai University, personally investigate the economic situation of each student before providing appropriate assistance, and inform each student that the funds they receive are a concrete expression of the sympathy and assistance of university students from the United States and around the world towards China, forging a sense of solidarity. According to estimates from this committee, RMB 10 will cover the annual tuition fees for one Chinese university student. Japanese troops have destroyed 93% of Chinese universities. After the donations raised by the committee were used to provide assistance, the number of university students who were able to continue their studies reached 75% of pre-war levels. These results are very gratifying. (Havas Airmail)

### The Mongolian Border Conflict Escalates; Japanese and Soviet Union Deploy Heavy Troops; Fierce Battles Unfold Southwest of Hailar; Japanese Propaganda Claims Self-Defense

(Shenyang) The situation in the war on the border between Manchuria and Mongolia is escalating and has taken the form of a major war. There are many troops on both sides. The 4,000 Mongolian troops that were surrounded yesterday attempted to break out of the encirclement this morning, but failed and suffered heavy losses. Japanese military reports claim to have shot down ten Soviet aircraft. (Haitong dispatch from July 4th)

Reuters Special Correspondent, Hailar, July 3rd: The forward positions held by Soviet-Mongolian troops in the areas of Jiangjunmiao, Noru Highlands, and Nomonhan are reported to have been occupied after a fierce attack last night by Japanese-Manchukuo troops. It is rumored that the above areas are located about 180 miles southwest of Hailar and were originally part of "Manchukuo" but were recently occupied by the Mongols. Fierce fighting is still underway. The reporter saw Japanese light artillery bombarding Mongolian positions, especially in the Nomonhan area, where a small hill 150 feet high with a Mongolian observation post on top was instantly turned into a pile of rubble after being shelled. Before the Japanese-Manchukuo forces launched their attack, they bombarded the area, and then the Komatsu unit, supported by mechanized units and heavy machine guns, began the attack. Japanese aircraft were extremely active today, with bombers attacking Soviet-Mongolian bases and fighters strafing Soviet forward positions and communication lines with machine guns.

(London) The Japanese Embassy in Britain released an official statement last night explaining the background of the Kwantung Army's attack on Outer Mongolia. The original text is as follows: The border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, according to the Manchurian Conference, was originally determined to be the Khalkh River. However, since January of this year, Outer Mongolian troops have repeatedly "violated the border" and clashed with "Manchukuo" troops. Since Japan and "Manchukuo" have a "mutual defense treaty," Tokyo naturally expressed concern. In May of this year, 1,000 Outer Mongolian troops, equipped with ten artillery pieces, ten anti-aircraft guns, several tanks, and several aircraft, attacked Nomonhan (transliteration) in "Manchukuo," but were repelled by "Manchukuo" troops. On June 27th, "Manchukuo" troops counterattacked Outer Mongolia, and the air force flew to Outer Mongolian air bases to bomb them, destroying 30 Mongolian aircraft. Since then, the Outer Mongolian air force has constantly bombed "Manchukuo" territory, so the Japanese Kwantung Army ordered a counterattack on July 1st. On July 2nd, the Japanese and "Manchukuo" armies launched a joint general attack. This action is entirely "defensive in nature" and its purpose is to obtain peace and tranquility on the border. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from July 4th)

### Rampant Inflation Puzzles Japanese Authorities; Prices Continue to Rise, Hearts are Restless, and the War in China Sinks Deeper and Deeper

(Tokyo) Japan is struggling with inflation. Inflation and meteor-like price increases will lead to domestic unrest and unpleasant effects on the war in China. To avoid this outcome and limit prices beyond the public's ability to bear, the authorities have implemented commonly recognized methods to resist inflation. Japanese Minister of War Itagaki, Lieutenant General, believes that inflation is a major problem and has advocated issuing orders to prohibit prices from exceeding current prices. The chairman of the Central Price Policy Committee, Ikeda, warned the public that they must recognize the seriousness of the price problem and be prepared to endure poverty and various inconveniences and pains, no matter how great the extent, as it is better than suffering the pain of unrestrained inflation. Other measures to curb inflation, such as controlling foreign exchange and imports and exports, have already been implemented and have been quite effective, so now they are using all their efforts to control prices. Although the specific results have not yet been determined, the general situation is already understood. The biggest reason for the price increase (the cost of living in Tokyo has increased by 25% since July 1937) is the mismatch between the supply and demand of raw materials. Adjusting supply and demand is the main goal of the authorities. The government plans to implement cooperative methods to coordinate production, distribution, raw material consumption, wages, transportation, rent, savings, and employee salaries. According to the procedure, the Price Policy Committee hopes to maintain the exchange rate of the yen, promote exports, and suppress any social unrest in order to curb the continued rise in prices. In addition to causing public dissatisfaction, high prices can also hinder exports, reduce Japan's ability to import raw materials, and reduce national savings. Savings are used to absorb government bonds. If it is practically possible, the authorities intend to place prices on an international level so that Japanese merchants can compete with merchants from other countries on an equal footing. This is very important for Japan to maintain and increase its foreign trade balance in the future. If Japan cannot make foreign payments, then Japan cannot purchase the raw materials necessary for the lifeline of industry. There is discussion about exporting Japanese food as another way to strengthen Japan's foreign trade balance, but this is complicated because Japan's ability to maintain self-sufficiency is a major factor in making Japan a first-class power. Reducing the amount of food people buy will lead to serious consequences. In addition to fighting inflation at home, Japan must also consider currency issues on the mainland. The Joint Reserve Bank in North China was used to expel Chinese legal tender, but failed. An important purpose of the blockade of Tianjin is to seize the currency situation there. The selling price of the yen in Shanghai, Beiping, San Francisco, New York, and other cities is still discounted. The value of the yen in international exchange is artificially limited by the Bank of Japan and its overseas branches. However, the foreign exchange needed by the Bank of Japan has all flowed into the "black market." The goods that Japan exports to China are priced in yen or currencies that are cheaper than the US dollar and British pound, so Japan cannot increase its foreign trade balance through its exports. Japan is willing to sell more goods to the United States and other countries because the currencies paid by those countries are more stable than the yen. (Associated Press dispatch from July 4th)

### Democratic Collective Security Conference Held in Manila; China Branch of the International Peace Movement Sends Congratulatory Telegram

(Chongqing) The Democratic Collective Security Conference is scheduled to be held in Manila, Philippines, starting today. The Chinese branch of the International Peace Movement sent a congratulatory telegram yesterday. The telegram first reviewed the history of the "militarism of the Japanese warlords," and then listed the experiences gained in the War of Resistance one by one: (1) "Japanese aggressors" and European Axis countries "do not know the limits of their actions"; (2) A policy of appeasement towards aggressors is tantamount to encouraging them. It also stated that "the so-called invincible Japanese army is not someone who cannot be subdued." The telegram also stated that friendly countries around the world have provided China with various forms of assistance. "If China unconditionally surrenders to Japan, our lives and property may not be completely destroyed, but this action is tantamount to abandoning the ideals of life, and the meaning of life and the value of property will inevitably be destroyed as a result." It also stated that the Chongqing branch of the International Peace Movement has a firm belief in China's final victory. "Because the masses of the whole world are our strong backing, and the peace forces of the whole world have united to oppose aggression." Finally, the telegram stated, "This Association extends its congratulations to your conference and hopes that we will unite together to resist present and future aggressors."

### Wu Dingchang Inspects Various Counties in Guizhou Province

(Guiyang) Wu Dingchang completed his administrative inspection of Guizhou Province and returned to the province yesterday. This trip covered more than 1,500 li and inspected more than 20 counties. The reporter made a special trip to inquire about the observations. According to the discussion: (1) The weather has been favorable and the production has increased greatly throughout the province. (2) The widespread establishment of local treasuries and cooperatives has made finance active and the countryside is thriving. The agricultural products planted as replacements after the prohibition of opium cultivation have also increased considerably. Since the prohibition of opium cultivation, the price of opium has been quite high, and the people in various counties have automatically given up opium and engaged in production. (3) The administration in various counties is honest and there have been no cases of corruption. The Baojia system has been completed in most counties throughout the province. In a few months, the foundation of the Baojia throughout the province can be established. (Dispatch from the 3rd)

### Danzig Situation Turns to Reconciliation; Germany and Italy Ridicule England and France for Unnecessary Disturbance; Only Say Danzig Determines Fate Only a Matter of Time; British Report Claims Germany Intentionally Misleads to Shift Attention of Other Countries

(Berlin) Newspapers and political circles here are mocking London and Paris for their self-"alarm" over the general situation in Danzig. However, no one now dares to deny that the fate of Danzig has already been decided. The remaining question is only "when" will it erupt. This answer must be given by Hitler. Hitler returned to Berlin last night and was warmly welcomed by the public. People in political circles here told a Reuters reporter today that Mr. Chamberlain should pay more attention to the source of the information he received. This refers to the Prime Minister's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that he had received reliable information that a large-scale plan of a military nature was being implemented in the Free City of Danzig. According to these people, there is absolutely no illegal action or extraordinary military arrangement in Danzig now. They are only reorganizing and expanding their police force, which is what they should do. It is true that a large number of German travelers have arrived in Danzig, but Mr. Chamberlain would be greatly mistaken if he thought of these people as soldiers in disguise. Senior Nazi officials are shocked by the repeated issuance of blank checks by Britain to encourage Poland's "stubbornness and arrogance." It would be better if the appeals made by the British Labor Party to the Germans were made to the Poles. The Labor Party's appeal has aroused the anger of the German authorities. Such an attempt to induce people to counterattack the government is close to treason. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Berlin) The newspapers here all published editorials yesterday afternoon mocking the previous predictions by officials in the United States and France that astonishing events would occur in Danzig at the end of last week. They said that this was a case of British and French nervousness, which was in stark contrast to the calm attitude of people in Berlin. (Haitong dispatch from July 4th)

(Rome) Fascist newspapers today said that England and France were greatly disappointed that they had not been able to provoke a war over Danzig at the end of the week. The newspapers also ridiculed the democratic countries for predicting a violent coup in the Free City that had not materialized. Italian Daily editor Gaida wrote that the aggressor has not yet appeared, but England and France have already discussed curbing the aggressor. The warmongers in Paris and London should not lightly touch us. (Reuters dispatch from July 4th)

(Berlin) It was rumored that Führer Hitler would go to the Free City of Danzig at the end of this month. According to German political figures, this statement may not be reliable. Even if the Führer goes, its significance is not as great as rumored. As for the fact that the domestic cruiser "Königsberg" is scheduled to sail to the port of Danzig between August 26th and 31st, there was originally no need to seek the consent of the Polish government, but in order to respect the current system of the Free City of Danzig, the Polish government was notified so that it could be notified to the city council. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd)

(London) It has been rumored here recently that Germany does not intend to use violence against the Free City of Danzig in the future, but wants to use Romania and Hungary as targets for attack. The Manchester Guardian recently commented, "This kind of rumor must have been issued by the German side, and its intention is to shift the attention of various countries and not pay attention to Germany's activities in Danzig. However, anti-German sentiment in Hungary is becoming increasingly intense, and the German authorities must feel uneasy, or at least take some diplomatic action." (Havas dispatch from July 4th)

(London) Regarding the supplementary budget announced last week, The Times reported that the number of British defense forces has doubled since April 1st last year, currently reaching approximately 300,000. Before the spring of next year, there will be another 200,000 militiamen trained. As for the 50,000 troops currently stationed in India and Burma, they are not included in the calculation. According to Secretary of War Leslie Hore-Belisha last week, the British national regular army is now well-equipped. Each of the newly formed 104 brigades has eight anti-aircraft guns and twelve artillery pieces. However, there is a slight shortage of uniforms due to the sudden increase of 170,000 people.

### League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig Strives to Maintain Peace, Emphasizes the Danger of False News, Polish Commissioner to Danzig Returns to Post

Danzig: Polish Commissioner Franciszek Chodacki has returned here from Warsaw. People are generally awaiting Mr. Chodacki to issue a statement condemning the Danzig Nazi authorities for undermining the Danzig-Polish agreement. However, this statement may be issued directly from Warsaw. At the same time, Danzig seems to be very peaceful on the surface. League of Nations Commissioner to Danzig Carl Jacob Burckhardt told Reuters today that he is making every effort to maintain peace and emphasized the danger of false news, which distorts the events that have occurred here. A local Polish newspaper published an article, which led to rumors that Poland would organize a free army to deal with Danzig. However, neither Poland nor Germany has officially confirmed this. The Danzig Nazi Party newspaper once again stated that Danzig is only increasing its police force for defense. (Reuters, July 4)
Warsaw: Polish High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig, Franciszek Chodacki, returned to his post today after returning home for consultations. So far, he has not scheduled a meeting with Danzig Senate President Albert Forster, nor has he sent any notes to the Senate. German munitions are still being shipped from East Prussia to Danzig by ship. No one is allowed to approach the ships when they are unloading the munitions. In addition, the Danzig Senate has decided to conscript a large number of tenant farmers and workers when necessary to carry out important work of special political significance, without any time limit. Foreign observers here believe that this decision is extremely important. From now on, the Senate can build defensive fortifications, and tenant farmers from East Prussia can be fully utilized to join the Nazi volunteer corps in Danzig. (Havas News Agency, July 3)

(London) Regarding the various military measures taken by the Danzig Free City Parliament, Polish Ambassador to the United Kingdom Edward Raczyński visited Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax today and informed him that the Polish government has not yet protested to the Danzig Senate.

(Associated Press, July 4)

(Paris) It is reported that the Polish government will send a note to the Danzig Senate, protesting against the military measures taken by the Senate. The note states that the city is strategically located as the key to the Baltic Sea. If it is used as a naval base, its strategic position is extremely important. For the sake of maintaining peace after the European War, the city was designated as a demilitarized zone. The current construction of defensive fortifications violates the city's legal status. (Havas News Agency, July 3)

Danzig: According to German sources, 1,000 Danzig youths have been conscripted into the special police force, and another 1,000 will soon join the force. This youth team will enhance the "defense force" of the Free City.

Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio wrote the preface, praising the bravery and skill of Italian soldiers. The first chapter of the book, on "Blitzkrieg," was written by General Pariani, and its key points include: "Adopting trench warfare tactics in the hope of depleting the enemy's strength and thus achieving victory is not what we will adopt." The second chapter, on the Navy, was written by Admiral Cavagnari, and its points include: "The way to win naval battles is not to maintain a qualitative and quantitative advantage, but to fight boldly." The third chapter, on the Air Force, was written by General Valle, and its conclusion is: "The strength of the Air Force does not lie in the aircraft itself, but in the skill of the pilots."

### The Soviet Union Accepts British and French Proposals, a Three-Nation Alliance Can Be Established, Molotov Asks for Clarification on Several Points, Formal Agreement Expected to Be Signed Within Days

(Moscow) Officials here announced today that there has been considerable progress in the negotiations on the anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is believed that the three-nation pact can be completed in the near future. (Reuters, July 4)

(London) A certain evening newspaper recently published a shocking message in large headlines, saying that the new proposals put forward by Britain and France regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been accepted by the Soviet Union, but with reservations, and the signing is imminent. Informed sources here also elaborated, saying, "The Soviet government has indeed accepted the British and French proposals as a basis for negotiation, but has raised reservations on certain important points, and a conclusion can only be reached after one or several more talks." (Havas News Agency, July 4)

(Paris) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's response to the new proposals put forward by Britain and France the other day was telegraphed to the Foreign Ministry this morning by French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Charles Alphand.

According to informed sources, the general meaning of the response was explained in detail by Molotov yesterday and is now confirmed in writing. It is reported that the attitude of both sides was very frank during today's talks, and further talks will continue. In addition, the Baltic Sea countries, namely Finland, Latvia, and Estonia, still oppose any guarantees that have not been mutually agreed upon in advance. However, according to people from those countries here, Britain and France now intend to satisfy the Soviet Union's demands, and will disregard the opposition and still guarantee the safety of those countries. (Havas News Agency, July 3)

(London) The report on the progress of the talks between the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today has been received here. Diplomatic circles said that although Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may not be able to reach an agreement immediately, the negotiations are progressing well. (Havas News Agency, July 3)

Kaunas, Lithuania: The Lithuanian envoy to the Soviet Union, who was on vacation in his home country, suddenly left here yesterday to return to his post in Moscow. Political figures here believe that the Lithuanian envoy's sudden return to his post is related to the rumored British guarantee of the Baltic Sea states, including Lithuania, and that this proposal is currently being discussed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow. (Haitong News Agency, July 4)

Riga, Latvia: The semi-official newspaper "Briva Zeme" published an article yesterday discussing the strong desire of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for the Baltic Sea countries to join the collective security system. The article stated that the governments of the Baltic Sea countries were very unhappy to hear that the British, French, and Soviet negotiations currently underway in Moscow mentioned guaranteeing the Baltic Sea countries. They felt that the policies pursued by the Baltic Sea countries since the war, and the obligations they have fulfilled to the League of Nations, were not entirely the same as the administrative lines of the great powers. On the contrary, the security of the Baltic Sea countries is gradually weakening. The relationship between the Baltic Sea countries and certain countries should not be obstructed by others, causing it to deteriorate. The Baltic Sea countries should adopt a position of absolute neutrality in order to maintain their inherent interests. As for the Moscow negotiations, they are entirely for the benefit of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union themselves. The Baltic Sea countries do not expect it to bring any benefits, no matter how moving the rhetoric of "collective security" and "peace front" is. The Baltic Sea countries are determined not to be involved in it. (Haitong News Agency, July 4)

(Berlin) Regarding the rumor that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will visit Latvia and Estonia, informed sources here recently stated that this is unreliable.

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Visits Berlin

Sofia, Bulgaria: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov, accompanied by his wife, daughter, and many staff members, left by special train for Berlin last night. It is estimated that he will arrive tomorrow. (Haitong News Agency, July 4)

(Berlin) Political figures here recently stated that the German authorities have not yet decided on the program of talks regarding the visit of Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. News from Sofia proves that the conspiracy of a certain country to undermine German-Bulgarian relations has not shaken Bulgaria's determination to clarify its relations with the Axis powers. The importance of the Bulgarian Prime Minister's decision to visit Germany for talks is thus further highlighted. Accompanying Mr. Kyoseivanov will be many senior officials from the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German government will send representatives to greet him at the station.

### President Roosevelt Monitors European Developments; Neutrality Law Fails in Congress; Prepares to Fight to Uphold Original Intentions

Hyde Park: News reporters here have learned that President Roosevelt is paying close attention to the possibility of war in Europe and is closely monitoring all developments. The President believes that the House of Representatives' move to reinstate the arms embargo provision into the Neutrality Act will increase the possibility of war. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Hyde Park: President Roosevelt is resting at his residence today, spending the American Independence Day holiday, in order to prepare to fight with Congress over the Neutrality Law and Currency Law proposed by the government. According to unconfirmed reports, the President plans to bid farewell to his mother who is departing for Europe on vacation tonight, and then rush back to Washington. (4th Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) Congressman Snyder, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced last night that President Roosevelt plans to request another appropriation of US$250 million in defense funds from Congress within the next week, to be used to purchase strategically essential raw materials. It is said that the President plans to sign commodity exchange agreements with various democratic countries according to a meticulous plan, purchasing strategically essential raw materials worth US$1 billion over the next four years. The emergency defense funds passed by this session of Congress, including the US$500 million bill signed by the President yesterday, nearly reach US$2 billion. The defense funds signed yesterday are intended to increase the number of Army aircraft to 5,000 and to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal. Snyder also said last night that the President's proposed raw material purchase sequence will not encounter opposition. The raw materials to be purchased are mostly not easily obtained in the United States. These raw materials include zinc, chromium, tin, manganese, coffee, and rubber. (4th Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) According to news from here today, it may be difficult for Congress to pass any Neutrality Act. Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, opinions in Congress remain divided. Not only is there disagreement between the House and the Senate, but there are also great differences within the Senate itself. Therefore, it is difficult for any Neutrality Act to be passed. According to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, although the provision prohibiting the export of arms is sufficient to fuel Hitler's arrogance, he believes that the government can only make some concessions regarding the Neutrality Act passed by the House. Observers say that Pittman also knows that it is extremely difficult for the Senate committee to reach an early agreement on the Neutrality Act. According to Republican Senator Capehart, the committee will definitely oppose the wartime arms sales clause. It is said that, according to "my observation, the Senate is determined to support a strict neutrality policy that is impartial. We must not be biased. However, I think it is very difficult to reach a consensus in reality." He also said that the current Neutrality Act, although not perfect, is much better than the current government's plan. The current government is also extremely anxious about the Neutrality Act issue due to the tension in Europe and Asia. Therefore, it is now exhausting all means to seek the re-introduction of the Bloom Bill. (4th Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Act issue, the House of Representatives passed the Bloom Bill a few days ago, with the Vorys Amendment attached, prohibiting the transport of arms to belligerent countries. Whether the Senate will discuss the Neutrality Act issue during this session of Congress is under study by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a decision will be made soon. Political figures here recently stated that the State Department was quite dejected after the House of Representatives passed the Vorys Amendment a few days ago, but now it has rallied its spirits and is preparing to fight to the end. Meanwhile, the opposition Republicans and the splinter Democrats, having achieved victories in both the House and Senate (referring to the failure to pass the bill extending the President's powers in currency and finance and the passage of the Vorys Amendment), are trying to take this opportunity to strike another blow against President Roosevelt. Both sides are extremely determined, and it is almost certain that this session of Congress will be extended. At this moment, several cabinet members are deeply concerned about the unfavorable reactions in Europe after the passage of the Vorys Amendment, and they advocate taking various economic measures to show that the US government's attitude towards future aggressor countries has not changed, and to make Germany and Italy fearful. Regarding this matter, countries that discriminate against American interests or American commerce will be retaliated against by the US Treasury Department through tariffs. Up to now, only an additional tax of 25% has been levied on German goods. However, after thoroughly studying the current policies of Italy and Japan, the Treasury Department authorities deeply feel that they are quite detrimental to the United States in terms of commerce. Therefore, a certain cabinet member believes that the US government is about to take action to prove that the US has not expressed anything so far, and is neither in league with Italy and Japan, nor deliberately indulging them. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is currently spending his vacation in Hyde Park and can consult with President Roosevelt at any time. In general, Italy will be the first to be hit, and it may be at the end of this week. Those who support this kind of retaliation say that after the US levied an additional tax of 25% on German goods, German exports to the US have almost completely stopped. If the same means are used against Italy, it will surely make that country fearful. (3rd Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Invade Swatow; Hong Kong Suffers a Major Impact; Virtually Under an Invisible Blockade; Hong Kong-Swatow Commerce Stalls

Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army's occupation of Swatow, in addition to militarily expanding aggression against South China, also has a significant effect on dealing with Britain and blockading Hong Kong. However, trade and transportation between Hong Kong and South China plummeted after the fall of Guangzhou. A few months later, the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island. This move has further threatened British Hong Kong. Following this, Jiangmen was also occupied by the Japanese army. Since then, the only remaining transportation route between Hong Kong and the South China hinterland is the Swatow line. Hong Kong's food, vegetables, and other food supplies originally relied entirely on the hinterland. Hong Kong's goods also relied solely on the South China hinterland as its market. Since the fall of Hainan Island and Jiangmen, the supply of food and vegetables has been cut off by eighty or ninety percent. As a result, prices have soared, and supplies of items such as meat and vegetables are occasionally cut off. For several months, import and export trade has also largely stalled. The fish, meat, and vegetables sold in the Hong Kong market mostly depend on Swatow for supply, and the native goods needed by foreign merchants also rely solely on Swatow for transportation. Now that Swatow has also been occupied by the Japanese army, Hong Kong, isolated in the sea, has virtually become an isolated island. Not only has import and export commerce completely stalled, but even the supply of vegetables has almost been cut off. The Japanese army, entrenched in Swatow, is making things difficult for British ships in many ways. First, they demanded that all British warships and ships withdraw. Then, they prohibited British ships escorted by British warships from entering Swatow Harbor from unloading cargo. However, the British side is extremely determined to sail to Swatow. Since the outbreak of the war and the Japanese demand that British ships stop sailing, almost every day there has been a British ship sailing to Swatow. Although these British ships sailing to Swatow do not unload or load passengers or cargo after docking, resulting in huge losses, British ships continue to sail as usual without interruption. This also shows the importance of the relationship between Swatow and Hong Kong. The British side cannot give up Swatow or temporarily suspend the sailing of ships to Swatow, as with Guangzhou, Qingdao, and various ports along the Yangtze River. Currently, the dispute between Britain and Japan over Swatow has not tended to worsen, but there is no sign of relaxation. Therefore, the development of the situation is truly difficult to predict at this time.

### Chinese Troops in South Shanghai Jointly Attack Nanqiao; Japanese Troops Retreat to Defensive Buildings; Transportation Cut Off, Situation Tense

South Shanghai Dispatch: Since more than 300 puppet police in Nanqiao, South Shanghai, defected, the Japanese side has slightly mobilized reinforcements, hoping to pursue them. Fortunately, the police had already contacted the 2nd and 8th detachments of the Loyal National Salvation Army stationed in the area. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they launched an attack from multiple directions. The police also joined the front line and surrounded the Japanese army. Unable to take care of both the front and the rear, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses and retreated to Nanqiao on the 30th. In addition to setting up barbed wire at various important land and water entrances outside the town, they also conscripted hundreds of people to dig trenches overnight. On the other hand, four watchtowers were built in front of and behind the town. The members of all puppet agencies and police officers implemented a system of joint guarantee, with strict restrictions. Both inside and outside are prohibited from entering and exiting, so the entire town is like a dead market. Currently, the two captains of the National Salvation Army, Yu and Ding, have drafted a joint attack plan. Yu will advance from Qingcun Port, and Ding will advance from Zhalin, etc. The People's Self-Defense Corps, under the Third District Administrative Inspector, led by County Magistrate Dai, will also advance to Shenxing to set up defenses. At the same time, the various teams of the 62nd Regular Army Division have launched fierce battles in Pinghu and other places to contain the enemy. According to confirmed news at noon on the 1st, the advancing troops of each team have launched attacks on all sides of Nanqiao. The Japanese army has not come out to fight, but has only fired artillery.

Transportation in South Shanghai: Originally, there were Tiancheng Company ships coming and going. Two weeks ago, the Japanese army found a receipt from the 8th Detachment in the ship's accounting room, suspected it of being involved, and immediately detained the ship and arrested two employees who have not been released yet. On the 20th, a temporary merchant ship went, and it had a pass from the Japanese army. It was also escorted back by the Japanese navy midway. Currently, only the Minhang line is running, but the inspection along the way is very strict, and the transportation of food is absolutely prohibited.

### Battle Situation of the Fall of Chao'an City; Front Line Moves from Hulu Mountain in the West Gate to Zhugao Mountain; Wu Qihui Sends Troops from Jieyang to Flank Swatow

Swatow Dispatch: The Japanese army invading Swatow, advancing north along the embankment road to attack Chao'an City, engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the Anbu, Panlong Mountain, and Fengxitou embankments on the Chao-Shan Railway on the 23rd and 24th, as well as near Malong and Neilong. The Anbu position was gained and lost seven times by the Chinese army. Security Team Battalion Commander Li Ping was killed in action, and Battalion Commander Du was seriously injured in the abdomen. When the Japanese cavalry copied over Huamei Station, the Chinese army at Anbu began to retreat to Sangpu Mountain. On the 25th, the battle line moved to Caitang City. The Chinese army urgently dug trenches on Wuyang Mountain to defend to the death. The Japanese army landed from Longhu and rushed straight to the south gate of Chao'an County, cutting off Fengxi. The Chinese army defending Fuyang and Wuyang Mountains retreated urgently to Qingmao Mountain and the Anjie Road, defending firmly along Sangpu Mountain and the Fengxi River. On the 26th, the Japanese army surrounded Chao'an City on three sides, and Japanese aircraft bombed Fuyang, Fengxi, and Chao'an all day long, causing heavy casualties among the people. Half of the refugees in the city scattered across the Xiangzi Bridge and retreated towards Raoping Phoenix Mountain. Most retreated to Zhugao Mountain, Dengyun District, and Tiandong District through the North Gate to enter Fengshun. Steamships and sailing boats in the river were all sealed off by the military and political circles. Personnel and documents from various agencies were transported by waterway to Yuhuang, Sanheba, and Songkou. At this time, the flames of war gradually approached the Han River. In the evening, the Chinese army counterattacked from Fengxi, surrounding the Japanese army. The bloody battle was extremely fierce. The Chinese army in the city was stationed at the city station, Hulu Mountain, and Huayuanzai, fighting fiercely with the Japanese army near the station. The Japanese army transferred the main force of the 104th Division, 6,000 strong, from Guangzhou, using tanks and motorboats to quickly rush to Fengxi, again cutting off the rear of the Chinese army, preventing them from returning to Qingmao Mountain. The 9th Brigade urgently retreated to Quxi and Xichang in Jieyang. On the morning of the 27th, the Chao'an West Gate Station was occupied by the Japanese army. Hulu Mountain was also lost at noon. All the ancient monuments and buildings in West Lake were completely destroyed by artillery fire. The Chinese army retreated past the Yixi Station to defend Zhugao Mountain. At this time, the Japanese army advancing along the embankment road had spread from the Nanshan Jiaochang to the East Gate. The Chinese army retreated past the east bank of the Xiangzi Bridge to defend Bijia Mountain. At 5:00 pm, 2,000 Japanese cavalry entered the city, carrying light machine guns and broadswords, killing anyone they encountered. Street fighting broke out in the city. The team troops of the Chinese army who had not retreated held firm at Jinshan Middle School. That night, they fought with the Japanese army on Taiping Road, with fires breaking out everywhere, and corpses blocking the ditches in the streets and alleys. The Japanese army attacking Chao'an City consisted of the Mori, Kamei, and Cavalry Teams, and the Tomita, Kan, Oda, Masaki, and Orita units, totaling more than 8,000. There were only a minimal number of Japanese troops along the Chao-Shan Railway embankment road. The able-bodied teams in each village defended their own village gates and did not launch attacks. The counties of Chenghai and Chaoyang are still safe. Wu Qihui led troops to Jieyang and mobilized troops to concentrate on Sangpu Mountain, cutting off the Japanese army's strongholds along the Chao-Shan Railway, preparing to counterattack Swatow.

### Fighting Continues in Pi and Mu; Battle Achievements of the Xu Regiment; Heroic Sacrifices in the Battle of Fangshan; Nearly 100 Japanese Troops Annihilated in the Battle of Dinglou

Taixian Dispatch: Xu Yankun, the regimental commander of the ××× Independent Regiment, was appointed as the regimental commander of the Independent Regiment and the director of the Tongshan Northwest Office in Suining County after the fall of Xuzhou. In July of last year, he rushed to Tongshan to work. On the night of August 28, he led his troops into Xuzhou City and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army all night. Because the supporting troops from all sides failed to launch in time, he retreated to the north of Tongshan City, guarded the northwest districts, and confronted the Japanese army for three months. He also actively reorganized the local area and restored the government. Later, because the Chinese side abandoned Wuhan, the Japanese army mobilized most of its mechanized forces from the front line to carry out a "sweep" of its rear. Feng, Pei, Suining, and other counties fell one after another. Under the pressure of the Japanese army, Xu's troops also abandoned the northwest and led his troops to the territory of Pi. Later, he drove away thousands of puppet troops led by Li Guanying who were gathered on the beach. He was then ordered to go to Huai and Jin to meet with the authorities and received great rewards. The troops were then transferred from Pi to Kai and Shu to take over the city defense of Shuyang. Soon after, Huai and Si fell, and Xu's troops lost contact with the provincial authorities. Therefore, they fought alone and confronted the Japanese army. When the Japanese army besieged Liuyang, Xu commanded his troops to fight fiercely all night. Feeling that his forces were weak, he abandoned Shuyang and took joint action with the ×× Brigade of the ×× Army. In the Battle of Fangshan in Shuyang, the Japanese army gathered thousands of mechanized troops, combined land and air forces, and besieged them on eight sides. The bloody battle lasted for two days and nights and was extremely heroic. In this battle, many Japanese troops were annihilated. Xu's troops were guarding the Zhoudaokou stronghold at the time. Later, because the ×× Army withdrew to southern Shandong, his forces became even weaker and it was difficult to maintain. Therefore, he broke through the heavy encirclement, and many officers and soldiers died or were injured. After the breakthrough, due to the supply problem, Xu came to the province to seek medical treatment for his injuries and to seek instructions from the provincial government. At the same time, he slightly reorganized the remaining officers and soldiers of the regiment. Later, Battalion Commander Li Songtao was responsible for leading them into Pi. They encountered the Japanese army several times along the way and fought several battles. When they reached Dinglou in Pi, the Japanese army again mobilized four tanks, several artillery pieces, and about 1,000 troops from the puppet Wei-Liu bandit unit to pursue and besiege Dinglou. Battalion Commander Li commanded the entire force to fight bravely and fiercely, fighting all day long, killing more than ten Japanese troops and seventy to eighty puppet troops, and finally repelling the Japanese army. The regiment's prestige was greatly enhanced as a result. On April 29, the entire Xu Regiment, in conjunction with the Picheng Regular Army, recovered Picheng. The local people admired Xu's troops for their strict discipline and for repeatedly establishing extraordinary achievements. Various groups and people brought慰勞品 to慰勞 the troops. It is said that Xu Yankun's injuries have now healed, and he will soon start his journey north to lead his troops to continue the war of resistance.

### Along the Coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, All Local Militias are Reorganized; Miscellaneous Troops are Organized into Eighteen Teams; 45th Brigade is Organized into 3rd Division

South Shanghai Dispatch: The coastal area of South Shanghai is where Jiangsu and Zhejiang meet, and it is also an important coastal defense port. After the Japanese landed on Jinshanwei in a stealthy crossing, they stationed heavy troops in Zhapu and Haiyan to control the area. However, due to the activity of guerrillas, the Japanese army suffered repeated losses and knew it was difficult to retreat. The Chinese army took the opportunity to cross over from the Zhejiang-Min coastal line in fishing boats. Three divisions of troops landed one after another and penetrated deep into the interior. They successively recovered the important points of the Su-Jia Road, Hu-Hang Road, and Zha-Ping Road. The Japanese army was under attack from both the front and the rear, and this spring retreated to Pinghu. On the one hand, they occupied Zhangyan, Tinglin, and Nanqiao as a strategic foothold. Although the guerrillas in various places have repeatedly risen up to resist, their strength is limited, and progress is difficult. Currently, the × District Inspector's Office, in view of this situation, has reorganized the militias belonging to the Feng, Jin, and Song counties into the ×th Detachment of the Jiangsu Security Force. At the same time, the Special Commissioner of the Songhu Military has separately reorganized the miscellaneous troops along the coast, added training, and successively established eighteen detachments. According to the defense area, they are divided into two routes, and Yuan and Ruan are appointed as the commanders of the two routes. On the regular army side, the 45th Brigade has also been presented to the Military Commission and approved to be organized into the 3rd Division, all under the command of the Special Commissioner, so as to closely connect with the local army. All highways have been completely destroyed, and all rivers have also been blocked early. Two days ago, due to transportation difficulties, the Japanese side, guided by traitors, secretly transported troops to Zhangyan via motorboats through the Maohu channel. They were defeated by the stationed troops midway, and a lot of military supplies were seized. It is heard that there have also been small-scale skirmishes in Zhapu, Nanping, and Hubei at the same time.

### Japanese Troops Landed at Taixing Port (Incomplete); Bombardment for Weeks, Heavy Losses

Taixing Dispatch: Jiangbei Port is an important port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, under the jurisdiction of Taixing County. Because foreign merchant ships are blocked by the Japanese side, it is difficult to reach the port. Before the war, the Datong, Dada, and Yangtze River lines took this port as their final destination. Most of the goods in Jiangbei are collected here. Since the fall of the Huai and Fu counties, Taixing Port is still held by the Chinese side. The Japanese army has coveted it for a long time. There is also a mobile team under Zhang Shaohua and others at the port, with considerable strength. For days, the Japanese frequently shelled the port to cover the Japanese army's landing, but they have never succeeded. However, the civilian houses have suffered heavy damage. Zhu Lujiu, the county magistrate of Taixing, is cooperating with the military and civilians and has taken strict precautions.

### Changzhou Attacked Twice; Puppet Police Killed on the Spot

Changzhou Dispatch: Since the Chinese army has been counterattacking Yixing and Liyang from time to time, the Japanese puppets in Wujin City are extremely panicked. The mobile team is also taking advantage of the opportunity to rise up. At 1:00 pm and 8:00 pm the day before yesterday, the Dabeimen was attacked twice. The city gate was closed, and puppet policeman Zhu Shuhong was shot and killed at Qingshan Bridge. Several residents were also injured by stray bullets. Residents of Wujin who are timid dare not live in the city anymore.

### Japanese Troops in Zhenjiang Exploiting Gaozi Mineral Deposits; Stone Products Also Being Exploited

Zhenjiang Dispatch: Kato, the head of the Japanese Troops Pacification Team in Zhenjiang, has recently coveted the coal, iron, phosphorus, and lead (for fertilizer) and other mineral products in the Gaozi mining area. He has been secretly cooperating with the Huazhong Mineral Products Company of the puppet Industrial Department to exploit them. As for marble, granite, limestone, pottery clay, graphite, and other stone products, they have been exploited by the Japanese since the fall of Zhenjiang. The materials obtained are all transported to Shanghai.

### Puppet Police Station in Kaiyuan Township, Wuxi, Destroyed; Dazhi Bus Attacked Again

Wuxi Dispatch: In Heliekou, Kaiyuan Township, outside the West Gate, the puppet side has set up a puppet police substation, with puppet inspector Yan Yi and ten puppet policemen on duty. At about 11:00 am on the 27th of last month, more than 20 guerrillas suddenly rushed into the puppet station, captured the puppet inspector and five puppet policemen, and also destroyed the houses. On the same day, puppet township director Jiang Liuchun was also arrested, and relevant documents of the puppet side in his residence were destroyed. The Japanese puppets were very disturbed when they heard the news. The day before yesterday afternoon, a Dazhi bus heading to Shanghai from Xixi on the Xi-Hu Road was attacked, and automatic weapons were used. The driver was injured, seven passengers were hit, four died on the spot, and three were seriously injured. Soon, another car passed by and dragged the car to Changshu to inform the family members of the deceased. As buses on the Xi-Hu Road have been attacked repeatedly, passengers are on their guard.

### Supplying Necessary Goods Foreign Exchange Handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, A Foreign Exchange Review Committee Established for Review, Central Bank Announces Legal Exchange Rate Daily, But the Difference Between the Legal Exchange Rate and the Posted Rate Must Be Paid

Since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese government has strived for equalization of foreign exchange. The Trade Commission controls native goods at ports, and its task is also to increase foreign exchange reserves in order to achieve consolidation. Since the successive fall of various customs points in North China, Southeast China, and then the Jianghan and Guangdong seas, the export of native goods from the mainland has decreased compared to before due to transportation issues. This spring, the British side loaned £10 million in order to stabilize the exchange market and organized an equalization committee in Hong Kong. However, in recent months, customs import surpluses have continued to increase. The legal currency in the occupied areas has also been largely collected by a certain party in an attempt to obtain foreign exchange. In the isolated area of Shanghai, speculative funds have also been concentrated, and there has been a rush to obtain foreign exchange, resulting in increasingly tight foreign exchange and rising gold prices in the past two weeks. According to the wartime financial policy, the Ministry of Finance has specially formulated measures to restrict cash withdrawals in Shanghai. At the same time, in order to protect the foreign exchange level and consolidate the economic barrier, it has successively issued orders prohibiting the import of non-essential goods and announced six rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with the financial community about the impact and relationship of this matter on the local business community. It is understood that in the past, applications for foreign exchange in Shanghai were reviewed by the Central Bank. If approved, they were allowed to purchase at the legal exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence as posted by the Central Bank. However, in reality, these applications accounted for a very small number. As for general importers, they all purchased at the black market exchange rate of more than six pence. This black market is a unique phenomenon in Shanghai, though there are precedents for it in the world. This time, the Ministry of Finance has revised the rules for purchasing foreign exchange without changing the legal exchange rate of the Central Bank, but the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will handle the collection of the balancing fee for the difference between the rate posted by the two banks and the legal rate. Financial authorities predict that the listed price of the two banks will be seven pence, making it the new level of the current exchange rate, but this listed price will sometimes fluctuate slightly to adapt to the market. It is understood that yesterday, the Shanghai Bank of China and the Bank of Communications had not yet received the Ministry of Finance's telegram order regarding the foreign exchange review and handling methods. As for the 236 kinds of goods that the Ministry of Finance referred to as prohibited from import, they are not included in the list of items for which foreign exchange can be purchased. The financial community predicts that the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market will be affected by the measures taken by the Chinese government to consolidate foreign exchange, making it increasingly difficult for speculators to be active.

Review Committee Established, Bank of China and Bank of Communications Handle Affairs

Rules for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods: It is stipulated that if the imported goods operated by importers are not on the list of prohibited imports but are necessary for the country, they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee to purchase foreign exchange, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are designated to handle matters related to applying to purchase foreign exchange. Foreign exchange approved for purchase will be sold by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at the legal rate, but the applicant must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal rate and the rate posted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The application form must clearly state the name, quantity, price, import and sales location of the goods purchased, etc.

Central Bank Announces Legal Exchange Rate

A reporter from the New Life News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank yesterday and learned that after the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, the "Measures for Applying for Foreign Exchange Review" and the "Rules for Applying for Purchasing Foreign Exchange Review" promulgated on March 12, 1938, were abolished. Therefore, the bank will suspend handling matters related to applications for foreign exchange from various industries from now on and transfer them to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications for exclusive handling. Matters related to foreign exchange review will be handled by the Foreign Exchange Review Committee, while the Central Bank will still announce the legal foreign exchange rates daily, namely one shilling and two and a half pence for the British exchange rate and 30 US dollars for the US exchange rate.

Bank of China and Bank of Communications Post Rates and Pay the Difference

The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have all received orders from the Ministry of Finance to comply with them. From now on, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will announce the daily foreign exchange listing prices. Applicants must pay the difference between the legal price of the Central Bank and the balancing fee for the listing prices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. After the implementation of the balancing fee for the import of essential goods, export goods will also enjoy the differential benefits of the export exchange rate, in order to be consistent and fair. Such handling can stabilize the exchange market and prevent unscrupulous people from obtaining foreign exchange. It is a temporary and necessary measure to cope with the environment in extraordinary times.

Hence, the Equalization Committee Continues to Work

From now on, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Management Committee will continue to handle the work of equalizing foreign exchange in accordance with its established policy. As for foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, it will still be supplied by the British-owned HSBC Bank for the time being. Its black market prices are still six and a half pence and twelve yuan and six jiao two fen five li. It is heard that the rates posted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be slightly higher than the black market prices. Therefore, for goods that are not prohibited from import, one may apply to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase foreign exchange. For goods that are prohibited from import, although there are some difficulties in customs enforcement, one must purchase foreign exchange from the black market.

Comparison of Posted Rates and Black Market Exchange Rates

Regarding the rates posted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, according to inquiries made by reporters from the New Life News Agency with the financial community: (1) The British exchange rate is seven pence; (2) The US exchange rate is thirteen yuan and six jiao two fen five li. Compared with the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the British exchange rate is half a penny higher, and the US exchange rate is one yuan higher. However, the reporter inquired about this news from the staff of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China, who stated that they had not yet received an order from the head office. Therefore, as of yesterday, it had not yet been decided when the Shanghai Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would implement the new method of applying for foreign exchange. It is expected that the two banks will consult and implement it after receiving orders from the head office.

### Li Li's Tragic Death in Shanghai, Britain Reserves All Rights, British Consulate in Shanghai Has Informed the Japanese Consul-General to Pay Special Attention to the Request for Compensation

Reuters, London. Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday that regarding the incident of Dr. Li Li's death in a car accident in Hongkou, Shanghai, on April 24, the Foreign Secretary, Halifax, had recently received a report. However, as detailed consideration has not yet been completed, he cannot say what kind of action is appropriate. The British Consul-General in Shanghai has informed the Japanese Consul-General that all rights are reserved regarding the matters that led to the tragedy. Labor Party Member Berenger asked whether Britain has any right to compensation in this matter and whether it is impossible to seek compensation for the loss on behalf of Dr. Li Li's widow. Butler replied that this is the key point of the issue and will naturally be kept in mind.

### After the Circulation of New Transfer Tickets, the Market Becomes More Active, Securities and Other Black Markets Resume Trading, Clearing of Bank and Money Shop Bills Concentrated

Since the banking and money shop industries decided to handle interbank transfers, various banks and shops have provided assets to the bank reserve for use. Yesterday, new transfer tickets have been circulated in the market. At the same time, various banks and shops deposit transfers in the treasury, which are exchanged for legal currency by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. As a result, the number of chips in the Shanghai market has increased, and industry and commerce have become more flexible. Various industry markets have resumed trading. Details are recorded as follows:

New Transfer Tickets: Various banks and shops provide assets to the United Banking Reserve Committee for interbank transfer use. The United Banking Reserve Committee has distributed transfer checkbooks to various banks and shops that have received the transfer. Since yesterday, various banks and shops have put new transfers into circulation in the market. Although the total amount is set at 50 million national currency, only a few million are currently circulating in the market. This amount will gradually increase, up to 50 million yuan. The evaluation committee and inspection committee of the bank reserve will be announced and established after they are hired and introduced.

Transfer of Treasury Association for Legal Currency: The transfers previously deposited by various banks and shops in the United Banking Reserve Committee and the United Money Shop Reserve Treasury, totaling approximately 22 million yuan, have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be exchanged for legal currency by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in twelve weeks. This has been implemented since yesterday. The legal currency released in the first week is 1.8 million yuan. The method of exchanging legal currency is for the banking and money shop treasury to receive legal currency from the three banks and transfer it to the legal currency accounts of various banks and shops. Various banks and shops may withdraw from the reserve treasury at any time.

Various Industry Markets Resume Trading

The securities, cloth, and other black markets previously felt a lack of chips and difficulty in trading due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting deposits and withdrawals. The securities black market was forced to temporarily suspend trading. Now, due to the increase in legal currency and transfer chips in the market, various industries have suddenly become active, so trading has resumed since yesterday. The closing market prices of securities are recorded as follows: Unified Class A 55.8 yuan, Class B 47.6 yuan, Class C 46.5 yuan, Class D 45.8 yuan, Class E 46 yuan, slightly rebounding from before.

Clearing of Bank and Money Shop Bills Concentrated

After the banking and money shop industries decided to concentrate bill clearing, the United Money Shop Reserve Treasury joined the bank bill clearinghouse as Spring Character No. 50. Its 142 member money shops are listed with serial numbers and have been implemented since yesterday. As a result, the exchange amount of the bank bill clearinghouse yesterday increased sharply. Regarding the exchange time, it has been changed to start at 3:30 pm from yesterday, once a day, divided into two types: national currency and transfer.

Transfer Premium May Be Eliminated

After the implementation of the new transfer system, all transactions in various industries will use transfers, which are used in the same way as cash. Moreover, the transfer has reliable reserves and can be transferred to the mainland to supply various industries with the purchase of native goods, which is different from legal currency in that it cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange in the black market. It is said that speculative activities will inevitably be sharply reduced as a result, and the trend of transfer premiums may be eliminated by itself. Members of the Shanghai Money Exchange Association have stated that they will not engage in improper transactions of transfer premiums from now on.

### Famous American Writer Broadcasts in Chongqing, Broadcasting to Europe and America, Stating That Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing and Massacred Civilians, Not Dropping Bombs on Any Military Targets, Praising the Work of Burial and Injury Relief in China

The English-language Great American Evening Post said that the famous American traveler and writer, Crow, recently made a radio speech in Chongqing from a radio station called XGOX to Morrow America, saying that the Chinese people are not afraid of the indiscriminate bombing by the Japanese side. In Chongqing, we occasionally value the sunny morning, but we appreciate this weather with a completely different standard. Chongqing does not welcome the sunshine that urges flowers to bloom and makes the air full of birdsong, because

Sunshine Everywhere

Is the day when Japanese bombers fly to drop bombs to cause death and destruction. Crow continued to describe the three recent air raids on Chongqing, the last of which occurred only a few hours before his broadcast, and he witnessed the entire process of these three air raids. He paid tribute to the bravery of the Chinese firefighters and other emergency rescue teams during and after the air raids, and also said that

The Fires That Arise

Are always extinguished before he goes to bed, and the dead are buried at night, and the dangerous walls of the destroyed houses are made to collapse, and the tiles are piled on the side of the road. By dawn, Chongqing is ready as always. Finally, he said, "Now, if I am lucky, and any Japanese person listens to my broadcast, then I am willing to reveal a very important

Military Intelligence

Your pilots are not bombing any military targets, but are doing their best to massacre as many civilians as possible. In the recent air raid on Chongqing, thousands of civilians died, while soldiers were less than twelve. Mass slaughter cannot complete what you hope for.

This is the Key Point

The Chinese people are not terrified by this. Each new air raid only arouses their indignation and makes them more determined to resist," he said. According to reports, Crow is well-known to the Chinese people and is the author of "I Speak for the Chinese" and "Four Hundred Million Customers." He is now collecting materials for American magazines and plans to write a book about the new China, which will record his views on how China will be after the war.

### Increased Vigilance in the Two Concessions, Detectives Strictly Inspect, Maintaining Security Within the Boundaries

The second week of the "July 7th Incident" is approaching in an instant. The various police stations belonging to the Public Concession Bureau of Works have dispatched a large number of search teams, each with three people, carrying handguns and ammunition boxes, wearing bulletproof vests, and searching vehicles and pedestrians on various main roads and tram and bus stations. It is extremely strict, especially paying attention to the Jiaozhou Road area at the intersection of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road Area, such as Rubenson Road, Pinlang Road, Haifang Road, Changping Road, Connaught Road, Wuding Road, Xinwen Road, Avenue Edward VII, Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc. At night, patrol cars drive through the various roads all night to prevent accidents.

The Chief of the French Concession Police Department, in order to "approach July 7th," has specially strengthened precautions. In addition to dispatching Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives, riding in more than a dozen armored vehicles, patrolling back and forth on various roads within the concession, and organizing search teams, each carrying live ammunition handguns, inspecting pedestrians at various key passes, since the day before yesterday, the Chinese and French detectives from various police stations have been divided into groups to go to various hotels, inns, and other public places within the territory to conduct inspections. Yesterday (4th) at 3 pm, the head of the McClellan Police Station personally led detectives to take buses to inspect rooms in major hotels such as the Ningxing Street, Baliqiao Street, Xinqiao Street, Zhengjiamuqiao Street, Avenue Edward VII, and Rue Cardinal Mercier.

### Replacements for Copper Coins Still Not Resolved, Substitute Vouchers Limited to Local Areas, Postage Stamps Not Based on Copper Coins

The problem of the shortage of copper auxiliary coins in Shanghai has not yet been resolved. However, the tram companies in the two concessions have printed and issued substitute vouchers, so the problem of change for taking the tram has been slightly alleviated. However, other industries still use postage stamps to replace chips below one jiao. Some also have several joint stores issuing a kind of substitute voucher, so the substitute methods for change in the market are quite different. Because this situation has been going on for a long time, there is no inconvenience. However, the actual situation, such as the damage of postage stamps and the increase in retail prices due to the lack of substitutes for numbers below one fen, is clearly obvious. Therefore, after the lack of copper coins, the impact on life is profound.

### Police Department Consults with the Japanese Side to Curb Crimes in the Western District, Head of the Japanese Military Police Hopes to Cooperate, Armed Rioters Will Have No Way to Be Active

The Continental News reported that the Deputy Superintendent of the Public Concession Police Department, Smith, held talks with Major Fujino, the head of the Japanese Military Police in the western district of Shanghai, yesterday morning (3rd), expressing serious concern about the surge in crimes in the western district. This meeting was a continuation of the talks that began after the police of "Great Way" and guards of gambling dens in the vicinity of Yidingpan Road and Zhuanbang Road shot at uniformed personnel of the Police Department on Saturday afternoon. Yesterday, according to reliable sources, the head of the Japanese Military Police stated that he hoped to cooperate with the Police Department to suppress the alarming crime wave, because the "Great Way" area has lax management, and armed rioters have found extremely favorable conditions in the western district to engage in various crimes. These people are accustomed to invading the Public Concession, robbing on the road, and then escaping into the "Great Way" area through many winding paths. The patrols of the Police Department cannot pursue them.

### Eastern Zhejiang Strengthens Precautions, Coastal Situation Tranquil, Fellow Villagers from Wenzhou Take Ship to Fujian and Return to Their Hometown, New Beijing Ship Continues to Sail to Quanzhou

The situation in eastern Zhejiang, since the Japanese army landed in Daishan and Dinghai and gathered a large number of Japanese warships along the coast, harassing various places with artillery fire from time to time, and talking freely about taking military action against Wenzhou, has become tense. According to the navigation industry, the situation in eastern Zhejiang has not changed in recent days. The coastal situation is as tranquil as usual except for the bombing of Japanese warships and aircraft. The residents have been evacuated completely. Liu Jianxu, the commander-in-chief of the Xth Group Army, went to Wenzhou a few days ago to inspect the defense.

Moufu Ship to Sail from Ningbo to Shanghai Tomorrow Morning

The German merchant ship Moufu, with the special permission of the authorities, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo for the last time at about 4 am on the 30th of last month. Unexpectedly, at about 3 pm that afternoon, it arrived at Zhenhai Port, but was blocked from entering due to the blockade of the river mouth, so it had to anchor outside the mouth. Passengers and goods were transferred to barges for loading and unloading and transported into the port. It has been many days since then. According to the company yesterday, the cargo of the Moufu ship can be cleared today, and it is scheduled to return to Shanghai from the mooring tomorrow morning.

Fellow Villagers from Wenzhou Transfer to Return Home

According to the New Life News Agency, the British company Butterfield & Swire agreed to the request of the Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association and shipped more than 80 fellow villagers from Wenzhou, mostly students returning home to visit relatives, from Shanghai to Sacheng, Fujian, at 12 noon yesterday. It is heard that the ship can arrive at Sacheng at about 5 pm on the 6th. Wenzhou passengers disembark, walk to Gu'aotou, then to Pingyang Ruian and reach Wenzhou. It is about 250 li from Sacheng to Wenzhou, and it takes two days to reach the destination.

Japanese Warships Prying on Wenzhou Will Definitely Fail

According to reliable information received by the navigation industry, three Japanese warships arrived at the Huanghua waters of Wenzhou on the morning of the 3rd. First, they launched a motorboat to cruise and pry, and at about 8 am, they fired artillery shells at the shore, reaching more than 20 rounds, all of which were indiscriminate firing. The Chinese side did not suffer any losses. At about 9 am on the same day, three Japanese aircraft bombed and bombed places such as Leqing, and the losses are unknown. The Chinese military authorities at the port of Wenzhou have made strict arrangements, and the defense is extremely strict. Any invasion by the Japanese army will encounter strong resistance.

Chinese Troops Heavily Deployed Along the Coast of Chuanshan

According to navigation news, five Japanese warships are currently anchored in the waters of Chuanshan, and there is also an aircraft carrier. At 7 am on the 4th, more than a dozen artillery shells were fired at the shore. Japanese motorboats cruised along the coast from time to time, harassing constantly. However, the Chinese side had long deployed heavy troops along the coast of Chuanshan and strengthened precautions. The highways connecting Chuanshan to various places that have not been completely destroyed are still being implemented.

Strict Defense in Xiaocheng, Lianjiang

According to news from the navigation industry, five Japanese warships arrived in the waters of Xiaocheng, Lianjiang, Fujian Province, on the morning of the 3rd, firing artillery shells at the shore, and put down several motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese troops, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison waited for the Japanese boats to approach, using machine guns to form a dense fire net and fiercely strafing them. A fierce battle broke out, and the Japanese army failed to succeed. The Japanese warships have not left there so far and seem to continue to have landing attempts. The Chinese garrison has been closely monitoring them.

New Beijing Ship Continues to Sail to Fujian

In order to maintain its legitimate shipping rights in China, the British company Butterfield & Swire normally sends ships to various coastal ports. The New Beijing Ship, which was previously sent to Quanzhou, Fujian Province, has arrived safely. However, because the port has been ordered by the Chinese military authorities to prohibit navigation, the ship can only anchor outside the port. Passengers and goods have been transferred and unloaded by barges. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and will continue to sail the Quanzhou line.

### After Price Increases in Various Industries, Sales of Domestic Goods Suddenly Become Active, Domestic Goods Manufacturers Open Day and Night to Meet Market Sales, Dyeing, Weaving, Knitting, Sock Factories, and Silk Factories Are Extremely Busy

Since the tightening of foreign exchange, foreign goods have increased in price due to increased water fees and higher costs. Various dishes on the market have competed to raise prices in order to maintain their capital. In addition, there is a lack of copper coins on the market, and the level of living is increasing. Ordinary people feel that their income is meager and their income and expenditure cannot be balanced. They are truly unable to bear the burden, and they have all strictly practiced frugality and used domestic goods, such as daily necessities, clothing, and household appliances, resulting in a major blow to the foreign goods market, and sales of domestic goods have suddenly become active. According to news from the domestic goods industry in Shanghai, although domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai are short of raw materials, they all automatically find ways to find and use domestic raw materials instead, and increase production day and night to meet market sales. It is understood that dyeing and weaving factories, electrical machinery silk factories, knitting sock factories, etc., have extremely busy sales, presenting an unprecedented phenomenon. However, due to the obstruction of shipping in various places, local goods have not been able to be shipped to Shanghai in time, so millions of civilians are looking forward to operators of local goods finding ways to collect and transport them so that they can purchase them. It is heard that various industries, in addition to having increased prices by several percent starting on July 1st, still have continued price increases in recent days, such as absorbent cotton, gauze, copper and iron sand casting, Zhongfu soap, and Xinhua red lead. Therefore, if the livelihood of civilians continues in this way, they will feel more and more difficult.

### British Parliamentarians Urge Government to Deal with "Huaxing Bank", Relevant Departments Are Closely Monitoring the Situation

Reuters, London, 4th. Labor Party Member Pradas raised the establishment of the Huaxing Commercial Bank under the wing of the Japanese side and its impact on commerce in the House of Commons today. Undersecretary Butler replied that relevant departments are closely monitoring the situation. Mr. Pradas then asked whether the British government had any concrete suggestions to deal with this danger. Butler replied that one's intentions cannot always be shown to others, but this matter is under full consideration and Mr. Pradas can be satisfied.

### German Diplomatic Officials in China Arrive One After Another

Dr. Adenburg, the German Consul-General in Guangzhou, was ordered by the German government to be promoted to Chargé d'affaires in China. He arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd with the French Ambassador Gossmer on the Dali Company's Klippell ship. The vacancy of Consul-General in Guangzhou was filled by former Counselor of the German Embassy in China, Zippert. As for the newly appointed Counselor of the German Embassy in China, Dr. Bader, he flew from Kunming to Chongqing by plane on the 30th of last month to take over.

### Shanghai-Zhejiang Postal Route Still Under Consideration, Route to Be Finalized After Moufu Ship Returns to Shanghai

Postal delivery between Shanghai and Zhejiang has a tendency to change to the Fujian province due to the prohibition of navigation in Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, the postal bureau transportation stock is still observing whether there are other rapid routes besides passing through Fuzhou. Therefore, it is generally necessary for the Moufu ship to return to Shanghai, inquire about the situation, and then seal and send it.

### A Special City Association Advises on Economy

The Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Union, due to the recent rise in prices and the difficult livelihood of citizens, specially notified the branch associations in various districts to advise citizens to be frugal in their daily lives during this extraordinary period and to work hard in production to overcome difficulties. The association also said that the rise in prices in Shanghai is affected by the tightening of foreign exchange and the high cost of raw materials, but there are also some people who take advantage of the opportunity to make profits by overpricing. It is heard that the association will suggest that the authorities in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce supervise various industries, especially those related to daily life, such as the food industry, the fuel industry, and the sauce garden industry, and strictly set price limits. When necessary, they should also find ways to dredge the source and suppress the selling price to benefit the citizens.

### Intense Battles in Northern Jiangsu, Chinese Troops Stand Firm Amid Fierce Fighting Since Day One, Passenger and Freight Transport Sharply Reduced, Foreign Vessels Face Impending Suspension of Service

Last month, the Japanese, through the Japanese Revenue Officer in the Jianghai Customs, instructed foreign shipping lines sailing to Northern Jiangsu to limit the destination for customs clearance to Qinglong Port. They refused to issue customs documents for ports in Haimen and Qidong counties. In order to maintain their business, the ships continued to call at ports in Haimen and Qidong counties as usual. The Japanese then dispatched a small shallow-water gunboat and several motorboats to patrol the sea, firing on various ports and harassing them in every possible way. They were met with fierce resistance from the Chinese troops stationed there. In order to vent their anger, the Japanese sent planes to bomb Xingang and Lingdian ports, resulting in over a dozen civilian casualties. In addition to reinforcing the Chinese troops stationed at various ports, the Chinese military command in northern Jiangsu ordered a unit of regular troops to coordinate with the guerrillas stationed in Tonghai and Qidong. They selected elite forces and launched a large-scale counterattack by land, dividing into three routes, Bao Xi, Tangjia Town, and attacking the Japanese bases in Yuxi Maozhen and San Chang. Fierce fighting broke out on the first of the month. As a result of the fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy losses. The Japanese troops at the coastal ports only relied on the shelling of warships, but the Chinese troops remained unmoved.

According to shipping industry sources, several Japanese motorboats arrived at Songji Port on the morning of the 3rd, fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers. They carried out a landing with machine gun fire. The local garrison immediately resisted, and fierce fighting broke out. The situation is still chaotic.

Impact on Shipping and Commercial Vessels Docking in Northern Jiangsu

After the outbreak of the war, residents along the ports evacuated to the countryside. Passenger and freight transport in various places was greatly affected, and transportation was hindered. As a result, the British vessel "Yihe" and the German vessels "Jiangding," "Paide," and "Lisha," which sailed from Shanghai to Northern Jiangsu the day before yesterday (3rd), arrived at Qinglong Port, unloaded passengers and cargo, and anchored in the port that night. The "Yihe" was protected by the British warship "Mosquito" and sailed to Sanhe Port to anchor. However, due to the scarcity of passengers and cargo, and boatmen not daring to risk leaving the port, the vessels originally planned to return yesterday remained anchored in the waters of Northern Jiangsu. Only the "Lisha" arrived in Shanghai at 4 pm yesterday and berthed at the Bund wharf. It is scheduled to sail to Northern Jiangsu this morning with the "Tingxi." As of the time of this dispatch, there was no news of the arrival of the "Yihe," "Jiangding," and "Paide" in Shanghai. There were rumors that they were being held up by Japanese warships, but the Dagong News Agency reporter inquired with various companies, and they all categorically denied it. They only said that the vessels were delaying their departure date by one day while waiting to load passengers and cargo.

Foreign Vessels Will Be Forced to Suspend Service

According to a source in the shipping industry, the Japanese originally intended to have Nisshin Kisen Kaisha dispatch ships to join the navigation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in order to control it and compete fiercely. However, this plan could not be realized for a while due to numerous difficulties. Currently, foreign shipping lines are restricted, and the terminating point remains Qinglong Port. The transshipment of passengers and cargo is complicated, and the Japanese and puppet troops along the way extort and harass, arbitrarily creating difficulties. Merchants and travelers hesitate to travel, and business has sharply declined, falling drastically. If this continues, foreign shipping lines will be forced to suspend service. The source sighed deeply.

### Ordering Foreign Rice, Under Negotiation, Inland Areas Also Implementing Restrictions, Must Not Exceed Eighteen Yuan

Some grain merchants in this city entrusted the Daful Foreign Firm in May of this year to order 2,500 tons of Saigon foreign rice. It was originally planned to be shipped to Shanghai in mid-June. However, due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and soaring exchange rates, the foreign firm in charge, in order to avoid losses, telegraphed the production area to stop shipping the foreign rice to Shanghai. They compensated the grain merchants for their losses and settled the matter immediately. However, the price of rice in the Shanghai market, affected by financial changes, soared from a market price of 18 yuan to over 20 yuan, which is equivalent to the current overseas market price of foreign rice. According to the Dagong News Agency reporter, the four grain merchant firms that originally ordered the foreign rice are currently in contact with foreign merchants to order it. The amount is expected to be 1,500 to 2,000 tons. Once the draft contract is signed, a telegram will be sent to the production area in Saigon to start shipping in order to supply the food needs of Shanghai residents.

Market Price Drops Slightly

After the authorities of the two concessions invited rice merchants to discuss and stipulate a new price limit of 21 yuan per stone, the Shanghai rice market was instructed to implement it accordingly. Anyone found to have exceeded the price limit would be punished immediately. The Municipal Council also dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives from the Police Department to station in the market every morning to supervise. Therefore, general speculative hoarders dared not manipulate it, and all market prices were traded according to regulations. However, the highest-quality white rice was still being held back to monopolize and unwilling to sell easily. Although there has been continuous rain recently and a decrease in arrivals, due to limited transactions, both the guest gangs and rice shops have hoarded a considerable amount of goods. During this yellow plum season, they do not dare to import more. The supply of spot goods in the market suddenly exceeds demand, and the market price has slightly decreased and is gradually stabilizing. If the supply from the inland areas is smooth, the market price should fall back again.

Market Prices in Various Places

According to inquiries made by the Dagong News Agency reporter from groups of rice merchants who transport rice from various places, the rice prices in Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Wuxian, Kunshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, and Wuhu, Anhui have been restricted by the local merchants themselves through collective discussions. The highest price for white rice must not exceed 18 yuan per stone, and the highest price for Xian rice must not exceed 16 yuan. As for rice and grain exports, since they were illegally controlled by the Japanese and puppet regimes, the merchants' businesses have been greatly affected, and they have been striving to lift the ban as soon as possible in order to allow free transportation.

### Yesterday Was the American Independence Day, American Nationals Celebrated Enthusiastically, Flag-Raising Ceremony Held at the American School Yesterday Morning, Toast Raised for President Roosevelt at the Luncheon

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that Americans around the world celebrated the national Independence Day on July 4th. American nationals in Shanghai also celebrated this "Glorious Fourth" enthusiastically. According to the scheduled program, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the Shanghai American School on Badang Road at 9 am. Colonel Fagan gave a brief speech, and US Consul General Gauss distributed flags to the American children present. From 11:30 am to 12:30 pm, the US Consulate General hosted a banquet at the Columbia Country Club, inviting only officials and invited guests, raising a toast for President Roosevelt. Members and guests of the American Club also held a luncheon at the American Club from 12:15 pm to 1:30 pm. In the afternoon, baseball and polo matches were held at the racetrack to compete for trophies. In the evening, members and guests of the Columbia Country Club held a dinner party at the club.

### Japanese Naval Spokesman Discusses the Min River Barrage Project, A Portion Will Be Opened to Facilitate the Retreat of Foreign Nationals, Nantai Designated as an Unofficial Refugee Zone

According to the "China Press" newspaper, a Japanese naval spokesman told reporters yesterday (3rd) that the barrage across the Min River in Fuzhou is almost complete. A portion of the barrage will be left open to allow foreigners to leave Fuzhou. The evacuation of foreigners is expected to begin today (4th). In addition, Nantai, opposite the public concession of Fuzhou, has been designated as a non-provisional refugee zone. It has been understood that this neutral zone will not be bombed. However, since the area is very close to Fuzhou, its complete safety cannot be guaranteed. The spokesman also answered questions, saying that no troops have landed on the mainland in Fuzhou. As far as he knows, there are about 100 foreigners in Fuzhou.

### Refugee Relief Association, Key Issues of the Board Meeting

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its sixteenth board meeting a few days ago to discuss the following key issues: (1) Three reports submitted by the Administrative Committee: 1. Number of Refugees: When the Association first started, there were 65,313 people. In the first half of June of this year, the actual number of people receiving supplies, including the second receiving number of self-sufficient refugees, was 3,391, only 51,011 people. The number has decreased. 2. Distribution of US Wheat: In June, a total of 112,000 pounds of US wheat were distributed, and the cost of the supplies was deducted, totaling 6,910 yuan and 04 cents. 3. Purchase of Rice: The Association purchased a total of 9,460 bags of rice, and distributed a total of 3,655 bags in two distributions. There are still 5,805 bags left, and the cost is deducted according to the number stipulated in the supply standard table. (2) Discussion on the case of leasing vacant land on Jiaozhou Road from the Municipal Council to open a refugee factory. Decision: This case is postponed for the time being and will be discussed at the next meeting.

### Japanese Troops in Fengxian and Nanhui Counties Attempting to Invade Eastward

According to a person from Datuan, Nanhui, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese troops in Fengxian and Nanhui counties have recently received considerable reinforcements and are planning to actively invade eastward, attempting to seize Datuan. At present, about 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops are gathered in the triangular area of Xin Chang Town in the seventh district of Nanhui, Zhuqiao Town in the second district (the end point of Shangchuan Road), and Nanqiao Town in Fengxian, posing a threat to the guerrillas. Yesterday (the day before yesterday), two planes went to Nanhui to reconnoiter in the rain. At present, the residents of Datuan Town have begun to evacuate to prevent bombing. It is also heard that the guerrilla captains Ding Xishan, Yu Taosheng, Fan Gencai, and others have simultaneously blockaded water and land transportation. The Chai Chang between Xin Chang and Datuan has been built with strong fortifications. Since the Japanese troops cannot advance by land and it is not easy to invade by water, the plan to attack and disperse the guerrillas along the coast will surely fail.

### After a Heavy Rain in Shanghai, Yesterday Was Invaded by Heat Waves, The Temperature Remained Around Ninety Degrees All Day, The Atmospheric Pressure Was Very Low and the Oppressiveness Reached Its Peak

Since 0:00 on the 1st of this month, heavy rain poured down on Shanghai, and all the roads were flooded. Yesterday, the weather began to clear up, but it was extremely hot. Here are the details:

Oppressiveness Reaches Its Peak

Yesterday at dawn, there was a slight drizzle in Shanghai, but it stopped soon after. From 10 am onwards, the sun broke through the clouds and the weather became extremely hot. The atmospheric pressure was especially low, so it was unbearably oppressive. Even when sitting still and fanning, one still sweats profusely.

Highest Temperature Recorded

According to the reporter from Datong News Agency's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday's heat wave began at 11 am, at which time the temperature had risen to 89.6 degrees. At noon and 2 pm, the highest temperature rose to 94.8 degrees.

Heat Wave Lingers All Day

This kind of heat wave lasted for a very long time. Even at 4 pm, the heat did not subside slightly, and the temperature was still 89 degrees. Compared with the highest temperature of 78 degrees on the same day last year, it is even more unfair.

Today's Weather Forecast

The weather in Shanghai is generally unchanged for the time being, due to the clearing skies in the Yangtze River basin. However, there is currently rain in Shandong and Pinghan areas. Moreover, during this yellow plum season, it is difficult to say whether the weather will remain unchanged.

Patients Admitted to Epidemic Hospitals

Yesterday, there was a large increase in the number of patients in the epidemic hospitals, including gastroenteritis, heatstroke, and dysentery. Epidemics are rampant. This is evident from the fact that the roads in areas such as Kang Nao Tuo Road and Haige Road in western Shanghai still had standing water yesterday.

### Received a Strange Phone Call, A Large Sum of Money Was Robbed, Ordered to Send 2,000 Japanese Yen, Robbed of the Full Amount En Route

At around 8 am yesterday, Rongtai Money Exchange at 286 Broadway, Hongkou, suddenly received a phone call from an unknown caller, saying that someone wanted to exchange 2,000 Japanese yen and requested that someone be sent to 74 Pong Road immediately to deliver the money. After receiving the call, the money exchange sent an employee named Wang to deliver the Japanese yen. Unexpectedly, when Wang was traveling near Pong Road, he was suddenly encountered by several robbers, who threatened him with guns and robbed him of the full amount of 2,000 Japanese yen that Wang was carrying. They then fled in different directions. Afterwards, Wang reported the incident to the responsible police station, requesting investigation and arrest.

### Residence of the Director of the Four Banks Vault Robbed of a Large Number of Valuable Ornaments, Investigation Reveals Theft by the Nanny in Collusion with the Eldest Daughter, The Eldest Daughter Was Arrested and Sent to Court, The Nanny Is on the Run

Mrs. Ye, the concubine of a director of the Four Banks Savings Society Vault (residing at No. 130, Lane 148, Shanzhong Road, French Concession), suddenly reported to the French police a few days ago, saying that the nanny, Da Kua Tou A Jie, hired by the plaintiff Ye Guiji's family, colluded with the eldest daughter, Zhang Chunye (16 years old), to steal 35 small diamonds, 1 large diamond, 1 gold bracelet, jadeite pearls, and 200 Hong Kong dollars, worth a total of about 4,000 yuan, while the plaintiff was moving. After the theft, the nanny took the eldest daughter to hide. Therefore, the plaintiff requested investigation and arrest. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives Sui Wenzhi to investigate and found that the eldest daughter, Zhang Chunye, was hiding at No. 259, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shen Fu Road. They arrested her the day before yesterday and learned that the nanny, Da Kua Tou A Jie, had fled to Songjiang. Yesterday, Zhang Chunye was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special District Court No. 2, where she was questioned by Judge Zhu. According to Zhang's confession, she was instigated by the nanny who was on the run. The police requested an extension because they still needed to arrest the nanny who was on the run. The court approved the request and ordered the trial to be adjourned to the 11th.

### Middle School Teacher Shen Jinru Abused Her Maid and Was Arrested, The Police Prosecuted Her for Assault

Shen Jinru, a teacher at Lequn Middle School at No. 970 Aiweni Road and a native of Changzhou, lives at No. 45, Zengxiang Lane, Kang Nao Tuo Road. In April of this year, Shen received Hu Ronghua, a 12-year-old girl from Jiangyin, as a maid. However, Shen's temper was very violent, and she treated the maid extremely poorly on a daily basis, so that Hu feared her like a tiger.

Recently, Hu suffered from a cough. Shen suspected that it was tuberculosis and was deeply afraid of infecting her own children, so she took Hu Ronghua to live temporarily in her school. In addition to continuing to abuse her, she also did not allow her to eat her fill. One day, she pushed Hu against the wall and beat her, causing an injury to her left forehead. Hu could not bear the abuse, so she ran away privately on the 1st of the month.

Her whereabouts were unknown. Shen then reported it to the police, but Hu was unfamiliar with the place, so she wandered around on the road. She was taken in for two nights by a certain surname. On the 3rd of this month, Wang Shigen, a driver of the Xiang Sheng Motor Company, saw Hu wandering around at the intersection of Aiweni Road and Jiaozhou Road, so he took her to the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

### Husband Injuring Wife Case: Wife Unwilling to Prosecute, Plaintiff Not Pursuing, Court Rules Inadmissible

He Shiqing, a Shaoxing native and salesman at the Tongmao Plush Shop at No. 11 Xingsheng Street in the French Concession, recently found that his wife, Ms. Hu, was extravagant and unruly, indulged in modern trends, and often stayed out all night. Despite his repeated advice, she did not improve. On the evening of the 25th of last month, he went with her to Room 148 of the Asia Hotel at No. 571 Hankou Road for the night. On the morning of the 26th, he went out and bought a kitchen knife, returning to the hotel with the intention of

disfiguring her face to curb her wild ambitions. She resisted, resulting in multiple knife wounds to her head and hands. He did not attempt to escape, remaining in the room until Chinese Detective Song Wenqing of the Laozha Police Station arrived after receiving a report. He was arrested and taken to the police station and then to the Special First Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the criminal court. He Shiqing confessed that his wife's behavior was improper, and he had repeatedly advised her without success, so he intended only to slightly disfigure her and had no intention of hurting or killing her. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police station initially charged He Shiqing with murder, but after investigation, it was found that He had no intention to kill, and the forensic examination of Ms. He Hu's injuries did not meet the conditions for aggravated assault under the criminal law. Therefore, the lawyer was now

prosecuting him for ordinary assault. The court then asked Ms. He if she wished to pursue charges against Mr. He. She stated that she did not wish to prosecute. Judge Feng ruled that assault required a plaintiff to press charges, and since the plaintiff was unwilling to prosecute, the case was inadmissible, and He Shiqing was released.

### French Police Search Haig Road

### Minghe Factory Case: Unclear Accounting Procedures, Defendant Released on Bail, Hearing Postponed

Wang Zuolin, the factory director and manager of the Minghe Textile Factory in western Shanghai, was sued in the Second Special Court's criminal division by Liang Chengao, a shareholder and manager of Yunhua Yarn Shop in Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, for embezzlement of 29 pieces of yarn and fraud. The lawsuit also included a civil suit seeking compensation for the value of the yarn and damages of over 40,000 yuan. The defendant, Wang Zuolin, hired lawyer Wu Peng for defense, who raised questions about the plaintiff's qualifications. Judge Miao Qingbang held a hearing and postponed the matter for further review. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing resumed. On the issue of the plaintiff's shareholder status, Liu Jingfu, a shareholder of Yunhua Yarn Shop, testified in court that the plaintiff was indeed a shareholder and manager. The court confirmed that the plaintiff had the right to sue and proceeded with the hearing. The defendant, Wang Zuolin, stated that as a businessman, he entrusted the management of the factory's finances to Xue Jin'e, the accountant. He knew about the transaction with Yunhua Yarn Shop, but after the war, Xue handled the delivery and did not retrieve or cancel the order. Later, Xue committed fraud by stealing items such as factory belts. After discovering this, he reported it to the police station, and an arrest warrant was issued. However, he only knew that the shareholders of Yunhua Yarn Shop were Liu Jingfu, Xi Shanxian, and Xue Yuquan. After the defense lawyer supplemented the opinion, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to 3:00 PM on the 15th. The defendant was ordered to post a bail of 8,000 yuan and provide a guarantor to be available for questioning. The defense lawyer, Wu Peng, was allowed to act as the temporary guarantor, with three days to provide a formal guarantee.

### Kechi Iron Factory's Iron Stocks Completely Stolen

The Kechi Iron Factory, a Chinese-owned factory near the Taitong Warehouse in Pudong, has been left unattended since the war. A large amount of iron materials stored in the factory, including foreign round iron, iron plates, iron pipes, rebar, angle iron, Z-shaped iron, and T-shaped iron, totaling two to three hundred tons, has recently been insured by rogue elements from the Qichang Warehouse and purchased by a certain iron shop owner. Every night, they use ruffians to transport the stored iron out and sell it to the shop at a low price, who then resells it to the Japanese at a profit. As a result, the entire stock of iron at the Kechi Iron Factory has been completely stolen in recent months, a veritable robbery.

### Renji Hospital Hopes for an Iron Lung: An Interview with Superintendent Batte (Part 2)

— EL

How can a hospital, besides treating "illness," focus on social work? This is a question that most people might have. In fact, this work is an important aspect of Renji Hospital. The following account can supplement Dr. Batte's comments.

The Social Service Department was established only two years ago, but has achieved remarkable results, alleviating the worries of many patients. When patients encounter difficult problems, such as concerns about unemployment, separated relatives, or lack of material support, the department helps them inquire or find solutions. For patients with chronic illnesses or disabilities who have no family to care for them, the hospital takes the trouble to find suitable charitable organizations or other hospitals to take in these unfortunate patients. For destitute patients, the department even raises money for clothing, shoes, or other necessities. After discharge, they visit the patients regularly, providing comfort in terms of morale.

Dr. Batte said that several female missionaries participate in this work, and the director of the Social Service Department is a Ms. Chen. He originally wanted to invite her to talk to me, but she was too busy at the time, so he dropped the idea. Dr. Batte then mentioned other auxiliary work, such as sermons for patients, handicrafts, and providing books and children's toys.

Undoubtedly, this hospital is not just filled with the smell of medicine; it also puts in a lot of effort to relieve the patients' souls and comfort their spirits. What moved me the most was Dr. Batte's last word on this question:

He said, "We cannot think of patients as just flesh and blood; we should show them compassion."

I have excerpted two passages from the hospital's annual report (1938) as follows, which I expect will also evoke the readers' sympathy:

(1) A doctor in the X-ray department reported, "I took an X-ray of a emaciated coolie, dressed in rags, whose foot was injured by the wheel of a handcart. When I talked to him, I found that this person was not just a common laborer, but had received some education. His story is this - he originally did business in Hongkou, but everything was lost. He did not want to enter a refugee camp, and finally found work pushing a handcart. However, his physical strength was not suited for this kind of work, and this accident was due to his weak body. This is just one of the many cases I have encountered this year. Many people used to have good lives, but due to the "war," they were ruined and had to struggle to survive in the lower layers of society."

However, the pity does not stop with the foregoing:

(2) Another report from the ward stated: "We encountered many cases of typhoid fever. After a long period of treatment, what was cured was the "disease," not the "patient." One case was typhoid fever followed by mental illness. When we investigated the patient's background, we found not only that he suffered from malnutrition due to several months of fever and a diet lacking in vitamins, requiring months of careful care, but his state of mind was even more difficult to deal with than his illness. The bad mood was caused by the war. He lost everything, and sometimes even close relatives and friends were lost, or their survival was unknown. I especially remember one patient who was transferred to the refugee hospital by our "Social Service Department." He was the sole survivor in his family. Although his physical condition had recovered to some extent, when he was discharged, he was not yet fully aware and could not walk without assistance. Mending a broken heart is as difficult as treating a sick body."

Too tragic, isn't it?

"You have been to many places, I believe, and within China, which hospital is the most worthy of emulation?" I continued.

"The mission hospitals are the best-run, because they do not only focus on material things," Dr. Batte replied frankly.

"In terms of medical care and modern equipment, can your hospital be compared with public hospitals in other large cities (generally speaking)?"

"In terms of equipment, of course, there are many areas where we are unable to fully equip due to limited resources. In terms of medical care and academics, we are in constant contact with the foreign medical community, and we selectively use new drugs and new medical methods. Moreover, the Lester Institute works with us to conduct pathological research, which is very effective in treatment," Dr. Batte replied.

I thought of the news report yesterday about the American "iron lung man" Snyder arriving in New York, and casually discussed with Dr. Batte, the "insider," the problem of life being completely maintained by science. The superintendent said that their hospital certainly hoped to have such an "iron lung," because people like British automobile magnate Morris had donated huge sums of money to donate several "iron lungs" to major British hospitals.

"But in reality," he said, "even with this equipment, without the huge sums of money to maintain it, then the patient is still a patient, unable to use it. Like Snyder's case, the doctors and nurses are watching over him day and night. If he were not the son of a millionaire, how could this be done?"

"Fortunately, this kind of illness is rarely encountered," Dr. Batte said finally.

I thought to myself that the money to save Snyder's life, if used in this hospital, would reduce the worries of many poor patients and their wives and children about "survival."

If the rich can help the poor, that is truly in line with the meaning of "Renji." I couldn't help but think of the four large characters "Renji Hospital" on the wall outside the hospital, written by the late Bai Longshan native Wang Yiting.

We had almost reached the end of our conversation. Everyone stood up and walked around the room. I asked Dr. Batte, "When is your next vacation back to your home country?"

"In April next year."

"Where is your hometown in England?"

"Very close to London, only half an hour from the ship after disembarking at London."

"Where is your wife now?"

"She and her family are in England now." Dr. Batte's face glowed with a sweet smile, as if he had already arrived in Southampton, and said the above words happily.

I left him in the beautiful reverie of "dreams of home" and said goodbye.

### Concession Authorities Intensify Sanitary Work: Inspect Summer Drinks, Vaccinate Against Epidemics and Prevent Outbreaks

Summer has arrived, and the continuous rainy season has resulted in hot and humid weather, with uneven temperatures and outbreaks of epidemics. Since the war, Shanghai's population has surged, with millions of civilians forced to make a living by setting up stalls on the streets, trading and selling items such as soybean milk, fried tofu, vermicelli, mung bean soup, ice cream, sour plum soup, jelly, lotus root flour, and sweet wine mash. While their business is not bad, there are concerns about their sanitary conditions. In view of this, the concession sanitation authorities have started their routine vaccinations and are paying close attention to the above types of summer drinks. They have sent personnel to investigate the drinks sold by street vendors and conduct detailed inspections to ensure cleanliness. If any drinks are found to contain toxic substances or are unsanitary, the vendors will be ordered to cease operations and will also be fined to emphasize the importance of public health. It is learned that the sanitation authorities have appointed personnel to patrol and inspect various roads and conduct inspections daily to intensify the crackdown on substandard drinks, and to strongly urge vendors to keep the drinks they sell clean to avoid harming consumers. The patrols are also actively carrying out this work to assist in the process. It is heard that the public health department's vaccination center hopes that people from all walks of life will come for vaccinations. The times are clearly specified, and there is no charge.

### Boats Jam the Suzhou Creek Waterway

At about 8:00 AM on the 4th, as ships headed inland were setting sail and a large number of inland vessels were arriving, boats became wedged together on the river surface from the Pentang Lane Bridge to the New Garbage Bridge, causing a blockage of the waterway. As of noon, it had not been restored.

### Chinese Children's Welfare Association Seeks Runaway Mother of Cen Axiao

Cen Axiao (male), a refugee child from Jiangbei, age six, was sent to the Shanghai War Zone Children's Shelter of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association on June 20th by Ms. Ba of the China Inland Mission. According to the report, the refugee child's father died and his mother ran away, leaving him without care. A wealthy family in Mubao (Christians) plans to adopt the refugee child as their son, promising to cultivate his education, be responsible for his marriage, and follow current laws to grant the adopted son inheritance rights to their property. The Shanghai office of the Children's Welfare Association has sent staff to investigate and found the family satisfactory. However, they still hope that the refugee child's runaway mother will go to the association to complete the return procedures within one month from today. If she fails to claim him after the deadline, the association will fully authorize the adoption so that the refugee child can begin to enjoy a new life.

### French Park Brass Band Concert

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert in French Park on the 5th of this month from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM (weather permitting). The program will include seven items.

### Advantages of Wuzhou Internal Vaccines

Summer vaccination has become a common and effective method of epidemic prevention. However, for those who are not accustomed to injections, they can use the new Wuzhou Pharmacy's internally administered vaccines, which have the same effect. There are several types of Anle tablets, including cholera, typhoid, epidemic, and dysentery, all of which are prepared with serum and bacteria. They have three major advantages: (1) no unpleasant reactions, (2) accurate efficacy, and (3) suitable for the constitution of the Chinese people. At a time when epidemics are rampant, they should be purchased and taken to safely pass through the epidemic year. The Healthy Family magazine, published by Jiankang Jiating, the fourth issue, was published today. This issue features writings by famous Shanghai writers Zhou Shoujuan, Yan Duhe, Tianxu Wosheng, and Xiaojizhe, all of which are carefully crafted works. The company believes that the further education of housewives is an urgent matter to be promoted at present, so this week they specially invited female writer Jiang Ping to write "The Problem of Housewives' Advancement" for housewives' reference. There are also two types of symposium records, one is the Family Education Symposium, and the other is the Objects That Family Life Should Adopt Amid the Rising Exchange Rate. The participants are all well-known figures in Shanghai's education and women's circles and are not to be missed. The photo plates in this issue are all works by famous artists Lang Jingshan and Du Ao. The tricolor cover "Ladies' Intimate Affairs" is especially charming and full of ancient charm. It is no exaggeration to say that it is rich in pictures and texts. Each issue is sold for only 20 cents of national currency, and the annual subscription is 2 yuan of national currency. The company is located at 330 Beijing Road, telephone number 19105, and can be subscribed by phone. The general distributor in this city is the China Books and Magazines Company on Fourth Road.

### Amidst Perilous Circumstances: Jinxi Education Actively Promoted; Building Six to Seven Hundred Elementary Schools Amidst Bombardment; Adapting to Needs, Elementary Schools Modified to a Four-Year System

(Jinxi Dispatch) Although the ten counties of the Sixth Administrative District of Jinxi have been lost for over a year, the War of Resistance education is still being vigorously promoted. The current educational status of the district is recorded as follows:

School Education

The Sixth Administrative District, due to its geographically remote location and very inconvenient transportation, did not have very developed education in the past. Only within the cities of Linfen and Xi County were middle schools established. Recently, a Sixth District Public Middle School was established in this area, divided into senior and junior levels, which is currently the highest institution of learning in Jinxi, with a total of about three hundred students. It already started classes on November 1st of last year. In addition, a branch school was opened near the Sixth District He (Fen River) Eastern Affairs Office to educate the youth of the eastern counties of the Fen River. A branch school is also being prepared for opening in a certain location in Fenxi, with the intention of training technical talents for the development of national defense industries. The main focus is still on elementary education. On average, each district in each county has one two-level elementary school, and each village has three to four junior elementary schools. Currently, there are six to seven hundred elementary schools built under bombardment in the entire district, and they are still constantly increasing. Compared to some educationally developed areas, this number is still very small, as the Sixth District consists of ten counties in total. However, it must be understood that this area was originally extremely backward in terms of culture and education, and today it is in particularly difficult circumstances. The Sixth District encompasses these ten counties: Linfen, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Huo County, Lingshi, Fenxi, Xi County, Pu County, Yonghe, and Da Ning. Comparatively, the five counties along the Tongpu Railway at the front have the best results. This is partly due to the fact that the original cultural level here was relatively high, and there were originally more schools than in other places. The curriculum for elementary schools at all levels, in addition to the necessary Three Principles of the People, mainly focuses on three types of textbooks: National Language textbook, Arithmetic textbook, and General Knowledge textbook. There are also courses on air defense and poison gas prevention knowledge, military training, and singing, and a significant amount of time is spent singing songs of national salvation. The teaching materials are mostly adapted to local conditions and are all re-edited, some lithographed and some mimeographed. Due to the difficulty of printing, the education in various places has not yet been fully unified. Currently, the Sixth District Administrative Inspector's Office is stepping up the mass printing of materials using lithography. The reason for separately editing and printing teaching materials here is twofold: first, the teaching materials edited and printed elsewhere are mostly not suitable for the specific needs of the current situation; second, the postal restrictions in the war zone prevent large-scale transportation from the rear. Based on the special environment and actual situation of the district, the situation of the War of Resistance, and its needs, they have temporarily collectively revised the length of elementary school education to four years, two years for junior elementary and two years for senior elementary. However, there is a provision that if work requires it, and if students' performance is particularly good, they can be introduced to national salvation work at any time or promoted to middle school early. Students who do not perform well can also have their study time extended.

Several Characteristics

The new education implemented here has several characteristics. First, all teaching materials are closely linked to the current work of resisting the war and building the nation, creating content related to resisting the war and building the nation. Even arithmetic teaches elementary school students the numbers of foreign horses, airplanes, and cannons, strengthening children's national consciousness. Second, the school authorities do not impose any unreasonable restrictions on students, do not prohibit or suppress students' various activities that are beneficial to the War of Resistance, and also lead students in their national salvation and other activities in all aspects, establishing a democratic and free style. Third, the past system of corporal punishment for students is abolished, eliminating that kind of unreasonable discipline and eliminating the past barriers, hatred, and fear of teachers among students. Teachers and students' lives are integrated into one. Fourth, adapting to the special and difficult environment during the War of Resistance and national construction, a style of hard work and endurance is established. Teachers do not have good classrooms and desks and sometimes conduct lessons outdoors underground. Fifth, they fully promote the spirit of collective learning. Students who learn well also automatically organize group meetings, lecture meetings, singing teams, etc., after class and outside of collective life. Sixth, learning and practice are linked together. Most elementary school students organize propaganda teams, etc., to work in the countryside or help the village self-defense teams to stand guard and patrol, check pedestrians, etc., after studying. Seventh, in general, the Boy Scout training in schools is changed to strict military training, which is also one of the important characteristics of education here.

Social Education

Especially since the beginning of the restoration of governments at all levels, the training of cadres has also become a very important educational task. These trainings are mostly short-term, implementing the policies of the War of Resistance and basic knowledge of the War of Resistance. The most common are the cadre training classes organized by governments at all levels, which are divided into many types such as administration, education, village chiefs, neighborhood chiefs, district chiefs, and village self-defense teams. The main purpose of cadre training is to cultivate and select new cadres, improve backward or weak cadres, and unify the political understanding of cadres and their new work style. The work of social education is being rolled out relatively slowly, but everyone is already paying exceptional attention to this work. In general, it is being promoted through people's schools, literacy classes, and small organizations of mass groups, and supplemented by public performances of dramas and singing. At this current stage, the promotion of social education in various places is being concentrated on universality.

### Cai Zimin Introduces: Guidance for Applying to Universities and Middle Schools, Authored by Director Lu of the Provincial Shanghai Middle School

Currently, middle and elementary school graduates are preparing to apply to universities and middle schools. Lu Shaoji, the director of instruction at Provincial Shanghai Middle School, has specially authored two books, "Guidance for Applying to Universities" and "Guidance for Applying to Middle Schools," in response to the needs of students, explaining the purpose and methods of further education. Cai Zimin has specially written a preface to introduce and praise the two books, affirming that they are indeed a guide for those aspiring to further their education. The content includes: (1) the content and nature of major universities and middle schools; (2) school fees and future prospects; (3) examination methods and preparation.

### Inter-Port Swimming: Hong Kong Seeks Gathering; Discussing Economic Issues; Chinese Are Not Excited

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong Victoria Sports Association convened a meeting last night (June 26th) to discuss matters related to the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-port swimming competition in mid-September. The various Chinese sports organizations lack enthusiasm, with only the YMCA having a representative in attendance. Other attendees included representatives from the European YMCA, the Military Sports Association, and the Victoria Club.

First, the convener of the Victoria Club, Mr. Gettins, stated that Mr. Li Chuzeng of the Victoria Club had sent a letter to the Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association, and had subsequently received a reply from the Shanghai side inviting the Hong Kong team to come north in the first or second week of September, and requesting the Hong Kong team's agreement on the events and scoring methods. The Victoria Club agreed to accept the invitation and proposed the following events: 50, 100, 220, 440, and 880-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, 100-yard breaststroke, fancy diving (1-meter board), 180-yard medley relay (3 people per team), 240-yard freestyle relay (4 people per team), and water polo. The scoring method is 5, 3, 1. The winners of water polo and relays get 5 points.

Mr. Lopes then expressed the opinion that he proposed the All-Shanghai Championships be held on August 15th, and the inter-port team could be used as a reference. Mr. Gettins pointed out the economic problems of the inter-port team, with the income from the pre-selected tickets for the inter-port team being used as a special fund for the inter-port team. Finally, Mr. Lopes expressed the opinion that since there were no representatives from the Chinese Association attending this meeting, a letter should be sent to inform them and inquire whether the Chinese Association has inter-port talent, and if so, whether they are willing to bear the travel expenses of those selected. A meeting will be held to discuss the matter after the Victoria Club receives a reply from the Chinese Association.

Science and Life

### Imperial Examinations and Science

— Ji Qian

To study for truth and to study for false fame, the interest is very different. To seek knowledge for the benefit of mankind and to seek knowledge for wealth, the purpose is very different. Because of the difference in interest and purpose, the spirit of scholars is divided. One devotes oneself to it for life, with the ambition to die in the evening if one hears the truth in the morning. The other relies on what one has learned as a stepping stone, and abandons it halfway once one gets what one wants. Are those in our country who engage in science with the spirit of seeking imperial examinations not similar to the latter? When they are studying at school, they only know to compare the high and low scores of each exam, and it is the greatest honor to graduate with the highest score. When doing specialized research with famous teachers at foreign universities, their purpose is to gain honor, obtain higher degrees, and reluctantly hone themselves in the hope of winning the praise of professors. When they return to the country, they think that what they have learned is enough to amaze the people of the country, and they only want to obtain a good position and generous remuneration so that they can live a life of ease. This is no different from the hard work of studying by the lamp and window in the era of imperial examinations, spending years memorizing, and then putting the classics aside and never looking at them again after passing the examination. With such a spirit, how can one expect them to fight against difficult environments, engage in scientific research, break new ground, and create a way out? Unfortunately, there are not a few people like this, and the drawbacks of the imperial examination system have penetrated deep into people's hearts. Science in the country has not been able to make profound contributions in the past few decades, nor has it been able to popularize it among the people, mostly because of this reason, which is regrettable. The mistakes of the past should serve as a warning for the future. Today's young people in the country who are engaged in science should strive to correct the mistakes of their predecessors. They should cleanse and purify the spirit of people in the era of imperial examinations. To study for the sake of knowledge, one must not be concerned solely with grades, degrees, and all false honors. One should devote oneself to the study of things, the acquisition of knowledge, and the practical learning that benefits people's lives, making it a lifelong endeavor. As long as there is breath, one should not slack off. Then science in the country may have the hope of development, and the country and people will benefit greatly.

### Animal Famine Prevention

— He Shan

Years of famine and starvation, the roads are littered with corpses, the tragedy of mankind. Therefore, countries and societies are all eager to take famine prevention measures. However, animals also have ways to prevent the threat of hunger. In general, there are five methods: 1. Fasting, such as fish that do not need to eat when food is scarce in winter, relying only on the oxygen in the water to maintain their lives (those who raise goldfish all know this phenomenon). 2. Changing diet, such as birds that eat all kinds of insects, but change to eating plant seeds when insects are not available in winter. 3. Hibernation, such as frogs, turtles, and a small number of mammals that naturally stop the work of metabolism in their bodies because it is not easy to get food in winter, and then enter the ground to spend the harsh winter. Avoiding the cold is avoiding hunger. 4. Migration, such as locusts that devour the crops in a certain place. Once the food supply is insufficient, they migrate in groups, looking for new areas to find food. In winter, crows gather in groups to forage, going out in the morning and returning in the evening, which everyone can observe. The migration of other birds and rodents, although for other reasons, is primarily for escaping famine and finding food. 5. Storing food, such as field mice (also known as搬藏) that try their best to take grains and hide them in their underground nests when autumn crops are harvested, in order to be prepared for when the ground is covered with ice and snow in winter and there is nothing to eat. Squirrels are the same. In autumn, they must take acorns and store them in their nests as winter provisions. There are many other animals with this phenomenon, but the most obvious are ants, whose group-moving of food and determination are amazing. If a worm is found by an ant, and one ant is not enough to carry it, several ants will come to help. Before long, dozens or hundreds of ants will come, working together with one heart, persevering. Even though the worm struggles desperately and cannot escape, it is eventually transported to the nest by the group of ants and enjoyed by the public. Ants like to drink the "honey" of aphids and even protect aphids. In warm winter weather, ants always transport aphid larvae to the sun to expose them. When the humidity is too high, ants must transport the aphids to a dry place and settle them properly, just like farmers caring for dairy cows, in order to ensure that their drinks are not exhausted.

### Coal Gas

— Mu Chang

Coal gas is obtained by dry distillation of coal without contact with air. Coal is composed of a mixture of many substances, mainly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with trace amounts of nitrogen and sulfur. Dry distillation yields coal gas, coal tar (also known as coal fat, commonly referred to as asphalt), and coke (refined coal). In the past, coal tar was considered useless, but in modern times, its importance is recognized as no less than other substances. The demand for coke has also increased rapidly with the development of the steel industry. Millions of tons of coal are used annually solely for the production of coke.

The type and quantity of substances obtained from coal distillation depend on the type of coal used and the temperature during dry distillation. In a typical coal gas plant, the yield is approximately: 10,000 cubic feet of coal gas, 120 pounds of coal tar, 25 pounds of ammonium sulfate, and 1,500 pounds of coke per ton of coal.

The coal gas produced in the still first passes through water and then through a long condenser pipe to condense water vapor and coal tar. The ammonia gas (i.e., ammonia) is not completely dissolved, so it then passes through a high tower where it is absorbed by spraying water. However, the coal gas still contains hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, which are harmful substances. Therefore, it must come into contact with moist lime to absorb carbon dioxide and iron oxide to absorb hydrogen sulfide. Finally, it is stored in a round gas holder, ready for distribution to users for combustion.

The coal gas contains more than ten types of gases, with hydrogen being the most abundant. Hydrogen gas burns with a colorless flame. Carbon monoxide is similar. Methane also has very little luminous flame. Only unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, produce a luminous flame when burned. The luminosity of a coal gas flame is due to the presence of such gases. Unsaturated hydrocarbons have a different ratio of carbon and hydrogen atoms in their molecules compared to substances in the methane series, containing less hydrogen. The carbon is not fully combined with hydrogen, hence the term unsaturated.

Why do flames of the same kind vary greatly in their light emission? When hydrocarbons decompose, tiny carbon particles are dispersed in the flame and become incandescent due to heat. If a cold object touches such a flame, soot is often seen falling on the surface. In ordinary flames, carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide by oxygen and dispersed into the air, thus not forming soot. A close examination of a flame reveals it is roughly divided into three layers. The inner layer contains unburned gas and is non-luminous. The middle layer is where the gas ignites, and the carbon becomes incandescent. The outer layer is very thin and is where the carbon is in complete combustion with the air. Therefore, the more carbon particles in the middle layer, the brighter the flame. Unsaturated hydrocarbons release many carbon particles during decomposition, so substances that contain these compounds will produce a luminous flame when burned.

Not only can flammable gas be produced by distilling coal, but a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, known as water gas, can also be obtained by passing steam over hot coke. This gas burns without light, but its production cost is lower. To make it luminous, it is only necessary to add unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds.

Sometimes coal gas is used not as a light source, but for the heat it generates when burned, such as in gas stoves. This is because before combustion, it is mixed with an appropriate amount of air, so that sufficient oxygen is available during combustion for complete combustion, leaving no residual carbon particles, resulting in a non-luminous flame that produces much more heat. This method was invented by the German scientist Bunsen. A small, suitably sized hole is opened on the gas pipe near the burner, allowing the gas to draw in air as it jets toward the burner, mixing with it before ignition at the burner. If oxygen is used instead of air, the flame burns even hotter, as air contains a large amount of nitrogen, which interferes with combustion and reduces its heat. However, a mixture of oxygen and coal gas is prone to explosion upon ignition, requiring special equipment. The design of the blowpipe achieves this. The pipe is divided into two layers, with oxygen flowing through the inner pipe and coal gas exiting from the outer pipe, igniting at the pipe head. The flame is very hot. If it is directed onto a heat-resistant material, such as lime, it emits a very bright light.

In addition to coal gas and water gas, producer gas is another gaseous fuel made from coal. It is formed by passing air through a generator containing red-hot coke, resulting in a mixture of carbon monoxide and nitrogen. Mond gas is formed by passing air and steam over hot coal, resulting in a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

### X-Ray Motion Pictures

— Yuan

A Belgian radiology expert has recently designed an X-ray camera capable of capturing motion pictures to assist doctors in studying and diagnosing diseases of the body’s internal organs. The machine does not just take one picture at a time; it can quickly take a series of large X-ray films. These specially made films are mounted on a drum driven by an electric motor, as shown in the picture above. After being made, they are copied onto ordinary motion picture films. These films are loaded into a projector and projected onto a screen at any speed for research purposes, and all the movements of the internal organs of the human body can be vividly displayed on an ordinary screen.

Scientific Anecdotes

### Talk of Peach Blossoms (Continued)

— Kyoka Yashi

However, we must distinguish between different things. In the case of sexual desire, which is similar to appetite, men and women are almost the same, but women are relatively weaker, and some even do not understand the pleasure of sexual intercourse throughout their lives, yet they still bear children. This point is not often discussed by sexologists, but it is of great significance to both men and women. Imagine one party using any means as a tool to achieve that, while the other party sees that as an insignificant formality, or as a fixed ceremony at the end of a great accomplishment, but becomes fascinated by any methods used beforehand, expecting them to be cashed at any time. In this case, both parties will inevitably be disappointed and frustrated. Some of you may think I am exaggerating, but let me give an example. If you list many love letters and record many sweet words, you will find that there is no new meaning in them, just like cats calling in spring, always the same tone every year. However, cats still call, and love letters and sweet words still come, why? Because these are all tools. Like an axe, you use it, and he uses it, this year, and next year, why would everyone need to change the form, or change the tools every year? Tools only need to serve their purpose, it doesn't matter if they are cashed.

I don't feel there is anything mysterious about love itself, but all the misunderstandings that arise from men and women not knowing each other. As for the motivation of love between men and women, it is governed by so-called internal secretions, which may be a little mysterious. Ending the talk of peach blossoms like this can be said to be the end of deep red, which will make Dr. Zhang laugh (The End).

Atomic "Shards"

If a housewife accidentally burns her finger in the kitchen, how much "nerve current" is required to tell her brain the extent of the damage? Research engineers at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States have recently developed a vacuum tube so sensitive that it can detect the faint current of energy from nerves, count the "shards" knocked off atoms by cosmic rays, and measure the acidity and alkalinity of blood. This vacuum tube, which has not yet been named but is called "RH-507," can help geologists determine the age of the Earth by detecting radioactivity in rocks.

Mr. R.A.C. Brie of the United Kingdom recently demonstrated a jump-start autogyro in Kemble. The aircraft does not need to fly forward when taking off and lands almost vertically. The British Navy has ordered this type of aircraft, and the Army may also adopt it. According to tests, the effectiveness of this type of convertible aircraft is greater than that of any helicopter previously built.

Freezing Gasoline

A pilot from Bulgaria, Jordanoff, recently suggested using "frozen" gasoline as fuel for aircraft to reduce the risk of fire. This type of gasoline has been demonstrated in the United States. Its temperature is very low, and it takes fourteen seconds for a blowtorch to ignite it. Jordanoff's cooling method uses alcohol and dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) to lower the gasoline's temperature to 150 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. At this temperature, the gasoline does not ignite but remains liquid, allowing it to flow freely from the fuel tank into a heater, where it is prepared for use in the engine.

The World's Most Powerful Locomotive

A locomotive recently built in Valenciennes, France, is the most powerful in the world. When fully loaded with fuel and water, it weighs 160 tons. It will run on the coastal railway line in Africa. The area along the coast is rich in forests, so it will use firewood instead of coal as fuel.

### Finance: First Day of Implementing the New Exchange System; Financial Market is Quite Stable; Bank Withdrawals and Deposits Also Calm Down

Starting yesterday, banks and money shops began to use the new exchange system, bank reserve requirements, and all exchange deposits held by each bank and shop as of June 30 (including interest for June) were converted into legal tender at 95 percent and credited to the respective banks' and shops' separate accounts in national currency. From yesterday, each bank and shop can withdraw cash in equal installments over twelve weeks (every Tuesday) or transfer it to national currency current accounts for withdrawal. Based on the total reserve requirements and exchange held by each bank and shop as of June 30, totaling 22 million legal tender, each bank and shop can withdraw more than 1.8 million legal tender per week for circulation. As for exchange certificates, there seems to be no need to issue them under the current circumstances because the current exchange in use on the market is still the exchange of checks paid by each bank from bank reserves. Furthermore, money shops also joined the bank reserve exchange yesterday, so the clearing of checks is now in one place. With the implementation of the new exchange system, if Bank A collects 500,000 legal tender from the exchange of checks on the same day, it will deposit the funds into its reserve as exchange deposits, without needing to use exchange certificates. If Bank B pays out 100,000 legal tender from the exchange of checks on the same day, it will need to provide collateral to apply to use exchange certificates from the reserve, and interest will be calculated according to the interest rate for exchange certificates used by other banks announced by the reserve. As for the provisional total exchange amount of 50 million legal tender, it is only a limit, and the actual exchange of checks each day may not be that large. The implementation of the new exchange system is a matter between banks and money shops and does not have a significant impact on the market, so the market was quite stable yesterday, and the bank withdrawal and deposit rush also calmed down.

### Discount Rates Soar; Gold Market Suddenly Plunges; Buyers Stand Back to Watch; Northern Banks Continue to Dump Aggressively

Yesterday, the black market price of cash gold plunged because the internal exchange rate slightly rebounded, and sentiment was slightly weaker than during the holiday. The opening price reached 2,592 yuan. Although northern banks entrusted money changers and securities firms to sell, the southern China and Hong Kong banks had strong demand, and retail investors also made some purchases, so the situation was relatively stable. At noon, it was still hovering around 2,590 yuan. In the afternoon, news that exchange discount rates had soared to 95 yuan caused buyers to hold back and watch. In addition, northern banks continued to dump aggressively, so the price plunged, once falling to a low of 2,550 yuan. Afterward, retail investors took advantage of the low price to buy again, pushing the price back up to 2,560 yuan at closing. As a result, the price fell 28 yuan compared to before the holiday, but it fell 40 yuan compared to the black market price during the holiday. The trading volume was still strong at more than 1,100 taels. The price of gold jewelry also fell 4 yuan. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged compared to before the closure of the market.

Cash Gold Plunges 28 Yuan

The initial price per tael (ten liang) in the morning was higher because news of the exchange rate recovery caused sentiment to be slightly weaker than during the holiday, and money changers and northern banks had strong selling intentions. However, the southern China and Hong Kong banks had strong demand. First, a money changer vigorously sold 150 taels to a gold shop (representing the Hong Kong banks) at a price of 2,592 yuan, which was the opening price, 4 yuan higher than the closing price before the holiday (i.e., the noon closing price of June 31), and slightly lower than the black market price during the holiday. Then, the gold shop, representing the Hong Kong banks, bought 50 taels each from the money changers and securities firms (who were selling on behalf of the northern banks), also at a price of 92 yuan. Soon after, a jewelry shop also bought 50 taels from the money changers, representing the Hong Kong banks, still at a price of 92 yuan. At that time, the northern banks were offering more aggressively, and the market trend was weak. The securities firms then vigorously sold 50 taels to the jewelry shops, representing the Hong Kong banks, at a price of 91 yuan, and then another 50 taels to a gold shop (representing the Hong Kong banks) at a price of 90 yuan. Later, the jewelry shops also sold 20 taels to other jewelry shops and 30 taels to the money changers, all at a price of 90 yuan. After that, the northern banks continued to dump, further weakening the market, breaking through the 90 yuan barrier. The securities firms sold 50 taels to a jewelry shop (representing the Hong Kong banks) at a price of 89 yuan, and another 50 taels at a price of 88 yuan. At that time, the northern banks stopped dumping, and the trend suddenly turned upward. The money changers bought 50 taels of cash gold from the gold shops on behalf of retail investors at a price of 90 yuan. At noon, the price jumped 2 yuan. The money changers bought 50 taels from the cash gold shops, with 92 yuan as the noon closing price. The initial price in the afternoon was still stable. First, the gold shops sold 50 taels to the money changers at a price of 92 yuan. At that time, the money changers and securities firms again vigorously dumped on behalf of the northern banks. Moreover, at that time, buyers heard that the exchange discount rates were high, reaching more than 90 yuan, so they mostly watched and waited. The price of gold plummeted, and the money changers sold 50 taels to other money changers on behalf of the northern banks at a price of 88 yuan. After that, the selling pressure from the northern banks was extremely strong, and they vigorously sold more than 200 taels. Moreover, the retail investors' buying appetite was sluggish, so the situation in the market suddenly became chaotic. The market price was under the control of selling pressure, plummeting to a low of 50 yuan. Afterward, the selling pressure slightly weakened, and retail investors rushed to absorb at the low price, causing the market to suddenly turn upward. The money changers traded 50 taels with each other at a price of 55 yuan, and then the price rose another 3 yuan. The money changers bought 50 taels from the cash gold shops at a price of 58 yuan. Later, the securities firms sold 50 taels to the money changers, and the price fell back to 55 yuan. Then, the money changers sold 50 taels to the gold shops at a price of 56 yuan. Later, a broker, on behalf of retail investors, bought 20 taels from the jewelry shops at 2,560 yuan as the closing price in the evening. As a result, the price plummeted 28 yuan compared to before the holiday. After the market closed, the potential trend was firm, and the money changers sold 50 taels to the jewelry shops at a price of 65 yuan. The high and low prices for the entire day differed by 42 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shops' own brand gold was 2,570 yuan, and the buying price was 2,555 yuan. According to inquiries, there were few transactions at the current standard gold price, which was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Jewelry Gold Falls by 4 Yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in the jewelry shops did not change because the price of cash gold changed very little. However, at 2:30 PM, the price of cash gold suddenly plunged, so the price was lowered by 2 yuan. Half an hour later, it fell another 2 yuan. After that, there were no further changes. The total decrease was 4 yuan. Datonghang changed the listed price to 259 yuan, and Xintonghang changed it to 257 yuan. The buying price was 251 yuan.

British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

A London telegram from the 3rd stated that the price of British pure gold was £7 8s 6.5d per ounce (the same as before the holiday), so the Central Bank's buying price of Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed price of customs gold also remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The price of Shanghai standard gold also remained at 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Although Japanese Businesses Continuously Come to Settle Accounts, the Exchange Rate Still Shows Stability with a Slight Ease

Yesterday's exchange market situation: the HSBC listed price remained unchanged, and the black market opened strong. Since the implementation of the method of restricting the withdrawal of legal tender by the Ma Dian on the 22nd of last month in this city, people could not avoid being panicked for a time. After the results of the meeting and discussion of the banking and money industries, it was decided to issue a new exchange of 50 million yuan attached with ancestral guarantees from this day onwards, in order to regulate the development of the same industry and industry and commerce. Therefore, the financial situation in this city is gradually stabilizing. At the beginning of the exchange market opening, because foreign firms' selling intentions turned stronger, it opened strong. Afterward, although Japanese firms, foreign firms, etc. frequently came to buy, because foreign firms were quite willing to supply, there was no change in the middle. Although the Japanese firms and Sassoon, a Western merchant, fiercely competed to buy July futures, the foreign firms' supply source was also smooth, so the market situation was quite stable. However, the current spot premium for July, the British exchange rate is 25, the US exchange rate is 4375, and the monthly interest rate excluding commission (calculated according to the 27th) is approximately 4 percent. However, the arbitrageurs actually only have 3.34 percent. Trading was still strong in the morning, but suddenly cleared in the afternoon. The Hong Kong exchange rate also saw a slight recovery because foreign firms' selling intentions were stronger.

Sassoon Buys July Futures

At the beginning of the morning, the closing price of the wheel turn was higher than the recent date by 25 and lower than the distant date by 1875. The New York silver price did not change, and the London refined gold also did not change. The exchange rates for British to US, British to Shanghai, all remained unchanged. Small change for British to French, American to British, American to Shanghai, American to French were all level. The Central Bank's listed prices for various exchanges remained as before. At the opening in the morning, the bank's selling price for spot exchange, the British exchange rate was 6 pence and 5625, the US exchange rate was 12 yuan and 75, which were higher than before the holiday, the British exchange rate increased by 03125, the US exchange rate hardened by 0625. After the opening, although Japanese and foreign firms frequently bought spot pounds, because the Bank of England HSBC, etc. were quite willing to supply, the process lacked change. The Japanese and foreign firms successively bought spot British gold from HSBC and Macquarie, all at 6 pence and 5625. HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to still be exempt. After that, the Japanese firms and Sassoon competed to buy July British and US exchanges, but the British and US banks' selling intentions were also strong, so the market situation was still extremely mediocre. The Japanese firms and Sassoon bought July British gold from HSBC and Macquarie at 6 pence and 3125, and also bought July US exchange from Chase Bank at 12 yuan 25 and 3125. At that time, the foreign firms started to buy spot US exchange from a certain bank at 12 yuan 75, and the situation was also calm. Near noon, only Hong Kong exchange trading occurred. The Dutch firm sold to a foreign firm at a spot price of 44 yuan and 125, and the situation was slightly firm. By noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices for British and US exchanges were about the same as the morning opening.

Aftermarket Trading Suddenly Becomes Scarce

Aftermarket transactions suddenly became scarce, and British exchange rate trades were not heard of. Only Japanese firms bought spot prices for the US exchange rate from American banks at 12 yuan 78125 and 75. Later, only the foreign firm Ander sold to money changers at a spot price for Hong Kong exchange rate that was still at 44 yuan and 125. The market situation was extremely quiet, and prices rarely changed. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices, the British exchange rate was 6 pence and 5625, the US exchange rate was 12 yuan and 75, both the same as the morning opening. As a result, compared to before the holiday, the British exchange rate loosened by 03125, the US exchange rate hardened by 0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate, according to the closing price, was also cheaper by 125.

Hong Kong Exchange Market is Quite Stable

A Hong Kong telegram from the 4th stated that the exchange market this morning opened stably. US exchange rate futures shrank by 0625, Shanghai exchange rate spot exchange rose by half a yuan, Japanese exchange rate spot exchange shrank by 125, and the rest remained unchanged. At 2:30 PM, except for the Shanghai exchange rate spot exchange returning to half a yuan, which was still 224 yuan, the rest were stable. Later, the Shanghai exchange rate rose again by half a yuan, returning to the original price heard in the morning.

### Foreign Currencies Decrease Very Quickly; Only Japanese Gold Tickets are Firm and Strong

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a cent, and the British-US exchange rate did not change. The foreign exchange bank settlement in this port has passed, and the US Independence Day is approaching, so the demand for American firms is even rarer. The supply of foreign banks is smooth, and the market situation is slightly firm. The British exchange rate is 6 cents and 5625, which is looser than the settlement before 03125, and the US exchange rate is 12 yuan and 78125, which is also looser by 03125. At the opening of cash gold, the buying intention of gold shops was excited, and the market price was 2,592 yuan, which was higher than the closing price before by 4 yuan. Afterward, the market price hovered around this price, and the market price was quite stable. At the opening in the afternoon, the market price was still 92 yuan. Suddenly, the supply from the Tianjin gang became very strong, and the buying demand of gold shops, money changers, etc. was very sluggish, so the market price decreased greatly, reaching 2,550 yuan as the lowest price. Later, customers took advantage of the low price to slightly absorb, and the market situation slightly improved. The evening closing price was 2,556 yuan, which was lower than the closing price before by 28 yuan. Due to the sharp drop in the price of cash gold, the demand for British-American gold pounds was sluggish, and the market price plummeted. British-American gold tickets, which originally soared due to the need for settlement, are now no longer necessary, and the exchange rate is trending toward loosening, so they are rapidly falling. The demand for Hong Kong tickets, French francs, Dutch tickets, etc. is rare, and all announced a decrease. Only the demand for Japanese gold tickets is high. The evening market price was 9 jiao 9 fen 8 li. Korean tickets were weak, at 8 jiao 8 fen 7 li. There was no transaction in the Guild. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds decreased by 1 yuan, British gold tickets decreased by 4 jiao, American gold pounds decreased by 1 yuan 5 jiao, American gold tickets decreased by 1 jiao 9 fen and a half, Hong Kong tickets and Annam tickets each decreased by 1 fen, French franc tickets decreased by 1 li and 2 hao and a half, Singapore tickets and Robi tickets each decreased by 2 fen, Dutch tickets and Philippine tickets each decreased by 5 fen, and the other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities Public Debt Principal and Interest Hopeful, Unified Class A Shares Show Largest Gains, Foreign Debt Already Seeing Recovery

Securities on the gray market, suspended trading temporarily from June 23rd due to multifaceted environmental changes and to safeguard the interests of fellow traders, resumed trading yesterday. The market has generally stabilized, and trading volume has significantly decreased. Both buyers and sellers are largely adopting a wait-and-see approach. According to observations from financial circles and the general public, there is no doubt about the payment of principal and interest for the seventh unified public debt due on July 31st. However, some believe that interest payments may need to be made in Chongqing. Given that the authorities have not yet officially announced this, the public remains skeptical. Considering the government's painstaking efforts to maintain financial stability and curb inflation, it is showing a determination to maintain creditworthiness. During the temporary trading halt, individual buying and selling activities continued to some extent, with fluctuating market prices, generally varying by no more than two yuan. Therefore, the market opened quite stably yesterday morning. Numbers 22 and 41 were absorbed at market prices, rising by one yuan. Tiansheng, Chengkang, and Hengfu saw some selling, while Tongshun took advantage of the low prices to buy. By the end of the half-day, Class A shares had rebounded by "one yuan and six jiao," and the rest were slightly better, rising by one or two jiao to six jiao. The total transaction volume did not exceed 300,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below. Trading was suspended in the afternoon due to the hot weather, as usual.

Stock trading included the sale of Shanghai Zhabei Electric Power Company shares, priced at six yuan and three jiao for 40 shares.

The general public association has been on holiday for several days, and investors still have no intention of making any transactions. Therefore, the market in this city is quiet, with few settlements yesterday. Brokers are not very busy. The market needs to await developments in the European situation. Trading yesterday was sparse, with only Jardine Matheson shares trading at eighteen yuan and four jiao, and Shanghai Waterworks A shares trading at six hundred and eighty yuan. A rubber report has just been received, stating that total production in May was 67,715 tons, while consumption was as high as 84,988 tons. Worldwide inventory is 397,748 tons (a decrease of 6,000 tons). Based on the current consumption-to-inventory ratio, the existing inventory can only supply four and a half months of usage. The current total inventory is the lowest since 1937.

### Yarn and Cotton, Reduced Speculation, Yarn Market Gradually Returning to Normal, Price Fluctuations Only Two or Three Yuan, Half-Day Trading a Weak 1,200 Bales

The yarn market resumed normal operations yesterday after the half-year settlement of the silver market. The market situation is particularly stable and trending towards tranquility. With the new foreign exchange allocation of 50 million yuan having begun registration, people's confidence has strengthened, and the market has returned to normal. The range of price fluctuations is limited to only two or three yuan. Speculative trading in the market has significantly decreased. However, Hua Nan and Hong Kong merchants have a strong demand for coarse and fine yarns. Other merchants are affected by the blockade of Haikou, leading to sluggish business. Even some large firms are releasing substantial quantities.

Regarding the current yarn situation, at the opening in the morning, traders, having rested for several days, arrived early to discuss the new foreign exchange allocation. Opinions varied, and a new buying wave did not arise in the market. Therefore, trading did not begin until 9:45 AM. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 496 yuan, down two yuan. However, the warehouse receipt price was higher at 490 yuan. There were no major changes midway. Subsequently, it was heard that Hong Kong merchants' intentions remained strong, with Double Horse reaching 498 yuan. Guangxi merchants had a particularly high demand for 20-count Shepherd yarn, as its price was far lower than Double Horse, making it cheaper. 160-170 bales were purchased, rising from 384 yuan to 389 yuan. By the time of closing, the market returned to a flat and weak state. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 496 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 490 yuan. As a result, the total transaction volume for the half-day in the morning was 1,195 bales. Trading was suspended in the afternoon due to the hot weather and will resume after the autumn coolness. 20-count Double Horse is down two yuan compared to before the closure, while Shepherd alone is up six yuan. 10-count yarn is firm and expensive. 32-count single yarn has not been traded due to seasonal reasons. Yong'an Factory opened with 300 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn, priced at 468 yuan, for delivery in three weeks. In addition, 110 pieces of cotton yarn arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday. Today (the 5th), 40 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin, 210 pieces to Hong Kong, and 90 pieces to Haiphong. The quantities purchased by various merchants are listed on the left.

Regarding the Japanese yarn market, although demand from various parties is sluggish, confidence is very good. It is said that sales in the northern market are not bad. The current price of 20-count Yueqin is 408 yuan, and the price for this month is 415 yuan.

### Payment Problem Not Yet Resolved, Cotton Trading Halted

Trading of both Chinese and foreign cotton remains suspended, with no deals made. This is likely due to the impact of tight credit conditions, making it difficult for those with limited funds to operate. The goods previously ordered by factories have arrived in Shanghai in large quantities. However, due to the unresolved payment issue, there has been no new development. Over the past three days, only 226 bales of Tongzhou cotton have arrived in Shanghai from Subei. Also, 200 pieces of cotton machine yarn will be shipped to Tianjin today.

Furthermore, although the difficult period at the end of June has passed for cotton trading outside Shanghai, credit conditions remain extremely tight. Various parties are temporarily unwilling to release funds, resulting in a quiet market with no hope of expansion for the time being. While ships continue to arrive daily, it remains questionable whether foreign firms can accept the new foreign exchange allocation.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market has shown no significant fluctuations in recent days. The market opened slightly weaker yesterday due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and selling by foreign and domestic traders. Subsequently, due to some new buying, spot prices rose, resulting in an overall increase of four or five pounds. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by over ten pounds.

A dispatch from Bombay states that there has been no activity from the Chinese side regarding Indian cotton in the past week, allegedly due to stricter foreign exchange controls in China. The destinations and quantities of eastern Indian cotton exports are listed below:

Yangon 111 tons

Bremen 42 tons

Antwerp 69 tons

Total exports: 222 tons

### Piece Goods, Differing Methods of Payment for Japanese Factories, Cloth Market Also Showing Signs of Contraction

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday was the first day of trading after the bank holiday for settlements, and the new system of foreign exchange allocation certificates was implemented. Stockpilers are less active, and the market trend is stable. Actual sales are mostly concentrated in Haikou due to the blockade. Commerce in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is declining. Shops in this street are usually in a slow selling season, and the situation is exacerbated by the excessive number of shops opened this year, which has fragmented business. Furthermore, the purchasing power of citizens is gradually decreasing, and the currency contraction has hit them hard.

Very few transactions took place in the cloth market yesterday. Sales in the northern route Yantai merchants included over one hundred bales of Dasheng 16-pound Double Dragon Blue Lion Kui character coarse cloth, with prices increasing by one to two and a half jiao per bolt. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants sold over thirty boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, printed, and colored satin, and over ten bales of Da Peng and other fine cloth brands, all at average prices. Demand in this street is very sluggish. Five to six hundred bolts of plain colored cotton yarn poplin and foreign yarn were sold, and twenty to thirty boxes of broadcloth and tribute twill woolen cloth were sold.

Eastern Cloth

Although the white goods market resumed business yesterday, sales were fundamentally stagnant, and discount rates remained high. Traders are showing little interest, so most transactions are speculative. Approximately three hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were sold throughout the day. Actual sales in this street amounted to about one hundred pieces. The current price of Longtou fine cloth is fourteen yuan and two and a half jiao. The futures price for this month is fourteen yuan and five jiao. Colored Four Gentlemen broadcloth is four jiao and four and a half fen per yard, and tribute is four jiao and three and a half fen. It is said that the Japanese factories have different methods for receiving payment. For example, Gongda can accept full foreign exchange allocation with market discount, and the internal and external discount only needs to be fifty yuan. However, the amount is determined by them based on the cash position and must be wholesale purchases. Small quantities are not allowed. Yufeng Factory, which makes the Du Longtou fine cloth, still only accepts cash, which affects the market price.

Export

Today, fifty pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Tianjin, twenty-four pieces to Xiamen, and thirty pieces to Hong Kong.

### Oilcake, Bean Cake Re-emerges, Above Two Yuan, Time for Fertilizing Fields, Trading is Particularly Lively

The bean cake market: The weather has cleared up yesterday after three days of heavy rain. The countryside is the time of applying fertilizer so bean cakes has brisk prospects. However, wholesalers specializing in inland trade have already gradually sold their stocks, and those stockpiling for speculative trading had also sold a large portion when prices were at three yuan. As a result, there is a feeling of a shortage of chips, causing confidence to soar amidst lively buying activity. Prices have uniformly jumped above the three yuan mark, rising another seven fen above the highest price of the previous day. It is estimated that 5,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake were traded, with prices rising from three yuan and five fen to three yuan and seven fen. 3,000 pieces of miscellaneous cakes were traded, with prices rising from three yuan to three yuan and four fen.

On the fourth of this month, thirty-five tons of beans were exported to Bombay, and twenty-three tons were exported to Colombo. On the fifth, 1,140 bags will be shipped to Xiamen, 550 bags to Hong Kong, and 350 tins of sesame oil will also be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Food, Flour Market Quiet, Wheat Market Trending Firm

The flour market remains as quiet as ever. Since the bank holiday, customer sales have not been active. This is due to the tense situation in Tianjin and the unstable situation in South China. Although there are sporadic inquiries, they are only for show. Customer demand was still quiet yesterday. Retail transactions in this street were also not very brisk. Although the financial situation is said to be stable, there is still a shortage of cash, so market development is still pending. It is heard that flour stocks at various flour mills are gradually increasing. Although there is a desire to depreciate and sell, it is feared that this will not lead to formal sales, so they are temporarily holding on, waiting for an opportunity. Today, 48,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, and 60 bags will be shipped to Xiamen.

The wheat market continues to be firm and expensive. Deliveries from the Beijing-Wuhu area and Kunshan-Wuxi areas have increased slightly in recent days, and most are stored in warehouses awaiting good prices. On the sales side, Hua factories are still slow to buy, only supplying Japanese factories and hoarders in this street. However, sellers continue to insist on high prices due to high costs, so market prices have risen again by several fen. A total of seven or eight carloads of wheat from Wuhu, Danyang, and Kunshan, such as Daqiao wheat, were sold at prices ranging from six yuan and nine jiao to seven jiao and five fen.

### Wuhu Water and Land Routes Blocked, Premium Indica Rice Rises Two or Three Jiao

Yesterday, no River Downstream glutinous rice arrived from various channels, and 1,700-1,800 steamed bun bags arrived by car. The opening trend in the morning was still sluggish. Later, it was heard that Wuhu had declared a blockade, and confidence immediately strengthened. The sales market in this street was more active than before, and inland merchants were also active. Therefore, the premium sharp glutinous rice market suddenly rose. As for thick and thin glutinous rice, there was a lot of rain-soaked goods from the previous two days, and sellers were eager to sell, so the market shifted depending on the seller's mood, with some differences.

Premium Indica Rice: Inland merchants' buying interest remains strong, and local villagers are also inquiring, so yesterday's transaction volume increased again to 4,600-4,700 bags. The market was in a flourishing state. However, the market also heard that Wuhu rice carts had been seized, and yesterday's telegraphic transport was also blocked. Prices immediately rose by two jiao. However, sellers' attitudes still remain optimistic. Du Yang Sharp and Port Sharp rice markets are average.

Foreign Rice: Although orders have been allocated, the market's existing stock is gradually decreasing. Yesterday, nearly a hundred bags of current Saigon rice were sold, with prices rising from twenty-three yuan to twenty-three yuan and seven fen. Traders and stockpilers want to raise prices again due to the low inventory in the market.

### Silk and Tea, Beginning-of-Month Inventory Decreases, Both Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise

Overseas silk markets: Both Japanese and American prices rose yesterday. Yokohama rose by 20 yuan, and futures rose by 13 yuan. New York short-term rose by eight cents, and long-term rose by five cents. Spot Japanese silk rose by five to six cents. Shanghai silk was not sold. Guangdong silk rose by four cents. The market trend is likely due to the fact that the beginning-of-month raw silk statistics showed another drop in inventory, which triggered speculation. Therefore, silk sales in this port did not become active as a result.

Local Silk Market: Silk and cocoon stocks in this port are nearly depleted. Market transactions are sparse. Manufacturers have no interest in buying or selling, as cocoon transport has not yet been properly resolved. Yesterday, Renchang Foreign Firm imported 2,000 dan of French silk, and Indian firms also made some transactions. Silk prices are said to be on a stable path. Yesterday, 367 bales of Lake silk were shipped to Europe.

### Occasional Notes from a Humble Study

— Bian Luo

In the play "Sai Jinhua" that was performed in the past, there was a satirical passage about scholars, which seemed to have the following sentence: "The emperor told us to study, and all we can do is study..." Then he strutted around reading "Emperor is calling us to study, and all we can do is study, Emperor is calling us to study, and all we can do is study ..." satirizing them very bitterly. But, in fact, scholars do more than just study; they also become officials. To put it bluntly, studying is precisely for becoming an official, and besides "bringing honor to the family," the common people have long said "good fortune and wealth", "promotion and fortune" the auspicious sayings", the odd thing is: people forget the ironic meaning of linking "promotion" and "getting rich." So being an official and "getting rich" is "justified", and "becoming an official for the sake of getting rich" is even more inevitable. Even now, there are still many people who are willing to recognize thieves as fathers and become officials of some kind as long as there is money to be made, the so-called "whoever offers milk is my mother" type. Among these people, there are also quite a few scholars. To say that scholars only know how to study would be to bury the genius of these scholars in becoming officials, and that's worth making a serious protest about.

These scholars (or the gentry class) originally used the Confucian classics as a stepping stone. In reality, they don't necessarily trust Confucius and honestly become disciples of Confucius. They rely on others to carry their power, acting as a fake tiger or even working for the tiger, but in reality, they are merely helping out or offering idle services.

When they are bored, there are also some fashionable trends, such as studying the teachings of Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu, or the ways of Buddhism and ghosts and spirits. They also swing around a bit. In Qing dynasty notes, there are mostly stories of fox spirits bewitching people and wronged women manifesting their souls. Perhaps the author's original intention was pure and honest? But later generations insist on seeing it as "lewd," then blame later generations for being sexually oversensitive. They use this to show off their erudition, as if they have transformed into butterflies and traveled through hell, but in reality, it is nothing more than a bit of elegant embellishment.

The affairs of ghosts and spirits are difficult to discuss. I don't understand them very well, but the way the Chinese people handle ghosts and spirits is very simple. They generally judge them based on their own likes and dislikes, and all the systems are almost the same as in the yang world. The Five Sacred Emperors act as administrative officials, the City Gods and Earth Gods act as local officials, and the Stove God is usually relegated to the smoky stove. A few days before New Year's Eve, people have to treat him to a feast, meaning that they want him to say a few good words to the Jade Emperor, just like entertaining newspaper reporters now. Although the Door Gods are fierce, they only beat the little ghosts who want to invade the house and do not mess with the owners of the house. So they all look very approachable. As for the Fire God and Plague God, they are a bit scary, but there is also a way: invite them to watch temple operas. They seem to be art-supremacy believers, and after watching the opera and eating some sacrificial offerings, they become calm and reasonable. So they are generally very concerned about face and value relationships. With a little accommodation, there is nothing that cannot be done.

As for Lao Tzu, he is not very well-liked, because people don't really understand his principles. Although he seems to be the founder of Zhang Tianshi's sect, people don't really believe that he has any magical powers. One rarely hears of Lao Tzu catching ghosts. Zhuangzi seems a bit slippery, dreaming of becoming a butterfly and singing when his wife dies. He also makes people suspect that he has a concubine. But they both agree that saints should not be praised, even cursing "If saints don't die, great thieves won't stop."

In fact, at that time, there was no need to "deeply hate and despise" the sages in this way. Although Confucius was "the sage of the times" and had a bit of a penchant for showing off, the result of his travels to various states was that the emperor was still unwilling to give him meat to eat, which angered him and caused him to leave. It can be seen that he was not very successful, far less than the sage of peace who said, "Let the compatriots bleed until the enemy says enough" was smarter. But after Confucius died, he was carried into the Confucian temple by successive emperors to eat cold pork, which seems very glorious, but therefore the dead saint was pulled to help and assist. Therefore, he was recognized by the reformers as an object of attack. And now, he is imprinted on banknotes like paper money, forced to be used, which makes people angry as soon as they see it. Alas. What is the saint guilty of! In fact, "even though the sage has died," great thieves still do not stop, but rather great thieves do not die, sages do not stop, because great thieves will call the sages to be resurrected. Confucius has been dead for thousands of years, and now aren't there places where children are forced to read the classics and not allowed to read their own Chinese textbooks?

### Also "Leading by Example"

— Chen Kangbai

Before August 13th, I was teaching at XX Girls' Middle School in Shanghai. One day, a not-too-big, not-too-small matter for a friend weighed on me, and he insisted that I come up with a solution for him. This forced me to see a "big shot" I didn't want to see.

Upon arriving at the "big shot's" place, unluckily, the big shot had gone to some urgent meeting, and I only ran into his "housewife," no, she should be called "wife."

After all, she was the big shot's wife, and her skills were quite different from ordinary people: one hand playing mahjong, one hand patting the child; one eye on the mahjong, one eye also had to talk to me.

Naturally, I was just a poor teacher, and it was already lucky that she didn't turn me away. It certainly wasn't enough for the wife to get up and greet me with great respect. The wife could just calmly play her mahjong.

So I thought: the big shot probably doesn't have much time to be idle at home; meeting him is definitely not an easy task. Wasn't it arranged by phone just now? But arriving immediately, I was met with an empty space; he was "urgently" called away to an urgent meeting. -- My own desk is piled high with files, how can I have so much free time to frequently visit the big shot's residence? Let the wife act as a telephone and ask her to pass on the message. Anyway, if the wife is willing to help, her power will be much greater than the old man's.

That's how I decided.

During the conversation, because her young master was making a lot of noise, our conversation was interrupted from time to time; the nanny next to him couldn't soothe him either, he insisted on pestering his mother for something or other...

I don't know whose concubine of which family came up with a way to calm things down, and said in a soft, soothing tone:

-- Little Bao! Come here! Godmother will give you money to buy candy, what is this card called?

-- Seven Dot! Water Pipe.

-- What about this one?

-- Seven String! Big Turtle.

Five blood-red mouths opened together in laughter -- including the Jiangbei nanny.

-- Good! Little Treasure is really capable! Take the money and go buy candy, don't argue with Mommy! But the mother was giving seductive glances, as if she was proud of her son's clever success, and didn't say half a word.

The family's young lady was probably ashamed of Little Treasure's rich knowledge, and also leaned out her left hand to pull him over.

Little brother, I'll buy you a foreign doll, come over here to older sister -- what is this thing?

-- Three String! Little Bird Turtle.

-- What is a little turtle?

The little brother tilted his head and looked at his mother, as if wanting his mother to answer him for a moment. Finally, he turned back:

A little bird turtle is just a little turtle! What is it?

Everyone burst into another round of giggling laughter; but for more than half a minute, they couldn't close their mouths.

But I, standing beside them, couldn't help but laugh too.

Little Bao really got the money and flew away. The square table conference still maintained its original quiet situation. Everyone was scheming in their minds about the cards in their hands.

I was too embarrassed to stay any longer and said goodbye.

At the entrance of the alley, I saw Little Treasure squeezing into the dice-throwing crowd, jumping and shouting "Twelve! Twelve!" His enthusiasm was no less than when he was giving his mother a hard time.

This couldn't help but make me admire the greatness of the power of "leading by example"! At the same time, my mind conjured up the memory of the big shot visiting our school for a lecture half a year ago: "Everyone! The national crisis is extremely serious! We must be frugal! Donate the money saved to the government. For example, I used to take a car, but now I don't take cars anymore. Saving a little expense for the public, saving a little gasoline. I wear a homespun uniform, you see the uniform I'm wearing is homespun. (Handily lifted the corner of his clothes for people to see) We must "lead by example," we must start with "cultivating ourselves," "cultivating ourselves" and then we can manage our families," "family managed" and then "the country will be governed," "the country governed" and then the world can be at peace. ... Everyone is a teacher for the youth, every move should take into account the four words "leading by example"! It's the same in the family! ..."

The applause at that time seemed to still be ringing in my ears. However, in this ringing, there seemed to be the sound of mahjong tiles dissolving inside!

### Female Propagandist in the "Little Devil" Team

### The Not Lonely Echo

— Ding Di

The scattered wind blows the gathered people far away, the son leaves his elderly parents, friends lose the warmth of joy, the sound of rain in the deep pear blossom courtyard takes away sighs, and countless cold, stiff lives look up at the isolated sun. Trapped in the black mud, despairing, angry, struggling, a group of people pray for light; the children who have crossed thousands of mountains and rivers endure many hardships, and when they are hungry, tired, and injured, they bless their parents far away; The bones and flesh are separated from relatives and friends, tasting all the flavors of the world and wandering, accompanied by the sad faces of cold birds and decaying grass, unwilling to bow their heads and beg for mercy, hoping to receive a letter from home in the ancient road in the evening or in a dirty little inn, they miss the counties and cities of jackals and wolves, the doorsteps there, the relatives and friends there, and the family members left stranded there.

Following the scattered wind, people are blown north, south, east, and west. Leaving familiar faces and voices, the old mother leaning on the door, the spring dreams in the boudoir, the flags of the elders in the Central Plains, let the cultural relics and clothing follow the memory to the distance, let the loved ones walk out of their own embrace, let the travelers give hardships to difficult messengers, and let all the ominous omens be entrusted to the vague and unknowable. The older generation waves their hands and lets go of their passionate beloved sons; the exiles abandon their old businesses; the rugged roads delay the travelers' return; they have not yet destroyed Loulan, and wives bid farewell to their husbands with smiles as they embark on long journeys. Not lonely at all, the scattered people burst out with cries from the bottom of their hearts, as if they can communicate with travelers thousands of miles away.

When you are lonely and thinking about a long journey, you seem to live in an empty, uninhabited house, you are a little scared, a little worried, and a little depressed. High walls surround you, you can't climb over them properly, and you can't see the scenery outside. Someone once said it was too lonely, but it's not really. Although you are isolated from your loved ones, the nannies you love, they are not far away from you. Their hearts are close to your heart, as long as you don't forget them, they will naturally give you comfort from time to time. You should quietly listen to the call from the bottom of your heart, just like the echo you get when you roar alone in the deep mountains. You may hear the responses of thousands of people. Countless people are in the dark, countless people are on the battlefield, countless people are wandering on the road, countless people are tiredly chasing the light, some have traveled far across the yellow sky of the desert, some are building roads in the mountains of the plank road, some are guarding the Yellow River at night and listening to the turbid water chirping, some are pursuing life and death in the high mountains or plains, although separated by the clouds and mountains of this post, the hearts of thousands of people are sleeping in the embrace of one motherland.

You should thank them, many people are shedding tears for you in the distance, they can't forget your pain, they are commemorating you, rescuing you in the midst of deep water and scorching fire; many people care about you, send you many expectations, and also send you many comforts. If your pain increases by one point, someone in the distance will send you sorrow; if you wipe away a few dark clouds from the picture of your life, someone in the distance will be happy for you. Naturally, you can't forget them either, their friendship to you, their caresses, as long as your heart has not been lost, you will remember them from time to time. When you are worried, someone will give you comfort; when you are lonely, someone will be your companion; when you feel it is too deadly quiet, someone will play a piece of music for you; when you miss someone far away, someone will write you a letter of peace from home. In the darkness, you don't have to worry about the coldness and loneliness of your heart, thousands of hearts are close to you, someone will share your sorrows, someone will give you rescue and help. Can't you hear it, in your heart, in your mind, someone is answering your words? Call out, someone will respond to you completely. Listen, listen -

Close your eyes, think of the familiar or unfamiliar masses, the people you love, the people who love you, those with the same fate, those with the same enemies, those in the dark, those on the battlefield, those wandering on the road, those chasing the light, a series of tragic faces, approaching your pupils, you should know that you are not lonely; the fate between people has become a huge chain, they will not leave you, forget you. Are you afraid of being alone? Try shouting loudly. Call out, someone will respond to you. Listen, listen -

Following the scattered wind, people are blown north, south, east, and west, the gathered people are blown far away, but the hearts of the two places are always full of care and deep love.

In everyone's mind, in their hearts, connected to thousands of people. In the darkness, you don't have to be afraid, because you are not alone. They will not forget you, just as you will not forget them. Do you dislike being lonely, are you afraid of being alone, then call out, someone will respond to you, give you comfort, give you a companion, play a piece of music for you, write you a letter of peace.

Call out. Listen, listen

### Talking Points

— Editor

Gorky's "Red Devil Vasika" portrays the characters' personalities vividly. Now, it has been translated by Mr. Di Zhou, and Mr. Qu Yi has proofread it once based on the Japanese translation. It is published in this journal, and I think readers will want to read it first. The entire article is about ten thousand words long, so I would like to introduce it here.

### Red Devil Vasika

— By Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

Not long ago, there was a man in his forties named Vasika, nicknamed "Red Devil", working in a brothel on a certain street in Pablos Town. He got this nickname because of his carrot-colored neck hair and his large face the color of raw beef.

With thick lips and large ears protruding from his skull like kettle handles, he often frightened people with the cruel expression in his small, white eyes. People were always so frightened in front of him that they broke out in a cold sweat and became as dazed as ice. No matter how fat he was, his eyes always showed the expression of a starving ghost. Short and stocky, he wore a blue Cossack coat, baggy woolen trousers, embroidered with trinkets, and highly polished long boots. His red hair was curled up in knots. Whenever he put on that beautiful hat, his hair would rise up under the brim and shrug on the silk edge. — It was as if Vasika had a wreath on his head.

Friends called him "Red Devil", but prostitutes called him "Executioner" because he liked to torture them.

There were several middle schools in the town, inhabited by many young people. "House of Tears" - a brothel - occupied one of the districts. Nearby were broad Yu Street and narrow lanes. Vasika was well known throughout the district. His name made every prostitute tremble. If the girls argued with the madam about something, the madam would always threaten them with the following words: Okay, you watch... don't make me angry — otherwise, I'll call "Red Devil Vasika", how about that...

To suppress the girls and withdraw their requests, just this threat was enough — no matter how legal and fair their requests were. For example: improving diet, the right to go out for a walk, etc. If this threat alone was not enough to suppress the girls, the madam would really call Vasika.

Vasika walked over slowly, like a big official, and blocked the prostitutes' house with the madam. Then the madam pointed out which of the girls should be punished.

He listened to the madam's story silently and said simply:

"Alright!"

He walked closer to the girls. When the girls saw him, their faces turned green and they trembled all over. He looked at them, enjoying their horror. If this drama was staged in their kitchen where they ate and drank tea, he would stare at them, standing silently on the door like a bronze statue for a long time. The pain that this silent moment gave them was no less than torture.

"Mashiha! Come here!..."

"Vasika Minonezhi!" Mashiha said, pleadingly, "Don't touch me, don't touch me! ... If you touch me — I'll die!..."

"Come here! Tie up this naughty girl with a rope!..." Vasika said coldly with a stern face.

He was always able to get the prostitutes to come to him automatically.

"I'm going to call the police!... I'm going to break the glass!" she counted the things she could do, panting while trembling. (To be continued) (One)

### (One) On Cherishing Time

— Xie

God gives us a short life, but we must obtain eternal life entirely through this short life, so we should cherish every minute and second of our time.

We have a great career to accomplish, many dangers to go through, many difficulties to overcome, many evils to eliminate, many good deeds to do, many children to raise, many friends to help, many poor people to relieve, many diseases to cure, in addition to various public and private matters, as well as various obligations. There are so many things we have to do, and our lives are so short, so how can we not cherish our time?

If there is no free time in our lives, then all the sins of licentiousness, extravagance, etc. can be avoided, and we will not be constantly tempted. On the contrary, for an idle person, all kinds of sins and temptations come like a tide, and they will surely make him fall.

Idleness is called "the sin of Sodom and her daughters" and is also called "the tomb of the living." A lazy person is useless to God and mankind, and is not concerned about the changes and needs of the world, wastes time all year round, divides profits without creating profits, is useless to save people when alive, and rots with grass and trees after death. Below are a few suggestions for cherishing time: (To be continued) Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Society P.O. Box 1227

### The "Working Women" Charity Bazaar is Moved to the New Asia International Ballroom

— Xi Yi

The company authorities are also willing to give the entire sixth floor of the New Capital Hotel to the "Working Women" members to personally prepare refreshments in the tea room inside the venue.

"Everyone, come and buy something to help the refugees!" The person in charge of the Chinese Professional Women's Club said the last sentence to me.

For more than a month, they have been running around to various manufacturers to negotiate donations of items for the charity sale, almost making them breathless with busyness, writing letters, discussing, sending representatives to negotiate, some trivial matters, they have handled them clearly. Now, all kinds of planning and arrangements have finally come to fruition, and the official date of the charity sale has also been decided after the tenth of this month. The location has also been moved from the Ningbo Association to the old site of the New Asia Company International Ballroom. If that place is too narrow, then the New Asia Company is also willing to voluntarily give the entire sixth floor of the New Capital Hotel to them as a charity sale venue.

"Many domestic goods manufacturers have enthusiastically donated this time, which is really very grateful. None of the various supplies they donated are not completely donated; of course, thanks to the enthusiastic promotion of the charity sale price coupons issued this time by the members, this charity sale has a more considerable number, which is also the result of everyone's concerted efforts."

"It is said that you are cooperating with the Refugee Relief Association this time, is that right?"

"Yes," their person in charge said: "Originally, this charity sale was held a long time ago, but it was delayed until now due to various problems. This time, the Refugee Relief Association is raising funds for the summer hygiene campaign for refugees, so we decided to donate all the income from the charity sale to the Relief Association as funds for the hygiene campaign. After the charity sale is over, the Refugee Relief Association will also formally publish a statement in the newspaper stating that it has received the donation from the "Working Women" charity sale."

Welcome Cash Customers

Now let's talk about the situation of the charity sale venue and the preparation process:

In order to prepare for this charity sale, they have held several "broadcast charity sales." On the radio, they made a powerful call. In addition, they issued a total of 10,000 yuan of "price coupons." These "price coupons" are divided into one yuan and five jiao. It is said that these price coupons have been generally sold out.

The reason why they issued 10,000 yuan of "price coupons" is to hope that the result of this charity sale will be an income of 10,000 yuan. Although it is hard for a long time, if they can have 10,000 yuan, it can be regarded as a relief.

The charity sale period is temporarily set for three days. They hope that in addition to those who hold "price coupons", those who go to buy with cash are more welcome.

Temporary Department Store

The organization of the charity sale venue is exactly the same as that of a company store. Not only is there a minister and staff inside, but also an invoice and packaging department. All transactions are the same as those of a department store.

The venue is divided into nine major departments. The categories of these nine departments are as follows:

(1) Stationery Publishing Department - This department has paste, ink, and specially printed "charity sale" stationery and envelopes donated by various manufacturers. The publishing department has a large number of books donated by the Literature and Magazine Society, guides, commentaries, and various books donated by business, Chinese, children, Datong, World, Kaiming and other bookstores. In addition, there are wool knitting methods and many children's books.

(2) Cosmetics and Pharmaceutical Department - This department has the most donations from various pharmaceutical and cosmetic manufacturers, and major companies have also donated. The most enthusiastic are: New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, China-France Pharmacy, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, New Asia Company, Paris Chemical Products Company, Family Industry Society, China Chemical Industry Society, and Yong'an and Sincere Companies, all of which have many valuable products.

(3) Daily Necessities Department - There are Yonggu Machine Factory's spring nickel coin boxes, Tianzhe Kitchen MSG. Taiyi Malt Essence, Standard-made MSG Factory MSG, etc.

(4) Toy Department - There are various toys from Kangyuan Canning Factory.

(5) Clothing Department - Various clothing.

(6) Antiques, Books and Paintings Department - Here is an ancient zither donated by Jing Lao Ren, worth 500 yuan, and emerald bracelets, jade Buddhas; in addition, Chen Xujun donated Ming Dynasty imperial ink tea crystals, etc.

Tea Room is Set Up at the Venue

(7) Food Department - This department is the only design seen in all charity sale venues in Shanghai. In addition to various foods, a "tea room" will be temporarily set up here.

The staff in this tea room will be "working women" members, and various cold drinks and snacks will be sold inside. The members will also sell newly made snacks in the "tea room." In addition, there are "sara" (i.e. cold dishes) and lychees, etc.

This department has tea leaves donated by Mao Li Farm worth 500 yuan.

(8) Production Department - This department can be said to be the hard work of all "working women" members. Inside are various embroidery handicrafts personally sewn by the members. All are exquisite and lovely.

(9) Miscellaneous Department - Miscellaneous items that cannot be categorized are all placed in this department.

### On the Controversy Between Nostalgia and Pragmatism

— Cai Fucheng

The education sector of the quiet lonely island, which has been silent for a long time, has recently been disturbed by the dispute between Huai Jiu and Wu Ben schools over orthodoxy, which has caused a sensation in the city. Advertisements in various newspapers have almost daily contained announcements from the two schools claiming to be orthodox and criticizing the other party. Recently, they have even used third parties to come forward to provide evidence and opened a pen war. It is difficult for outsiders to know which of these two schools is the formal successor to Wu Ben. However, the competition is so fierce that I can conclude that both schools have at least a considerable relationship with the former municipal Wu Ben. However, this kind of dispute exposes the weaknesses of the entire education sector, which no one can deny.

In fact, what is the meaning of the two schools competing for orthodoxy? Even if one of the schools wins and gains orthodoxy, what benefits will it bring to the school itself? To be honest, running a school depends entirely on performance. In other words, it depends on the spirit of hard work on the ground. It is by no means a trick that can be taken by speculative merchants with counterfeit hats. Whether it is orthodox or not, as long as you can work hard with enthusiasm and perseverance and achieve outstanding results, then even if it is not orthodox, you can make your reputation ten thousand times higher than that of the orthodox. On the contrary, if you win orthodoxy, regard yourself as an old brand, and act perfunctorily, then undoubtedly your reputation will be swept away day by day, and people will never forgive you because you are an old orthodox brand. In this way, the problem still lies in your own school-running spirit, so why value orthodoxy? I would like to say to the authorities of the two schools that they should bury themselves in hard work and win with real achievements. A false reputation is unacceptable.

Finally, I would like to say to the general parents that you don't need to inquire around to find out who is the orthodox of Wu Ben, because orthodoxy has no absolute relationship with your children's knowledge. If you love your children and want them to get a better school, you must inquire about which of these two schools has achievements, which has history, and which has spirit. If you can choose schools in this way, you will never mislead your children.

### Female Storytelling

— Shen You

Biographies of Female Storytellers (3)

However, although Su Lan was the first to create this genre, she wasn't the most outstanding. At the time, the most renowned in female storytelling was Yuan Yunxian. She's the one Wang (author of "Ying Ruan Magazine") referred to as being "praised for her excellence" alongside Zhu Youxiang and others. Volume 2 of "Songnan Dream Record" states:

Yuan Yunxian rose to fame in Shanghai through storytelling... She lived with her younger brother, Yuexian... A certain magistrate listened to her storytelling in Suzhou and, after several years in office, happened to receive an official assignment that kept him in Shanghai. During his leisure time, he frequented brothels and fell deeply in love at first sight, vowing commitment by cutting his arm. Upon completion of his assignment, he gathered thousands of gold coins to request her as a concubine. The woman herself was fortunate to have someone extend a hand from the "green lantern district," and from then on, she had a patron and wouldn't drift like fallen catkins. Unexpectedly, the magistrate's waiting for a new appointment dragged on, and to avoid debts, he wanted to return home, but his luggage was meager. If he wanted to stay, he would be destitute. He had no one to appeal to and no means to beg for rice, becoming destitute in the pleasure quarters, changing his name to Zheng Suqin...

Gu Quxian from Moli Peak's "Register of Beauties in Shanghai (1884), Volume 1" also contains a biography, though the details recorded are slightly different. It says the magistrate was "dismissed" because of "taking a prostitute." However, after being dismissed, Yunxian "willingly endured poverty, often doing needlework to supplement their daily needs, living together in harmony for nearly ten years." The magistrate's death occurred in "the summer of Xinsi (1881), when the magistrate was involved in transporting goods by sea, his boat capsized, and he was rescued. However, he suffered from illness and divine punishment," ultimately passing away. Therefore, Yunxian had no choice but to return to her former profession. Longqiu Old Hermit has a "Pipa Song" dedicated to Yunxian, which describes this matter in great detail. However, its greatest value lies in describing Yunxian's youthful years. The song goes:

...Once, Autumn Maiden possessed incomparable beauty, known as Yuan Bao'er, the enchanting flower master. Like a goddess from the Luo River, gracefully she appeared; like an immortal descending from the clouds, slowly she walked. At the age of blossoming youth, she was exquisitely charming, her family having migrated from Suzhou. A single glance could empty the hearts of men north of the Ji River; for ten years, she resided quietly south of the city. Beneath the loquat blossoms, she built a fragrant dwelling, rivaling the old scholar by the bridge. Deep in the alley, springtime breezes hid embroidered curtains; at the door, fragrant carriages filled the street all day long. Occasionally, she stepped onto the stage to compete with her new voice, singing of the Yellow River, unmatched by anyone. Her oriole-like voice tested the clear weather, her pipa strings rang out, startling the night rain. At this time, her fame was worth a string of cities; at this moment, her splendor captivated all. Winning the hearts of the young men from the capital, everyone wished to know her...

This sufficiently illustrates the renown Yunxian enjoyed in her youth. As for returning to her old profession, according to "Register of Beauties," "on the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival of Guiwei (1883), Wen Yushan from the lake once again became her patron." This is Yuan Yunxian's life story. However, "New Liaozhai" (1909), Volume 2, "A Short Biography of Yuan Yunxian," differs in some respects. The Yunxian portrayed in "New Liaozhai" is named Qiao, from Liangxi, and began her life in the pleasure quarters due to family hardships in her youth. She was skilled in the pipa and proficient in lyrics and melodies. Other details are noticeably different, leading one to suspect that this is a different person altogether.

Yunxian's fame stemmed from her combined talent in appearance and artistry. Therefore, Dai Pingsou in "Brief Notes on Female Storytelling" states: "Recently, Yuan Yunxian has been highly praised for her beauty and artistry. Her appearance is stunning, her words are elegant and unrestrained, and her skills are adept, which is why everyone admires her." Bangjiang's lyricist in "Shanghai North and South Bamboo Branch Songs" sings of Yunxian, "The storytelling stage is lively as the sun sets, patrons and officials standing shoulder to shoulder. When the master of ceremonies announces Ms. Yunxian's arrival, everyone gazes with anticipation," also highly praising Yunxian. As for her acting skills, Dai Pingsou's comments offer valuable insights. He states:

Female storytellers all reside north of the city, but Yunxian alone lives south of the city. Initially, no one north of the city knew of Yunxian. For several years, the women gathered at the Mountain Forest Garden Pavilion in Jin Gui Lane for storytelling sessions, each showcasing their skills in turn. When Yunxian took the stage, it was already dusk, leaving her with little time for singing and playing. She hurriedly delivered a few lines of dialogue, witty and refined. I was amazed, considering her the best storyteller. From then on, her fame spread from south to north, and she performed daily. The audience grew daily, and her reputation soared. Recently, a connoisseur summarized her with two words: 'Hard Echo.' This refers to her hard tone and resounding voice. Yu's style values gentleness, subtlety, and a perfect combination of charm and rhythm. This spring, a certain official and I went to listen, and it was as he said. I realized that she was good at dialogue but not so good at singing and playing. Her dialogue was truly brilliant and insightful. However, her strength was also her weakness, as she used too much obscene language. Her desire was conveyed through her appearance, and private matters were expressed through her movements. To categorize her, she was almost like Wang Xifeng from "Dream of the Red Chamber."

This gives insight into Yunxian's storytelling skills. However, the words "Hard Echo" cannot fully capture her essence. "Shanghai North and South Bamboo Building Songs" states, "The legacy of Jingting is exuberant, rare to find someone who can tell stories like that of tomorrow. Yuan's tone is naturally high, Yan's tone is steady, but in terms of appearance, Zhu takes precedence." This suggests that some find Yunxian's tone to be "steady," but largely, it's a matter of opinion.

Episode 13: Encouraging Education and Agriculture, Stockpiling Talent for the Nation; Keeping the Strong, Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Purpose

Director Ge then told them, saying, "Seed selection is the core of our work here and requires the utmost precision. The praise we've received from higher authorities and the acclaim from old sericulture families are all thanks to Ms. Li." Ms. Li modestly replied, "Director Ge is too kind. It's thanks to everyone's efforts; how can I claim credit alone?" At this point, He Liyu said, "Looking at the microscope all day is quite tiring." Ms. Li said, "After looking at the seeds for a long time, we can tell which seeds to keep and which to discard with just our eyes. However, many are borderline cases, and the naked eye can't see them clearly for a moment, so we have to rely on the microscope." Zhu Airen said, "What's the magnification of your microscope? Is it 800x? That's much less than what we use in medicine to examine germs, right?" Ms. Li said, "People have germs, and silkworms have disease-causing bacteria. Examining silkworm diseases requires the same level of detail as examining human diseases. The magnifying glasses we use for seed selection are just ordinary ones." He Liyu wanted to see what they looked like magnified under the microscope. Ms. Li said, "Let me adjust the light, and I'll invite you sisters to take a look." Ms. Li placed a silkworm egg under the microscope and invited them to look. He Liyu exclaimed, "Oh my!" All she saw was a silkworm egg that looked like a goose egg, with some translucent qualities. Zhu Airen said, "You haven't seen the microbes in medicine yet. Their bizarre shapes are truly startling. Yet, a person spends every day and night dealing with those germs." He Shuangyu said, "After you select those seeds, you have to wait until next year to use them. So, where are these silkworm eggs stored?" Director Ge said, "We have a refrigerated storage room. Would you like to see it?" Ms. Li smiled and said, "The He sisters aren't wearing many clothes. Don't catch a cold in the cold storage room. You can only take a peek and come out." He Liyu also smiled and said, "It's okay! It's okay! We have a doctor with us. If we catch a cold, the doctor will treat us." Zhu Airen also smiled and said, "Even though doctors are good, it's better not to get sick." At this time, their group, including Li Shi, was led by Director Ge to the cold storage room. The person in charge of the cold storage room opened the door and let them in. The machinery that produces the cold air was installed outside. They all knew a little about the basics of producing cold air, so Director Ge didn't need to explain in detail. Inside, there were two doors. Zhu Airen said to the two He sisters, "Now, I'm inviting you to the icy hell. Really! Just take a look and come out!" (153)

### Listening to Master Hongdou in the Rain

— Xitong

The Kunqu Opera Study Group held its third song gathering at the Wei residence on the afternoon of the second. Despite the heavy rain, the guests were extremely crowded. The main purpose of most of the guests was to listen to the elegant performance of Master Hongdou Pu Xiyuan, a senior figure in the opera world.

The opening act was "Haircut" from the Pipa Record by You Caiyun, a teacher from the Xianni Society. With a long face and nose, she must have been very beautiful when she was young. Now, she sings very well and is extremely energetic; many places still retain the style of the older generation.

Then there was Ms. Liu Ying's "Eight Yangs" from the Qianzhong Record. Xu Liankui's "Looking in the Mirror" and Miao Ruochang's "Removing the Seal" from Mantang Hu followed. After that, Pu Xiyuan and others performed "Kneeling in the Pond, Three Fears" from Lion's Roar Record. Old Pu's portrayal of Su Dongpo is simply his true self. Imitating the voice of the gods, using a fan to cover his face, and his fearful expression were all excellent. Coupled with the support of Wang Fumin and Ding Zhixiang as Chen Jiichang and Ms. Liu, the green leaves enhanced the beauty of the flower. Ms. Liu's sharp voice and fierce expression were perfectly suited to her role. Chen Jiichang also vividly portrayed the psychology of being afraid of his wife. Miao Ruochang's magistrate spoke in Jiangbei dialect, sympathizing with Chen Jiichang's pinched arm, frowning and saying that he himself had encountered the same misfortune, his expression quite amusing. When he asked the yamen servant if his wife was still in the back hall, his ghostly expressions were also extremely interesting; he was simply Guo Ziyi by Fanghong.

Li Xiaxunru's Kite Mistake "Houqin" has been seen twice; this is the third time. Ms. Li is probably already fifty-two years old? At such an advanced age, she still has such good spirits and even wants to perform Qin Tiao. Her spirit is truly admirable. She performs very skillfully and steadily; her stage experience is too rich. It is said that she has helped a lot with public welfare and is also kind and amiable. Her empathy is rare. Pan Naiying's sister's plays have been heard before, including Sifan, Youyuan, and Qintiao. Naiying's singing of "Little Nun at the Age of Sixteen" in "Sifan," especially the two words "Sixteen," are the most gentle and melodious, still lingering in my ears. This time, she played the mother and daughter, with Chuanfang supporting the scene or perhaps being taught by Chuanfang. Chuanfang's performance as the daughter, with her sad and indignant expression, is commendable.

This is the first time seeing Yin Junong's play. It seems that she is quite confident, and her performance in "Sifan" this time is indeed not bad. Shen Shengwu's performance of Gui Zhi's Writing a Lawsuit was very appropriate. His singing voice is also loud and can last for a long time without changing. Xiao Ming's Jade Hairpin "Qintiao" is better than Gui Zhi's Writing a Lawsuit, and the several smiles at the time of parting are quite expressive.

Because it was already late, I had to go back; it was a pity that I didn't get to see Cui Tixian's "Elegant View Building." In a quiet hall, looking at the red large pillars and palace lanterns, as well as the lotus lanterns, listening to the sound of the strings and the singing from the stage, the trees in the yard were washed by the rain and were dripping with green, and the bamboo shoot-like rockery was also washed so that it was exquisite and translucent—under such circumstances, it can truly be said that "This song should only be found in heaven, it is rare to hear it a few times in the human world," and what's more, I also saw the living Su Dongpo.

### Hu Die Will Have a New Work Released Soon

— Yuesheng

Xinhua and Nanyue Co-Production "Philippine Blood Case" to Be Filmed on Location in the Philippines

After "Rouge Tears," Hu Die has not had any new works released until now. There is now news that she will star in "Philippine Blood Case." The past "Rouge Tears" was a co-production between Xinhua Company and Nanyue Company in Hong Kong. The current "Philippine Blood Case" is still jointly operated by Nanyue and Xinhua. Cantonese films will be distributed by Nanyue, and Mandarin films will be distributed by Xinhua.

"Philippine Blood Case" is a detective film. The male lead is confirmed to be Wang Yuanlong, and the strongman Peng Fei will also participate in the performance. The director will be Wang Cilong. Wang Cilong is currently busy in Hong Kong with the work of dividing the script into scenes.

Nanyue recently established a branch factory in the Philippines. The location shooting for "Philippine Blood Case" is planned to be in the Philippines. With a branch factory there, it can be much more convenient.

Hu Die has a contract with Xinhua for four films, and the remuneration for each film is 10,000 yuan. After "Rouge Tears," this is the second film. There are still two more films to be filmed after this, and the long-rumored "Yang Guifei" will be one of the two.

### Yan Jupeng Comes South to Recall Old Memories of Zhang Yuting

— Xiao Cang

In the past forty years, among the amateur opera singers who learned the Tan style and were able to capture its essence, only Zhang Yuting, Wang Youchen, Wang Junzhi, and Yan Juyue were the best. Among them, only Wang Junzhi has always maintained the status of an amateur opera singer and deeply hates the trend of amateur opera singers becoming professionals. Zhang Yuting and Wang Youchen have passed away one after another, and only one, Yan San'er, remains. Jupeng is now visiting Shanghai, and his supporters are not lonely. I am using Yan Jupeng's coming south to recount Zhang Yuting's matter in order to correct it before the readers.

Zhang Yuting came from an amateur opera singer background and was not skilled in weapons, and was only familiar with thirty or forty operas, especially Kongcheng, Hongyangdong, and Zhuofangcao, which were famous for a time. His singing and acting were comparable to Wang Youchen and were almost identical. Yuting's singing voice was more cheerful and faster than Youchen, and the charm sometimes surpassed Youchen. Yuting loved opera in his early years and spared no effort in studying Tan's singing style. In his middle age, he indulged in playing opera, which led to the stagnation of his optical shop in Liulichang due to playing opera. He once performed with Yang Xiaolou and Yunfu in the Hongqing Troupe. At that time, Yuting's performance already showed signs of starting smoothly and ending sloppily. In the first year of the Republic of China, the gathering of female opera singers in Beijing caused a sensation for a time. In the past, famous old opera singers mostly lived in seclusion, unwilling to compete with the group of females for a day's length, or traveled far to Shanghai and established their own unique style. In the winter of that year, Yuting followed Yunfu and Zhu Youfen, two actresses, to Shanghai in response to an invitation from the first stage of Shanghai's Dangui, and set off for Shanghai. On the way to Jinmen, a certain theater firmly asked Yuting and other actors to perform on stage for one day in order to please the listeners of Tianjin. That night, Zhu Youfen sang Cailou, Yunfu sang Jindiao Jingui, and Yuting's Kongcheng was the finale. Unfortunately, Yuting was stimulated by the sudden departure of the audience under the stage before he finished singing on the city tower, and he was unhappy for a long time. A few days later, he arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and stayed at the Mengyuan Hotel. That night, he still sang a section of Kongcheng, full of energy and proud of himself. Unexpectedly, after only three days of living there, he suddenly died of vomiting blood! Dangui, the first stage, collected thousands of gold coins and gave him a generous funeral. The people of Shanghai had long admired his name but never got to hear his clear singing. Compared with Jupeng's successive trips south and broadcasting his fame, it is truly not the same. (At that time, Dangui, the first stage, had Xiaodaizi, Xiaojinwa, Ba岁hong, Yang Ruiting, and Gai Jiaotian)

Statement on Plagiarism: "Two Noteworthy Films" by Mr. Guxing, published on June 21, was taken from the film semi-weekly of Singapore's Nanyang Shangbao on May 14 and 17. The original author was Ma Yuqi. Although it was not completely copied directly, the structure and writing were nineteen similar. With the revelation of Mr. Chengyu, in addition to canceling Guxing's remuneration, we hereby make another statement. (Editor)

(7) Female Storytelling

Throughout history, most people who "tell stories" are male; there are three to five hundred people in Suzhou and Shanghai who are engaged in this profession, belonging to the "Guangyu" and "Runyu" societies. Only a dozen or twenty women such as Yeeshe and Xie Le are engaged in this profession.

The establishment of the Puyun Society is only four years old and can be regarded as having laid the foundation for women's storytelling. With the pipa covering their faces, their beautiful voices singing softly, they are gradually seizing the seats of Guangrun.

However, according to previous dynasty notes (Tiannan Yuexiu's records are the most detailed), the book world of the Qianjia, Xianfeng, and Tongzhi eras would have been active for a while now.

### Movie Star Ms. Lu Ming Talks About: Movie Life and Love Problems (Part 1)

— Xin Shang (Recorded)

Editor's Introduction

Lu Ming, who is just over twenty years old this year, once studied at Yanmo, Qingxin, Zhizhi and other schools. She has been in the film industry for less than three years and has acted in nearly ten films. The films she starred in after the war, such as "Woman" and "Film City Diary," have all won more praise. She has a good foundation in literature and is pure in character, without some of the strange habits of movie stars. This is her only strength.

The autumn of 1936 was a chance opportunity, and my film life began to be tried out during this period. Because Yihua Company had a new film called "Guangling Tide," which was short of someone to play the role of Hongzhu, I was encouraged again and again by them, so I came to try it out. Before that, I had only read some film books and had not actually received any strict training. I was very worried and thought that I was not very confident and that the results would definitely be difficult to see well; after "Guangling Tide" was filmed and released, I was very fortunate to be praised by the company authorities for this mistake, and thus signed a long-term contract for three full years.

Then I acted in three films, "Elastic Daughter," "Full Garden of Spring," and "Sequel to Incarnation Girl." In less than a year of the contract period, the "August 13th" war broke out, and the filming work of the entire film industry was suspended at any time; because I had never given up my original wish to study, I enrolled in the Department of Political Economy of Zhizhi University the following year to concentrate on my studies. Last year, Yihua recruited old people and resumed filming. After studying at Zhizhi for a semester, I returned to my old life and worked hard in my career.

The current living situation, on average, is about one and a half months to shoot a film - that is, about eight films must be shot throughout the year. In addition to being busy with business work, I also hired a tutor to make up for my studies, and also learned music and singing from Mr. Zhang Hao - two classes are scheduled every week. I believe that life is absolutely serious. The spare time is only used to watch foreign movies, as a model for performance; in addition, reading is the only pastime, and it is just so ordinary.
