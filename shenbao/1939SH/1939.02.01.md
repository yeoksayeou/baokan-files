Editorial: Germany, Italy, and Japan Germany, Italy, and Japan commonly proclaim their opposition to communism. They are actively pursuing the alteration of the world's status quo, even through military force. For several years, they have caused immense human suffering and plunged the entire international community into turmoil. These three nations are, in fact, the main protagonists in these events. But what kind of relationship exists between Germany, Italy and Japan? Why have Germany and Italy repeatedly sacrificed their longstanding, friendly relationship with China for the sake of Japan? Why does Japan, both domestically and internationally, rely on Germany and Italy to bolster its own standing, as if it has something to depend on? Why do the actions of Japan in East Asia and Germany and Italy in Europe seem to be synchronized, with each echoing the other? Is there a secret agreement between these nations? A tacit understanding between politicians? Or is there a resonance in their ideologies and beliefs? Upon investigating, we find nothing of the sort. The only thing they have in common is the Anti-Comintern Pact, a pact with only a few clauses, merely serving as a tool for propaganda against the Third International and for exchanging information. Their seemingly synchronized actions are not based on any treaty but are simply political and diplomatic maneuvers employed temporarily due to the environment. When used appropriately, they can appear quite subtle. Whether there are conflicts of interest or potential fissures between Germany and Italy is something we won't discuss for now. But the current cohesiveness forming a strong European axis is undeniable. Japan is not in the same league. The world mistakenly refers to them as three nations; in reality, Germany and Italy are paired, while Japan stands alone, making them two distinct entities. If the Soviet Union had not abandoned its international movement policies and if communist followers were significantly active in Germany, Italy, and Japan, then the three nations might have become one entity. If Germany, Italy, and Japan each possessed unique economic strengths that allowed them to mutually benefit, then the three nations might have become one entity. If Japan's encroachment on China resembled Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia, or if Japan's swallowing of China resembled Germany's actions in Austria and Italy's in Abyssinia, then Germany, Italy, and Japan, each with comparable strength and numerous enemies, might have become one entity. However, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of socialism in one country and is focused on completing its first and second five-year economic plans, now even starting its third five-year plan. Therefore, the three nations initially had no real reason to unite against the Soviet Union. The agricultural and industrial structures of Germany, Italy, and Japan are similarly imbalanced, and their wealth is meager. Thus, the three nations cannot form an economically self-sufficient bloc. Germany and Italy expand outwards with limited bloodshed, while internally reorganizing their military and governing, presenting a picture of growing national strength. Japan, however, faces strong resistance in China, depleting its strength and nearing collapse, with its demise a cause for concern. Therefore, it is no longer worthy of being considered an equal partner to Germany and Italy. To say that the Anti-Comintern Pact is directed against the Soviet Union is misleading because Japan has lost its courage and even its qualifications to provoke the Soviet Union due to its invasion of China. Can Germany and Italy expect Japan's assistance if they have dealings with the Soviet Union? Therefore, Germany is Germany, and Japan is Japan; they are different entities on different paths. Can these three nations, on separate paths, possibly converge? There is no evidence to support a positive assertion. The only thing we can consider is that Japan has repeatedly offered shares to Germany and Italy and used them as bait for other countries. But what does this look like? According to the recent two years of Chinese customs reports, the trade between Germany and Japan with China has diverged in opposite directions. The approximate figures are as follows (in thousands of yuan): According to the comparison of the table on the right, Japan's trade has increased dramatically while Germany's has sharply declined. The development of Sino-German trade in recent years was originally progressing rapidly, but now, with Japan's increasing aggression, Germany, which received generous promises from Japan, has plummeted. From this one point alone, to say that Germany and Japan will eventually share common interests is clearly wrong. They are not only different entities on different paths. Let's put aside political and diplomatic matters, and economic and material considerations, and talk about potential spiritual resonance. Then please examine the arguments of Germany and Italy to compare with Japan's actions. Germany, regarding Czechoslovakia and Poland, speaks of the issue of ethnic minorities. How does this compare to the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in China? Italy, regarding the Mediterranean, claims it is a just and legitimate demand. Can Japan's aggression be said to have any demands that are just? German newspapers claim that Italy's aspirations are a restoration movement, saying that there will be no peace until restoration is achieved. If we apply this to China's war of resistance, which aims to recover lost territory, is the blame not on Japan? An Italian people's newspaper says that an all-powerful nation wants to establish peace based on justice. Is this not entirely incompatible with Japan's pursuit of a new order through violence? In a speech yesterday, the German leader Hitler made the striking statement: "Germany's old colonies have been stolen by other countries, which is morally unfair and economically insane." So what does Japan's seizure of Chinese territory in terms of unfairness and insanity look like? The concepts, views, and arguments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are so dissimilar, and even run counter to each other to such an extent, so how can it be said that there is any possibility of spiritual resonance? Taking the trade of the past year as evidence, the conflict of interests between Germany and Japan is like that. Taking the recent expressions from the German and Italian governments and public as evidence, the absurdity of Germany and Japan is like that. Then Hitler and Mussolini should not only refrain from letting Japan exploit Germany and Italy at every turn, but should also fundamentally abandon Japan from their very souls! They should condemn Japan harshly on the Far East issue without mincing words! But because the two men cannot decisively do this, Japanese ambassadors and ministers to various European countries recently gathered in Paris to plot to transform the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact into a trilateral military alliance. Hitler's speech also included the statement that "differences in political systems are not a reason for war," while the Japanese side "blew the whistle," saying that "Ambassador Oshima to Germany will hold important talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to lay the foundation stone for a new world." Comparing the two, how far apart they are! There is nothing else. Today's Japan intends to drag Germany and Italy into its own vortex, stir up a great storm, make a final struggle first, then seek to escape through the cracks, ultimately covering up its own shameful defeat! End of Chongqing Headquarters The Military Affairs Commission Moves to Chongqing to Work Chengdu Will Set Up Another Headquarters (Chongqing) The Chairman's Chongqing Headquarters ended on the 31st. A reporter made a special visit to Director Zhang Qun, who said, "The Chongqing Headquarters has been established for more than three years, and it has made considerable contributions to the progress of military, political, economic, and transportation in the Southwest. Today, the Southwest has become a base for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The Military Affairs Commission is now moving to Chongqing to work, and the headquarters is ordered to end. Another "Chairman's Headquarters with a smaller scope" will be set up in Chengdu, and it has been announced that the headquarters' Deputy Director He has been appointed as the director." The reporter also asked if there was a saying that a headquarters would be set up in Xichang. Zhang replied, "Xichang has generous natural endowments and abundant products, which urgently need to be developed. It has now been decided to set up a headquarters to take charge of this matter. The Central Plenary Session has paid great attention to the economic construction of the Southwest, and a grand plan has been determined and a perfect plan has been approved. The future development will be immeasurable." The reporter then asked about his thoughts on the Fifth Plenary Session. He replied, "The commissioners who attended this meeting were exceptionally enthusiastic and energetic. The President provided detailed and clear analysis of our national policies and firmly believes that the final victory is already within grasp, which gives us great excitement. Recently, the international environment has been improving, and our national strength is growing stronger as we fight. The enemy has fallen into a dilemma, which is in line with the President's predictions in the appeal to the nation delivered in Wuhan in January of last year and subsequent speeches. This further proves that our leader's outlook on the situation in East Asia is insightful and profound. In short, our eighteen months of hard fighting can be said to have produced three results: Breaking the enemy's侥幸心(spirit of僥倖), 打出(evincing) our peace-loving nation's 自信心(self confidence), 打醒(awakening) the democratic countries' 理智之畏怯心(rational trepidation) towards the aggressors. I personally deeply believe that any nation that struggles arduously and resolutely for world peace and national survival will succeed" (31st dispatch). Transferring and Training Military and Political Personnel from Four Provinces (Chongqing) According to Hua Fang news, the Hua Fang military authorities have recently decided to conduct transfers and training for military and political personnel from the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang. Military officers will be at the company and battalion commander level or above, and civil officials will be at the county section chief level or above. The methods are currently being drafted in detail (31st quick report). Four Thousand Refugees Assigned to Yunnan Hong Kong The Central Relief Committee has decided to assign 4,000 refugees to Yunnan to participate in the construction work of the Yunnan-Burma and Sichuan-Kunming railways (31st, 10 PM special dispatch). Rumor: Wu Peifu Expresses Opinions (Beiping) Wu Peifu expressed his opinions to foreign reporters this morning. He reportedly stated that when the Chinese civil war broke out twenty years ago, he advocated peace. Since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese war, the outcome has shown that the war between the two countries has not only caused China to suffer significant losses but also failed to bring benefits to Japan. Konoe has repeatedly claimed that Japan has no desire to interfere with China's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Therefore, Wu believes that the realization of his proposed peace mission should not be delayed any further (31st Haitong dispatch). (Berlin) The Chinese Embassy in Germany issued the following official statement yesterday afternoon: "The Embassy has received a telegram from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the rumor that Wu Peifu will be appointed as the chairman of the so-called "Pacification Committee" is purely groundless. People close to Wu Peifu have also denied these rumors" (31st Haitong Agency dispatch). (Beiping) According to foreign sources, Itagaki definitely met with Wang Jingwei in Hanoi in early January. Because Wang's scheme failed, he fled back north in embarrassment, forcing Wu Peifu to come out and serve as a puppet president. However, General Wu not only refused to accept but also sent a telegram to his friends to express his attitude. The Japanese plan was then shelved again. Currently, Itagaki feels extremely frustrated because all his past efforts have completely failed. It is said that in the near future, he will try new tricks and adopt coercive measures against Wu and others in order to stage a "success" as soon as possible and console himself (31st quick report). Matters Resolved by the Executive Yuan Establishing the Changsha Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee Appointing Yan Lisan as Acting Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government (Chongqing) The Executive Yuan held its 399th meeting on the 31st. President Kong and the heads of various ministries attended. President Kong chaired the meeting. First, Foreign Minister Wang and General He reported on the diplomatic and military situation, respectively. Then, the discussion of proposals began.

Jews in various parts of the British Empire held prayers for their distressed brethren on the 29th. Jews in Hong Kong also held prayers yesterday (30th dispatch). Wireless Telephone Between Xinjiang and Chongqing Connected The sound was very clear during the official opening test call in Dihua the day before yesterday. (Chongqing) The wireless telephone between Xinjiang and Chongqing made its first test call on the 30th. From now on, Northwest transportation will be more convenient, truly opening a new era in the history of Northwest transportation. Previously, the Dihua Wireless Telegraph and Wireless Telephone Bureau under the Xinjiang Provincial Government Transportation Department purchased the latest wireless electrical equipment at great expense and actively deployed it. Everything was ready, and the official opening was held in Dihua on the 30th. At 4:30 pm on the 30th, the province chairman, Li Rong, made the first test call to Zhang Yuanfu, the province's representative in Chongqing, via wireless telephone. Li asked Representative Zhang to pay respects to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, the presidents of the various branches of government, and the military commanders, saying that all of Xinjiang was at peace and the people were extremely concerned about the war situation. Zhang then reported on the recent central political situation. The two sides spoke for about twelve minutes, and the sound was very clear. The wireless telephone can be officially used for communication soon (31st dispatch). (Chongqing) According to reliable sources today, the large wireless radio station in Dihua has been completed. Yesterday, Chongqing and Dihua made their first test call. The speakers were the Chairman of Xinjiang Province and the province's representative in Chongqing (31st Associated Press dispatch). (Chongqing) In order to meet transportation needs, Chongqing is specially adding automatic telephones. Most of the project has been completed, and it is expected to be officially in operation by the middle of next month. In addition, the Chongqing-Kunming long-distance telephone equipment has also been completed and will be put into business on a set date. The Chongqing-Lanzhou long-distance telephone is currently being planned (31st dispatch). (Chongqing) The wireless telephone between Dihua and Chongqing has now been connected. During a communication test held yesterday, Xinjiang's official Li Rong (transliteration) and Zhang Yuanfu (transliteration), the Xinjiang Provincial Government's representative in Chongqing, held a twelve-minute conversation. It is reported that Li asked Zhang to convey his respects to Chairman Chiang and expressed the Xinjiang people's concern for the Sino-Japanese war, while Zhang reported on the political situation in Chongqing. It is reported that the results of this test were very satisfactory. Therefore, wireless telephone service between Xinjiang and Sichuan will soon be open to the public (31st Reuters dispatch). British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Arrives in Tianjin (Tianjin) British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived here at 2:30 pm today on a British warship. The British Consul-General and important British expatriates came to greet him. It is reported that Ambassador Kerr departed from Shanghai on the Taikoo Shengjing Wheel on January 28, and after arriving in Yantai, he transferred to a British warship (31st Reuters dispatch). Manila Youth Joins the Eighth Route Army After Graduating from Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, Engages in Political Work (Chongqing) Li Cheng (transliteration), a 26-year-old youth from San Fernando, Manila, joined the army to participate in the Eighth Route Army. He traveled from Manila via Hong Kong, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Xi'an to Yan'an. He traveled by passenger ship, on foot, and by military truck for a total of five months before reaching his destination. Although the weather was cold, he was still wearing tropical clothes, and he was penniless. It is said that he has now been renamed "Li Franklin," the same name as U.S. President Roosevelt, because both are "lovers and fighters for freedom and democracy." After graduating from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, he is engaged in political work (31st Associated Press dispatch). For the Sake of Our Readers’ Health and Happiness in the Coming Year - Wellington We are thrown into society, which is akin to throwing ourselves onto the battlefield. We are surrounded by crises that we cannot avoid, such as wind, cold, heat, humidity, epidemics, and germs. These are like airplanes, artillery, stray bullets and rifles, and if we are not careful, we may endanger our lives. These dangers are greater in cities and fewer in the countryside. Therefore, in terms of life expectancy statistics, those who live in the countryside live longer on average than those who live in the city. It is not without reason that this is the case. However, we are burdened by our families, and for the sake of food and clothing, and for the sake of our children, we have no choice but to toil in the dust to seek a livelihood. If this is the case, should we stake everything on our physical health without regard to the "art of life defense"? This is surely unacceptable. Things must first decay before worms are born, and diseases only come when there is a void to enter. Those with strong resistance can turn a major illness into a minor one, and a minor illness into no illness, while those with weak resistance are prone to worry and illness. Therefore, the most important principle of hygiene is to increase the ability of the five members of a household to resist disease. This method of preparing for a rainy day is far more effective than waiting until the last minute to seek divine help, or treating the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt. Winter tonic is the groundwork for health care next year, so choosing a suitable tonic is of utmost importance to the health and business endeavors of the coming year. Speaking of common tonics, turtle and fish liver oil are the best, as they contain large amounts of vitamins A and D. However, fish liver oil is often impure or too fishy, ​​and those with weak stomachs may find it difficult to swallow. "Wellington Malt Extract Fish Liver Oil" is made from the finest Norwegian clear fish liver oil, which is pure, clear, and has very few impurities and no fishy taste. It is mixed with vacuum-concentrated barley malt extract and supplemented with aromatic and delicious ingredients, scientifically prepared. It functions to nourish yin, nourish the lungs, nourish the brain, nourish the blood, improve appetite, strengthen the spleen, strengthen muscles, and strengthen bones. And because it contains vitamins A, B, and D, it is not only fragrant and delicious, but also suitable for people of all ages. It is truly the only wonderful product for winter tonic. As for those who are strong and healthy and have a better appetite, if they prefer to take clear fish liver oil, "Wellington Pure Clear Fish Liver Oil" is also very suitable. Because it is pure, thick, and not fishy, ​​its potency is greater. And because it is directly imported in large quantities, the price is lower. It can be said to be an affordable tonic. These two types of "Wellington" brand fish liver oil are now sold by the Zhengwei Pharmacy opposite the Great Stage on Er Ma Lu. It is the 10th anniversary of the release of these two tonics, and 10,000 bottles are being given away as gifts. The price of "Wellington Malt Extract Fish Liver Oil" is $1.80 for a three-pound bottle, and the price of "Wellington Pure Clear Fish Liver Oil" is $2.40 for a large bottle. Buy one get one free (call 92525 to purchase but does not include delivery). However, the stock is limited and will be gone in a flash. Anyone planning for health and happiness in the coming year should not miss this opportunity.

Hitler Frankly States Desire to Achieve Territorial Claims Germany and Italy Struggle Together Germany Will Help Italy if Attacked Japan's Collapse Deemed Unfavorable to Germany (Berlin) Yesterday, on the 6th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, leader Hitler delivered an important speech to the Reichstag. The surge in national morale can be said to have reached its peak. The crowds surrounding the parliament were estimated to be tens of thousands. In addition to the 855 members of parliament, the diplomatic corps and press seats in the venue were fully occupied. The parliament convened at 8:00 pm sharp. First, the Speaker of the Reichstag, Goering, requested Dr. Frick, the Minister of the Interior, to speak. Frick immediately proposed that Goering be elected as the new Speaker of the Greater German Reichstag. The entire audience unanimously passed the proposal. Goering then gave a brief speech and invited leader Hitler to deliver an important speech (31st Haitong dispatch). (Berlin) In his speech to the House of Representatives last night, leader Hitler said, "If another country wages war against Italy, regardless of the motive, Germany will definitely assist Italy without any doubt." He then discussed the colonial issue and raised demands for both Germany and Italy, stating, "Germany's former colonies have been stolen by other countries, which is morally unfair and economically insane. It is unimaginable for a great power with a population of 80 million to remain in an inferior position for so long. This situation is the same for Germany as it is for other countries in a similar position. It is very clear that if the world's resources are not rationally divided, they must be redistributed by force" (31st Havas dispatch). (Berlin) When mentioning Japan in his speech to the House of Representatives last night, Hitler said that the determining factor in the relationship between Germany and Japan is the common recognition of the need to curb the dangerous tide of Bolshevization in a blind world. The German people are determined to do this with all their might. The anti-communist common goal may one day become the crystallization point of a group of powers, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the harm caused by the devil to world peace and culture. The Japanese nation has set many glorious examples of heroism in the past two years and will strive to serve civilization in the Eastern world. The collapse of Japan would be detrimental to the civilized countries in Europe or other parts of the world and would only allow Bolshevism to gain a decisive victory in the Far East (31st Reuters dispatch). Hitler's Speech (Berlin) Last night, Hitler delivered his long-awaited speech in the House of Representatives, stating that Germany has no hatred for France and Britain and is willing to coexist peacefully with them. Germany has no territorial claims on these two countries other than its original colonies. The crux of Hitler's speech is that his party will have a long period of peace in the future. If Italy is dragged into the vortex of war, Germany will fight shoulder to shoulder with it. This is absolutely certain. Germany is much easier than other countries to wage economic warfare. Germany does not want colonies to station large armies, but purely to alleviate economic difficulties. Germany has not asked other countries to adopt Germany's own trade plan. Germany's relationship with the United States has been disturbed by false propaganda. We do not allow Americans to interfere in our German affairs. One thing is very clear to the German people, and we allow them to be very clear about it, that is, Germany is undoubtedly always in a particularly difficult economic situation. We must indeed fight, but we will definitely win this struggle. Today, I tell you that we have already won this victory. Hitler recognized the statement of democratic countries that Germany was plotting against the Netherlands, saying that the idea that we would attack them because the United States or South America or the Netherlands had different political systems was absolutely inaccurate. We do not pay attention to spreading National Socialism abroad. Recalling the History of Struggle Establishing National Socialist Regime At the beginning of his speech to the 855 members of the Greater German House of Representatives, Hitler recalled the events of January 30, six years ago, when the Nazis took power. He said that at that time, about 13 million National Socialist Party men and women voters were behind him, while the remaining 20 million people were separated from him, scattered among fifteen political parties and small groups. The only factor that united them was a common aversion to our movement. They fought for a long time to resist the National Socialist Party and compete for leadership in order to protect their interests. They colluded with the Jews, and the politically minded bishops of various churches all raised their hands to bless them. At that time, only the mystery of the last hour could save Germany. Our enemies scoffed at our belief in this mystery. If Germany had fallen into the turmoil of Bolshevism that day, it would have inevitably accelerated the crisis of the entire Western civilization to an unimaginable degree. Only the most limited islanders can imagine that the Red Fist had once lingered and shrunk before the dignity of democracy or on the borders of unrelated countries. When Mussolini and Italian Fascism rose up, the salvation of Europe began on the other end. The National Socialist Party carried out this rescue work on the other end. Today, we are able to witness in a more distant place that the international attempt by the Jews to sweep away the world's culture in Europe has also been bravely overthrown. Six years is enough to realize the dreams of centuries. Those who are without ideological knowledge are easy to believe that we have achieved this result without struggle. In fact, before the unification of Germany this year, we had been fighting fanatically against political doctrines for nearly twenty years. We have used unwavering will to implement courageous resolutions in order to strive for this success. The Annexation of Austria into the Territory Gloriously Received the First Test Hitler then gave a detailed account of the events of 1938, the merger of German and Austrian ideologies, and the annexation of Austria into German territory in the end. He said that all of this was carried out so quickly, without a break. Our confidence in the speed and efficiency of the new Germany has not been disappointed, and has even exceeded our original plans. Hitler mentioned the day of Germany's mobilization during the Czech crisis, saying that we did not threaten anyone. We only tried to defend ourselves to prevent attempts by third parties to interfere. In the future, we will not tolerate any attempts by Western powers to interfere in matters that are entirely related to us in an attempt to prevent natural and reasonable solutions. This is something I need not assure you again. Therefore, we were all very happy when we began to establish friendship with Mussolini. Chamberlain and Daladier's adaptability was also very admirable. Relying on the strength of these two men, we were able to find a principle of agreement, which not only allowed the urgent events to be resolved peacefully, but also could be regarded as an example of the possibility of making a general and reasonable decision on all important issues. If the great powers were not determined to solve the problem in this way or another, they would never be able to complete this unification. At this time, there was no need to draw a knife for national unification, but only to draw a knife for self-preservation in the face of external threats. The German youth army has gloriously received its first test. Urgent Need for Territory to Alleviate Economic Difficulties Hitler then emphasized that what makes a country great is strict discipline within the country and the unity of the national strength. After the Great War, Germany was forced to pay huge contributions and reparations, and its colonies were also stripped away. From an economic point of view, seizing Germany's colonies was completely unconscious. Before the European War, the democratic countries all heard that if Germany disintegrated, Britain's trade would naturally become more stable. But Britain and its people have not become richer as a result, and today Germany is stronger than before. We do not want colonies to station large armies. We have a sufficient population and are already content. However, in order to alleviate economic difficulties, we have to return to the colonies. Promoting Trade Policy Reserving Food for Wartime We do not want to ask other countries to adopt Germany's trade plan. We want to buy food and raw materials and sell goods. This is in the interest of other people as well. The ideal of political economists that the value of currency is based on gold reserves is not worth laughing at. In our opinion, the value of the German mark must be based on the working people and the quantity and quality of production. The first way to alleviate Germany's difficulties is to expand its space. It has not yet benefited from kicking it, so Germany must increase its exports. From an economic point of view, it is even more necessary to return Germany's old colonies. It is more important to provide jobs for 7 million unemployed people than to increase their wages. We must export goods in order to purchase food abroad. The German people depend on exports for their livelihood, otherwise we will become starving people. But I can assure you that the German people will live, and their leaders are willing to do everything in their power to manage everything. No Hatred for Britain and France Willing to Coexist Peacefully Hitler resolutely declared that Germany does not hate France or the United States and is willing to coexist peacefully with both countries. We have answered all those who advocate war through German newspapers and informed the German people of their names, such as Cooper Aiden, etc. Taking the Excuse of Overpopulation Anti-Semitism Must Still Be Carried Out Germany currently has 135 people per kilometer and no room to accommodate Jews, while other countries have room. But they all say they cannot allow Jews to live there. If the internationally powerful Jews try to start another great war, the result will not be to destroy Germany, but only to make the entire European Jewish race perish. Will Follow French and American Precedents to Promote the Separation of Politics and Religion Hitler spoke of the church, saying that if the church is not satisfied, the German government is ready to separate politics and religion at any time, just like France and the United States. Germany and Italy Are in Cahoots to Maintain Common Interests Hitler's remarks on reducing armaments stated that from an economic standpoint, it would be prudent to reach a political and colonial compromise with Germany. This is more effective than taking a path that only allows arms manufacturers to reap huge profits while increasing the burden on the people. If foreign politicians threaten us with economic sanctions plans, then I dare to assure them that, if so, it will inevitably trigger an economic war of desperation, and we are easier to carry out than other over-satisfied countries. If Italy is dragged into the vortex of war, Germany will fight shoulder to shoulder with it. This is absolutely certain. Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany will be able to preserve the civilization of Europe. Assisting in the Spanish Civil War to Avoid Falling into Red Hitler said that Germany is now assisting the Spanish Nationalists in order to save Spain from the possibility of Bolshevization. They will save the people and annihilate the political clergy who are the enemies of the people. They will deal with all the enemies of the country. Germany would try to unite the Christian churches, but because of the resistance of a few bishops, it could not do so and abandoned this move. Now only those who advocate war think that there will be war. He himself thinks that there will be a long period of peace in the future. Raise the Issue of Recovering Territory Again Broadly Discuss Foreign Relations In addition to colonies, Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France. If they say that colonies are worthless, then why are they unwilling to return them to Germany? It is a joke to say that Germany cannot govern its colonies. All opposing arguments are a matter of power and have nothing to do with justice or reason. Without adequate space and some necessary raw materials, the economic survival of the people cannot be maintained. Our relationship with North America is now disturbed by false propaganda. We do not allow Americans to interfere in our German affairs. We have friends in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. We have good trade relations with the Balkan countries. We hope for the stability of Czechoslovakia and hope that the country will not return to the dangerous attitude of former President Benes. Four-Year Economic Plan Will Continue to Be Implemented in the Future Hitler's speech lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. After the speech, General Goering, the Commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, thanked him. General Goering also thanked Hitler for his hard work in the past six years. Then the members of parliament sang "Germany Above All" and the National Socialist Party song. Hitler's speech will be broadcast by the radio station with a summary translated into English, French, and Italian. Before Hitler's speech, Interior Minister Frick Chuan announced that Germany's four-year self-sufficiency plan will be implemented for another four years. General Goering was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House by the entire House (31st Reuters dispatch). Mussolini Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the German Leader (Berlin) Today is the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently sent a telegram to Hitler, saying, "Since the establishment of the Axis between our two countries, our friendship has been profound and our relationship has been close. This is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. I am delighted to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule." The leader immediately replied with a telegram of thanks, saying, "I am very grateful for your telegram of congratulations. The close friendship between our two countries is further proof of this" (30th Havas dispatch). Chamberlain Delivers a Speech Promoting Anglo-German Cooperation Britain Truly Has Comrades (London) Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that Hitler said in his speech yesterday that the British and German nations are willing to cooperate with each other in a situation of mutual trust. I take this opportunity to reiterate that this sentiment is shared by the British government and people. However, to date, the British and German governments have not considered conducting any negotiations (31st Havas dispatch). Fascist Conference Scheduled to Convene This Saturday Italian Prime Minister Will Make a Statement (Rome) Here, people are paying close attention to and looking forward to the Fascist Conference this Saturday. The conference is the first major conference of the Fascist Party this year. Mussolini will make an important report on several important matters. The so-called important matters include: Chamberlain's visit to Rome, Ciano's visit to southern Hungary, the conquest of Barcelona, and Hitler's speech in the Reichstag (31st Haitong dispatch). German Leader Awards Medals (Berlin) Yesterday, German leader Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels distributed medals to those who received the German National Arts and Sciences Award. This award was established by Hitler to replace the Nobel Prize because Germans are prohibited from accepting the Nobel Prize. Germany once had a man named Ossietzky who, one or two years ago, was in a concentration camp and, although he won the award, was not allowed to accept it. The German National Arts and Sciences Award is worth 800 pounds sterling per award. During the cultural conference held in Nuremberg in September, it was decided who would

Science and Life
Published Foreword by the Shanghai Society of Friends of the China Science Society, Ji Qian

The world today is a world dominated by science. Among all countries in the world that are able to survive and not perish, there is virtually nothing that does not require science. The scope of science is very broad, and the categories are numerous. However, strictly speaking, it can be divided into two major categories:

Natural science, and
Social science. Those that belong to the former include mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology (with meteorology, and geography attached), botany, zoology (with physiology, psychology, etc. attached), and so on. Those that belong to the practical applications include various engineering fields, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering; there are also architecture, mining, agriculture, forestry, and medicine, which utilize the foundations of pure sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and geology, and apply them to the utilization and benefit of life. Those that belong to the latter include politics, law, economics, sociology, education, history, and other disciplines. Although not pure science in the strictest sense, they are also based on mathematics, physics, biology, and other sciences, and have a great effect on national welfare and people’s livelihood. Other academic fields not discussed in this article, as long as they contain the nature of science, are all inseparable from the two major categories mentioned above.

The benefits of science to human life are countless. Here, we will discuss the most obvious ones in general terms: such as the vastness of the earth, the great distances between countries, often tens of thousands of miles apart, and the obstruction of high mountains, deep seas, and vast oceans, making mutual contact and communication absolutely impossible in ancient times. Since the development of science, transportation tools have become more and more advanced and refined, with ships, trains, airplanes, wireless telegraphs, and other inventions, which have reduced all the dangers of nature, solved the problem of space, and made transportation around the world as convenient as it is today. The Earth is an infinite treasure trove, and what is contained within it was initially necessary for human life. Ancient people allowed these resources to be buried and wasted, unable to develop and utilize them. In modern times, scientists study the formation of various rocks, observe the types and distribution of ancient organisms, and determine the age and structure of strata; with the development of chemistry and mechanics, they can now excavate and refine gold, silver, coal, iron, gasoline, and other minerals, which are all extracted by mankind. The plains and open fields of the world all have crops growing among them. With the application of biology, physics, chemistry, and other sciences to agriculture, cultivation and harvesting have been gradually improved, and the profits are many times greater than in the past. Industrial raw materials are scattered and abundant throughout the world's waters and lands. With the advancement of biological surveys, geological surveys, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and other fields, organic and inorganic materials can be absorbed and utilized to a great extent, and the precision of manufacturing is constantly improving. Human health and longevity have greatly increased compared to the past due to the progress of medicine and other disciplines. Human clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all been greatly improved due to the development of science. The advantages and disadvantages, beauty and ugliness, of what people can enjoy today compared to what people could enjoy a hundred or decades ago are as different as heaven and earth. There are countless other areas where human life requires science. There is no doubt that humanity relies on science to evolve. Therefore, the nation with the highest level of modern culture must have the most scientific talents and the most prosperous scientific endeavors. However, what our people should pay the most attention to is that science is not only a necessity for human life, but also enables human thinking to be orderly and systematic, conforming to the laws of nature, obtaining a true view of life, and adapting to the environment in one's conduct and actions, making everything appropriate. Individuals become outstanding members, and the whole becomes a superior nation. If the people of a country can be like this, then the education in that country will be particularly developed, the order of society will be extremely stable, the financial resources of the country will be abundant, the strength of national defense will be strong, the politics will be enlightened, and there will be long-term stability and security, without internal worries or external troubles, and the country's fortune will reach its peak, and the people will enjoy the joy of peace. Therefore, science is truly a good medicine for a nation to cure poverty and overcome weakness.

Today, in civilized countries, people cannot live without science for a moment. If our people want to survive in this world and avoid the tragic disaster of inferiority and defeat, in addition to striving to promote science and producing a large number of highly skilled experts to respond to all urgent problems, the general public should also have common sense about science, so that they can use science and benefit from it in their daily lives. Only when the general public in the country, the majority of whom are knowledgeable about common science, can the spirit of society be cultivated and strengthened, and the potential of the nation be strengthened, can the country's destiny be long-lasting. But how can common sense about science be acquired? How can individuals devote themselves to science? The first step is to read ordinary science publications from time to time, as a plan to accumulate gradually and achieve great things. Ordinary scientific common sense, such as those contained in this column, are all simple and easy to understand; people with a little common education can easily understand them without any difficulty. If one can practice it tirelessly and persevere, regarding pure science (such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, geology, etc.) or applied science (such as engineering, agriculture, medicine, and those involving social sciences), when reading regularly, classify them by category, select and extract the essentials, and prepare a common scientific foundation, in order to have a day of integration and understanding. After studying for a while, one can specialize in a field that is of the greatest interest and closest to one's nature, while still reading other fields from time to time, continuing to extract information, striving to understand the general meaning of general science, and having the ability to seek further knowledge in the field that one loves and specializes in, so-called "To know something of everything and to know one thing well." This is the law of learning, and all those who aspire to self-study must not ignore this meaning. If the people of our country can devote themselves to science, and the number of people with common sense about science increases day by day, there will inevitably be scientific experts emerging from among them in the future. Thomas Edison of the United States, in his early days, did not develop an interest because of reading ordinary science publications, and then devote himself to in-depth study, and later become a great inventor unparalleled in the world, whose contribution in applied science has benefited all mankind? This is what the young people of our country who aspire to self-study should take as a model. Moreover, if the people's scientific knowledge is rich, their knowledge and skills will increase, and their thoughts, vision, character, morality, health, and physical strength will improve, and the problem of making a living will be easily solved. This is a superior nation that will not be eliminated by nature, and the progress of society and the strength of the country will naturally become stronger day by day. Today, our people are working hard to strive for survival. Because science was not very developed in our country in the past, we have suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. At this time of serious national crisis, patriots should rise up and catch up, do their best to contribute to the path of saving the country through science, which will surely contribute to the final victory and future construction. The publication of the articles in this column is intended to encourage each other with those who are interested in the country.

### Science and the Wine and Vinegar Industry
Xin Jun

Louis Pasteur of France wanted to convince people that science is beneficial to industry, can help production, and directly enrich the country and benefit the people. Therefore, he once brought many glass instruments with his assistant, Mr. Cookler, to his hometown of Arbois, to study the diseases of wine, in order to save the endangered wine industry. First, he borrowed an old coffee shop as his laboratory. There was no gas lamp and no running water. He temporarily used a charcoal stove blown by bellows and self-drawn well water. All the equipment was temporarily made by hiring several coppersmiths. Pasteur went to visit many of his old friends and asked them for various wines. Some were sour, some were bitter, some were viscous, and some had turned oily. He knew from experience that winemaking depends on the action of yeast, and he suspected that the spoilage of wine must be caused by another kind of small organism. Sure enough, he looked at these wines one by one under a microscope. In the viscous wine, there was a string of special small organisms. In the bitter wine, there was another kind, and in the spoiled wine, there was yet another kind. Then he invited many people who were in the wine business to show his skills. He told them to bring all kinds of bad wine with strange tastes, and said to them: "I don't need to taste it, I can know what's wrong with your wine." At that time, people naturally didn't believe that he had this kind of ability, but they wanted to make fun of him. They each brought wine. Some deliberately mixed some good wine in it. Little did they know that he saw it all under the microscope. He pointed out the problems of those wines one by one, and even identified the good wine as good. Everyone at the scene was stunned. Their contemptuous attitude changed to admiration. They all said in unison that he was an amazing genius. After everyone dispersed, Pasteur discussed with Mr. Cookler how to deal with these small organisms, so that they would not turn good wine into bad wine. Finally, they invented a method. That is, when the wine is about to be brewed, heat the wine slightly, without boiling it, so that even if there are undesirable microorganisms inside, they will be eliminated, and the wine will not be spoiled. This method is now used for sterilization, and in Western languages, it is called "Pasteurize" after his name.

The people of eastern France learned this method from him and solved their problem of spoiled wine. The people of central France then clamored for him to solve the problem of vinegar making. Pasteur rushed to Tours, France, and used his microscope as his tool in the same way. People told him that there was often a special scum in vinegar, which was a sign of vinegar making. If there is no such scum, wine cannot be turned into vinegar. Sure enough, in less than a few weeks, he researched that these scum were all thousands of small organisms. Finally, he gathered the vinegar merchants together and told them that these microorganisms turn wine into vinegar when they drink it. In a few days, they can produce more than 10,000 times their own weight in vinegar. For example, if a person has a body weighing 101 kilograms, they can chop one million kilograms of wood in four days. Do you think this kind of ability is shocking? However, these small organisms have this ability, so we cannot underestimate the work of microorganisms. Therefore, Pasteur thought of an elephant, a cow, or a person that can be killed by the power of a microorganism. This is not an impossible thing. Before leaving Tours, he helped the vinegar merchants solve the problem of how to cultivate and nurture these vinegar-making microorganisms, so that they can do a good job of making vinegar by adding oxygen to the wine. As a result, Pasteur almost gave the local vinegar merchants a generous gift worth millions of francs.

### What is Coal? How Does it Burn?
Jing Qing

Coal is one of the many minerals that make up the Earth's crust, and it is produced all over the world. It is usually buried deep underground and must be mined, but in some places, coal can be mined by quarrying.

Coal in coal mines is usually not in lumps but in layers. The thickness of coal seams varies, sometimes only a few inches, sometimes several feet. The two coal seams are separated by rock layers or clay layers, and some are separated by oil shale. In some places, the coal bed is six miles deep from the ground, but the coal seam is not very thick.

To mine coal, a well or deep cave must be dug. Where the coal passes through, tunnels are dug in all directions to dig out the coal, leaving materials to separate the coal layers. The dug coal blocks are lifted to the surface by a crane suspended in the mine. On the one hand, pillars are erected at the excavation site to prevent the top of the coal seam from collapsing.

Geologists tell us that coal is the remains of abundant plants that covered the ground thousands or even millions of years ago, earlier than the birth of mankind. The soil in coal-producing areas was very fertile at that time, the climate was very warm, and trees and weeds grew very tall.

During the process of crustal movement, great changes occurred on the ground. The dry land, which was previously full of trees, gradually sank and became the seabed. Then the river carried sand and weeds down and deposited them on the seabed.

As the sand and weeds piled higher and higher, their enormous weight, plus the heat of the earth, pressed the trees below into solid blocks, which is the coal we mine.

The river constantly raised the sand, and the previous sediment was pressed into stone. We can see the shells and fossils of marine animals in this rock, which proves that the coal bed was once flooded.

In Greenland and northern Canada, there is a place called Baffin Island, where there are two large coalfields, and the coal is produced on the ground and can be dug out with a shovel. The place is extremely cold, and no trees can be seen within three thousand miles nearby. However, explorers have discovered a large forest under the ground, which is well preserved. The direction in which these trees lie down seems as if they were blown by the sea breeze. Even the fruits on the tops of the trees are still fresh. All of this indicates that Baffin Island must have been much warmer at one time than it is now.

Plants, like animals, are composed of four main elements - carbon (charcoal gas), hydrogen (light gas), oxygen (nourishing gas) and nitrogen (light gas). The amount of nitrogen is very small. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air, which is composed of carbon and oxygen. Plants retain the carbon to form the body, and release some of the oxygen back into the air.

Plant roots absorb water and obtain hydrogen from the water, because water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen is also absorbed by the roots to nourish the plants.

Since coal has been transformed from decayed plants, we can infer that it is also composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the process of decay, it loses most of its oxygen and nitrogen. A pound of ordinary coal contains twelve ounces of carbon, half an ounce of hydrogen, and two ounces of oxygen and nitrogen.

During combustion, carbon and hydrogen emit large amounts of heat. Although hydrogen is much less abundant than carbon in coal, it is equally important, because, weight for weight, nitrogen emits more heat than carbon.

Burning coal requires oxygen. Oxygen is usually supplied by air, because air is composed of gas and nitrogen. Our bodies are constantly burning. We breathe air into the lungs, and the blood absorbs oxygen from the air and distributes it throughout the body so that it comes into contact with tissues. Oxygen is burned to form carbon dioxide, which is sent back to the lungs, where it is exchanged with oxygen and exhaled. Our bodies feel warm because of this combustion, and we also get the ability to act, speak, and think from it.

If we stay in a small, unventilated room, the oxygen will quickly run out, and carbon dioxide will poison us. The same is true for burning coal. Coal must have a constant supply of gas to keep it burning.

When coal is first heated, hydrogen and part of carbon combine into a gas called hydrocarbon. In fact, there are many different gases because hydrocarbons have different compositions. They are important gaseous fuels.

When we sit by the fire and watch the coal emit gas streams, sometimes cracking into flames, we see hydrocarbons. But when the coal is not hot enough, some hydrocarbons do not emit gas, and some condense on the surface of the coal into a waxy substance.

Usually, the temperature of the fire is not enough to ignite this hydrocarbon gas, so black smoke and soot spots occur, which wastes a lot of useful heat. Therefore, coal stoves must have a sufficient supply of air.

### A Bomb with a Driver
Yuan

Air Force personnel often find it difficult to hit targets when dropping ordinary bombs from high altitudes, because they cannot follow the bombs as they fall and guide them to the correct destination. This problem has been solved. A bomb that can accommodate a driver inside has now been designed. This bomb is launched from an altitude of 10,000 feet and steered by the driver lying inside the bomb, causing it to glide until it is directly over the target object at a distance of approximately 3,500 feet. Then it is allowed to fall straight down, making it easy to hit the target.

What about the driver? He has a parachute on his back, ready to detach from the bomb and land safely before reaching the destination. To avoid the danger of landing in enemy camps, this bomb is now limited to naval warfare. Therefore, a portable rubber boat and sufficient food are specially prepared for him, so that he can float on the water after landing, waiting to be rescued. It is said that this bomb can sink battleships worth 20 million gold pounds, and the driver himself can ride a small boat and triumphantly return. (British Armchair Science)

### New Invention of Wireless Radio Light
(New York Times, Dan)

The French Mr. Costel has invented wireless radio wave lighting, which has recently been patented. This new type of light bulb is spherical, without a filament, and the interior is a vacuum coated with phosphorescent or other luminescent powder chemicals. When excited by high-frequency radio waves, it emits bright light. When in use, it is suspended on a line (metal line), and this nickel is used as an antenna for a prototype wireless radio transmitter. From this, we predict that in the future, this type of light bulb may be used to illuminate streets and houses. When used to illuminate streets, the antenna used is a single wire, and when used to illuminate rooms, the antenna can be parallel or fan-shaped.

### Children’s Telephone Bureau
(Soviet Yearbook, Dan)

The "Central Park of Culture and Recreation" in Moscow has a telephone bureau. All the work is done by children. There are 80 lines connecting the houses and institutions in the children's village in the park. There are also 25 telephone receivers set up in various parts of the village, each representing a famous city in a foreign country. The intention is to allow the children to use the telephone for international calls, and to use the language of a certain country when communicating with that country. Fifty skilled members of the Archimedes Society work in the telephone bureau. The society is dedicated to young inventors.

### Artificial Plastics
(New York Times, Dan)

Four researchers from the U.S. Forest Service have invented the use of sawdust, straw, waste wood, and sugarcane stalks to make useful artificial plastics. The inventors boil any of these wastes in water and dye under steam pressure, resulting in a hard, heavy, black, and shiny glass-like material that has a high resistance to water and moisture. This material is an excellent electrical insulator and can be used to make buttons, door knobs, and car handles, and base plates for nickel electrical appliances. The manufacturing process of this plastic is very simple, requiring only three hours of cooking. It contains 85% to 95% of the original waste. After the generated compound is dried, it is ground into powder. If heat is applied and a pressure of 1,500 to 3,500 pounds is applied, the powder can be molded into artificial resin.

### Ancient Seeds Can Still Germinate Today
(American Science Communication, Yuan)

Several seeds of the oriental red lotus, which have been buried for three to five hundred years, were successfully germinated after proper treatment by the Chicago Field Museum. These seeds were obtained from South Manchuria by Professor Wugge, who excavated them from the bottom of an ancient well, which was formerly the bottom of a lake. The seeds were buried inside. There is a willow tree with a diameter of four feet on the ground where the seeds were found. A similar smaller willow tree was cut down and counted to have 125 growth rings. Therefore, the professor concluded that the seeds must have been buried for three to five hundred years. After he tried planting the seeds, he found that they could still flourish.

### All Properties of Chinese Shipyards Occupied by Japanese
Ten shipyards along the Huangpu River Important machinery removed

Except for the Jiangnan Shipyard, which is state-owned, all other shipyards in this city (excluding foreign-owned) are commercially operated. After the war, all of them were occupied by the Japanese, resulting in extremely heavy losses. Unexpectedly, the Japanese recently moved the machinery from various factories to the vicinity of Taitong Warehouse in Lujiazui and handed them over to the Japanese company Nisshin to start the Nisshin Shipyard. Chinese business owners have no way to consult. The details of the investigation are recorded as follows.

Ten factories before the war

According to the investigation, among the Chinese-owned iron factories, those with a larger scale and specializing in repairing and building ships totaled ten before the war. They were distributed on both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River. Their names and addresses are as follows:

Laogongmao, located in Bailianjing, Pudong
Sanbei, located in Rihui Port, Nanshi (formerly operated by Sanbei Shipping Company)
Dazhonghua, located at the bottom of Yangshupu Dinghai Bridge
Hongchang, located at the southern end of Xuejia浜, Nanshi
Taixing, located next to Hongchang Factory, Nanshi
Caili, located at Chunjiang Pier, Lujiazui, Pudong
Longchang, located in Lujiazui, Pudong
Hengchangxiang, same as above
Hongxiangxing, same as above
China Merchants Inland River Factory, same as above
All of the above factories are of considerable size.

Two factories requisitioned for military use after occupation

Since the Japanese army occupied the suburbs of Shanghai, the above-mentioned factories have all been occupied by force. Several soldiers were stationed in each factory, and no one from the factory was allowed to enter. Last year, Laogongmao in Pudong and Dazhonghua at Dinghai Bridge, which were larger in scale, were organized and recruited a large number of ignorant Chinese workers to work for them. Laogongmao was under the management of the Japanese Navy, specializing in repairing small vessels such as naval speedboats. Dazhonghua was under the management of the Japanese Army, specializing in repairing damaged guns, artillery, ironclad vehicles, and other weapons.

Nisshin occupies machinery from five factories

Recently, in order to develop its own commercially operated Nisshin Shipping Company, the Japanese designated vacant land near Taitong Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, to be handed over to the company to start the Nisshin Shipyard, so that workers could be hired to start business. All the machinery, such as motors, lathes, and shears, were moved from Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and China Merchants Inland River Factory in Lujiazui. Ignorant foremen were used to recruit Chinese workers to repair and build ships. Once preparations are complete, work will begin soon.

Mitsubishi takes over Jiangnan Shipyard

The state-owned Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, was reorganized by the Japanese earlier. All the machinery used to repair and build ships, except for a part that was abandoned when the national army moved west, was completely moved from the Sanbei, Hongchang, Hexing, and three commercially operated iron factories in Nanshi to Jiangnan Shipyard for use. The factory was also completely allocated to the Japanese Mitsubishi Shipping Company by the Japanese authorities and renamed Mitsubishi Shipyard, sharing the limelight with Nisshin. All the shipbuilding factories and heavy industry owned by Chinese in Shanghai have completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese.

### Surviving Crew Members Describe Dangerous Situation
Hit a reef due to dark weather Fortunately, fishing boats came to the rescue

The news that the crew of the Kaibo ship, which hit a reef and sank in the Diaoban sea area outside Haimen, were rescued, and part of the crew had returned to Shanghai, while the shipowner and 20 others remained in Taiwan waiting for the ship to return to Shanghai, has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at about 4 p.m., the shipowner led the crew members back to Shanghai on the Far East Company's Hana ship, and then went to the relevant parties to report the details of the accident. After the crew members reported to the company, they rushed back to their residences to reassure their families.

Yesterday, this reporter met with the crew members who returned to Shanghai on the ship and heard a very detailed account of the accident and rescue. According to them, on the 23rd of last month, the Kaibo ship left Shanghai with a full load of coal for Ningbo. At 9 a.m. on the 24th, it arrived outside Wenzhou Port and anchored. As usual, it had to clear customs with the Wenzhou Customs. It then left Wenzhou at 9:30 p.m. that night and set sail for Ningbo. The sky was dark that night, and it was impossible to see one's fingers.

It was difficult to distinguish even things nearby. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 a.m. (on the morning of the 25th), when sailing in the Diaoban sea area outside of , they suddenly heard a loud crash and the whole ship shook. They knew that a major accident had occurred. Upon closer inspection, the hull had hit a reef, and seawater immediately flooded in. The ship urgently sent a telegram for help, and the sound was pulled back, and the hull gradually sank. Nearby fishing boats rushed to the ship to rescue the crew. The shipowner ordered the compradors and other crew members to disembark first, and finally

The shipowner led the chief mate, second mate, third mate, and the crew members who came with him today to disembark. The large ship also sank at that time. At 10 a.m. the next morning (the 25th), they landed at Xi'ao, which belongs to Wenling County. After having lunch there, they were led by the villagers to Daliang Township and reported to the township chief, Chen Sidao. Mr. Chen was honest and kind, but he was very anxious because the whereabouts of the compradors who had left the ship earlier were unknown.

Very anxious Chen then ordered people to investigate and learned that 49 people had already passed through the border and were advancing. Everyone was relieved. They were entertained by Mr. Chen and stayed overnight. Because the area prohibited able-bodied men from leaving the border, they were issued a document to accompany them to Wenling County. First, they went to the Township Joint Office, and then a representative from the office accompanied them to the county government to prove their identity and obtain passports. They took an inland small boat to Luqiao, about 90 miles away.

Luqiao changed ships to Haidou, which was fifty miles away. They arrived at Haimen on the evening of the 27th. Because the hotels were full and there was no place to stay, they were specially permitted by the owner of the Hana ship, and they stayed on the Hana ship. Yesterday (the 30th), they came to Shanghai from Haidou, and finally arrived at the port at 4:45 p.m. today, stopping at the Roosevelt Pier on the Bund of the French Concession. It can be said that it was a great fortune in misfortune.

### Haida and Hafa Ships Released One After the Other Have Sailed to Shanghai from Qingdao

All three ships were searched and silver coins were confiscated. The Japanese falsely claimed that they were aiding the Chinese army, but the foreign merchants firmly denied it. The British adopted a tough stance and insisted on continuing to sail to Fuyu. The Haida, Yongzhen, and Hafa foreign ships were hijacked by Japanese warships to Qingdao a few days ago at Yanghekou. After negotiations by the British Consulate, Yongzhen has been released first and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. The Haida and Hafa ships have also been released one after another and left Qingdao for Shanghai yesterday morning at 11 a.m. However, all three ships were searched in Qingdao, and the silver and legal tender loaded on board were confiscated. The Shanghai-Japanese naval authorities even claimed that the three ships were aiding guerrillas, but the foreign merchants firmly denied it. The Shanghai-Fuyu route will continue to operate after the three ships arrive in Shanghai. The details are as follows, according to a reporter from Modern News Agency.

Haida and Hafa released at the same time

The British Yongzhen and Norwegian Haida and Hafa, etc., were forcibly hijacked by Japanese warships and Qingdao Customs patrol ships near Yanghekou in Haizhou at about 9 a.m. on the 27th of last month and sailed to Qingdao. After the British and Norwegian consuls telegraphed the consuls in Qingdao, the Yongzhen ship was released the day before yesterday and sailed directly to Shanghai under the protection of the British warship Haynamma, and will arrive in port this morning. Yesterday, the Norwegian Consulate in this city received a telegram stating that after the Norwegian Consulate in Qingdao continued to protest, the Haida and Hafa ships were also released one after another and set sail for Shanghai at the same time yesterday morning after adding coal in Qingdao, and are expected to arrive in port in the next few days.

Silver and legal tender on three ships confiscated

Yesterday, a reporter from Modern News Agency learned from the companies of the ships that the shipowner of the Haida ship, Norwegian Mr. Peter, telegraphed from the ship that after the Haida and other ships arrived in Qingdao, they were illegally searched by the Japanese and the silver coins (mostly hard currency) and legal tender loaded on board from Fuyu to Shanghai were confiscated. Although the British and Norwegian consuls negotiated, the Japanese actually confiscated all the silver coins. As for the legal tender, it will be returned after verification.

The Japanese falsely claimed to aid the Chinese army

It was also learned that the spokesman of the Japanese naval authorities in this city stated to foreign reporters the night before last regarding the detention of the three foreign ships, falsely claiming that the three foreign ships were transporting kerosene and other military supplies from Shanghai to Fuyu, unloading them onto sailing boats, and transferring them to the mainland to aid the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the Qingdao Customs authorities impounded them. However, the British and Norwegian shipping companies absolutely denied this and believed that this illegal move by the Japanese was obviously to squeeze the rights and interests of foreign expatriates and attempt to monopolize shipping in various ports. This decision was made after the ships were severely searched and suffered considerable business losses. Therefore, they decided to ask their governments to seriously negotiate to stop the barbaric behavior of the Japanese in order to protect the interests of foreign expatriates in China.

British merchants advocate continuing to sail to Fuyu and Ning

The British Kailin Mala ship loaded cargo and sailed to Fuyu from Shanghai on the 28th. Because it was blocked by Japanese warships outside Yanghekou, it was forced to return to the original ship. It arrived in Shanghai at 10 a.m. yesterday. It is now known that the owner of the ship, British Mr. Maller, is extremely indignant at the illegal obstruction by the Japanese and believes that the shipping rights of British expatriates cannot be destroyed by the Japanese. Therefore, he advocated that the Kailin ship should ask for the protection of British warships again and continue to sail to Fuyu. However, in order to avoid accidental losses, the customers who entrusted the cargo all advocated that after the Yongzhen, Haida, Hafa and other ships arrived in Shanghai, they would inquire about the details before discussing and deciding whether to continue sailing.

### Tonghai Troops Severely Damage Japanese Army
The Japanese army at Sanyu Town was annihilated. More than 80 no one survived

According to a guest from Nantong, guerrilla warfare in Tonghai counties has occurred from time to time in the past six months, but there have been no significant gains or losses for either side. This is because the troops in the two counties are local strong men who have not been rigorously trained and lack sophisticated weapons. In addition, the officers' command is ineffective, so it is difficult to achieve results in combat. Until recently, in a battle in Sanyu Town, Tong, more than 100 Japanese troops

The entire army was annihilated, which made the people very happy. Recalling that since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Haimen and Sanxian City Qinglong Port three months ago, they immediately repaired the Tonghai South Main Road and stationed troops in various towns along the road. Since the various troops did not resist, the Japanese army entered

No man's land. People in the two counties were heartbroken. In order to recover the lost land, the Jiangsu Provincial Government first dismissed Magistrate Wei of Haimen and appointed Sun Xinfu, the brigade commander of the ×× Brigade of the ×× Group Army, to take over. After being appointed, Mr. Sun led his team south, first resolving all the land boats and battalions in Qidong within ten days, and then starting to reorganize the military discipline of the various battalions

Appeasing the local area, he recently built fortifications in the Sanyu Town area in preparation for an ambush. The Japanese army did indeed depart from Si Jiaba at 7 a.m. on the 22nd with more than 80 people in seven cars and advanced towards Sanyu Town. The villagers saw the Japanese army swarming in and rushed to avoid them. Mr. Sun made preparations early and calmly waited for the Japanese army to approach the defense line and swept them with dense machine guns. The Japanese army was caught off guard and collapsed. At the same time, a certain battalion commander supervised the team to pursue them from the Beixing Bridge. Within two hours, the Japanese army

All were killed in battle, and the Chinese army only suffered a few casualties while waiting for work. Since this battle, the Japanese army has been a little restrained and no longer as arrogant as before. It is heard that Mr. Sun graduated from Huangpu and participated in the Battle of Shanghai on January 28. He is extremely brave. This time, he won a victory, and the people of the two counties were all grateful.

### Adjusting Foreign Trade Local Products Concentrated in Kunming for Export The area is the only main channel to foreign countries. Main local product exports gradually increase

After the Trade Committee of the Ministry of Finance adjusted foreign trade, it has been making every effort to encourage local products, increase production to promote foreign sales, and unite with the China Vegetable Oil Company, the Central Trust Bureau, the China Tea Company, etc. to purchase the country's main export local products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, medicinal materials, mineral sand, etc. For goods exported and sold in foreign exchange, taxes are exempted. Since implementation, it has been quite effective. The entire trade has gradually improved, and the number of import surpluses has gradually decreased. The Ministry of Finance has increased the fund for the association, totaling 80 million yuan in national currency. In the past, the export of local products was concentrated in Hong Kong, but now it has been decided to concentrate in Kunming, because Kunming is the only main channel to foreign countries in the northwest. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs to Hanoi in French Indochina, the Yunnan-Burma Highway runs to British Burma, the Kunming-Sichuan Railway is under active construction, and the Kunming Commodity Inspection Bureau has been established. The Kunming branches of the China-China Communications and Agriculture Bank and various commercial banks have also been established one after another.

Fortunately, the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Daily Report
There Were Two Market Prices for Public Bonds in One Day
Interest Included in the Morning, Interest Excluded in the Afternoon
Market Waits to See What Happens After February 10th

Securities in the Black Market: Yesterday's market conditions were slightly chaotic. Generally, the morning prices included interest, while the afternoon prices excluded interest. This type of approach was unprecedented and should be considered innovative. It's also a unique phenomenon of the current spot market activity. Selling was prevalent in the morning, as naturally people were willing to cash out their profits and avoid the hassle of receiving payments in six-month installments. This also reveals the general sense of uncertainty among the public. Based on this, the public outrage and the fierceness of the price surge, as well as the severity of the decline, all happened within a month and a half. The market has returned to the same sluggishness as before December 12th of last year, even worse. The price surge gradually started on December 12th and continued until January 10th of this year, experiencing a flying leap and rising by ten yuan. After January 10th, the market gradually turned bearish, with the decline becoming increasingly severe, even more so than the increase. By yesterday, it had fallen by more than ten yuan again. This back-and-forth movement suggests the presence of manipulators, causing speculators to become wary and hesitant. This situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. Yesterday's trading seemed stagnant, with a significant decrease in transactions. The market price was interest-inclusive in the morning and interest-exclusive in the afternoon. Because major players were observing, retail investors, although slightly interested, were not enthusiastic. Major sellers were Dakangcheng and Dafenghao, but their sales were limited. Market prices fluctuated within a range of ten to twenty cents, roughly similar to the previous day's market. The afternoon market excluded interest, with prices generally reduced by one yuan and seventy or eighty cents. Normally, this would only be reduced by two and a half yuan, so the market still appeared weak. A more standard market price is expected to emerge after the Type A lottery on February 10th. Currently, the situation is still chaotic. The total transaction volume for the day was only over 300,000 yuan. There were no transactions for Type D and 96 bonds. The interest-inclusive and interest-exclusive prices for the morning and afternoon are listed below.

Interest Included in the Morning, Interest Excluded in the Afternoon

Stock Transactions: More than 80 shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Company were traded at a price of 5.05 yuan, slightly higher by one cent than before.

London Chinese Foreign Debt Market Prices on January 30th (Monday): Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation and a few railway bonds saw slight declines, falling by half a pound to one pound. Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds issued in England continued to fall by half a pound, with a price of 46 pounds, the lowest price for this month. Daqing Railway Bonds fell by one pound, with a price of 22 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at 21.5 pounds and the latter at 18 pounds. Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds issued in France had an asking price of 44 pounds and a selling price of 45.5 pounds. The supply of Anglo-French-American 5% bonds in the spot market was quite strong, with a position of 10,000 pounds (equivalent to 50,000 US dollars) sold at a price of 67 pounds, one pound lower than the market price, but 1.5 pounds lower than the sales price a few days ago. Therefore, sellers are very cautious and have no intention of selling further. Furthermore, 3,000 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds were sold at a price of 18 pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence, 7 shillings and 6 pence higher than the market price. Continued issuance of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bonds issued in England amounted to 1,000 pounds and was sold at a price of 16 pounds. Another 1,000 pounds of winning tickets were also sold for 16 pounds, at the same market price. The current market sentiment remains weak, and it is feared that it will be difficult to recover in the short term if there are no special developments.

London Market Prices of Stocks of British Far East Companies on January 30th (Monday): Only bank stocks saw a slight increase, with Mercantile Bank shares rising by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 8 pounds, 17 shillings and 6 pence. HSBC shares each rose by half a pound. The price of shares registered in England was 82.5 pounds, and the price of shares registered in Hong Kong was 84.5 pounds. There were no other changes. Stop selling and wait and see, so the price immediately rebounded. The Qian-Dui-Ye Jin-Hao sold 50 taels at a price of 16 yuan. Later, Qian-Dui-Ye did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 17 yuan. By this time it was 11:40 am. Later, someone still offered to buy at 17 yuan, but the seller wanted 18 yuan before they would supply, so the deal did not go through. Therefore, the noon close was still 17 yuan. At the beginning of the afternoon, due to news that foreign exchange had been manipulated by foreign firms, it gradually returned to normal, so sellers were scarce, and the price was raised to the border of 20 yuan. At 2:45 pm, Yu Hao did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 19 yuan. After that, a certain Qian-Dui-Ye suddenly came to sell, but buyers were all watching and waiting. The selling price dropped directly to 17 yuan but still no deal went through, so the late closing price was still 2019 yuan, which was 1 yuan lower than the previous day. The spot gold of Xianjin Hao was sold at a price of 2030 yuan and bought in at 2015 yuan. The current bid price is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Sugar Market
Sugar Is Almost Entirely in the Hands of the Japanese
Imported Japanese Sugar...Enjoys a Uniquely Low Tax Rate
The Planned Shutdown of Minghua...Is About to Resume Operations
It Is Fortunate That Dutch Sugar Will Eventually Retreat

Sugar imports are transported in large quantities every year before the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Lunar New Year. Since August 13th, smuggled sugar has been abundant, and Dutch, Cuban, and Taikoo sugars have been greatly affected. In May of last year, after negotiations with various countries, the sugar tariff was revised, and smuggled sugar temporarily decreased. Unexpectedly, between August and September, the previous state was restored. Recently, a certain party has come up with a clever taxation method: the sugar is first shipped to Xiamen (which has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the customs are also supported by the Japanese), and taxes are paid at the Xiamen Customs, as reported in this newspaper, and then shipped to Shanghai without paying taxes again. However, the import tax at Xiamen Customs (paid in Japanese yen) is more than 9 yuan per metric ton, while the Shanghai Customs requires more than 13 yuan per metric ton. Therefore, it is calculated that paying taxes in Xiamen can save more than 3.60 yuan per metric ton compared to paying taxes in Shanghai. Therefore, in the past month, more than 20,000 bags of this low-tax sugar have been imported, causing the Dutch ships that imported sugar a few days ago to disappear, only carrying 26,180+ bags of beeswax, 2,290 bags of raw starch, 4,650 pieces of coconut shells (raw materials for soap), and 1,300+ pieces of rubber. If this continues, Dutch sugar will surely disappear. It is said that a certain party has also raised this matter for negotiation and is preparing remedial measures, but it is feared that they will be ineffective. (Zu)

The sugar market continued its weak trend yesterday. The association’s closing price for spot Dutch coarse white sugar fell by another one cent, quoted at 24 yuan, 24.20 yuan for goods from this warehouse, 24.40 yuan bid by Da Jinqian, and 15.80 yuan bid for re-exported Dutch coarse white sugar, initially quoted at the original price, but also dropped by one cent later, with few buyers. Due to the association with Lianyingchu, the price of Dutch red sugar remained stable, with spot goods at 16.60 yuan and re-exported goods at 11 yuan, with 100 bags sold. Taikoo car white sugar fell by 1.75 cents, with B Mark East Warehouse delivery at 23.525 yuan, with 50 bags sold, determined as 23.45 yuan for CW Mark, 23.40 yuan for CX Mark, 23.35 yuan for DY Mark, and 23.30 yuan for HX Mark. It is heard that the plan to resume operations at the Minghua Japanese Sugar Factory will be realized in the short term. As of the other day, 9,000 bags of raw sugar have been shipped to Shanghai, indicating that the resumption of operations will not be far off. If so, foreign sugar may undergo further changes. Only Chao Bang opened 80 bags of Shantou cotton red sugar for national sugar, priced at 15.45 yuan, with other scattered transactions, with little price fluctuation.

Finance
Changes Remain Small
Cash Falls First, Then Recovers

Yesterday, the dark market situation of cash sterling continued to trend flat and weak. The situation fell first and then rose. Initially, news that foreign exchange had been sold off by foreign telegrams caused it to loosen slightly, and securities dealers suddenly came to sell off. In addition, a certain money exchange dealer who had previously acted on behalf of Tianjin dealers and went long also came to dump, causing the price to fall to a low of 2014 yuan at one point. However, relying on the silver store dealers buying in on the dip, and money exchange dealers also following suit to scoop up, it immediately rebounded and rose, eventually falling by one yuan. Sentiment in all quarters is downward, and trading is not active. Gold ornaments in silver stores still have not changed. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold have repeatedly declined.

Dark Market for Sterling Down 1 Yuan

From the morning, the initial selling price for each tael (ten liang) was 2020 yuan, but no deal was seen. It was not until 9:45 that securities dealers sold 50 taels to money exchange dealers at a price of 2018 yuan, which was the opening price. Subsequently, at the same price, a certain money exchange dealer sold 100 taels to the same industry on behalf of Tianjin dealers. At that time, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange had loosened slightly after being dumped by foreign telegrams, causing buyers to wait and see, and the price gradually declined. A certain money exchange dealer then sold 50 taels to the same industry at a price of 15 yuan. At the same price, another 100 taels were sold to silver store dealers. Later, silver store dealers did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 15 yuan. Before long, a certain money exchange dealer suddenly came to buy 30 taels from the same industry at a price of 14 yuan. At that time, because a certain money exchange dealer had run out of money, no deals were made.

Prices of Gold Ornaments Have Not Changed

The exchange rate for gold ornaments in silver stores still has not changed. Datonghang and Laoqingyun are still quoting the original price of 205 yuan, and Xinhanghang is quoting 203 yuan for selling and 197 yuan for buying.

Pure Gold Suddenly Drops by 1 Penny

According to a London telegram on the 30th, the price of British pure gold suddenly dropped by one penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence, causing the Bank of China's cash purchase price to also fall to 1213.3 yuan. The posted Customs gold price also fell by 2 cents, reaching 2.397 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 7 cents, reaching 1208.6 yuan.

Exchange Market Fluctuates Slightly
Foreign Telegrams Sell, Foreign Firms Buy
Process Goes from Loose to Tight

Yesterday, the exchange market situation was such that British and American exchange rates were flat for the UK and long for the US, causing the situation to become tight for the UK and flat for the US. However, there were slight fluctuations in the middle. The process was generally loose first and then tight, mainly because foreign telegrams were flooding in, and foreign firms were buying aggressively. Trading was not frequent. The absorption of Hong Kong exchange by foreign banks was not good, and money exchange dealers and others continued to sell, so the underlying trend continued to loosen.

In the early morning, the spread between London's long and short positions narrowed, the price of silver in New York remained unchanged, and the price of raw gold in London narrowed by one penny. There were no changes in exchange rates between the UK and the US, France, and Shanghai. The US dollar rose by 0.375 against the pound, also rose by 0.375 against the French franc, and rose by 0.02 against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's early morning spot selling prices were 8.328125 pence for the pound and 16.28125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound was tighter by 0.03125, and the US dollar was unchanged. After the opening, although the bank bought pounds at 8.34375 pence and US dollars at 16.28125 yuan, because other foreign banks such as Huabi and Anda Youli had sell orders, there was no change. HSBC announced that the exchange rate would not change, and the silver balancing tax would be reduced by 0.075. After that, foreign telegrams sold HSBC, Mercantile, Huabi, and British gold at 8.359375 pence, and also sold US exchange to Huabi, Dutch, and American banks at 16.3125 yuan. In addition, money exchange dealers also sold Hong Kong exchange to Dutch banks at 56.125 yuan, causing the underlying trend to tighten slightly. The bank's closing selling prices at noon were slightly looser than the morning opening, at 8.359375 pence for British gold and 16.3125 yuan for the US dollar.

Although banks such as Anda and Huayi competed to absorb Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan in the afternoon market, because money exchange dealers still had intentions to sell, and the intention to sell foreign telegrams had not subsided, the process was slightly looser. Finally, foreign firms came to settle and buy HSBC, Mercantile, and British gold at 8.34375 pence, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan, so the situation turned slightly tighter. By the evening close, the bank's selling prices were 8.34375 pence for British exchange and 16.28125 yuan for US exchange. As a result, the pound was tighter by 0.015625 compared to the previous close, while the US dollar was flat. Hong Kong exchange was slightly firmer by 0.025.

Foreign Currency Comes Out,
Prices Mostly Decline
Yesterday, British gold fell by one penny, and the British-US exchange rate fell by 0.375. The settlement of foreign exchange was still strong, and banks supplied readily. Because exchange rates loosened, there were also many people hoarding, so the price was not easy to see weaken. Transactions in the association were slightly active. Chen Tai sold British gold notes for 100 pounds to Qin Tai, and Hui Tong sold British gold notes for 30 pounds to Qin Tai. Hong Tai sold British gold notes for 50 pounds to Qin Tai, and Li Tong sold US gold notes for 500 yuan to Cheng Tai, and also sold US gold notes for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds decrease by 0.1 yuan, British gold notes increase by 0.08 yuan, US gold pounds decrease by 0.2 yuan, US gold notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, Hong Kong notes decrease by 0.01 yuan, Singapore notes decrease by 0.01 yuan, Dutch notes decrease by 0.05 yuan, Robbie notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, Canadian notes decrease by 0.03 yuan, Philippine notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, German gold notes decrease by 0.2 yuan, and Australian gold notes increase by 0.2 yuan. Only the prices of French francs, Annam, Italian, and Siamese notes did not change.

The Spread Narrows Again,
Indian Silver Rises Slightly
According to a London telegram on the 30th, speculators and the public sold off, and there was a lack of support. The market was still flat. Buyers bought at the listed price, and sellers were mostly waiting to see. The spread between near and far futures for silver narrowed by 0.0125. According to a New York silver telegram, the price of American silver was still undetermined. Also, according to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, and spot and near and far futures all rose by one anna.

Discount Rate Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts fluctuated around 37 yuan per thousand. In the afternoon, it was 36.75 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 37 yuan, slightly higher by 0.025 yuan compared to the previous day.

Yarn and Fabric
Customer Sales Are Less Than 200 Bales
Yarn Prices Decline Gradually
Bearish Squeeze on Japanese Yarn Has Been Settled
Spot Prices Plunge by Six to Seven Yuan

The yarn market is still generally sluggish, with slow customer sales. This is mainly because the accounting period is approaching, and customers are all preparing funds, so they are temporarily reducing the scope of their purchases, resulting in actual transactions being as sluggish as usual. At the same time, because hoarding households have been actively scooping up for several days, they seem to have reached their fill, and transactions on the market have become less active and less lively than before. As for the intentions of the industry, most are still watching for higher prices, but because the base price is too expensive, coupled with the increasingly tight situation in North China and the Beihai region, the demand for cotton yarn has also become weak. In the Zhejiang region, because the authorities do not allow large amounts of silver to be remitted out, the funds available to customer merchants are becoming smaller, resulting in business coming to a standstill.

Yesterday's spot yarn market situation: At the beginning of the morning market, industry members gathered to discuss, but most did not have actual purchasing needs. It was not until around 10:00 that no market price was made. Then, floating households sold on the market, opening slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 395.5 yuan. After that, prices gradually declined. In addition, many retail investors rushed to sell, and hoarding households also remained motionless, and the momentum was very weak. The lowest price for Double Horse yarn was 392 yuan. At the close, a certain industry member came to buy two to three hundred bales of Double Horse warehouse receipts, and the price of Double Horse yarn rebounded to 393 yuan. As a result, statistics showed that a total of 785 bales were transacted in the morning, with customer merchants transacting less than 200 bales. Manufacturers took no action. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was down 3 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Earth was down 3 yuan, Special Jincheng was down 4 yuan, and Tiannv was down 2 yuan. There were no transactions for 10-count and 16-count yarn. Today, 210 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, over 100 pieces to Beihai, and 315 pieces to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each gang is recorded below:

In the Japanese yarn market, the bearish squeeze on this month's skin ball transactions has been resolved peacefully, and it has come to an end. People's minds are agitated, and apart from Tianjin's strong sales, other regions remain as sluggish as usual, so the spot price of yarn has plummeted by six to seven yuan. The spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 324 yuan to 322 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 328 yuan to 327 yuan, a significant drop compared to the previous day.

160,000 Bales of Yao Cloth
Are Blocked in Eastern Zhejiang and Cannot Be Shipped Out
Local Yarn Factories Are Requesting Release for Shipment

The cotton business is becoming increasingly depressed, and all parties have no purchasing intentions, while selling prices remain stubbornly high, so the market is also stagnant and lifeless. Factories are mostly replenishing with foreign cotton, as prices are cheap and the quota can be absorbed in bulk. However, all sources are still lacking, so the future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. Judging from the current situation, inventory is weak, and market prices are also difficult to decline. Also, news that the source of Yao cotton is still blocked, and it is said that 160,000 bales cannot be shipped out. Most of this cotton has been sold to local yarn factories, and they are currently requesting the authorities to approve its release for shipment. Dock arrivals include 766 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 350 pieces of Beisha cotton, and 280 pieces from Qiya. The current cotton transaction volume and market prices are listed below.

Most Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Made by Japanese Factories
American Cotton Prices Are Falling for Near-Term and Rising for Far-Term Due to Sales Issues
The foreign cotton market price: The market is rife with rumors that the US government will propose lending 4 million bales of cotton within days for dumping overseas, causing panic. However, after Senator Peng Hai's strong rejection, sentiment suddenly became firm. However, the sale of the government's 11 million bales of loan cotton is inevitable, but it is not known what method will be used. Most traders in the market believe that near-term cotton prices will decline, so they are all selling near-term cotton and buying far-term cotton, especially March contracts. Therefore, yesterday, near-term cotton prices in New York fell by 0.09 pounds, while far-term prices rose by 0.08 pounds. Spot cotton transactions are sluggish, and factories are temporarily reporting a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by another 1 rupee. Egyptian cotton was closed. Yesterday's exchange rates did not fluctuate much. Converting to legal tender, cotton prices rose and fell. American and Brazilian cotton each fell by 0.075 yuan per dan, Indian cotton fell by 0.06 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 0.065 yuan.

Local Foreign Cotton Transactions: Various factories have been actively purchasing foreign cotton, and arrivals have been numerous in recent days. Currently, the US government's sale of loan cotton has a significant impact on the cotton market. Factories believe that the cotton market will be weak in the short term, so they are waiting to see how the world cotton market develops before deciding on their cotton purchasing strategy. Moreover, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and factories' purchases of foreign cotton have not been as enthusiastic as they were several weeks ago. Yesterday, Shui An purchased 1,000 bales of American cotton and 500 bales of Indian cotton. Other factories were quiet. The transaction volume and prices are listed below.

Jardine Matheson Fabrics
Also Levy Refugee Relief Donations

Since the Cotton Yarn Industry Association began raising funds for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, it has achieved excellent results. It is heard that the Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory, a British firm in this port, has expressed great sympathy for the refugees in deep distress in our country. Starting from October, they have voluntarily joined in, paying refugee relief donations at the same rate as Chinese factories, with the factory contributing 0.25 yuan per bale of cotton yarn and 0.25 yuan for every 40 pieces of cotton cloth. It is found that the factory has a large scale and produces a very large quantity of yarn and cloth each year, which fully demonstrates the close relationship between China and Britain. The popularity of its products in society is naturally expected.

Food
Current Flour Supply Is Lacking
Wheat Prices Remain High

There are not many flour market transactions. Since the rumor of the liquidation of the large Beiyang gang spread, other scattered gangs have had no wholesale appetite. The Nanyang gang also allocates shipments based on ship positions, and factories have insufficient flour in stock. After delivering goods daily, they are even facing a shortage of spot supply, so the total daily transactions remain as dull as before, with a total of just over 10,000 bags for local and out-of-town merchants. The price of No. 2 flour from the factory remains at 4.8 yuan. It is found that 4,600 pieces of flour were shipped to Shantou today.

Wheat Market: Since prices rose once the other day, sellers have not yet shipped the second batch of foreign wheat, and they are still unwilling to loosen prices, and factories' purchasing appetite is also not very strong, so the transaction volume has not increased. High-quality goods are holding their original prices, and medium-quality goods are seeing slight tightening. A total of 3,500 bags of wheat from Wuhu, Jiangbei, Puzhen, Chuzhou, etc. were sold on the market, of which 2,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin Factory and 1,000 bags by Fufeng Factory. The highest price was still 6.55 yuan.

Rice Prices Change Little
Customer Xian Rice Market Is Active

National Rice: Yesterday, a total of 5,000 bags of Heshang goods arrived, including 1,000 bags from Hupu. The market on the street was more active, but hoarding households remained on the sidelines due to a lack of warehouse space, so the market remained stable with little fluctuation. Prices for thick and thin Jeng, Du, Yangjian, and Bujien remained at their original levels. High-quality goods in Bien Yuan remained firm, while there were fewer inquiries about medium-quality goods, and the market was also sluggish.

Customer Xian: Yesterday, transactions turned active, and the market turned from sluggish to stable, with the situation becoming tighter. Only about 1,000 bags were publicly traded on the market, but individual retailers and hoarders directly negotiated about 3,000 bags. Transactions were mostly for large lots of goods priced at 10 yuan and 10.12 yuan, and fewer transactions were made for special goods and low-priced goods. After several days of sluggish declines, sellers were unwilling to sell at a loss, and buyers found it difficult to continue to depress prices, so they took the opportunity to buy.

Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Reappears at 28 Yuan
Due to Continuous Reports of Price Increases
On the Dalian Market
Soybean oil once entered the 28 yuan mark last Saturday. However, due to reports of price increases on the Dalian market on the previous two days, sentiment immediately rebounded. Yesterday, Dalian barrel oil exceeded the 28 yuan mark again, with prices of 28.05 yuan and 28.2 yuan, with a total of 150 barrels transacted, for delivery in late February, with 150 barrels also transacted at prices of 28.35 yuan and 28.5 yuan. Dalian Qilou oil also rose by 0.03 yuan, with 100 large barrels agreed at a price of 26.3 yuan and 150 small barrels at 26.5 yuan. Other Yanqi oil remained at its original price of 21.2 yuan, with 30 pieces transacted. Groundnut oil is arriving in a steady stream, causing anxiety, and the market price is uncertain. No transactions were seen on the market yesterday.

Yesterday there was...coming from...,

Northern Goods
Xinghua Longan and Hua Yuan Products Are Expensive
According to Xinghua Bang, there is definitely not much inventory of top-grade products such as authentic brand, authentic second, and bald barrels, so product prices have not loosened recently but have instead risen. According to news from the Xinghua Bang, prices are expected to increase by five to six yuan compared to before, and it is estimated that the spring market at the end of the year will definitely increase.

Piece Goods
The Financial Industry Has a Strong Desire to Hoard
The Market Is Full of Rising Momentum
Actual Sales of Eastern Piece Goods Are Quite Flat

National Cloth: Due to the European situation reaching its most serious stage, and the puppet government in North China announcing a second devaluation of legal tender, the financial industry has a strong desire to hoard. In addition, raw material prices are rising, and Japanese yarn is indeed strong, so the market is full of rising momentum. However, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, customer merchants' current needs are not strong, and market prices have temporarily turned quiet after rising sharply for several days, with little fluctuation. In the Southwest, the Sichuan Bang has a stronger purchasing appetite, with over 2,000 pieces of spring goods such as patterned and plain Fuchou, patterned Zigong, satin, hemp yarn, and patterned labels transacted. The Yunnan Bang purchased over 40 boxes of blue cloth, twill, bleached cloth, patterned cloth, and satin. The Wen Yong Bang purchased over 100 pieces of blue cloth, twill, and bleached cloth. The Guangdong Bang purchased four or fifty pieces of twill, blue cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. The Min Bang purchased several hundred pieces of local cloth, twill, and Shilin cloth from this factory. The Subei and Funing Bangs have greatly reduced their purchasing appetite, while the rural towns of Hai'an and Jialing have stepped up to purchase over a thousand pieces, mostly colored cloth. Wholesale shops on the street purchased over a hundred boxes of Qiantie, Biji, rough cloth, rough twill, and lower-grade dyed blank fine twill, and various factories are most busy delivering blank cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Because white cloth is being delivered by the end of the month, actual sales are flat. Fine cloth and fine twill are being resold by Tianjin Bang, and sentiment is loose. Spot market prices for various brands have uniformly declined, with fine cloth falling by 0.1 yuan to 0.15 yuan per piece and fine twill falling by 0.15 yuan to 0.2 yuan. Throughout the day, less than 500 pieces were absorbed by dyeing factories and industry members on this street. However, the market price still remains unchanged. The market price for 12-pound Caiqiu fine cloth is 12.25 yuan per piece, plus 0.0306 yuan in tax. There were no deals made yesterday, so most industry members, seeing the firm foundation of goods, still have the intention to hoard them when prices are low.

Piece Goods Exports: Today, 75 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, 10 pieces to Haikou, 9 pieces to Beihai, and 250 pieces to Haiphong.

Demand for Felt, Woolen Fabric, and Down for Shoes Is Strong

It's Unnecessary to Argue with the Useless

Buddha:
Yesterday's newspaper reported reliable news from Berlin that Hitler's speech this year will be longer than in previous years, even longer than any of his past speeches. The speech draft is about two hundred pages long, amounting to tens of thousands of words, which cannot be completed in two or three hours. Mr. Hitler's speech is too strenuous and unsuitable for the elderly. At the time the reporter wrote this article, Mr. Hitler's speech draft had not yet been read, so what he will be talking about is naturally unknown. But I can summarize this tens of thousands of words long article in two sentences: The first is to consolidate the Rome-Berlin Axis, and the second is to reclaim the colonies. In fact, not only is the speech draft too long and unnecessary, but also such a speech is meddlesome, because Mr. Hitler's intentions are already clear to everyone, so there is no need to use speeches for propaganda and make them known to every household. In fact, if Mr. Hitler is interested, he may as well write a "History of Aggression Techniques" for the world to read, which may not be a bad idea. Such a lengthy speech is really unnecessary.

It was also reported that Dr. Kawai, a professor of political economy at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, wrote a book that was considered by the authorities to disturb peace and order and was banned from publication. Recently, the new president, Dr. Hiraga, took office and then engaged in taking action against unstable elements, resulting in more than ten people being dismissed or resigning from the Department of Political Economy. What is Mr. Kawai's book about? Even the Japanese people are not fortunate enough to read it, and we can't even talk about having the opportunity to see it. However, Mr. Kawai's book is considered by the Japanese authorities to disrupt peace and order and is banned from publication, which shows that he is dissatisfied with the actions of the warlords. In fact, the anti-war sentiment among the Japanese people, with the exception of the warlords, is generally consistent, especially among the intellectual class, which is even more enthusiastic. However, under the pressure of the warlords' power, they are unable to resist and have to swallow their anger, remain silent, and seek temporary peace. But from time to time, there are generous and tragic heroes who express their discontent, which are then fabricated and purged by those who act as accomplices. The people are also very pitiful. However, this kind of suppression cannot last long. The so-called "preventing the people's mouths is like preventing rivers, and there will inevitably be a day of collapse and rupture. Moreover, the higher the pressure, the more severe the rupture; the stronger the prevention, the wider the collapse. It only shows that their efforts are fruitless. Dr. Kawai, please be patient and don't be discouraged. There will soon be a day to vent your anger."

At the Banquet
Ba Dun
In the towering building, I stood by the window. Looking down, pedestrians were like ants, and cars were like long snakes. The electric lights were flashing, like goddesses on the street, emitting alluring light.

It was a corner of the metropolis at night.

The heat was rippling in the room, like a spring breeze blowing across the water, causing ripples. People's faces were flushed, as if everyone had applied rouge. Melon seeds were crackling, being sent from the box into mouths, and then quickly thrown on the ground.

"Why isn't Mr. Tu here yet?" Old Li grabbed a handful of melon seeds, impatiently looked at his watch, and added, "It's past seven o'clock!"

Before anyone could join in the conversation, a voice jumped up: "A guest is here!" The door curtain was lifted, and it was our Mr. Tu who came in.

Everyone stood up, letting smiles roll all over their cheeks, and different words crawled out of different mouths:

"Haha, speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives,"

"How unreasonable, people are celebrating your birthday, and you come so late!"

"A penalty drink! A penalty drink!"

### After the Close of the Fifth Plenary Session, No Changes in Central Political Organs; Cooperation with the Communist Party Seems to be Based on the Principle of Abandoning Party Membership; Mao Zedong and Others Will Be Appointed as Supreme National Defense Commissioners; The National Defense Commission Becomes the Highest Ruling Body in the Country

(Hong Kong) The Central Standing Committee, following the Fifth Plenary Session, convened on the 2nd. Apart from the announcement of the Deputy Minister of Propaganda, it is heard that there will be no changes in the political organs. The resolution on cooperation with the Communist Party holds that if they can abandon their party membership and join the Kuomintang, it would be deeply welcomed. Participation in political work in an individual capacity will also not be refused. The highest national wartime organ is about to be established to centralize authority and coordinate major plans, which will be implemented by the front and rear. A certain important person said that the future organization of China will be truly strict, and the new atmosphere will be enough to excite the whole country. In the future, everything in the country will be subject to military control, and no one will be allowed to evade military service, which is tantamount to making every citizen a soldier. The rational arrangement of all military, political, party affairs, economic, and financial matters is sufficient to support a protracted war of resistance. In the front, in addition to the deployment of positions to cope with stubborn enemies, there are also considerable preparations for the future recovery of the country and the construction of a modern nation. (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 31st)

(Chongqing) A United Press reporter inquired with a senior official of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee about the nature and role of the Supreme National Defense Commission established by the recent resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session. He stated that according to the original resolution, the nature and role of this organization are unprecedented. This group is organizationally a liaison mechanism between the Kuomintang and the National Government, similar to the Central Political Committee, but with greater power and a broader role. The Central Political Committee can only decide on administrative matters; the Supreme National Defense Commission is a military and political decision-making and command body, responsible only to the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. All political, military, and party affairs related to the war of resistance aim to coordinate various activities to achieve ultimate victory and consolidate unity, so that all national strength and resources are used for the war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, this organization is not established under the National Government, but under the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. Its members include leaders from the national political, military, party, and cultural circles, and are therefore not limited to Kuomintang members. Members and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, the China Youth Party, and the Chinese National Socialist Party will all be invited to participate. It is heard that Communist Party leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De have been invited to join the commission. All military, political, and party organs must abide by the decisions made by the commission. China must now strive to absorb the spirit of democracy, and the purpose of this commission is to implement this point. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

(Chongqing) According to Kuomintang sources speaking to a United Press reporter, the Supreme National Defense Commission will begin work on February 1st. The National Government's political and administrative organs, the National Military Council (military administrative organ), and the Kuomintang Central Headquarters (organ for executing party affairs) are all subject to the control of the Supreme National Defense Commission. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

(Chongqing) Political figures here today stated that yesterday's declaration from the Fifth Plenary Session clarified that the Kuomintang does not want members joining from two parties to exist. In other words, it rejects the Communist Party's hope of allowing Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang. However, this cannot be immediately interpreted as friction between the two parties, as the Communist Party has never formally made such a proposal. The Communist Party has proposed allowing Communist Party members to join the Three People's Principles Youth League, but this is different from requesting to join the Kuomintang. According to the current plan, the Three People's Principles Youth League is no longer a party organ but a state organ, allowing members of all parties to participate. Furthermore, the Ta Kung Pao commented that the declaration of the conference indicated that all parties in China will remain in their original state and will not change their organizations, but all must strive together under the guidance of the Three People's Principles to seek liberation for the nation. According to reliable sources, Communist Party members will not participate in the government in the near future, but several Communist Party leaders, such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, etc., will be appointed as members of the Supreme National Defense Commission. The Supreme National Defense Commission is an expanded organization of the former National Defense Council. The former National Defense Council was merely an advisory body, whereas the current new Supreme National Defense Commission is the highest command organ for political and military activities during the war. The Military Council and the Ministry of Military Administration are both administrative organs under the control of the new Supreme National Defense Commission. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

(Express News Agency dispatch, 31st)

(Changde) According to reports from the front, Japanese troops in Yueyang have recently increased slightly in number, but the exact number is unknown.

In addition, a part of the Japanese soldiers patrolled to the vicinity of Junshan by motorboat yesterday, also firing randomly along the lake with small cannons and machine guns before retreating immediately.
