### The Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo

London dispatches frequently report: Regarding the Tianjin issue, the British Ambassador to Japan and Japanese diplomatic authorities will seek a solution in Tokyo. According to unconfirmed reports, Japan's demands on the Tianjin Concession include three key points: (1) to search for Chinese anti-Japanese elements within the concession, so that the concession will no longer be a base for anti-Japanese activities in the future; (2) in North China finance, the concession must cooperate with the Japanese side, that is, the concession will no longer support Chinese legal tender, and will accept the circulation of counterfeit currency; (3) existing silver in Chinese banks within the concession, valued at 48 million Chinese currency, will be handed over to the Japanese side. As for the extradition of the so-called four suspects, which was the immediate cause of the Tianjin case, it seems to be set aside for the time being; even if it is not mentioned in other Anglo-Japanese solutions, it is already undeniable that the two sides do not regard this as a problem today. Moreover, the British public is indignant about the humiliation suffered by British nationals during the blockade, and this is indeed the focus, which also does not seem to be of concern to the Tokyo negotiations; the British authorities probably believe that the past humiliation was "deserved," and only seek to be exempted from future humiliation.

On the eve of the start of these negotiations, according to the attitude taken by the British newspapers, as reported by Reuters, they are generally "welcoming with cautious words, but with strong suspicion"; our feelings are the same. In fact, on the surface, the United Kingdom has always advocated that the Tianjin issue be resolved through negotiations as a local incident, so it has endured humiliation that no nation can tolerate; now, after more than ten days, negotiations are expected to begin, which can be said to be a masterpiece of Mr. Chamberlain. The authorities' response to the questions from the members of parliament was to show a slight pleasure, and their feelings can be imagined. In fact, any international issue should be resolved through negotiations; the UK's proposal for negotiations has naturally not been rejected by Japan; if the UK now regards Japan's agreement to negotiations as a sign of Japan's compliance, it is too much of a "misunderstanding." The problem is not in the negotiations, but in the outcome; the UK's main view lies in the outcome of the problem as a local incident. What is a local incident? In terms of the statement made by the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin when they blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, such as the so-called issue of concessions in China, and the so-called issue of aiding China's war of resistance, these truly exceed the scope of local incidents, and the British side has stated that they can never be accepted; however, if the above-mentioned three key points of the Japanese demands all state that the Tianjin concession should be how it should be, does the mention of the Tianjin concession not mean that Japan has also recognized the local scope? Will the United Kingdom accept it because it is limited to the local scope? If so, the United Kingdom's so-called local incident is a case of self-deception; why? If the negotiation of the Tianjin issue is limited to the Tianjin locality and accepted, flowing down the stream, Shanghai is also a local issue, Gulangyu is also a local issue, and even Hong Kong, Singapore, and India, none are not local issues; under the blockade of force, in the policy of appeasement, not only will local ways be unblocked, but the world will be at peace. This is by no means an exaggeration, Japan is most adept at dealing with weak countries to obtain "local" solutions; before and after the September 18th Incident, it also had the most extensive experience in obtaining local solutions in China; when China was determined to resist aggression, it first announced a "full-scale war of resistance" to its people, which was aimed at the so-called "local solutions."

In making this statement, we do not dare to belittle the United Kingdom for being so weak; the other day, British Major General Knowles questioned in the House of Commons: "Will the Prime Minister insist, at the beginning of the negotiations, that the interference suffered by the British nationals in Tianjin should be absolutely terminated; will he declare that the patience of the United Kingdom in the past two weeks has been greater than that endured by any great power in the world in history?" It can be seen that it is not only we who are worried about the UK's excessive weakness; and Mr. Chamberlain's failure to answer this question shows that the worry has a source. What is somewhat comforting is that the United Kingdom also adheres to three points in the Tokyo negotiations, we are told: (1) The solution to the Tianjin case is limited to Tianjin, which is the so-called local incident theory is not worth mentioning, because Japan's original intention was not necessarily to encircle Tianjin in order to encompass Great Britain; (2) The Tianjin concession maintains neutrality in Sino-Japanese relations and maintains the integrity of its authority within the concession; (3) The solution to the Tianjin incident must not harm the United Kingdom's entire Far Eastern policy. Whether the authorities in power in the United Kingdom are adhering to this remains to be proven by the facts; if what is said is true, then it is strange that the United Kingdom has not resolutely raised the second and third points as principles, but still included them in the so-called "local solution."

Negotiations are about to begin, or perhaps even in the middle of negotiations, we are both worried about the weakness of the British authorities and suspect that the negotiations will inevitably have no achievements. The future of the Far East depends entirely on the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war, so the Anglo-Japanese parties, at least on the Japanese side, do not want to make any decisions about the future before the end of the war, unless all their demands are met; this is one reason. Japan's demands on the Tianjin issue may be small, but its hopes are extravagant. What it extravagantly hopes for is in conflict with the United Kingdom's vaunted Far Eastern policy, and the United Kingdom is naturally unwilling to openly belittle itself; this is a second reason. Various views and strategies within Japan are inconsistent; what the military does not want to accept, Tokyo does not dare to compromise; what the military hopes for, Tokyo may not be able to implement through diplomacy; this is a third reason. The United Kingdom's patience and weakness do have their limits, and Japan's contempt for the United Kingdom in recent years has far exceeded the limits of the United Kingdom; this is a fourth reason. The success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is fundamentally related to Japan's attitude towards the United Kingdom; now the success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is still uncertain, which is seen by Japan as an excellent opportunity to wait and see and to extort concessions; and the United Kingdom's repeated concessions to the Soviet Union have further increased Japan's obstinacy towards the United Kingdom; this is a fifth reason. The United Kingdom is trying to find the moderate faction in Japan as its opponent, thus falling into a fundamental error in strategy; the United Kingdom believes that showing favor and enlisting the moderate faction in Japan can increase the political influence of the moderate faction and facilitate the success of Anglo-Japanese negotiations; in the eyes of the Japanese extreme right, the United Kingdom's attempts to appease the moderate faction are a clear sign that the United Kingdom is afraid of the extreme right, which is a reason to adopt a tough attitude towards the United Kingdom, and also a counter-evidence that the moderate theory is insufficient to promote Japan's prestige; therefore, every concession, every compromise, will inevitably make the Japanese moderate faction speechless and make the extreme right elated; now, the United Kingdom still believes that it is following the diplomatic path, taking the moderate route, to explore the key to solving the Tianjin issue, but it does not know that its plan is wrong; this is the sixth reason. Only these six reasons will lead to protracted negotiations and delays in reaching a decision. And what the United Kingdom must do urgently is to ensure that milk and bread continue to be imported into the Tianjin Concession without interruption.

### British Consul to Japan for Negotiations; Situation in Tianjin Gradually Easing; Chongqing Groups Send Telegrams to Comfort Chinese in the Tianjin Concession

(Tianjin) The body searches of foreigners here have been greatly relaxed, but the businesses of British nationals and foreigners within the British Concession are still at a standstill. According to a certain British national, Japan may have a large-scale war with the Soviet Union, so the Tianjin dispute between Britain and Japan is easy to resolve. According to a certain British banker here, Japan's demand for the British side to cooperate and support its "United Reserve Bank" banknotes is impossible. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)

(Chongqing) The Japanese army has blockaded the British and French Concessions in Tianjin for more than half a month. The various trade associations and women's cultural circles in Chongqing City are greatly concerned about the fact that compatriots in the concessions are in dire straits, and have sent telegrams of condolence and encouragement to fight to the end. (Telegram, 28th)

(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, people close to the Foreign Office here said that the United Kingdom does not intend to change its current general policy in the Far East, especially its policy on Chinese currency. The 48 million Chinese currency in Chinese banks in the British Concession should not be handed over to the Japanese side, because Chinese financial issues are not only related to the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom's policy towards China is also part of the United Kingdom's entire foreign policy. When Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie holds talks with the Japanese authorities, he will treat the Tianjin case as a local incident and try to resolve it, so that the Japanese side does not use this case to change its policy towards China. In short, the principle of maintaining the neutrality of the British Concession in Tianjin can be accepted by the government, but the United Kingdom must maintain the integrity of its authority in the concession. (Havas telegram, 28th)

(London) The Times has commented on the upcoming negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan on the Tianjin incident, with a rather optimistic tone. Its words are as follows: "The British and Japanese authorities announced yesterday that negotiations will be held in Tokyo, which is indeed what we are pleased to hear. As for the issues to be discussed by both parties, although the Japanese authorities said that they will not be limited to the extradition issue of the four Chinese in the Cheng Xigeng case, the scope should also be limited to the various issues related to the Japanese army in North China. Regarding this level, it should be clarified after the negotiations begin. As for the demands that Japan may make, some of them have been rejected, and some are difficult to accept. Although it is impossible to know how it will be resolved in the future, judging from the current situation, the fact that the negotiation venue has been moved from Tianjin to Tokyo shows that the Japanese diplomatic authorities are very willing to seek a peaceful and reasonable solution, because the situation in Tianjin is extremely tense. If negotiations were held there, they would inevitably fail. If so, the extremely serious development caused by the local dispute would be unavoidable." (Havas telegram, 29th)

### Japanese Troops of the Baizhen Company Fail to Invade Southward

Xingji: The Japanese troops who invaded southward on the Baizhen Highway have recently been moving in and out of Zouzhen. The Japanese troops who retreated to Henglingguan were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army along the way. Japanese corpses are piled up like mountains in the Majiashan, Yanjiashan, and Liulinli areas, and a large number of baggage and military equipment have been abandoned, all of which have been seized by the Chinese army and are currently being inventoried. The remnants of the Japanese army are relying on the stronghold of Henglingguan and artillery fire to cover their retreat northward in disarray. The Chinese army is pursuing in several directions. (Telegram, 29th)

Tongguan: The Japanese troops who retreated from Yuanqu to Fuluo Town, and then to Henglingguan, were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army along the way. Japanese corpses are piled up like mountains in the Majiashan, Yanjiashan, and Liulinli areas, and a large number of baggage and military equipment have been abandoned, all of which have been seized by the Chinese army and are currently being inventoried. The remnants of the Japanese army are relying on the stronghold of Henglingguan and artillery fire to cover their retreat northward in disarray. The Chinese army is pursuing in several directions. (Telegram, 29th)

(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military dispatch, 10,000 Japanese troops in the Jiangxian area of ​​southern Shanxi are currently attacking Jicheng in three routes, attempting to encircle Yicheng. The Chinese side has formulated countermeasures according to the predetermined plan. In Jiangxi, because the rise in the water level of the Fu River hinders the construction of Japanese defensive works, the Japanese troops in Maqiushi (transliteration) have withdrawn to the west of Maqiushi after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese side, and Maqiushi has been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)

### Over a Thousand Trucks Delivered to China Last Month

(Chongqing) According to reliable Chinese sources, more than 1,000 trucks arrived in China last month. The second batch of trucks this month, with more than 500 vehicles, is expected to arrive in China this week. These trucks are mostly purchased by China from the United States, including products from "Dodge," "Ford," and "GMC." According to people in the transportation industry, it will take at least two years for all the trucks purchased by China to arrive completely. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)

### Japanese "Manchukuo" Planes Repeatedly Invade Outer Mongolian Territory; Soviet Deputy in Japan Recalled Home; Japanese Newspapers Claim Diplomatic Relations Severed

(Moscow) Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" air force bombers, escorted by fighter planes, again flew back across the border yesterday, invading Outer Mongolian territory in the Lake Buir area. The Mongolian-Soviet defense forces immediately responded with anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes. The Japanese "Manchukuo" bombers then indiscriminately dropped several bombs without clear targets and fled without engaging, hastily retreating to "Manchukuo" territory. (TASS dispatch, 29th)

(Moscow) Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" bombers, under the protection of several escort fighters, again invaded Outer Mongolian territory in the Lake Buir area today. The Soviet-Mongolian air defense forces immediately responded with anti-aircraft artillery. The Japanese "Manchukuo" planes indiscriminately dropped many bombs. When Soviet-Mongolian planes took to the air, they dared not engage and immediately fled towards Manchuria. As a result, the Soviet-Mongolian anti-aircraft artillery teams shot down two Japanese planes, both of which crashed in Outer Mongolian territory. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

(Moscow) Soviet Deputy Representative to Japan, Smetanin, has been recalled to the country for consultations. Responsible figures here recently stated that this matter is purely for ordinary official reasons and has no special significance. Deputy Representative Smetanin has been stationed in Tokyo for a long time, exceeding two years since leaving the country, and it is only natural that he should return for a visit. Furthermore, it is not clear to most people here why air battles have been constantly occurring recently in the Lake Buir area on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo." The area is desolate and uninhabited, and airplanes seem to be the most suitable combat tool. There is no official information on the number of Soviet troops in Outer Mongolia that can be considered credible, but there is at least one infantry division and one motorized brigade, totaling about 25,000 personnel. The population of Outer Mongolia is 900,000, which can supply 100,000 combatants. As for the transportation situation on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, a railway has been built within the "Manchukuo" territory, running from Changchun to the Heilongjiang Jiashan (transliteration) area on the border. On the Outer Mongolian side, there is only a highway running directly from the Lanut area to the border. Up to now, Japan and the Soviet Union have been taking diplomatic actions. However, Soviet People's Commissar Chairman and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov recently made a speech, saying that the Soviet Union is prepared to "stop Japan's provocative actions against Outer Mongolia," which is extremely noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

(Tokyo) Today, Japanese newspapers reported that Soviet Russia has effectively severed diplomatic relations with Japan in Tokyo. Since Soviet Ambassador to Japan Slavutsky was recalled home, Soviet Deputy Representative Smetanin has been acting as head of the embassy and has now also been recalled, leaving the Soviet Union with no diplomatic representative in Tokyo. Only a few lower-level staff members remain. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the Soviet embassy's nameplate, written in both Japanese and Russian, has now been removed. Smetanin plans to leave Tokyo for Dunka on July 5th and Dunka for Vladivostok on July 7th. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

Reuters Special Correspondent's Dispatch from the Manchukuo-Outer Mongolia Border, 28th: This reporter traveled to the front line today, traversing the area previously attacked by Soviet and Outer Mongolian planes. I neither saw Outer Mongolian planes crossing the Manchukuo border nor heard any news of this. However, news from the Lake Buir area stated that several small air battles occurred today. Last night, a Soviet fighter plane was shot down and burst into flames upon crashing. The pilot ejected with a parachute and was captured. I then met with him, but he was badly burned and severely concussed, making it impossible to obtain any answers through questioning. I only learned that his name was Traminski, and he was 23 years old. There is currently an atmosphere of unease here, and a land conflict may be imminent.

(Tokyo) According to information obtained by the Associated Press, the fighter planes currently engaged in combat with Soviet planes on the "Manchukuo" border are a new type of aircraft developed by the Japanese army through painstaking efforts. Although these planes may still be difficult to compare with the latest European and American models, they are unprecedented in Japan. Although these planes underwent a combat trial in the Changsha area this spring, they were then moved to "Manchukuo" to determine the victor. This led to the news of the Japanese shooting down 42 Soviet planes on May 28th and the news of 56 Soviet planes being shot down again on June 22nd. Although this news may be exaggerated, there must be some truth to it. It is said that the model for this new type of aircraft was supplied by Italy and incorporates features of American planes. Although its speed and combat efficiency are not as good as the latest European and American models, it marks a new era in Japanese aircraft manufacturing history. It is said that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the planes used by Japan were mostly of the 1935 model, which had been discarded by European and American countries. Later, although Japan formed an anti-communist alliance with Germany and Italy, Germany and Italy were unwilling to share their exclusive secrets with Japan. Therefore, Japan's new planes this time were still developed by itself. As for the planes currently used by Outer Mongolia, they are mostly of the 1936 model and have become outdated, making them inevitably inferior in comparison. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

### British Foreign Office Sends Memorandum to Germany: Naval Agreement to Be Scrapped If Germany Does Not Abide by Naval Construction Ratios; Denies Pursuing a Policy of Encirclement Against Germany; Ready to Revise Agreement with Germany Openly

(Berlin) The British Embassy delivered to the German Foreign Office last night a memorandum from its government regarding Germany's announcement of its abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other leaders, upon learning of this matter, immediately convened a meeting to carefully study the document and distribute its contents to various newspapers. The first critical report published today by the Völkischer Beobachter adopted a completely negative attitude, stating that the British communication contributed nothing to peace and only proved the justification for abandoning the agreement. The newspapers pointed out that the memorandum was drafted in a "provocative manner," only denying the policy of encirclement and mentioning the willingness to negotiate with Germany in a single, unfriendly sentence. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) After the German government presented a note to Britain on April 28 declaring the Anglo-German Naval Agreement terminated, British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, recently delivered a memorandum to the Foreign Office in response, stating that Britain's current policy has no intention of encircling Germany. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Contents of the British Government Memorandum

(London) After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was declared terminated by Germany on April 28 of this year, the British government recently instructed its ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, to send a memorandum to the German Foreign Office, stating: "If Germany becomes involved in a conflict of a warlike nature in any part of Europe, Britain will initially not necessarily adopt a hostile attitude towards Germany, but if it is not Germany invading another country, then it is a different matter. Germany's note of April 28, pointing to the guarantees provided by Britain to certain countries as a political decision, should know that these guarantees can only be implemented when the countries concerned are attacked by Germany. It is evident that Germany's note, referring to Britain's current policy as a policy of encircling Germany, has no basis and is a misunderstanding of Britain's intentions, which must be urgently corrected. The matter of a certain place being incorporated into Germany, no matter what reasons the German government gives to explain it, has already caused significant anxiety in all aspects. The actions taken by the British government after the occurrence of this kind of situation are only aimed at assisting small countries so that they feel safe and enjoy independence, as a means of dispelling anxiety. The right of these small countries to enjoy independence is no different from that of Britain or Germany. Britain is willing to accept certain constraints in order to achieve this goal, but its nature is limited to the day the country is invaded. To say that the British government intends to restrict the development of German trade is also not true. On the contrary, the current Anglo-German commercial payment agreement is actually beneficial to Germany, and the British government is willing to engage in further discussions with Germany to improve its economic situation if the main prerequisites can be realized. What are the prerequisites? That is, establishing mutual trust and goodwill. This is a necessary condition for conducting fair negotiations with careful thought and calmness. In short, what the British government is constantly thinking about is not to promote a war against Germany, but to lay the foundation for relations between Britain and Germany on the basis of mutual recognition of each other's needs and respect for the rights of other countries. The British government's adoption of this policy and attitude has always been the case in the past, and there have been no changes recently that would justify Germany's termination of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. As the British government sees it, the main goal of the establishment of this agreement was to find a way to stabilize the naval situation in order to avoid unnecessary competition. If the German government says that the agreement has other purposes, then there is nothing to be found in the text of the agreement. It is a pity that the German government did not ask the British government to jointly study the actual situation and abruptly terminated the British naval agreement. Even if the German note only wants to express the German government's views and not as a notice of termination, it should not have been issued before the exchange of views between the two parties. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is enough to dispel useless competition and avoid military expenses. Even if the relationship between Britain and Germany is not good, it is not enough to constitute a reason for terminating the agreement." The British government hereby declares its readiness to hold consultations with the German government in order to establish a "clear and practical understanding" on a solid foundation. [If Germany is no longer bound by the ratio stated in the agreement (the ratio of German naval tonnage to British tonnage is 35 to 100), then the British government's previous planning for its own required naval power will also be difficult to continue to use this as a standard and will no longer declare it invalid. On the contrary, if Germany intends to negotiate another agreement to replace the Anglo-German Naval Agreement after terminating it, then how the German government considers the scope and goals of the new agreement to be appropriate, the British government is eager to know one or two things. What is particularly important is the following two points: First, when does the German government think it is appropriate to conduct discussions? Second, what kind of suggestions does the German government intend to make so that the effective period of the new agreement, whether revised or declared terminated, will only be done after both parties agree.] (Havas dispatch, 28th)

German Newspapers Comment on the British Memorandum

(Berlin) The first reaction of the German newspapers to the British memorandum on the termination of the Anglo-German Agreement does not believe that the British attitude "contains a strong intention and confidence in conducting negotiations." The newspapers all said, "Regarding Germany's position, Führer Hitler made a speech on April 28, clearly expressing his willingness to open the door to negotiations and clarify misunderstandings. On the contrary, Britain has failed to clearly accept this proposal. Today's British memorandum avoids mentioning the main topic, and re-restricts Germany's claims. It also does not clearly answer the issue of the scope of each other's naval interests. According to this scope of interests, it has been damaged by Britain's policy of encirclement. Today's British memorandum, in addition to giving a vague answer, also condemns Germany for plotting against small countries. This is truly of no help to clarifying international disputes." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Regarding the British government's memorandum on Germany's termination of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it has recently been sharply criticized by newspapers here. The National Socialist Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, commented, "The British memorandum did not give a concrete answer to Führer Hitler's parliamentary speech, stating that although Germany terminated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it is still willing to establish an understanding with Britain and clearly redefine each other's scope of interests. This is a manifestation of the weakness of the British memorandum. Does Britain really want to continue to use the naval agreement as a tool to restrict the naval armaments of other countries?" The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented, "If Britain still holds a skeptical attitude, it will be impossible to generate this kind of belief in order to promote world peace and the welfare of the people." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented, "The British memorandum still does not understand the facts of German policy. It is important to know that Germany does not consider Britain to be Germany's enemy. Germany is willing to avoid interfering in the British Empire, but on the condition that Britain also does not interfere in Germany. Now it is not the case. Britain is intent on pursuing a policy of encirclement, with the intention of obstructing Germany's efforts to eliminate the Treaty of Versailles. Today's British memorandum still does not express the sincerity of engaging in negotiations. Britain claims that its policy is aimed at dealing with aggressor countries, but in fact, this definition is not precise. Before a conflict occurs, how can it be determined who is the aggressor and who is the aggressed? It is impossible to judge until after the fact. Now Germany uses these words to question Britain, how will Britain explain itself? Therefore, Germany interprets Britain's policy as a 'policy of encirclement,' which is very consistent with Britain's conspiracy." (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

### German and Italian Air Forces Agree on Joint Operational Methods; Organizational and Technical Issues All Settled; Italian Undersecretary for Aviation Valle Returns to Rome

(Berlin) Italian Undersecretary of the Air Force General Valle came here for a visit and held talks with the German authorities. He has recently completed his business and flew back to Rome today. German figures here all said that the nature of the talks was important and the process was extremely friendly. A cooperative style has been formulated for the air forces of Germany and Italy. The semi-official German News Agency also commented on General Valle's talks with General Göring yesterday, saying that the two sides conducted talks in an extremely friendly atmosphere for two hours. General Valle, based on the agreement previously negotiated by German Air Force Chief General Milch with the Italian authorities in Rome, continued discussions with General Göring. Immediately after, it was decided that various organizational and technical issues of the air forces of Germany and Italy should be thoroughly resolved jointly by both sides. From now on, the close cooperation between the air forces of the two countries has been completely determined. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Italian Prime Minister and German Führer Meet Secretly; Somewhere on the German-Italian Border

(London) The London Times correspondent in Rome recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler met some days ago at some place on the German-Italian border. Italian newspapers, which have always paid attention to the Prime Minister's whereabouts, have been silent about it recently, which is quite noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Churchill Advocates Anglo-Soviet Alliance; European Situation Will Stabilize, Japan Will Be Respectful

(London) Churchill said in a speech at the Carlton Club in London today, "I see that Italian propagandist Gayda is supporting the German propaganda minister and is extremely sarcastic about us because we have not gone to war with Japan because of the humiliation suffered by British expatriates in Tianjin. What I am pleased about is that the government has not hastily shifted its goals due to provocation. Japan has always prided itself on being polite, but now it has this public insult, which is probably a trap to induce us to lightly leave the location where the main problem can be resolved. We should not lightly send a fleet to the Far East until we are certain of our position in the Mediterranean, and there is hardly any need to send a fleet to the Far East until the position in the Mediterranean is stable. Because once the position in the Mediterranean is stable, we will see the Japanese being respectful. The Japanese are now deeply mired in thorns in China, bleeding all over, and their strength is greatly reduced in this wrong and impossible task, and the entire gravity of the Soviet Union is pressing down on North China. At this time, to say that Japan is willing to go to war with the British Empire before it is sure how European events will proceed, I do not believe it. Therefore, we should support the government's patience and firmness on the troublesome issue of the Far East." Churchill continued that he attached great importance to the situation that Europe will encounter in the next three months, because Germany may not yet understand its position properly to this day. What we must tell the world is that Germany's attack on Poland will be a decisive and irreversible event. Any act of violence against Poland, whether it comes from within Danzig or from outside, will create important problems that will affect the whole world. Foreign Secretary Halifax has announced the use of force against force. He feels that the meaning of this statement should be carefully considered by Germany. If the misunderstanding of its attitude towards Britain is not dispelled, the crisis is worrying, but he does not believe that war is inevitable. Although examining Germany's preparations, the tone of the German newspapers, and the remarks of the National Socialist leaders, it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that war is about to happen and will happen soon, there is still hope, that is, if Hitler knows that Britain and the British Empire have reached the extreme of patience, he may change his mind. Finally, Churchill advocated an alliance with the Soviet Union and warned the audience that the next three months would be the most tense period in Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Dangerous Situation in Danzig; Poland Intensifies Defense; Danzig City Prepares for Wartime; Polish Border Builds Tank Defenses; Polish Navy Gdynia Harbor Crowded; Demonstrations; President Mościcki Speaks, Determined to Defend Territory

Warsaw: Today is Polish Navy Day. Government officials have all delivered speeches, saying that Poland is determined to defend its territory. President Mościcki delivered a speech in the capital, saying that Poland must defend the sea route and must use all its strength to prevent the seizure of the Free City of Danzig. General Kwaciszewski, chairman of the Maritime and Colonial League, also delivered a speech to the crowd at Piłsudski Square here, saying that Poland is determined to defend its interests in the Baltic Sea. Afterwards, the military band played anti-German songs, and the crowds marched in formation, holding flags with slogans such as "The ocean is the space on which our lives depend" and "We will never withdraw from the Baltic Sea." When passing through the streets, the residents gathered along the way and cheered loudly. They then participated in a Mass on the banks of the Vistula River and swore an oath: "We swear to defend Poland's sea route with all our strength and will never withdraw from the Baltic Sea." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Warsaw: The issue of the Free City of Danzig has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that this issue, from whatever point of view, is of extreme importance to Poland. If Germany can occupy the city of Danzig, it will not only have a significant impact on land strategy, but the Baltic Sea will also become a German lake, and the country can further colonize the entire central Europe. But at this moment, if Germany intends to change the current system in Danzig, the Polish army will resolutely resist it. This is what German Führer Hitler is aware of, and he will continue to pursue his usual policy in the hope of managing the land without war. The method it adopts in Danzig is a gradual means of encroaching on Polish rights in all aspects in secret. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Warsaw: It has recently been learned here that 4,000 Germans secretly entered the Free City of Danzig last night from the province of East Prussia in many heavy trucks to join the volunteer corps organized by the National Socialist Party in the city. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Polish government is rushing to build fortifications in the area connecting the city of Danzig. A tank defense line about 20 kilometers long has been built from the port of Gdynia to the city of Danzig. In addition, most of the Polish navy's warships, including several torpedo boats, have also been concentrated on the sea off the port of Gdynia. However, the general public believes that German Führer Hitler may not act rashly and use force to annex the Free City of Danzig, so as to cause war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Polish Port of Gdynia: Today is Polish Navy Day, and a celebration ceremony was held here. Cabinet Councillor and Finance Minister General Kwiatkowski, Minister of Industry and Commerce Roman, and many other cabinet members participated. More than 50,000 people participated. Minister Roman immediately delivered a speech, saying, "At present, our country's economy is developing day by day. Therefore, the ports of Gdynia and Danzig must be expanded. Our country's activities on the ocean have no intention of threatening other countries, but only [to maintain] the position it deserves." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Warsaw: After the news of the National Socialist Party's military preparations in Danzig came, there was no sign of any surprise among the people here. The Polish press all asked whether an incident would occur there. Although there are various rumors in Warsaw that an incident will occur, the attitude of the general public can be summarized in the two words "vigilance." Polish President Mościcki gave a radio speech yesterday, saying that the two seaports of Danzig and Gdynia have a very important relationship with Poland's national economy. This is why Danzig has had many important connections with Poland for centuries. Mościcki concluded by saying that the above two seaports are freely open for merchant ships of all countries to come and go. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Singapore Conference Results Satisfactory; Lieutenant General Tai Ho Speaks

(Singapore) French Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Navy, Lieutenant General Tai Ho, told a Reuters interviewer today that the British-French defense conference that recently concluded here was completely successful. He hopes to meet on time to review the overall situation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the results of the meeting between the British and French army generals stationed in the Far East in Singapore some days ago were very satisfactory. "Its content is the same as the talks with the British and related countries' general staff and is not suitable for announcement." What can be said is that the methods for the complete cooperation between the British and French navies, armies, and palaces in the Far East have been decided. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Canada Youth Conference

Winnipeg, Canada - Five hundred representatives of 500,000 Canadian youth are scheduled to hold the fourth annual Canadian Youth Conference here tomorrow to study the world and its future. The conference symbolizes a miniature League of Nations, as the four-day event will include most religious groups, all classes, and dozens of ethnic groups. The Governor-General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, declared at the pre-conference meeting that universal youth had never encountered such serious problems before. However, he believed that Canadian youth possessed the courage, perseverance, and adventurous spirit necessary to cope with these problems. He warmly praised their endeavors and extended his most sincere congratulations. The only major organization not affiliated with the conference is the Catholic Youth League, which withdrew from the conference in 1938 when the Young Communist League joined. The Canadian Youth Conference will divide into five groups to consider youth work in agriculture, industry, citizenship, Canadian unity, and Canadian peace policy. (Reuter, 29th)

### New British Proposal: Revising the Conditions for Mutual Assistance Among the Three Nations; Soviet Legislators Accuse Britain and France of Deliberate Delay

(London) French Ambassador Corbin met with Sir Alexander Cadogan of the Foreign Office. French Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps in Paris. Both discussed the content of the instructions telegraphed by the British government to Ambassador Seeds yesterday. The French government reportedly suggested that the new British proposal should be slightly revised in wording so that the British position could be thoroughly explained and to dispel any doubts on the Soviet side. As a result of the discussions, opinions on both sides converged. The final instructions will be telegraphed separately to the two countries' ambassadors to the Soviet Union tomorrow, so that they can jointly continue negotiations with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. According to general knowledge here, the British proposal advocates that (1) if one of the three signatory countries—Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—is attacked, (2) if any European country that one of the three countries deems necessary to protect is attacked, then the three signatory countries should automatically implement mutual assistance. If the Soviet side still considers this proposal unsatisfactory, Britain would not object to explicitly naming the countries to be protected. However, they should still declare to the Soviet authorities that this is largely inconvenient and may only weaken the strength of the European peace front. In short, if the names of the Baltic countries are explicitly stated in the tripartite mutual assistance agreement, then the names of Switzerland and the Netherlands should also be included. Regarding this, the Soviet side may raise objections because these countries do not have normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Havas, 28th)

(Moscow) Soviet legislator Zhdanov published an article in today's Pravda, criticizing Britain and France, especially Britain, for the slow progress of negotiations on the anti-aggression agreement among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Zhdanov stated that although the Soviet government has strived to achieve the early realization of the agreement, there has been no practical progress. The current state of negotiations shows that Britain and France do not want to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union based on the principle of equality but only want to establish a treaty that would make the Soviet Union bear all the obligations alone. Any self-respecting country that does not want to be driven by others and pull chestnuts out of the fire for others will never accept such a treaty, let alone the Soviet Union, whose power and reputation are known throughout the world. In his view, Britain and France do not want to establish a genuine treaty acceptable to the Soviet Union but are merely making empty talk of negotiation to blame the Soviet Union in front of their domestic public opinion for being unwilling to compromise.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Broadcast to Europe: Japan Actively Promoting Anti-Foreign Movement, Will Eliminate European and American Interests in China

(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui broadcasted in English to Europe at 6:15 AM on the 29th from the Central Shortwave Radio Station, titled "Japan's Policy and the Future of the Interests of the Powers in China." The gist was that the Sino-Japanese War is approaching two years, and China is becoming stronger as it fights, which has plunged Japan into a quagmire. In order to eliminate European and American interests and fulfill its ambition to monopolize East Asia, Japan has recently been actively promoting an anti-foreign movement in the occupied areas. Currently, Britain is the main target, hoping to divide the countries and defeat them individually. Japan's long-standing policy of dominating the Asian continent has been fully exposed in the Tanaka Memorial and other diplomatic documents. It has now begun to implement its southward advance policy, successively occupying Hainan and the Spratly Islands as bases for its southward advance. Therefore, the territories of Britain, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and other countries in the Pacific are all threatened. Recently, it has also been actively pressuring the concessions of various powers in China, hoping to achieve its goal of encroachment. Westerners should clearly understand that Japan's aggression against China is also aimed at the countries of Europe and the West. The Japanese army has now announced the complete blockade of China's coastline, restricting joint ventures and trade with China by the powers, and the Yangtze River has been blockaded for more than a year, with no hope of opening. The current problem facing the powers, in short, is whether to maintain or abandon all treaty interests in China. Past experience has fully proven that the Japanese warlords, based on their traditional aggressive policy, will never tolerate the existence of the rights and interests of third countries in China, and attempting to compromise with Japan is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger, which will not only fail to resolve the Far East crisis but will also lead to further demands from Japan. (29th Telegraph)

(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a special broadcast to Europe this morning, stating that the powers are now faced with the important question of either maintaining or abandoning their treaty rights in China. In his view, compromise is not a lasting solution because the aggressor's established policy is to monopolize Asia as its exclusive possession. The facts of the past two years have proven that accepting one of Japan's demands only leads to new demands on a larger scale. The undeclared war has now become a movement to seize foreign concessions and drive out Western interests. Foreign Minister Wang continued that Britain is currently being singled out by the Japanese side as a target of attack, hoping to use this strategy to alienate the powers involved in the Far East. However, the flames of the anti-foreign movement instigated by the Japanese will sooner or later spread to the doorsteps of other powers. It is very clear that destroying foreign property and investment is part of the goal of Japan's "New Order in East Asia." The Chinese people are extremely resentful of the insults and atrocities suffered by the British and are grateful for the sympathy given by the world and the material assistance provided by peace-loving countries. Foreign Minister Wang appealed to the people of Europe to assist China in maintaining the principles of democracy, freedom, and the rights of others. Foreign Minister Wang further strongly advocated boycotting all Japanese goods, refusing all Japanese commercial orders, terminating all Japanese financial transactions, and prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to Japan, all of which would help curb aggression.

### Strive to Reduce National Memorial Days

(Chongqing) According to Reuters' sources in responsible quarters, the rumor that the Chinese government intends to issue a nationwide order to hang the national flag on July 1st, the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, is incorrect. It is said that although that day was previously designated as a national memorial day, the government has now decided to make May 5th the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's assumption of the presidency, and at the same time, it will also be the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. Because the country is currently in dire straits, the government is willing to reduce the number of national memorial days as much as possible. Therefore, it recently issued an order to the entire country that in the future, for all national memorial days, the people of the country only need to observe the memorial days promulgated by the government. (Reuter, 29th)

### Switzerland Prepares to Raise Funds to Help China

(Chongqing) According to a telegram received today by the National Diplomacy Association from the "Swiss Women's Security Association," the association plans to hold a "charity buying movement" in Switzerland to raise funds to help Chinese refugees and wounded.

### American Democratic Congressman Criticizes Neutrality Law; Majority of Congressmen Tend to Restore Neutral Status in International Law

(Washington) Democratic Congressman Alexander, known for his anti-Japanese stance, launched a strong attack today on Bloom's Neutrality Law bill, believing that the bill only benefits Britain and Japan. It benefits Japan because it allows Japan to purchase arms and military supplies from the United States, while China, because it has no ships, is unable to purchase them. According to Alexander, the great threat to the United States is not Germany or Italy, but Japan. Japan's goal is to use American arms, weapons, and military raw materials to conquer China, dominate East Asia, and then attack the United States. Alexander believes that the Bloom bill is not only pro-British and pro-Japanese but also biased and oblivious to the facts, and is not worth taking. (Associated Press, 29th)

(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Law issue, the amendment proposed by Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, (advocating the abolition of the current provisions on the embargo of arms and authorizing the President to designate belligerent countries and war zones) was continued to be discussed by the House of Representatives. Democratic Congressmen Shane and Leahy said that it would be better to have no Neutrality Law than to have an incomplete one. Republican Congressmen applauded in approval. Republican Congressman Barton said that any Neutrality Law is difficult to perfect. We will never allow a single American soldier to go abroad to fight. (Congressmen applauded enthusiastically.) He also said that if we prohibit the transportation of arms to Britain and France after a war breaks out, the public opinion's reaction to the embargo will be difficult to resist once London and Paris are subjected to air raids. Judging from today's discussion, the majority of Congressmen advocate restoring the neutral status prescribed by international law, still allowing arms to be transported to the belligerent countries, and completely abolishing the current Neutrality Law, only retaining the current methods of monitoring and obtaining licenses for arms exports. If this important amendment is accepted by the House of Representatives, it will still be possible to extend credit loans to the belligerent countries, and the arms embargo will inevitably be cancelled. The House of Representatives is scheduled to submit it for a vote tomorrow. Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting before the House of Representatives convenes to decide on their stance. (Havas, 28th)

### US Lowers Silver Prices, Aiming to Suppress Japan; London Observers View it as Such, US Says it is to Prevent Dumping

(London) After the US Treasury Department repeatedly lowered the price it sets for purchasing foreign silver, the price of silver here fell another three-quarters of a penny per ounce. It is not yet known whether the US Treasury Department will continue to lower silver prices tonight. Generally, people in the market here are eagerly awaiting the arrival of news. According to the observation of certain figures in the financial community, the price of silver will not fall below eighteen pence per ounce, and it is believed that the fall in silver prices is enough to constitute a powerful weapon against Japan. The US authorities may use it to induce Japan to adopt a more moderate attitude. (Havas, 29th)

(Washington) After the Treasury Department reduced the purchase price of foreign silver yesterday from 43 cents per ounce to 40 cents, it was reduced again today to 38.5 cents. In two days, it has been lowered by two jiaos. Senior officials of the Treasury Department refused to explain the reason for the devaluation, but responsible parties claimed that this move was purely to prevent foreign silver from being massively dumped on the American market before Congress decides on silver policy. (Havas, 28th)

(London) The disagreement between the US government and the opposition in Congress regarding silver policy has greatly affected the London silver market. The price of silver has fallen by three-quarters of a penny per ounce. Relevant parties are now waiting quietly for developments and say that how the situation develops in the future will depend on the attitude of the US authorities. (Havas, 28th)

### US Monetary Law: Joint Discussion by the Senate and House of Representatives

(Washington) The US Treasury Department has again lowered its purchase price for foreign silver in New York from 40 cents per ounce to 38.5 cents. The official price of silver bars at Handy & Harman in New York has also been reduced from 39.75 cents per ounce to 38.25 cents. (Reuter, 28th)

(Washington) When the House of Representatives met today, the scene in the chamber was extremely heated. Republican Congressman Fish expressed opposition to the President's power to purchase foreign silver and change the fineness of the dollar, but Democratic Congressman Somers (Chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures) vigorously refuted it, stating that the President should be allowed to maintain the right to purchase silver from China and Mexico so that American commerce in China could be expected to develop. Taking Mexico as an example, the country's currency price fell by 10% yesterday due to the Senate's vote, and the impact of this can be seen. As a result of the discussion, a resolution was finally passed by a majority of 209 to 161 votes, by which the House of Representatives appointed five representatives to form a joint committee with representatives of the Senate to draft a compromise plan.

### Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Recalled to Country

(Moscow) Regarding the recall of Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Smetanin, it has been verified today by the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that Mr. Smetanin has not returned to the Soviet Union for two years, so he has made a special trip home to visit old friends. However, neutral observers believe that Mr. Smetanin's trip must be related to the border dispute between Mongolia and "Manchukuo." In other words, it is to report to Molotov and at the same time to seek instructions and conduct negotiations with the Tokyo side. (Associated Press, 29th)

### Japanese Military Supplies Rely on the United States

Wellesley, Massachusetts - According to Dr. Bryce Laisley, an expert on Far Eastern issues, 53% of the thirteen types of military supplies imported by Japan are supplied by the United States. As for the kerosene used by Japan, 90% is supplied by the United States. He also said that the outcome of the current Sino-Japanese War depends entirely on the attitude of Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States towards Japan. (Associated Press, 29th)

### The Soviet Window to the West (Continued)

— Te Ye

These data have not yet been fully verified because the strength and organization of the Soviet fleet in the Arctic Ocean can be quickly enhanced by medium-sized warships sailing from Kronstadt (still the largest naval base in the Soviet Union) through the canal connecting the Baltic Sea and the White Sea. However, this canal is only navigable in summer.

Why does the Soviet Union pay so much attention to the military development of the Murmansk region? This question cannot be answered purely in terms of defense because defending the area does not require such a strong force. Then, is she doing this for offensive purposes? This raises the question of who she is preparing to attack. Finland and Norway have both witnessed these great military preparations, and neither country has any intention of attacking the Soviet Union. Then, will the Soviet Union seize Finnish and Norwegian territory on the Arctic Ocean coast? Many events have shown that the Soviet Union does have this tendency. For example, mysterious Soviet planes often fly over the northern border of Finland. If Soviet aviators are not spying on the land from the sky and using cameras to photograph the terrain, why bother with this trouble?

We must remember that the Soviet Union's access to the Arctic Ocean is limited to a 50-mile stretch of land, and even there, the climate is volatile, with fog or rain, and it is too far from the open sea. Finland's coast, on the other hand, has countless deep-sea bays that are natural ice-free harbors all year round, from which access to the sea is much safer than starting from the Murmansk coast. Another factor is the Norwegian port of Narvik, which in 1938 had 8 million tons of the world's best ore (all from Swedish Lapland) that were transported to various parts of the world. These ores are the most important supplies in Europe and have become even more important recently due to the competition among countries for military equipment. In the event of war, if the Soviet Union can control the export of this material or use air raids to stop mining, the countries involved will feel unhappy. Norway and Finland are now increasingly uneasy. Norway's national defense was originally very weak. Seeing the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Arctic Ocean expanding day by day, Norwegian experts are increasingly worried that Norway's defense is inadequate.

Finland is greatly hindered in the Arctic Ocean area under the terms of its peace treaty with Russia. Since 1920, she has bordered the Arctic Ocean through the Petsamo Corridor. She can only dock a few patrol boats in the Petsamo Bay, but is still not allowed to build any defensive works or aircraft bases. Unarmed Soviet planes can fly over the area. In peacetime, Finnish Lapland does not station regular troops, only a small number of border guards and a local defense force composed of volunteers. In fact, no air defense equipment has been made. However, because the Petsamo mines have rich nickel production and local industry is also developing rapidly, the value of the area is increasing, so it is expected that considerable military equipment will be deployed soon. However, the Red Army is powerful, especially due to the recent development of amazing techniques by parachute troops, and the sky is even more difficult to defend. Even if considerable military defense is deployed, it may not have much effect. From these facts, we can determine that

the Arctic Ocean coast is extremely vulnerable to Soviet attack. Recently, the Nordic countries proposed the establishment of an "armed neutrality group," which has been under discussion for a long time and may still be able to use the existing defense forces to guarantee the security of Northern Europe to a certain extent. This defense alliance gives countries concerned about the integrity of Northern Europe a sense of security, and Germany is one of them. (End)

### Central Important Political News Compilation: Commemorating Fallen Soldiers on the Double Seventh Festival; Four Banks Establish Branches in the Northwest

Tax Reduction on Steel Imports

Chongqing Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance, to facilitate industrial construction in the rear, has telegraphed customs offices in all provinces, permitting a two-thirds reduction in import taxes for steel, hardware, and machinery. It stipulates that when steel and other metal products and machinery are declared for import, they shall generally be allowed to pay two-thirds less than the current tax rate. For imports of machinery and metals, a detailed list of items, quantities, values, place of origin, and purchaser (factory, mine, or importer), along with the customs office and destination, must be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will then forward the list to the Ministry of Finance, which will instruct the customs office to reduce the tax. Before obtaining approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to forward to the Ministry of Finance, importers may apply to the customs office to pay a deposit based on the current tax rate for immediate release. However, the deposit period shall not exceed three months. After this period, the customs office will deposit the tax and no refunds will be given. This measure is now in effect and will be valid for six months. (Lists of metal and machinery items are available in two categories, A and B, details omitted.)

Double Seventh Anti-Japanese Construction Commemoration

With the approval of the Military Affairs Commission, the National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to issue a circular to the entire country (including occupied areas), designating July 7th (Double Seventh Festival) as the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Memorial Day.

### Taicang Guerrilla Squad Kills Puppet Deputy Commander; Wang Shilan's Troops Capture Xintang Market; Fifteen-Year-Old Bravely Kills a Notorious Traitor

Taicang Correspondence: Since the fall of Taicang, the guerrilla squads scattered in the surrounding villages have been very active under the leadership of Wang Shilan. Last winter, they fought more than ten battles. Wang's younger brother, Shikui, died for his country. Wang, remembering the national hatred and the hatred for his brother, became even more resentful. He hired guerrilla military and political specialists to assist in training the troops, thus strengthening his forces. Last year in October, the Jiangsu Provincial Government appointed Wang as the commander of the Second Administrative District Security Regiment, ordering him to station his troops in Taicang and Kunshan. In recent months, Hong Jinping, the puppet Taicang County Magistrate, and Geng Chao, the puppet Deputy Commander of the Security Regiment, have committed many evils, imposing exorbitant taxes, extorting the people, kidnapping and falsely accusing, using every means possible. The people, unable to bear the oppression, pleaded with Wang to swiftly eliminate them. Wang then authorized Tang Namin and Qiu Yangshan to plan the elimination of Hong and Geng. Tang, upon receiving the order, immediately trained a suicide squad to enter the puppet Security Regiment headquarters in Xintang Market, waiting for an opportunity to act. At the same time, he mobilized troops, launching the attack at 11:00 AM on the 24th of this month. First, Mao Jingao, a member of the suicide squad, sneaked into the puppet headquarters and reported to Geng that the New Fourth Army troops had entered the territory. As Geng Chao was about to stand up, Mao immediately drew his pistol and fired six shots at Geng, killing him instantly. Another member of the suicide squad, Shen Fu, stood at the staircase entrance. Upon hearing the gunshots, he opened fire on the Japanese and puppet soldiers, killing five more. Shen Fu, wounded by three bullets, rushed out, leading other team members into the melee. At the same time, Tang led soldiers from the Third Battalion to provide support, surrounding the Japanese and puppet troops. Seeing that Geng had been eliminated, the Japanese and puppet soldiers scattered in panic. Simultaneously, there were no troops that could be mobilized within Taicang City. By 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet troops were completely wiped out by the Chinese Fourth Regiment, with 52 Japanese and puppet soldiers killed, more than 100 wounded, and 120 captured alive. The people cheered. The suicide squad consisted of only 74 people. Mao Jingao, who killed Geng Chao, was only 15 years old. Geng was originally a guerrilla commander under Xiong Jiandong, but recently defected. People who heard of his death expressed their joy. Commander Wang, seeing that the operation was very effective, instructed Tang and Qiu to intensify troop training and organize the people, striving for military-civilian cooperation. At the same time, he joined forces with the Jiangnan Advance Army, planning to attack the county seat in separate groups on a set date. Currently, the Advance Army has 3,200 people entering Taicang territory, and has made contact with Wang's troops.

### Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department Proceeds with Reinforcing and Repairing Canal Dikes After Consulting with the Canal Works Bureau to Determine Measures

Xinghua Correspondence: Han Deqin, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently, due to the unrepaired breach of the Yellow River in Henan, instructed that the project of reinforcing and repairing canal dikes should be started early before this year's flood season, in order to reduce flood damage and avoid major disasters. However, due to the large project and insufficient funds, he had previously telegraphed the Central Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate funds for the project. It is now learned that before the funds are remitted, the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed for long. He specially instructed Xu Mojia, Chief Secretary of the Construction Department, to telegraph Shen, the Director of the Canal Works Bureau, the day before yesterday, to come to the province immediately to discuss the implementation measures in person, in order to start construction. Director Shen, after receiving the telegram, was delayed by important matters in Hai'an and could not come in person. He appointed Wang Zizun, the Section Chief of the Bureau, Wang Yuanyi, the Technician, Xue Zhankui, the Inspector, and Yuan Guiguan, the Technician, to go to the provincial capital for consultation. After the matter is completed, Shen will still come to the province to request instructions in person. It is reported that the officials appointed by the Canal Works Bureau held a meeting with Secretary Xu in the Construction Department on the 18th of this month, and discussed and decided on various measures for reinforcing and repairing the east and west dikes of the canal and preparing for flood prevention. The decision is as follows: (1) How to handle the reinforcement and repair of the east and west dikes of the canal? It was decided that if the Ministry of Economic Affairs replies and allocates funds before the end of June, it will be handled according to the survey plan of the Canal Works Bureau. If there is still no reply, the dangerous sections will be selected, reinforced and heightened separately, and workers will be recruited to build a sub-dike with a top width of 1.2 meters, to be prepared and implemented by the Canal Works Bureau. (2) Missing planks in the various sluice gates along the canal should be urgently replaced. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should order the Huaipi and Jiangbao sections to complete the work within a limited time. (3) Water level records in Jiangba and Yangzhuang and other places should be restored and reported daily. It was decided to be handled by the Canal Works Bureau. (4) The Huai-Pi and Jiang stations should be strictly ordered to fully open all culverts and sluice gates along the canal, in order to discharge the water of Shengkong Lake and provide irrigation for farmland. It was decided to be handled and reported by the Canal Works Bureau. (5) How should the five ports of Guihu be dredged? It was decided that the Department and Bureau should each send a person to conduct an on-site inspection and prepare a concise plan. (6) It is proposed to appropriately narrow the entrances of the Jia and Chen ports on the west dike of the canal. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should prepare a plan and submit it to the province for approval and implementation in advance. (7) The spring repair project of the canal was decided to be re-estimated by the province and the most urgent work should be carried out first. (8) Accumulation of soil and materials on the canal dikes. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should submit a request to the province, asking the relevant counties to recruit workers to accumulate soil separately and report for commissioning. Regarding the accumulation of materials, the provincial government ordered Yancheng and Baoying counties to investigate the current quantity of firewood stored and report to the province for future reference.

### The Coastal Defenses of Zhejiang and Fujian are Strong; The Gap in Zhenhai Has Been Blocked; A German Ship Arriving in Ningbo Parks Outside the Blockade Line; Three British Ships Unload Cargo at Chuanshi in Minjiang River

Since the fall of Dinghai and the tension in Ningbo, the Ningbo Defense Command has prohibited foreign ships from sailing in order to strengthen coastal defenses. The Sino-Italian Shipping Company has received a telegram from Ningbo stating that the gap in the blockade line at Zhenhai has been ordered to be blocked the night before. The German Rehe Shipping Company's ship "Mofu" sailed to Ningbo yesterday morning. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, it arrived outside Zhenhai Port but was unable to enter. Japanese warships are gathered outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, and the situation is tense. The details are as follows:

The Gap in Zhenhai Is Blocked

The Sino-Italian Shipping Company in this city received a telegram from its Ningbo branch the day before yesterday, stating, "Top secret, Ningbo Airlines was notified by the Defense Department that the opening for navigation in the Zhenhai blockade line is to be blocked immediately to strengthen coastal defenses. Please inform all shipping companies to take notice." Yesterday afternoon, a follow-up telegram stated that the "Old Taiping" ship had sunk at 9:00 PM on the 28th, and the gap had been completely blocked. Furthermore, the Ningbo Hometown Association also received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday morning, confirming the blockade. This shows that the situation in Zhejiang is tense, and the authorities have taken this emergency measure. However, it is understood that the situation in Ningbo is still calm and stable, and the people are quite calm.

"Mofu" Arrives in Ningbo but Cannot Enter

The German Rehe Shipping Company's ship "Mofu," having been specially approved by the Ningbo authorities, continued to sail to Ningbo. The ship set sail from Shanghai at 4:00 AM yesterday morning. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the company received a telegram from Captain Berge stating that the ship had arrived and anchored outside Zhenhai Port. However, it did not mention whether the gap had been blocked. The company then telegraphed to inquire about the situation, but had not received a reply by the time of publication. Therefore, the whereabouts of the ship will be clarified after receiving a telegram today.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Chinese Troops Unsuccessfully

According to a passenger who recently arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou on the German "Hana" ship, when the "Hana" ship sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th, as it passed Huanghua Customs, the military police inspection station at the customs, as usual, sent troops on a speedboat to board the ship for inspection. Unexpectedly, as the Chinese military police were about to board the ship, they were suddenly discovered by the Japanese navy. Immediately, a Japanese aircraft circled above the ship, strafing it with machine guns and throwing small hand grenades. At that time, the Huanghua Customs Fortress immediately fired heavy anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese aircraft did not dare to fly low, and the Chinese troops were able to safely retreat without any casualties. Fortunately, the ship was not affected. The ship did not undergo inspection and sailed directly to Shanghai.

Japanese Warships Gather Outside the Mouth of the Oujiang River

Three Japanese warships are anchored outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, along with one aircraft carrier, which is carrying many Japanese aircraft. In addition, there are six transport ships converted from merchant ships. The Japanese soldiers on the ships are very busy. Furthermore, when the ship sailed to a certain sea area, another Japanese warship sailed towards Wenzhou, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. It is assumed that they have some plan for Wenzhou. It is also learned that the Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company's "Kangshayi" ship, which departed from Wenzhou for the last time on the morning of the 28th, will also arrive in Shanghai today.

British Ships at Chuanshi Report Situation: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the British Jardine Matheson Shipping Company yesterday that the company's "Shenguang," "Shenfu," and "Shenai" ships are all anchored at Chuanshi Island outside the blockade line of Mawei in the Minjiang River, Fuzhou, and are unloading cargo. "Shenai" will sail from Chuanshi to Sandu'ao today. On the evening of the day before yesterday at 5:00 PM, a telegram was received from the ships at Chuanshi, reporting on the unloading situation, and stating that three Japanese warships are anchored in the waters of Chuanshi, and the situation is tense, but the local area is peaceful. Furthermore, the British Swire Shipping Company's "New Beijing" ship, which sails on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday, and is scheduled to load cargo and sail directly to Quanzhou, Fujian on July 1st (Saturday).

Mawei's Blockade Has Strong Booms

Japanese troops landed at Jianfeng in Fuzhou Port, and are still entrenched there. It is confirmed by the shipping industry that six Japanese aircraft bombed Mawei and Changmen on the morning of the 28th, with unspecified losses. Currently, Mawei Port has been closed to all ships since the 28th, but the gap in the blockade line has not been completely blocked. The Mawei blockade line has strong booms, and it is difficult to destroy them. The Chinese military authorities have deployed heavy troops in Changmen, Guantou, and the Luoxing Pagoda area. If the Japanese troops attempt to land in Fuzhou, they will face strong resistance.

Ships Gather in the Huangpu River

After the war, shipping between Shanghai and Fujian is entirely maintained by foreign shipping companies. The ports of call include Ningbo, Wenzhou, Dinghai, Haimen in Zhejiang Province, and Fuzhou, Xinghua Quanzhou in Fujian Province. With the exception of Haimen, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, which were previously banned from sailing, Wenzhou and Fuzhou have also been notified by the Japanese naval authorities that third-country ships are prohibited from sailing to the ports of Min and Ou, affecting the suspension of flights. All ships of various foreign shipping companies are currently unable to operate any lines, and are mostly anchored in Shanghai. Therefore, more than 20 ships are gathered near the Roosevelt Wharf in the Huangpu River.

Japanese Warships Bombard Fuzhou and Wenzhou: According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon, (1) Five Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou on the morning of the 29th and fired more than 20 shells at the shore. The local defense forces also returned fire. (2) Six Japanese warships sailed to Changmen at the mouth of the Minjiang River yesterday and anchored there, firing shells at the shore and launching several speedboats filled with Japanese troops, attempting to land. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army and failed to succeed.

Reports of Some Foreigners Evacuating

The Japanese have announced that they will take military action against Fuzhou in Fujian Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, and have notified the consular corps through the Japanese consulate, requesting third-country ships and foreigners to leave the two places before noon on the 29th to avoid danger. Yesterday was the deadline. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, British citizens in Fuzhou and Wenzhou began to evacuate yesterday, but there was no news about American citizens. To avoid danger, various foreign shipping companies have suspended sailing on the Fuzhou and Wenzhou lines.

### Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Revises Market Regulations; The Principle is to Make Sure That Merchants and Customers Comply; Rice Prices Continue to Fall Back, Sales Turn Tired; It is Widely Believed That the Bureau Will Lower Rice Prices Again

The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the fact that the market firms and customers disregard market regulations, conduct private transactions, resulting in a chaotic market order and unstable prices, which has a major impact on the people's food, and disputes often arise between merchants and customers, the Management Committee, in order to reorganize and revise the regulations, held a

Business Policy

In order to make the transactions of all firms more regular, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the rice market yesterday. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, because hoarders sold off one after another, and 6,000 to 7,000 bags of rice, 3,000 to 4,000 bags of rice were transported to Shanghai by vehicles. The Municipal Council sends personnel to the market every day to supervise the prices of transactions of various goods in the market.

### Landing Attempt Foiled, Japanese Planes Bomb Beisha: Over Ten Bombs on Xingang, Lingdian, Beitou, Over Ten Civilians Killed and Wounded in New Bombings

The coastal ports along the Beisha shipping route have continued to be bombarded by Japanese warships in recent days. Three Japanese planes again flew to the area on the previous day to drop bombs, bombing portside civilian houses, resulting in over ten civilian casualties. Our Dagang News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the situation as follows:

Japanese Planes Bomb Xingang, Lingdian

Japanese warships (No. 32) and armed motorboats continued to shell the shore at various ports yesterday, but their landing attempt has not yet succeeded. In frustration and to vent their anger, the Japanese army dispatched three planes which took off from Chongming Airport at 10:00 AM on the previous day (the 27th) to drop over ten bombs on Xingang Town and Lingdian Town, indiscriminately bombing. The town's civilian houses caught fire and burned, with thick smoke filling the air.

Civilian Houses Destroyed, Over Ten Killed and Wounded

Xingang Town and Lingdian Town are only about half a mile from the port. The Japanese army suspected that Chinese troops were hiding in the civilian houses in the towns, using them as cover, making it difficult to find targets. Therefore, they dispatched three planes to bomb them, while the Japanese warships shelled Sanhe Port and Wanjia Port, coordinating with the air raid. In this attack, over ten civilians were killed and wounded, mostly the elderly, weak, women, and children. According to the Dagang News Agency reporter's inquiries with people coming from Beisha, residents of Xingang Town had been evacuated in advance, and only two children, surnamed Jiang and others, were killed. The casualties were heavier in Lingdian Town. Two bombs landed in the West Market, destroying the Yuanshengtai Dyeing Shop, killing three villagers, including one surnamed Liu. Three bombs landed in the Hedong area of the Central Market, destroying the Su Qialong General Goods Store, killing the elderly couple Gu Qijin and his wife, and their two young grandchildren. Two bombs landed in the North Market, destroying the Wanchengchang Store, killing four people, including one surnamed Fang. The remaining bombs all landed in the fields. The Japanese planes brutally murdered innocent people, and their cruel actions are evident.

Foreign Merchant Ships Plan to Change to Night Shifts

Although the Beisha battles are ongoing, foreign vessels continue to operate as usual to maintain traffic between Shanghai and Beisha. The Yiyi and Helun of British firm Jardine Matheson departed yesterday morning, and the Haiyilun of German firm Far East and the Jiangdinglun of Fuhua arrived and berthed at the Bund wharf at 4:30 PM yesterday. Since the final destination of the ships is Qinglong Port, designated by the Japanese army, there are few passengers and goods. To maintain operations, they held a special meeting last night to discuss changing to night shifts, traveling back and forth on the same day, in order to reduce costs.

### Three Democratic Nations Celebrate July Festivals: Citizens of China, America and France All Fly Flags on July 1st, 4th and 14th to Commemorate

July 1st is the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government of the Republic of China, July 4th is the Independence Day of the United States, and July 14th is the Democratic Day of France. These valuable anniversaries of the three major democratic countries all fall within the first half of July, which can be said to be a naturally wonderful symbol. Therefore, the Chinese citizens of this city and the expatriates of the United States and France will all fly their national flags for one day each on the respective anniversaries to commemorate.

Travelers Detour, Disturbances Along the Way

Yesterday, when the ships arrived, people from Haiqi Township in Shanghai went to the wharf to inquire about the news of their hometown being bombed. According to the Dagang News Agency reporter's inquiry with a gentleman who took a ship to Shanghai from Lusi after venturing to detour through Qinglong Port, since the ships were prevented from stopping at Wan, Xingang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port, travelers in Yudong, Baochang, Liujia, Lusi, Sanyang, Jiulong, and other places have found it very difficult to travel. On the way, they have to pass through the Japanese military警戒area, and are subject to searches and interrogations by Japanese and puppet military police, and all kinds of difficulties, so they dare not try to take the risk. Most of the travelers are locals. Yesterday, very few detoured through the above-mentioned ports to Shanghai. The sound of cannons rumbled along the way, indicating there was a war, but the people in the countryside were still stable.

### Moved by the Warmth for Refugees, the French Ambassador's Wife Shed Tears: Visited the International First Refugee Camp Yesterday and Was Deeply Satisfied with All Kinds of Work

Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Madame Yudan, Madame Gongsang, and others, she took the embassy car to visit the camp. At that time, flags were hung high at the gate of the camp, fluttering in the wind.

Along Both Sides of the Avenue Inside the Camp

Five hundred male and female refugee children lined up in a singing honor guard. When the Ambassador's wife and others arrived at the camp, they were led in by Camp Director Pan Da, Father Mumu, and all the faculty and staff of the camp. Five hundred children stood at attention and saluted in unison. Under the direction of Zheng Yaonan, a nine-year-old child, they sang Chinese and French songs and other majestic songs. The Madam was very moved and inspected them one by one, touching them and shaking hands with the refugees to express sympathy.

Even Shed Tears

Afterwards, she visited the labor exhibition of refugee children in the junior high school class and the radio telecommunications training class. She expressed surprise and sympathy for the refugee children who were in a pitiful situation, living in hardship, but still able to immerse themselves in their studies and achieve remarkable results. Later, she received a formal welcome in the French classroom of the junior high school from over a thousand refugees, primary and secondary school students, and faculty and staff of the camp. Refugee Bao Junzhang delivered a welcome speech, and the Madam was deeply moved and expressed her sympathy in a thank-you speech. Afterwards, she visited the "Refugee Daycare Center Participating in Production," the hospital, the sock factory, the egg-knocking factory, and the ice-carrying work, tirelessly seeking out the group. Every old and weak patient was

Personally Comforted

The Madam toured the entire camp, and everywhere she went, she only heard the refugee children singing welcome songs and welcome sounds. The entire atmosphere fully demonstrated the increase in the close cooperation between China and France, and their peoples. Before leaving, she wished all the refugees in the camp good health, and expressed her satisfaction with the efforts of the French expatriates in serving the Chinese refugees.

### Suspension of Principal and Interest Payments on the Telecommunications Government Bonds: Lottery Will Still Be Held as Scheduled and Will Not Affect Credit

The fifteenth principal redemption lottery for the 24th Year of the Republic of China Telecommunications Government Bonds was held in Shanghai on June 10 by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. Three branches were drawn, with a total redemption of 300,000 yuan in national currency. According to the regulations and the principal and interest payment schedule, payments will begin today by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank in various locations. However, according to the New Life News Agency reporter's inquiry with the banking community yesterday, this telecommunications government bond is issued by the Ministry of Transportation. It is said that the principal and interest payments have been temporarily suspended since September of last year. Moreover, this government bond is not circulated in the market, so the suspension of principal and interest payments will not affect the overall debt repayment.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Municipal Bank Accepts Demand Deposits

### A Contradictory Phenomenon: Restrictions on the Repatriation of Japanese Yen: Limited to 200 Yuan Per Person Per Trip, Japanese Regulations, So-Called "New Regulations"

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that, regarding the exchange of Japanese yen between Shanghai and Japan, the Japanese side has decided to implement new regulations starting from July 1st. The Tokyo Ministry of Finance has recently revised the articles of the Japanese Foreign Exchange Control Law to restrict the Japanese yen exported from Japan to Shanghai, and at the same time reduce the Japanese yen returning from Shanghai to Japan. According to the new regulations, the remittance and travel expenses, etc., allowed for each Japanese leaving the country will be reduced from 1,000 Japanese yen to only 500 Japanese yen, including currency, drafts and credit letters. Japanese tourists carrying larger amounts of money out of the country must obtain special permission from the Bank of Japan. The Japanese yen returning from overseas, which was not previously subject to any legal restrictions, will be limited to only 200 yuan per person per trip. If the Japanese yen carried back to Japan exceeds this amount, it will all be confiscated.

### Japan's Domestic Economy Has Reached a Desperate Stage: Naginata Blades and Pen Nibs Are Melted Down to Make Munitions, Tokyo Has an Atmosphere of Unease

According to the records disclosed by the U.S. Department of State, Japan did not purchase war materiel from the U.S. in April.

What is referred to here is actual armaments. There is no doubt that many of the items purchased by Japan from the United States are indirectly used for war. The Ministry of Finance has recently issued the following order, requiring that all gold-made items listed below must be reported to the Ministry of Finance by July 5, including: rings, jewelry, and other personal ornaments, watch cases, eyeglass rims, and other personal items, cigarette holders, cigarette cases, cups, pots, and other

Food and Drink Utensils

Candles, incense burners, paperweights, pencil sharpeners, paper knives, seals, and other household items, Japanese authorities have asked the Jewelry Association to refrain from using gold to make any items, and have asked stores not to display any gold items. From this, it can be inferred that the Japanese government is now directly entering people's homes to search for this valuable yellow metal for the purpose of purchasing materials to support its troops in fighting in China. At the same time,

Official Announcement

A rationing system will soon be implemented. This system will apply to butter, milk, eggs, tea, sugar, and other videos. According to Japanese newspapers, the government has decided on this measure, "Even if the people's living standards will be temporarily lowered as a result, it will not care." Japan intends to sell these goods overseas, at least to make up for its overall outflow of foreign currency. The Every

Foreign Currency

obtained will continue to be used for war. This is the scene Japan presents in the world market. Economists say that Japan is clearly trying its best to obtain foreign currency to purchase necessities to supply its troops' consumption. The Japanese government arbitrarily stabilizes prices, but costs have risen sharply, so that the sale of goods is not profitable. Currently, many of Japan's products require "handling fees" or "service fees" of several yuan. Retailers

Therefore Fail

are commonplace. Therefore, the interest rate on loans has been reduced from 5.7% to 4.8%. Bankrupt merchants and employees who have lost tens of thousands of dollars have changed to other industries. The circulation of money is accelerating, and there is a shortage of goods, with supply falling short of demand. Although this may not be inflation, economists say that deflation is not far away. Although this kind of domestic situation seems serious, it is still not as serious as the

Serious Issue

of using funds to maintain the war. The problem of using funds to maintain peace is also particularly complicated. Six months ago, Japanese financial leaders were very confident that the economic strength of the Japanese people could maintain both war and peace. Today, Tokyo has shown a strong atmosphere of suspicion, hesitation, and uneasiness. Although the government and the public have not yet openly expressed pessimism, their strong optimism must have dissipated. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese leaders have insisted that the Chinese dragon will continue the long-term resistance, which will cause Japan to

Economic Collapse

Today, neutral observers, while still not doubting that the ultimate result will be defeat, are now acknowledging that the war has reached a stalemate, and that Japan's finances are burdened with the heavy expense of maintaining a large army on the mainland indefinitely. This is no different from the collapse of economic institutions. There are rumors in Tokyo that Japan is currently "taking measures" against China, and will present some compromises in person, etc., because everyone knows that Japan's financial situation is now very serious, and it has to do this.

### Salary Increase for Employees of the French Municipal Council: Officially Announced Within Days; In addition to the salary increase, a subsidy will be added, depending on the family burden of the employees

The Shanghai Times said: "It was learned yesterday (the 28th) that the French Concession Municipal Council will officially announce an increase in employees' salaries within a day or two. The recommendations of the committee that investigated living conditions and revised salaries have been approved. Details of the salary increase will be published in the next issue of the Municipal Council Gazette. According to reliable sources, the salaries of the employees of the Municipal Council will be greatly increased according to the level of basic salaries and nationality. Thus, the French, Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese employees will be compensated for the losses they have suffered due to the current high cost of living and the low value of the French currency."

Salary Increase Standards for Employees Residing in Shanghai

The special subsidies given to employees by the Municipal Council on July 4, 1938, ranging from 7% to 22%, have all been abolished. It is now proposed to increase the employees residing in Shanghai by 13% to 15% based on their basic salaries before July 4, 1938, to replace the subsidy. If the exchange rate remains between 5.5 pence and 7.125 pence, these subsidies will be implemented for a long time.

Low-Salary Employees Are Particularly Favored

Employees with salaries below 700 yuan receive the most benefits, with a 15% increase in basic salaries. Those with monthly salaries above 700 yuan receive a maximum increase of 13%. This is the salary increase for married people, and the salary increase for single men is 11% less.

Additional Subsidies for Chinese and French Employees

In addition, the child subsidy for married French personnel of the Municipal Council will also be increased. The monthly allowance of 14 yuan for children under 18 will be increased to 40 yuan. The housing subsidy for married personnel will also be increased. In addition to the percentage increase, Chinese employees will also receive a monthly subsidy of one yuan.

Compensation for Current Living Expenses

The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 29th that the French Municipal Council gave its employees temporary subsidies ranging from 7% to 22% on July 4, 1938, in order to compensate for the high cost of living. At that time, this subsidy was inversely proportional to the size of the salary, that is, those with small salaries received more subsidies, and those with large salaries received less subsidies. It is now said that the temporary subsidy has been cancelled. Recently, due to the high cost of living, it has been decided to replace it with other subsidies, which are also temporary in nature, ranging from 30% to 50%.

Effective Period of the Salary Increase Method

This subsidy is also inversely proportional to the size of the salary, as before, and the subsidy for unmarried people is 10% less than that of married people in each grade. It is said that the effective period of this subsidy is as long as the French currency is between 5.5 pence and 7.5 pence in sterling, it should be paid. As for the Chinese employees, those who originally received an average salary increase of 7% in July 1938 will now receive a salary increase to 20%, and a rice subsidy of 2 yuan per month will be added. Also, as for the family subsidy for French employees, each child was only able to receive 14 yuan per month, but now it has been increased to 40 yuan per child per month. From this point of view, this new subsidy method is based on the family burden of the employees, and it is proportionally more favorable to low-salary employees.

### British Ships Transport Scrap Iron to Aid Japan: They Suffer Misfortune Both on Land and Sea; American Dockworkers Prevented British Ships Loaded with Iron from Passing Through; British Ship Struck a Reef and Sank; Cathay Cinema Screens Film of the Sunken Ship, Chinese and Foreign Audiences Applaud

The Millard's Review reports that the British freighter "Bonnie" was carrying scrap iron destined for Japan. On June 25, it was prevented from passing through Tacoma, Washington in the United States because dockworkers refused to cross the picket line set up on the dock. The picket line was set up by the Tacoma branch of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression. The head of the group is former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, whose goal is to prevent the shipment of munitions and basic war materials from the U.S. to Japan. Another British ship, the "Tambourbar," which was also carrying scrap iron to supply Japanese munitions factories, struck a reef and sank off the coast of Quillaute, Washington on April 9. All 36 crew members were rescued, but all 8,000 tons of scrap iron were lost. News footage of the wrecked ship was recently shown at the Cathay Cinema in Shanghai, and the entire audience, both Chinese and foreign, applauded for several minutes.

### The Course of the Fall of Dinghai City: 1,400 Japanese Troops Landed in Three Routes; Principal of Zhoushan High School Detained by the Japanese; County Magistrate Su Benshan Is Now Defending an Isolated Island, Awaiting Reinforcements

The details of the fall of Dinghai were not available until yesterday. A businessman who personally experienced the incident managed to escape and arrive in Shanghai yesterday. The account is as follows:

Landing Situation

The Japanese army's seizure of Dinghai was divided into three landing sites, namely, Shenjiamen Town, about 80 miles east of the county seat, Yancang Village, about 10 miles south of the city, and Daotou and Dongyue Temple. The Japanese troops who landed at Shenjiamen Town arrived in the city last and entered the city through the East Gate. The Japanese troops who landed at Yancang Village were second and entered the city through the West Gate. The Japanese troops who landed at Daotou first attacked the county seat through the South Gate. The number of troops on the three routes was about 1,400, and because they had guides, they all took winding paths, as if they were familiar with the roads.

Principal Detained

When the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, they used machine guns to strafe. Two Japanese warships in Jiangxin, Daotou, fired at the shore. The Quanda Soy Garden, located in Daotou, was destroyed. At that time, Fang Xiangyuan, Principal of Zhoushan Jin High School, and Chen Dehong, teacher from the Christian Church, went on board the Japanese warship to demand that the Japanese troops withdraw and not ruin the local area. However, they were detained by the Japanese army, who seemed to be using them to organize a so-called "Maintenance Association."

Transfer to Baiquan to Fight

At that time, the troops stationed at Puji Temple in the northern suburbs and all the self-defense teams in Dinghai resisted under the leadership of County Magistrate Su Mubenshan. After four hours of fierce fighting, they retreated to Fanhe Ridge due to being outnumbered, and have now transferred to fight in the Baiquan, Xiaozhan, and Dazhan areas. As for the residents of Dingcheng, they all evacuated to the mountain countryside when the incident occurred. In total, only 30 to 40 people were killed or injured in this battle, but the food stored in Baihe Temple and other places in Dongxiang was looted. Therefore, the food problem for the military and civilians who evacuated to the mountain countryside is a cause for concern.

A Tragic Scene

County Magistrate Su of Dinghai, because the incident happened suddenly, was unable to bring his wife with him at the time. When he led his troops to resist at Fanhe Ridge, his wife was escorted to him by his subordinates. County Magistrate Su immediately held his wife's hand and sobbed, saying emotionally, "When a powerful enemy is pressing on the border, local officials only know to be loyal and sacrifice their lives, and can no longer think of their families. Please do as you wish, madam, go and encourage each other!" After saying goodbye, he parted ways with his wife, with tragic words and expressions.

Defending a Certain Island to the Death

It is now known that County Magistrate Su, in addition to dispersing his troops to harass the Japanese army with guerrilla tactics, has crossed the sea to a certain island to defend it to the death while awaiting reinforcements. There are still more than 200 soldiers and civilians following him, and it is said that they have been out of food for a day. As for his wife, after saying goodbye to the county magistrate at that time, she was disguised by the county government officials, taken on a boat, and escorted to Ningbo. She has now transferred to Jinhua to report the incident to Chairman Huang. Also, when the Japanese troops landed at Daotou neck, there were three Japanese planes in the sky providing cover. As for the details of the fall of Shenjiamen, it is not very clear. All that is known is that four Japanese warships came on that day and fired at the shore, and the Zhenh濟源 Wine Shop was destroyed, it is said.

### 地產商迭接恐嚇信　緝獲大批匪黨　冒稱游擊隊名義索詐經事主報捕設計擒獲

A real estate businessman, Tang Shujian, a local resident living at No. 2, Lane 1124, Xinzha Road, who is of modest means, was targeted by bandits. In February of this year, he received three anonymous threatening letters demanding hundreds of yuan, otherwise, they would resort to extreme measures. Tang ignored them and did not report them to the police. Afterward, the bandits did not take any action, and he remained safe until, unexpectedly, between the 24th and 26th of this month, he received two threatening letters in the name of

Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Corps

Military Committee Headquarters Guerrilla Force, with two bullets attached, demanding 850 yuan. The letters stated that if he continued to ignore them as he did in the spring, his life would be in danger. After receiving the letters, Tang Shujian secretly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area and arranged for the bandits to

Collect the Money at Tang's Residence

At the appointed time, Zhuang Meichu from Pudong and Zhang Guoying from Suzhou arrived, still carrying a letter from the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Corps to collect the money. They were captured by the police detectives Wang Chengying, Xu Decheng, Gao Huixian, Lu Gendi, Tao Aifu, and Li Baichuan, who were lying in ambush around Tang's residence. After interrogation, it was revealed that there were accomplices hiding in Room 314 of the Dalu Hotel at No. 402, Lane 431, Rue Puech, French Concession. Detective Wang and others rushed to the address and arrested Zhang Zhenqiu, Cai Quansheng, Shen Guosheng, Tang Xin from Ningbo, Xu Yunbao from Chaozhou, Shen Shixiong from Suzhou, and Wu Guie'e, a woman from Pudong.

A Group of Men and Women

were all taken back to the police station, detained separately, and transferred to the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and presented a seal of the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Corps and a small seal of the defendant Zhuang Meichu, which were confiscated from Room 314 of the Dalu Hotel in the French Concession, as well as several notebooks. He stated that the plaintiff Tang Shujian had not yet arrived and requested a postponement. Dai Yunpu, a servant from Pudong representing Tang's residence,

Testified

that his master had received the threatening letters and reported the arrest. When questioned, the defendant Zhuang Meichu confessed that the matter was done by a friend surnamed Ma who was on the run and that the seals and notebooks were brought by him, asking for leniency. The other defendants all gave vague answers. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ordered them to be remanded to custody separately for further investigation at a later date.

### 賭負上吊畢命

Due to Gambling Debts, He Hanged Himself.

Yin Maodi (29 years old) from Wusong, whose family lives at No. 25, Hongxing Lane, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, had been gambling in Hollywood gambling dens recently. However, he lost every time, resulting in heavy debts that he could not repay. At around 6 PM yesterday, he suddenly had the idea of dying and tried to hang himself in his room. He was discovered and cut down by his family and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He died before arriving at the hospital.

### 明和紡織廠經理　被控侵占詐欺　要求返還存紗定洋等款被吿身份不明爭辯甚烈

The manager and shareholder of Minghe Textile Factory, Wang Zuolin (59 years old, from Wuxi), located at No. 3, Xiangyu Lane, Tiantang Street, outside the New North Gate, near Fada Road, was recently sued for business embezzlement and fraud by Liang Yongaao (24 years old, from Shangchu), the shareholder and manager of Yunhua and Xinfeng Yarn and Cloth Shops at No. 24, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road. Liang hired three lawyers, Zhu Gaorong, Li Qingmu, and Sun Zhongyao, to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, along with a civil suit.

The complaint stated that

The plaintiff's Yunhua Yarn and Cloth Shop ordered 100 bales of 6-count Lantianma yarn from the defendant's Minghe Yarn Factory on April 18, 26, for delivery in June, July, and August, at a price of 170 yuan per bale. The Minghe Factory's order form serves as proof. After delivering 64 bales, on June 30 of the same year, a Anyuzhuang promissory note for 2,550 yuan was delivered for 15 bales of yarn. After taking out 5 bales, the remaining 10 bales were stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse, as evidenced by two Minghe Factory warehouse receipts. On July 10 of the same year, another

Anyuzhuang Promissory Note

for 1,665 yuan and 34 yuan and 1 jiao and 6 fen in cash were delivered. Ten bales of yarn were taken out and stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse. Also, in May of the same year, nine bales of Minghe Factory's 6-count Lantianma yarn were transferred from Zhengjihao at a price of 177 yuan per bale. After payment was made, the goods were stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse. A total of 29 bales of yarn were stored, all with warehouse receipts. In early August of the 26th year, when the goods were to be taken out, the defendant claimed that the situation was tense and that they were moving to a safe area in the Public Concession and told the plaintiff to come back after the move was completed. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident broke out, and Shanghai was in chaos. In the spring of the 27th year, when the plaintiff asked for the goods, the defendant

Claimed that the Goods had been Destroyed

as an excuse to avoid responsibility. The plaintiff originally wanted to file a lawsuit, but refrained due to friendship. Later, in another case, it was discovered that the defendant had stated in the court that Minghe Factory still had 200 bales of yarn in storage in the Jiangsu Bank warehouse and that they were sold in the autumn of the 27th year. The defendant's actions clearly constitute fraud and business embezzlement. The plaintiff requests an investigation and a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to return 8,700 yuan, the value of the 29 bales of yarn in storage, and to return the deposit of 5,980 yuan for the fraud.

Also, Damages

of 31,250 yuan are requested. The court accepted the complaint and held a hearing yesterday afternoon presided over by Judge Miao Qingbang. The plaintiff and his lawyers arrived in court to state the grounds for the lawsuit. The defendant and his lawyers also arrived in court and raised a procedural objection, questioning whether the plaintiff was indeed a shareholder and manager of Yunhua Yarn Shop. Because Liang had testified in a previous case that he was an accountant, it was requested that this point be investigated first. The lawyers for both sides exchanged opinions and argued fiercely. As a result, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for 3 PM on July 4th.

### 傭妇留書服毒案　患有神經病癥　所謂寃單所載虐待等情　依據捕房調查完全不確

The Case of the Maid Who Left a Note and Took Poison. She Suffered from Nervous Disorders. According to Police Investigation, the Allegations of Abuse in the So-Called Grievance Letter Were Completely Untrue.

Xu Wu, a woman from Haiyan Gan, worked as a maid in the house of Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhao Tai Foreign Goods Shop on Henan Road, British Concession. On the morning of the 23rd, she suddenly went to the Asian Hotel at Sanmao Bridge, rented a room, and committed suicide by swallowing tranquilizer pills. She also left behind a grievance letter accusing her employer of embezzling 600 yuan of her accumulated wages, selling inferior goods, and subjecting her to unbearable abuse. She entrusted Zhang Fucheng, a shop employee, with 8 yuan to buy tranquilizer pills, etc. She died after failed treatment. The police reported to the court for an examination. All the details have been

Detailed in Yesterday's Newspaper

It is now known that the French Concession Police Department dispatched officers to investigate the case and found that the claims in the deceased's grievance letter could not be confirmed. It appears that she suffered from a form of hysteria. Xu Wu and Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhao Tai Foreign Goods Shop, were acquaintances from the same hometown. She was hired seven years ago without a guarantor, earning 5 yuan per month. In addition to using her wages gradually, she accumulated 200 yuan and a gold ring, which were stored with her employer.

### 徐家匯　折屋風潮平息

Xujiahui Housing Demolition Uproar Subsided

Along the riverbank on the east side of Li Zongjing, Xujiahui Town, West Shanghai, facing Haige Road, from the Su Xin Bookstore at No. 1986 Hongqiao Road to the Xianghe Fried Goods Shop at No. 2182 to the south, there are more than a hundred houses, all of which have shops. However, the back doors of each house have had sheds built over them for many years. Now, the river sheds are ordered to be demolished voluntarily. At around 4 PM the day before yesterday, the French Concession Police Department sent Chinese and Western patrol officers to the scene to forcibly demolish the sheds, which aroused public outrage and led to a market strike. Fortunately, Zhou Chengxiang, chairman of the South Association, rushed to the scene to persuade them, and they all resumed business as usual. At around 9 AM yesterday morning, the French Concession Police Department summoned the shopkeepers for questioning. More than 80 people arrived. The business representatives, Hu Xiangxi, Wang Qingxiang, Jin Yongxiang, Zhuang Amao, Liu Ganchen, and Zhang Xiaodi, and others, all said that the people living in the sheds were mostly refugees who would have nowhere to live if the sheds were demolished. Also, the wood from the demolished sheds could not be reused, resulting in considerable losses. Therefore, they requested a temporary suspension of the demolition to avoid displacement. After repeated consultations, the request was approved by the Western Police Chief. As a result, the sheds will be temporarily preserved, but the space under the sheds must be filled with soil and the shopkeepers must dig up the floorboards and fill them themselves to prevent water accumulation. The shopkeepers were very satisfied upon hearing this, and the uproar subsided.

### 僞虹橋小學校長　髮妻訴請離異　被告住址不明改期再訊

The Legal Wife of the Pretended Principal of Hongqiao Primary School Sues for Divorce. The Defendant's Address is Unknown, and the Hearing is Rescheduled.

Kang Zuyao, a local resident who used to teach at Zhengmeng Primary School, is 36 years old and resides at No. 10, Xin Kang Lane, Rue Massenet, French Concession. He is currently the principal of Hongqiao Primary School, which is run by the puppet organization. His legal wife, Gu Runyi (35 years old, local resident, residing at No. 38, Baxianfang), recently hired lawyer Feng Song to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court,

Requesting a Divorce

It is claimed that the defendant committed adultery, malicious abandonment, and that it is unbearable to live with him. The plaintiff married the defendant in the 15th year of the Republic through a matchmaker. At first, they were on good terms, but in the 19th year, the defendant listened to malicious rumors and filed a lawsuit for divorce against the plaintiff. Later, they reconciled. In the year of the Republic of China, the defendant taught at Zhengmeng Primary School and often stayed out late on various pretexts, leading to an opium addiction and seeking pleasure with prostitutes, treating his legal wife like worn-out shoes. In February of the 24th year, the defendant intentionally abandoned her and falsely accused the plaintiff of

Adultery

After investigation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the accusation was false and the case was not prosecuted. In March of this year, the defendant cohabitated with another woman at No. 10, Xin Kang Lane, which was reported by the plaintiff to the police, resulting in their arrest. There is a record of this. At that time, the defendant begged for reconciliation and was not prosecuted. Recently, the defendant has joined the puppet organization, living a shameless life and neglecting the living expenses of his legal wife. Therefore, she earnestly requests a divorce to avoid being implicated. Yesterday, Judge Ma of the Civil Division No. 7 convened a hearing, but because the defendant's whereabouts were unknown and the summons could not be delivered, the plaintiff requested public notice of the summons. The court then decided to reschedule the hearing.

Letters

To the Editor,

Having read in your newspaper on June 26, on page 3, in the news column, "[...] at midnight the other day, more than a dozen short-sleeved thugs suddenly came to the Shentai Lumber Company in Xuejiawan, Shiliupu, Nanshi, each holding pistols, hatchets, iron rulers, and other weapons, broke in and robbed a [machine] and two thick copper coins, 20 zhang in length, worth approximately 4,000-5,000 yuan in total, and severely injured an elderly operator [...]"

We hereby inform you that our company is located at No. 1190, Nanshi Outer Ma Road, and all [plank] machines have long been moved to the North City, and none remain in Nanshi. The incidents of robbery and the injury of the operator are not related to our company. We should inform you by letter and ask for correction.

Respectfully,

To the Editor,

We hereby inform you that our clients, Li Yunsun, Li Yongsund, Li Runquan, Li Jimin, shareholders of Wan Chen Soy Sauce Garden, have stated to us that, upon reading the article published in your newspaper on the 28th of this month regarding the liquidation dispute of our garden, many of the facts do not correspond to the truth. Our garden has historically had surpluses, and there is no way Runquan could have reported a loss and difficulty in sustaining operations at the shareholders' meeting on April 22nd. The claim that the appointment of Fei Zuyi for liquidation was based on a conference is even more erroneous. Furthermore, the claim that Li Yunsun and Li Yongsund do not have shareholder status and cannot be plaintiffs is incorrect. Yunsun and Yongsund are heirs of Li Boji and legally have shared ownership rights. Fearing that the outside world is unaware of the truth, which could lead to misunderstandings, we should send a letter on behalf of the representatives to correct the errors. Therefore, we respectfully request that the letter be published to serve as a correction.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Wu Huatai

### The Ministry of Education Actively Promotes Educational Films in Provinces and Cities, Adding New Areas in Various Provinces This Year

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since 1936, the Ministry of Education has started organizing film education. Various provinces and cities have established mobile film education areas, which have achieved significant results. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the ministry's work on implementing film education has continued as normal. Recently, to adapt to the current needs, on the one hand, it has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 24 sets each of generators, projectors, and slide projectors for distribution to various provinces to add new educational areas. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of educational areas nationwide will increase to 134. On the other hand, it has produced and purchased a large number of educational films. It has entrusted Hong Kong Yin Guang Company and Kodak Company to reprint the third and fifth series of "War of Resistance," "Defending Our Land," "Hot Blood," "Loyal Souls," "Air Force War Records," "The Battle of Shanghai and Air Defense," and "Gas Defense," among other films. It has also independently produced educational films related to wartime educational facilities. Furthermore, it has sent personnel to participate in the Southwest Border Education Inspection Group, traveling to Guiyang, Bijie, Weining, Zhaotong, Kunming, Dali, and Mengzi to film geographical customs and produce educational films. In addition, the ministry has assigned specialized personnel to be responsible for compiling and drawing slides, and several types have been completed. When the National Education Conference opens, the ministry will include the newly produced slides in the exhibition, which has received high praise. This year, in addition to actively adding new areas in various provinces, the ministry will also restore film education work in Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanghai. Educational films in small demand for Zhejiang and Fujian, etc., are regularly sent by the ministry from Hong Kong. Therefore, the film education work in various provinces and cities has not been affected by transportation difficulties. Currently, to facilitate the promotion of film education, the ministry has specially compiled a "Film Education Handbook," which will be distributed to film education workers in various provinces to understand the storage and use of equipment and the procedures for implementation, in order to improve work efficiency.

### Recent News from the Central Vocational School: Five Departments Currently Running, Aquaculture Department Temporarily Postponed

(Chongqing News) The National Central Vocational School of Technology was established in late January of this year, after the Ministry of Education hired Liu Yiyan, the former director of the Anhui Construction Department and special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to prepare for its establishment in Chongqing. It was initially planned to establish six departments: Agricultural Product Manufacturing, Papermaking, Leather, Textile Dyeing, Sericulture, and Aquaculture. In order to cooperate with relevant production business organizations in the establishment of each department, the school selected a certain location in Sichuan as the location of the main campus, establishing the three departments of Agricultural Product Manufacturing, Papermaking, and Textile Dyeing. The Sericulture Department was established near the Sichuan Provincial Sericulture Improvement Farm in northern Sichuan, and the Leather Department was established in another location, with detailed measures agreed upon with Huazhong University and the Sichuan Provincial Construction and Education Departments for cooperative management. The Aquaculture Department, due to equipment reasons, was approved by the Ministry of Education to be temporarily postponed. Later, in mid-February, experts were hired to serve as teachers, and curriculum standards and guidance outlines were formulated according to the goals of each department. School buildings were repaired and located in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guilin, Zhucheng, and other places to recruit students. On March 28, the list of admitted students was announced in the newspaper. Registration took place on April 18 and 23, and classes began on the 24th. Students from remote areas who were unable to report on time due to transportation difficulties were also allowed to enter the school later. Currently, the number of students who have registered in each department is 32 in Agricultural Product Manufacturing, 40 in Papermaking, 45 in Textile Dyeing, 36 in Leather, and 33 in Sericulture. Those who have been granted leave for special circumstances are not included. It is expected that the number will not differ greatly from the ministry's quota of 50 students per department. The funds for the construction of practice workshops for each department have been increased by the Ministry of Education. Recently, a construction committee has been established, and plans are being made and actively carried out.

Karen Touret weighed 233 and three-quarters pounds, while Joe Louis weighed 200 and three-quarters pounds. When they met by the scales, they only exchanged a very cold "Hello."

Course of the Fierce Battle

Joe Louis knocked down his strong opponent Karen Touret to the ground with his left hand before the end of the fourth round, retaining his boxing throne, taking only two minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Although Karen Touret was defeated this time, everyone said that his terrifying attack was something Joe Louis had never encountered before. Although Joe won, he also spent a lot of effort. In the first round, both sides concentrated and probed each other. When Karen Touret attacked with his left and right hands, the audience cheered. After a stalemate for a while, Karen Touret made a heavy blow with his left hand, hitting Joe's jaw, and Joe also retaliated. In the second round, Karen Touret used the same trick again, attacking with his left fist, and Joe attacked his head with a clever method, while at the same time hitting Karen Touret's jaw with his left fist. At this time, Joe's fist was like a storm, and Karen Touret was busy parrying. Later, Joe made another terrifying heavy blow, knocking Karen Touret to the ropes. Before long, the bell rang, and the second round ended. Karen Touret's nose had been injured and bleeding within three rounds, but he still fought bravely. He first attacked Joe's left, and then also returned with a powerful left fist to the jaw, causing Joe to fall to the ground, which shows his strength. But Joe immediately stood up. When the third round of fighting was about to begin, it ended. After that, the fierce fight was very intense. Joe Louis, because he had enough experience, waved a very hard left fist in a very tense situation, knocking down Karen Touret and retaining his throne.

Lido, with its victorious division, faced Aiming, and as a result, easily defeated Aiming with a score of three to one. In another match, the French United Army had only Chiara and Fan Eers due to illness of several team members. Therefore, a mixed team composed of Lido and Hengchang teams was temporarily formed to fight against the Hengchang team. Therefore, the strength of the two teams was equal, and the battle was very tense. As a result, neither side gained anything, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw. Today, there are two B-level matches, Nanmo vs. Guangxia, and Bomber vs. Navy, Army, and Air Force, plus a practice match between Lao Yi and Yao Ke, starting at 3:15.

### Dietary Therapy for "Summer Heat"

— Wu Shanqing

In the sweltering heat of summer, the most common disease is "summer heat." Regardless of gender, age, or severity, patients are not uncommon. If you feel that your hands and feet are soft, you are lazy to move, your appetite is poor, you are drowsy, your face is sallow and thin, and you are tired, then you have already suffered from summer heat. This is all caused by the hot weather and the dirty and humid environment, which leads to abnormal digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.

The symptoms of summer heat were called summer withering in ancient times, because the spirit is tired, the limbs are lazy, just like the withered and unthriving plants. "Where evil gathers, its qi must be deficient." The deficiency lies in the weak intestinal digestion, which is unable to resist the hot summer, resulting in summer heat. Before getting sick, you should use nourishing foods in advance, and you should often use black dates or red dates, steaming them on the rice cooker, or boiling them in water, peeling off the skin and pits, and using them as a snack to eat often, and drinking the soup, which can strengthen the spleen and stomach, and increase resistance. The date meat contains sugar and mucilage, which can increase the oxidation power in the blood and expand the cell proliferation power, so it is often used as a mild tonic. It is advisable to eat it often before the onset of summer heat.

After getting sick, it is advisable to remove dampness and heat. Often eat coix seed porridge, that is, cook raw coix seed with water into porridge. It can remove dampness and heat, nourish the stomach and spleen, benefit the muscles and bones, and relax the meridians. Moreover, coix seed is the most nutritious and easily digested. The protein it contains is more than other grains. It can not only remove dampness and heat, but also help to nourish. It is a good choice to use it as a dietary therapy for summer heat.

Other vegetables and fruits also have the same effects, such as mung bean porridge, lentil soup, dried radish, kohlrabi, sweet pickled cucumber, salted tempeh, loofah, lily, pickled mustard tuber, water chestnut, sugar cane, watermelon, etc., which are suitable for those with summer heat to eat, because they have the effect of clearing heat and resolving dampness, benefiting qi and harmonizing blood, regulating the spleen and stomach, and benefiting the viscera. However, sour and cold fruits, sweet and fatty meats, and things that are not easily digested or stale, should all be avoided. Otherwise, if they accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, it is inevitable that the summer heat will be accompanied by other diseases, leading to damp heat, vomiting and diarrhea, malaria, and other symptoms. Can we not be careful!

### "Don't Eat Too Much" Don't Seek to Be Full

— Jin Zheming

The three words "don't eat too much" were also said by Confucius more than 2,000 years ago. Its meaning is clearly to teach people not to overeat when eating. As the saying goes, "Eat less and taste more, eat more and fill your stomach," which is a true saying. Because unrestricted indulgence in eating and drinking results in stagnation of the digestive function of the stomach and intestines, and is prone to chest tightness, abdominal distension, belching and acid reflux, loss of appetite... and many other ailments. We must understand: the effect of diet is only to increase the driving force in the body! Therefore, the principle of adopting food should be to seek its ease of digestion, richness in nutrition, and not to care about the quantity. When ingesting food, we must leave considerable room, that is, athletes must also do this (swimmers should not eat too much). People often have an abstract view that athletes must eat more, and that they must eat more meat, which is really wrong. Often many athletes suffer from stomach problems as a result. People who use their minds too much should not eat too much, and should reduce their food intake. This is because people who use their minds too much use their brains more and use their strength less. There is not much physical exertion, so there is no need to eat too much. Eating too much is harmful, because if there is a fixed amount of blood, eating too much will make the circulation in the digestive tract more vigorous, and the amount of blood will increase. At the same time, the amount of blood in the limbs and brain will decrease, resulting in anemia. The reason why you feel tired, lazy, and sleepy after eating too much is this. Especially after eating too much, people become slow in thinking and relaxed in muscles. Therefore, we should be careful and prudent according to the clear instructions of "The gentleman eats without seeking to be full" (don't eat too much).

### 温病小誌（二）

— 楊彥和

In discussing warm diseases, Yu Qian often mentions conditions like excessive sweating leading to Yang collapse, and fever receding while the disease remains.  These are not exhaustive, so I add further details:  Mistakenly inducing sweating injures fluids, mistaken purgation causes sudden depletion, fatigue and internal injury manifest as dazedness, coma, stiff tongue with black coating, dry throat, deafness, palpitations, and irregular pulse.  In medical terminology, these are called "grave signs". At this time, it is imperative to invigorate the Qi to dispel the disease, and to allow the righteous Qi to recover and resist the pathogenic influence. What is the method to achieve this? Wu Jutong specifically advocated the "method of preserving vitality to treat the disease". His formula is based on Ye Tianshi's eighth case of warm disease and the sixteenth case of warm heat, but ordinary people often overlook it, which is a pity! Wu specially defined this method as "Modified Fuling Mai Tang Decoction", and solemnly warned: "Even if there are other symptoms, treat them later." At this critical moment, the spirit is wavering, hanging by a thread. If we do not focus on preserving Yin and only treat the symptoms superficially, any aggravation may cause the wavering spirit to leave the body. Alas! Can one not be careful? In addition, there are formulas for rescuing Yang and Erjia (three-shell) Decoction, but one must choose and modify them according to the symptoms, and not adhere rigidly to one formula. (The end)

### 預防失眠

— 徐林炎

Insomnia is mostly caused by Liver Qi excess. When Liver fire rises, it leads to chest tightness, irritability, headache. Although feeling tired, it is difficult to fall asleep. Thoughts surge, and anxiety intertwines. The next morning, one feels listless and unable to concentrate. Furthermore, those with neurasthenia are particularly prone to this. With neurasthenia, sensations are exceptionally acute. Therefore, it is not only difficult to fall asleep, but even if one does, any slight noise can easily awaken them. The way to prevent it lies in self-cultivation and regulation. Try the following points according to the law, and it will be effective over time. One, cultivate a pure heart and few desires, and do not get angry or agitated. Two, reduce sexual activity. Three, avoid spicy and stimulating foods. Four, quit smoking and alcohol. Five, eat more Yin-nourishing foods. Six, ensure smooth bowel movements every day. Seven, wash feet with hot water before bed and urinate. Eight, do not talk before bed. Read briefly in bed to calm the mind, but only to the point of slight fatigue. Nine, avoid going out at night, and practice going to bed early and waking up early. Ten, bathe frequently. Eleven, take walks in the countryside to breathe fresh air. Twelve, the bedroom light should not be too bright. In summer, green curtains and light bulbs are best. Thirteen, consume Suanzaoren (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa seed), Lianxin (Nelumbo nucifera seed embryo), and reed root tea.

### 告施茶者

— 心仁

A word to those providing tea:

Now that summer is approaching, it is common to see a pot of cool tea placed at intersections and beside telephone poles. At the same time, there are vendors selling tea for one copper coin a bowl by the roadside. However, in this bustling city, dust flies everywhere. Even if the tea pot is free of dust, dust and flies will fly into the tea pot.

Coolies, sweating profusely and unbearably thirsty after working hard in the hot sun, are overjoyed to see a pot of ready-made drink. They drink it into their stomachs. As a result, the sources of diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and cholera also take the opportunity to invade their abdomens. Imagine the danger if they break out!

Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion to all the gentlemen who set up tea pots: "Please put a lid on the tea pot." This will be an immeasurable act of merit.

### 濕令代茶妙品　橘皮

— 缶鳴

A wonderful tea substitute for humid weather: Orange Peel

"One cup is tasting, two cups is quenching thirst, three cups is drinking like a donkey." This is what Jia Baoyu said in Longcui Nunnery. But drinking tea can quench thirst, and in hot weather, it increases the body's water content. One cup, two cups, ten cups, eight cups; as long as there is a physiological need, what does it matter if you drink like a donkey or an ox? In this summer season, the body's water loss increases daily, and adding beverages is inevitable. Modern beverages such as soda and fruit juice are not affordable for ordinary people. With rising prices, even tea leaves are not necessarily affordable for everyone. In our country's custom, when guests come, tea is served. If plain water is used, it is considered stingy. But now, we might as well advocate a compromise: use orange peel instead of tea leaves. The method is to take orange peel and dry it in the sun, then cut it into thin strips with force. (Regardless of Guangqiao, Fuju, or honey oranges, as long as it is an orange, its peel can be used.) It can be stored for a long time without spoiling. Take a handful of orange peel strips, put them in a cup, and pour in boiling water. After a few minutes, it can be drunk. The color is clear and green, and the taste is fragrant. If you pour it into a cup to serve guests, no one will believe it is orange peel brewed. And its effect is to regulate dampness, guide stagnation, and invigorate the stomach. Long-term use has the effect of removing bad breath.

### 夫婦之愛得進行曲

The Love of Couples Must Advance

Because the enlightenment of social evolution makes us believe that in the highest society, matters between men and women will especially emphasize love, and the love of couples will be regarded as the most precious life experience, and will no longer be defamed but will be envied. However, the things in between are often contradictory. In occasions where genuine free love is possible, the hearts of both men and women will expand. According to psychologists, a romantic man is constantly seeking, at any time and any place, the freedom, beauty, and adventure that his ancestors were able to find in the young forest. The heart of his desire is opened, and can simply accommodate more than a dozen women! Although women are not as intense as men, they also dislike the permanent relationship between couples. Lascivious women are fickle. If they were not bound by moral concepts, which woman would not be fickle?

Escape is never a way to solve difficulties. Only struggle is the best way to solve difficulties. Contradiction is a necessary stage in evolution. With contradiction, there is consensus. Positive and negative cancel each other out, and a new individual is born from this. If love is what we need, then we should strive to make it complete. The expansion of desire in men and women in love is precisely their expression of vitality in life. This vitality can encourage them to be brave, move forward, and make their lives happy and comforting! If the husband and wife are healthy and beautiful, and also understand the secrets of love, so that everyone can freely bring the love and interest into unity, pay attention to the promotion of health to meet the requirements of his and her desire when it expands, and make love eternal, this is the sweetest and happiest! In short, the promotion of the love of couples is greatly related to health. If a man suffers from masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in debauchery after marriage, consuming too much of the life source of the reproductive gland fluid, then symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, asthenospermia, infertility, and neurasthenia will follow. Such a sick husband, not only because of lack of energy, has no achievement in his career and academics, and is rejected by society, but also cannot have a happy life in his married life, is hated by his wife, leading to the breakdown of love, and staging all kinds of tragedies! This is the man's own fault, how can he blame his wife for being fickle? To try to remedy it, it is necessary to cure this kind of hidden disease. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking reproductive gland hormone preparations [Reproductin] is the most effective treatment. Because this agent is of precious quality and has definite efficacy, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidney, strengthen the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote development within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will surely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can make the body healthier. Only those with spermatorrhea need to also take [Hemet's Spermacrasia Tablets] (available in large pharmacies such as Wuzhou Chinese and Western Medicine Pharmacy, etc.) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the treatment addresses both the root and the branches, and the effect is even faster!

### 乳峯在健美上的價值

The Value of the Breast Mound in Physical Beauty
— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Trendy makeup and eyebrow painting, skeletal thinness is shameful! Do you know the modern beauty? Tall breasts and fat hips show off their charm.

Due to the turbulent situation, there are now many wealthy wives and young ladies who have come to Shanghai from other places to seek refuge on this isolated island. As soon as they set foot on the Bund, it is as if Grandma Liu has entered the Grand View Garden for the first time. They feel that everything they see and hear is wonderful and spectacular. What they especially admire and feel the need to imitate is the new clothes of modern women. They think that since they have become Shanghainese, they must learn to speak the Shanghai dialect. Therefore, regardless of their figure, they get perms, leather shoes, purses, and short-sleeved qipaos. Applying powder and rouge, painting their faces and dabbing their lips, they are transformed in one day and dare to enter social circles, complacent with themselves. How would they know that while they are feeling smug, people are sneering at them behind their backs!

This is not nonsense, because what they pay attention to is only clothing, thinking that as long as the clothing is new, they will naturally look good. Actually, it is not like that. You must know that what modern people are advocating for female beauty is the curve beauty composed of towering breasts, plump buttocks, and fine waist, which is also healthy beauty. However, inland women do not pay attention to breast development. The more aristocratic the family, the more they bind their breasts. Therefore, women with atrophied breasts, thin hips, and loss of health and beauty are everywhere. Even if such women put on extremely gorgeous new clothes, they still feel skinny, as if they are wearing a lantern case, wide and empty, with no fleshy, touching beauty. Therefore, no matter how new their faces are, or how sophisticated their decorations are, they still cannot hide their ugliness!

To be a new age woman, please spend less money on unnecessary decorations, and quickly think about health and beauty. If the breasts are atrophied and health and beauty are lost, they should immediately use ovarian endocrine preparations, which are generally recognized for women as taking ovarian preparations for women. The [Reproductin] is used to compensate. This agent was invented by American physician Dr. Dana after more than 30 years of arduous experiments, and has been verified by many European and American doctors, who believe that the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great. All kinds of women's hidden diseases can be completely cured in a short period of time. Continued use will not only make the atrophied breasts become towering, but also reduce uterine diseases, promote pregnancy, redden the cheeks, and maintain youth.

Why Does Long-Term Spermatorrhea Cause a Sallow Complexion and Skinny Appearance?

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Young people with sallow complexions and skinny appearances are prevalent in today's society. They are not in that state due to not being able to get enough food or clothing. According to our investigation, most of them have committed masturbation and spermatorrhea. After a young person reaches the age of fifteen or sixteen, it is a natural phenomenon for semen to be produced in the reproductive organs due to physiological maturity. But this semen is usually stored in the seminal vesicles and is intended for the sacred function of reproduction. How can it be trifled with? However, most curious and ignorant young people cannot restrain their sexual impulses or are tempted by bad environments, and commit masturbation. There are truly countless people who commit masturbation, and because the indulgence of masturbation destroys the sexual nerves and relaxes the sperm gate, even more people suffer from spermatorrhea.

Those who suffer from spermatorrhea are described by doctors as being possessed by a blood-sucking demon, because one drop of semen is as precious as eighty drops of blood, and one instance of spermatorrhea is equivalent to one pound of blood loss. Then, it is probably a better phenomenon to have a sallow complexion and skinny appearance due to long-term spermatorrhea. Semen is the reproductive gland fluid in our body. Part of it is stored in the seminal vesicles through the vas deferens, and part of it directly seeps into the blood, irrigates the whole body, and functions to adjust metabolism, invigorate development, and nourish all nerves. Therefore, long-term spermatorrhea will inevitably reduce metabolism. In various tissues, only old cells die, and few new cells are produced. How can this not cause a sallow complexion, a skinny appearance, and premature aging? At the same time, it is difficult to escape symptoms such as incomplete development, neurasthenia, and kidney deficiency. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that masturbation and spermatorrhea in young people is equivalent to chronic suicide. To seek remedy, one must take the special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, take "Hemet's Spermacrasia Tablets", to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, and spermatorrhea can be cured that night. Those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to spermatorrhea must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain, kidney, and nerves, promote development, and adjust metabolism. It will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time. If patients can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

### 尿中忽然出血的淋病

Gonorrhea with Sudden Bleeding in the Urine

In the daily cases of gonorrhea that we doctors encounter, there are many patients who are inexplicably frightened by the sudden bleeding in their urine. In fact, there is no need to be so alarmed. Gonorrhea with bleeding in the urine is a symptom of gonorrheal cystitis, which is often encountered. The cause of cystitis is, in seven or eight out of ten cases, due to the result of local instrument surgery, because impure surgery often causes gonococci to reach the bladder from the posterior urethra during the procedure, thus eroding the bladder mucosa and causing cystitis. At this time, the urine is completely turbid, and even bloody urine may erupt. The most serious case is bleeding inside the bladder. When the rupture of blood vessels is large, the blood serum accumulates in the bladder, making the urine completely red. Fortunately, this kind of phenomenon is not always seen. Generally speaking, it is only during urination that a small amount of bleeding occurs due to the contraction of the bladder wall muscles. As for the bleeding in the bladder, it is often in the posterior part, because gonococci often invade the bladder neck. The characteristic of this symptom is that the lower abdomen and the pubic joint feel tingling, and this tingling radiates to the tip of the penis during urination.

When treating this symptom, attention should be paid to the severity of the symptom. Some are suitable for bladder irrigation, some are suitable for warm compresses, some are suitable for taking diuretics, and the latest chemotherapy has a special effect on this symptom. However, the surgery used in treating this symptom must still be quick and skilled. Otherwise, if the wound is further damaged, it will be like adding fire to the river, and the situation will become even worse. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea who see blood in their urine must not choose a doctor indiscriminately or take over-the-counter drugs indiscriminately. They should seek a doctor with experience who is willing to take responsibility.

### 金融　多頭趁髙出籠　金價大漲小回　頭盤出六百元關交易七百兩左右

Finance: Bulls Take Advantage of High Prices to Exit, Gold Prices Rise Sharply and Slightly Rebound, First Trade Exceeds 600 Yuan Mark, Transaction Volume Around 700 Taels

Yesterday's spot gold price in the black market, although the range of change was not as large as the previous day, the market trend was still uncertain. The reason is that people's hearts are hard to change. Initially, due to the continued sharp drop in foreign banks and the weakening of foreign exchange, coupled with the vigorous buying intention of the securities firms, the market opened at a high of 2,605 yuan. Then, due to the spot gold traders taking advantage of the high prices to sell, and a certain money exchange firm selling all the bull positions it had entered the previous day to take profits, the market situation once turned weak and fell back to a low of 2,580 yuan. Afterwards, due to the upward sentiment and the strong pull by major players, the price rose again to 2,596 yuan. However, it finally closed at 2,590 yuan, an increase of 22 yuan compared with the previous day. Trading was still active, reaching about 700 taels for the whole day. The price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores also rose first, then fell, and then rose again, finally increasing by 2 yuan. The customs gold price remained flat, while the price of Chinese-British pure gold slightly increased.

烚赤尙漲念二元

Spot Gold Still Increased by 22 Yuan

Since this morning, each bar (ten taels), initially carrying on the remaining momentum from the previous day, and with the weakening of foreign exchange and the sharp drop in foreign silver, coupled with the sudden stop of congestion and the turn to buying by the securities firms, and with sellers extremely scarce, the price was under the pressure of buying orders, and soared by 37 yuan at the opening. First, the securities firms bought 50 taels from the spot gold traders, at a price of 2,605 yuan. Then, the money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the securities firms, at a price of 600 yuan. Later, the spot gold traders sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm, at a price of 604 yuan. At this time, the money exchange firm that had entered the market the previous day suddenly took advantage of the high prices to take profits, and the market situation immediately turned downwards, falling by 9 yuan in an instant. A certain silver firm sold 50 taels to the securities firms, at a price of 595 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. A certain silver exchange firm sold 50 taels to its peers and 10 taels to the gold firms, all at a price of 590 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. A certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to its peers and jewelry stores, all at a price of 585 yuan. At this time, the securities firms also had selling intentions, so the price fell again by 5 yuan. A certain money exchange firm and securities firm each sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm, all at a price of 580 yuan. After this, the buying sentiment suddenly turned strong again, and the news was that everyone was holding a wait-and-see attitude, which caused the market to strengthen again. Before long, it soared by 15 yuan. The jewelry stores bought 50 taels from the spot gold traders, at a price of 595 yuan. Then the money exchange firms did some inter-trading for 10 taels, at a price of 596 yuan. Later, the money exchange firms bought 50 taels from the jewelry stores, at a price of 594 yuan. Approaching noon, the market situation turned flat. The gold firms bought 50 taels from the jewelry stores, and the jewelry stores bought 50 taels from a certain silver firm, all at a price of 592 yuan, which was the closing price for the noon session.

The spot gold traders sold 50 taels to the jewelry stores, at a price of 590 yuan. At this time, retail investors came to sell a little, and the trend continued downwards. The money exchange firms did some inter-trading for 30 taels, at a price of 588 yuan. Then it fell another 1 yuan. The gold firms did some inter-trading for 20 taels, at a price of 587 yuan. Then the retail investors sold 50 taels to the money exchange firms, at a price of 588 yuan. At this time, the money exchange firms had a good appetite, so the price rebounded slightly. At 2:45 PM, the gold firms sold 30 taels to the money exchange firms, at 2,590 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it increased by 22 yuan compared with the previous day, with a fluctuation of 25 yuan throughout the day.

According to inquiries, very few short sales were done.

首飾金更動三次

The Price of Gold Ornaments Changed Three Times

The selling price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores per tael, initially did not change. But at 9:52 AM, because the spot gold price at the opening was strong, they all raised the price to 263 yuan. Shortly after, at 10:15 AM, because the spot gold price suddenly rebounded, they also lowered the price to 261 yuan. Later, at 12:00 noon, because the spot gold price secretly strengthened again, they raised the price by 2 yuan again. After that, there was no change. It is estimated that the major firms changed the price to 263 yuan, while the small firms changed the price to 261 yuan, and the buying price was 255 yuan.

British Pure Gold Rose by Half a Penny

The Chinese cash buying price of the central bank reached a maximum of 1,212 yuan, 6 jiao. The listed customs gold price remained flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li.

### 月杪結款浩繁　外匯續見緊縮　掉期合息又在四分光景

At the End of the Month, Settlements Are Numerous, Foreign Exchange Continues to Tighten, Swap Interest Rate Is Again Around 4 Points

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the HSBC listed price, no changes. Black market conditions, initially carrying on the remaining momentum from the previous day, coupled with the end of the month approaching, the oil companies such as Asia and Texaco and other foreign firms, settlements are even more frequent. Although the day banks and Hong Kong Electric and Chinese textile firms (bulls exiting) successively sold, and Sassoon also turned to selling for the month, but foreign banks' appetite suddenly strengthened, which caused the market to continue to tighten. The British gold was once the tightest at 6 points 53125, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 12.75 yuan. Afterwards, because silver companies and foreign banks' selling intention was slightly stronger, the situation turned flat. As a result, the US exchange rate was weaker than the British, because the British-US inter-exchange rate shrunk. The futures market also once tightened at first, but later the congestion of the Hong Kong Electric returned to flat. Currently, the distance between the spot and July British gold is 28125, and the US exchange rate also differs by 5625. The bank's deposit interest rate is about 4.5 points, while the actual monthly interest rate for arbitragers is only 3.78 points. However, it is not easy for Chinese merchants to deposit and there is no legal currency, so the transaction was not completed. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it continued to tighten because foreign firms settled frequently, and finally shrunk by 625 again.

沙遜日商尚有賣出

Sassoon and Japanese Merchants Still Had Selling

In the early morning, the London large bars, near and far, fell sharply by 75, the New York silver price continued to fall miserably by 1.5 points, the London raw gold by half a point, the exchange rate British to US small by 1 point 3, to Shanghai down by 25, to France no change, US to British small by 125, to Shanghai down by 2 jiao 5 fen, to France shrunk by 0625. The central listing of various exchanges remained the same.

The bank's morning opening spot selling price, British gold was 6 points 625, US exchange rate was 12 yuan 9375, compared to the previous close, British flat US tight 03125, is the reason for the British-US opening exchange rate shrinkage. After opening, oil companies and other settlements were frequent, and foreign firms' sellers were thin, while the appetite was good, so the potential immediately tightened. First, HSBC absorbed the spot British gold of Japanese banks and foreign electricity in Hong Kong for 6 points 625, then the oil companies Texaco and Asia competed to absorb the HSBC spot British gold 6 points 59375 and 5625, until the HSBC listing was announced without moving, and the white silver balance tax was announced exempt, after this, the foreign China Datong certain banks successively absorbed the spot US exchange rate of Japanese banks and Chinese merchants for 12 yuan 875 and 8125, at which time foreign companies' settlements were still frequent, so the potential became tighter. The bank selected the tightest British gold as 6 points 53125, the weakest US exchange rate as 12 yuan 75. Approaching noon, Japanese banks and Western merchants Sassoon successively sold to Bombay Silver Company and foreign banks the July British gold for 6 points 28125, and the same month US exchange rate for 12 yuan 25, the situation was also tight. Later, foreign companies settled the Hong Kong exchange rate for 44 yuan and a half, the situation was quite tight. Extended to noon closing, the British-US exchange rate slightly hardened, the bank's spot selling price British gold was 6 points 59375, US exchange rate was 12 yuan 875.

In the afternoon, the market situation turned slightly stable

In the afternoon, the foreign companies continued to settle, HSBC's spot British gold was 6 points 59375, and it also settled Datong's spot US exchange rate of 12 yuan 84375, then the silver company sold the spot US exchange rate of 12 yuan 875 to a certain bank, the market situation was quite stable. Later, Hong Kong Electric sold the July spot British gold of 6 points 3125 to foreign firms, the situation saw a slight hardening, later the Netherlands sold the spot price of 44 yuan and a half to foreign firms, the situation lacked change, until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price, British gold 6 points 59375, US exchange rate 12 yuan 875. As a result, compared with yesterday afternoon's close, British tightened 03125, US weakened 09375, Hong Kong exchange rate was also sold for 625 after the transaction price was reconciled.

### Economic Implications of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions (Continued)

— Gu Xiao

Coercing Foreign Banks into Connection with Counterfeit Currency

After the establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" in North China, it issued "United Reserve Bank" notes. However, foreign banks in the concessions generally adopted a passive attitude and refused to cooperate with this bank, unanimously refusing to use the "United Reserve Bank" notes. Even if they were used, these counterfeit notes could only be recorded separately and used exclusively for trade with Japan. They could not be used to purchase foreign exchange. Moreover, more than 300 foreign stores inside and outside the concessions preferred to sacrifice business and reduce their scope rather than use counterfeit currency. Therefore, this blockade by the Japanese also aimed to coerce foreign banks and stores in the concessions to use the "United Reserve Bank" notes and recognize them as currency. However, things backfired. After the blockade of Tianjin Concessions, an order was issued within the concessions to completely ban the use of counterfeit currency as retaliation. This was something that the Japanese had not anticipated.

Looting 50 Million Silver Dollars within the Concessions

It is estimated that the silver stored in North China, specifically in Tianjin, includes:

Bank of China: 18,349,981 yuan
Bank of Communications: 20,612,599 yuan
Total: 38,962,580 yuan

In Beiping:

Bank of China: 6,592,359 yuan
Bank of Communications: 8,865,867 yuan
Central Bank: 100,315 yuan
Total: 15,558,501 yuan

Total for Beiping and Tianjin: 54,521,121 yuan

Since the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, this sum of 54,521,121 silver dollars has been stored in the vaults of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications within the British and French Concessions of Tianjin. The Japanese have long harbored the intention to loot it. On February 7th of last year, the puppet "Provisional Government" attempted to seize it and organized the so-called "Cash Custody Committee of the Two Cities of Beijing and Tianjin," forcing the two banks in the concessions to hand over the silver for "acceptance." The British and French Concession authorities insisted on their neutral stance and refused. In March, when the puppet "United Reserve Bank" was established, it again attempted to loot the silver to use as a foundation for issuing counterfeit currency. However, both attempts failed. Later, the Japanese further demanded that the British and French Concession authorities jointly form a committee with the Japanese to seal off the silver, but this was never accepted by the concessions. Therefore, the Japanese and their puppets have been constantly thinking about the silver, intending to loot it to satisfy their desires.

In summary, the above four points are the major objectives of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin Concessions. Because Japan has occupied North China for nearly two years, its strength is insufficient to fully realize its ambition of domination. As a result, it has shifted its anger to the concessions. The cause was by no means accidental. This time, it merely used the issue of extraditing criminals as a fuse to create trouble. The ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the rights and interests of the powers in the entire North China region. This blockade is just one step in their implementation plan. (The End)

### British and American Gold Pounds Continue to Rise

Yesterday, pure British gold rose by half an ounce; British-American exchange rates fell by 0.125; local foreign exchange banks had substantial settlements; foreign banks provided smooth settlements; the market condition was tight at first and then eased. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6 ounces and 59.375, a rise of 0.03125. The American exchange rate was 12.785 yuan, also a rise of 0.09375. The Shanghai gold market opened high, continuing the upward trend of the previous day. Gold shop customers were excited to buy, pushing the price to a high of 2,605 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses took advantage of the high prices to sell and settle profits. Furthermore, exchange rates eased, falling to a low of 2,580 yuan. The market recovered in the afternoon, fluctuating around 2,590 yuan. Trading was sparse, and fluctuations were narrow. The evening closing price was 2,590 yuan, a rise of 22 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, remained in high demand. Due to the high rise in the Shanghai gold market, market prices all increased. British and American gold notes were in high demand, and market prices slightly decreased. Hong Kong notes, French francs, Dutch guilders, etc., were in slight demand, trending slightly higher. The supply of Japanese gold notes increased relatively, and the market condition eased. The evening market price was 9 jiao, 8 fen, and 6 li. Korean notes were also rarely needed, and the price was 9 jiao. Transactions by the association were not active. Ren Tai offered 10 British gold pounds to Qin Tai, and Hou Ji offered 200 American gold notes to Cheng Tai, and also offered 300 American gold notes to Tong Yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 5 jiao, American gold notes fell by 1 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 1 fen, French francs rose by 1 li, Singapore dollars rose by 2 fen, Dutch guilders rose by 4 fen, Australian gold notes rose by 2 jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Old Banknotes Gradually Decreasing, More New Banknotes Seen

In recent days, it has been widely rumored in the market that the banknotes issued by various banks are mostly old banknotes from various commercial banks. However, since recently, these banknotes have become rare. Not only that, but more new banknotes are being issued, which proves that the substitution of miscellaneous banknotes for the banknotes of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is groundless, and that the payment capabilities of various bank notes are abundant and not expected to be exhausted, which is particularly obvious. This has been the case for several days. However, small banks do have considerable difficulties.

### Lingering Impact: Silver Prices Continue to Plunge

A London dispatch on the 28th reported that the silver market's downward trend intensified, with India and speculators rushing to sell. The market was unstable. After the closing, there were inflows and outflows at a price 0.0625 higher than the listed price. Large bars of silver, both near-term and far-term, plunged again by 0.75. A New York silver dispatch reported that the spot price in the US continued to fall sharply, plummeting by another 1.5 fen. A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian silver market was increasingly weak, with spot prices plummeting by 25 annas, and prices for July and August both plummeting by 26 annas.

### Discount Rate Steps Lower

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts continued to fall, at 95 yuan per thousand in the morning and retreating to 92 yuan in the afternoon, a further decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank loans from the Money Trade Association remained at 0.22 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions, it is said.

### Banks to Conduct Semi-Annual Settlements Today; Check Clearing Extended to 4:45 PM

Today is the day when banks customarily conduct their semi-annual settlements. The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city has specially extended the check clearing time to facilitate interbank check collection and delivery, scheduling it to begin from 4:45 PM. The time for collecting checks on behalf of others will remain the same. It is reported that the committee has already sent circulars to all banks to follow suit. (Y)

### Securities: Jardine Matheson Shares Most Active

In the stock market of the exchanges, Jardine Matheson shares continued to be the most active, with 6,700 shares changing hands at prices between 19 yuan and 18.70 yuan. Other stocks also showed slight progress in market sentiment, with a large number of buyers appearing and prices becoming slightly more leveled. Tramway shares changed hands at 40.075 yuan, and Wheelock Marden shares rose slightly to a price of 35 yuan. It seems that both the general public and speculators are adopting a wait-and-see strategy to await the resolution of the Tianjin Incident. However, it is speculated that the European situation is unlikely to conclude in the very short term. Rubber stocks showed slight demand. The corporate bond market remained sluggish, with only the 5.5% power utility bond showing slight demand at 82.5 yuan.

The listed prices of Far East companies' stocks traded in London for British merchants on the 28th of this month (Wednesday) showed only slight fluctuations in bank stocks. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 5 shillings, with a price of 7 pounds and 5 shillings. HSBC Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 80.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts traded in London on the 28th of this month (Wednesday) showed that the Rehabilitation Loan's British and French bond notes rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 32.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. Trading prices: Rehabilitation Loan, British issue, buying in at 31.5 pounds, selling out at 33.5 pounds; French issue with stamp, buying in at 29 pounds, selling out at 31 pounds. Spot goods for sale in England, including 7,000 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds, are priced at 15.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds above the market.

### Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Exchange Shrinks Again; Spot Yarn Buying Spree Erupts; Double Horse and Earth Brands Soar by Around 20 Yuan; Japanese Yarn Transactions Also Convert to Exchange Clearing

The cotton yarn black market suddenly trended upward, and the upward trend became heated again, but actual transactions were not very developed, due to the impact of transportation obstructions. However, the general perception of rising prices among those in the trade remained deep. As soon as a good opportunity arose, they rushed to lift prices, and the lifting force was especially strong. It was found that the lowest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn had reached 475 yuan on the previous day. Yesterday, the highest price reached 494 yuan, a surge of around 20 yuan in the space of one day. However, customer sales were not smooth, and financial conditions could not be relaxed immediately. Most market transactions were in units of ten bales. Upon investigation, the reasons for the rise were that foreign exchange had shrunk again to 6 ounces flat, gold had risen slightly, and the trend of trade had rebounded. There were more buyers than sellers at the opening call in the morning, and the opening price immediately rose by 4.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at foreign godowns was 484.5 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 478 yuan. After a short while, the momentum tightened again. Some major customers had sold a lot on the previous day, and they took no action today. Merchants were dried up and rushed to buy in after hearing some good news. The market gradually hardened step by step. By the time of closing, 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 490 yuan, and the godown receipt was 485 yuan. The market reopened in the afternoon and rose another 3 to 4 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 494 yuan to 493.5 yuan, and the godown receipt was 489 yuan. It was found that the total purchases by various groups throughout the day were about 700 to 800 bales. Only the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou groups of customers made purchases, with most transactions still being among those in the trade. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan, Double Earth yarn rose by 18 yuan, and Shepherd yarn rose by 6 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn was flat and firm. It was found that 250 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and another 450 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

The spot yarn market will be closed from July 1st due to the financial industry's semi-annual settlements, and will reopen on July 4th, it is said.

The Japanese yarn market showed slight signs of a turnaround, because Japanese factories, aware that the discount rate was high and that spot cash was especially scarce on the market, had no choice but to follow the trend and converted to using exchange clearing in order to promote sales. As a result, the trend became slightly more flexible, and market prices rebounded slightly. However, sales were still flat. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was 385 yuan to 388 yuan.

### Domestic and Foreign Cotton Transactions Are on the Verge of Stagnation; Large Batches of Indian Cotton Arrive in Shanghai

Foreign Cotton

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was still considered firm in the early morning, rising slightly by 2 to 3 points. Later, due to purchases by those in the trade and favorable telegrams from Bombay, it entered a good phase. In the middle, the price of silver suddenly fell, causing panic among the people. Furthermore, the government's newly drafted legislation for the cotton industry placed many restrictions on transactions among those in the trade, and the weather in the cotton-growing areas was reported to be good, triggering settlements and abandonments from all sides. At the close, cotton prices fell by more than 10 points compared to the previous day, and Indian futures also predicted a drop of more than 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by 3 to 5 points.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: Since the government restricted withdrawals on the 22nd, financial conditions have tightened daily, and transactions have become increasingly difficult. Meanwhile, the number of arrivals is increasing daily, and factories are finding it difficult to raise funds and have temporarily stated that new transactions are impossible. Furthermore, foreign firms are suffering excessive losses due to the swap of exchange bills between this month and next month, and are extremely anxious. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm even sent its entire staff to collect banknotes from various manufacturers. Many in the trade, facing difficulties in raising funds, are also selling off their inventories at low prices.

Domestic cotton transactions have completely fallen into a state of stagnation. Only packages that have not been opened are left untouched. Factories, in the face of a lack of legal tender, are also unwilling to take any action. Furthermore, most Chinese factories have reserves of raw cotton for several months of use, and there is no sign of panic. As for foreign cotton transacted among those in the trade and resold to other factories, most market conditions appear slightly weak. Sources from northern Jiangsu are also not strong. Dock arrivals only included 165 bales from Tongzhou, which were transacted. Those in the trade took 800 pieces of Bairoke cotton, priced at 88.5 yuan, and also took 200 pieces of New Special Flower cotton, priced at 74.5 yuan, both delivered to godowns on a spot yarn basis.

Indian cotton continues to be shipped to China. Yesterday, the British company "Rahore" arrived in Shanghai with 2,707 tons of cotton loaded from Bombay. Yesterday, it docked at Qichang Godown in Pudong for unloading. Furthermore, the company's "Ghitral" came to Shanghai from London, and also loaded 882 pieces of cotton when passing through Bombay. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th. However, due to slight damage to its machinery, it was repaired in Hong Kong. The work has been completed, and it set sail from Hong Kong to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and is expected to arrive in port this morning. It is scheduled to dock at floating docks 11 and 12 for unloading and transshipment (Zu).

### Piece Goods: Many Cloth Factories Implement Reduced Working Hours; Exchange Clearing Notes Require Additional Premiums; Domestic and Foreign Factories Have Agreed to Ship Goods

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the spot sales market for cloth was dismal, and sales prices continued to decline. Only small amounts of about a thousand pieces were transacted by the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong customer groups. Business on this street was also lackluster, but still better than the customer groups. Transactions in retail pieces and assorted goods in Jiangzhe inland areas such as Bengbu continued without interruption. Wholesale shops on this street purchased more than 100 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, crepe de chine, thread fabrics, colored cloth, colored foreign yarn, and printed goods. Various dyeing and weaving factories, due to the shrinking sales of their products, are considering stopping work or reducing working hours, and many have already implemented this. They are also willing to relax prices on their inventory in an attempt to reduce heavy burdens, which has led those in the trade and customer groups to intend to purchase and hoard at low prices. However, due to tight financial conditions, transactions were not active. About 200 pieces of goods such as broadcloth, straight-sell flannel, fine cloth, and coarse cloth were transacted, all transferred to godowns for spot collateral. Market prices were chaotic, with less difference in white goods. Prices were generally lower than on the previous day, with no increases.

Eastern Cloth

In the white goods market, transactions were sluggish due to a lack of actual sales. However, most of those who sold short and bought short were forced to settle prices at the end of the month, as they could not delay any longer. The market price of Dragon Head fine cloth was once reduced to 13.5 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday, both domestic and foreign factories could ship goods with exchange clearing notes. Although premiums were required, the selling prices were again strengthened, and bullish sentiment returned to drag prices up. The spot price of Dragon Head fine cloth for this month increased to 14 yuan, and the price for the next month was 14.4 yuan. Transactions reached 200 to 300 bales. 75 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai on the 29th.

### Grains: Wheat Shows Slight Turnaround; Flour Still Difficult to Activate

Flour: Yesterday, spot flour transactions with customer groups were still limited by factories' firm sales for cash, and it was difficult to activate them. Except for a few who needed to touch the market, there were no large transactions. Even on this street, due to the banking semi-annual settlement period at the end of June, both financial conditions and cash were tight, and retail transactions were not high. The factory prices for No. 2 flour have not changed temporarily, and a decision will generally be made after the banks reopen next week. 30,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat gradually reached the port in scattered quantities. Arrivals were mostly cart wheat, because ship wheat transactions are not as convenient as cart wheat. On the sales side, the factories were silent, but fortunately, with the patronage of those on this street and domestic customers, the market has gradually recovered. Because the freight owners' costs are high, they mostly firmly insist on storage in godowns, waiting for good prices to sell. They are unwilling to sell off cheaply again. Yesterday, the market rebounded by 3 to 5 fen, and it is estimated that a total of more than 800 bags were sold to Danyang, Taicang, Kunshan, Nanjing, etc., at prices of 6.68 yuan to 6.55 yuan.

### The Hot Weather Makes It Easy for the Rice to Spoil; Rice Prices Fall More and More Sharply; Sales Are Limited to This Street

Du Geng: Since the concession authorities strictly ordered price limits and financial relations, the domestic rice market has been declining all the way. Yesterday, the downward trend was even stronger. In fact, hoarders saw that the market was only heading downward, and it was the summer season, so rice was difficult to hold for long. Furthermore, the banking industry would be closed for three days for settlements. The marketers were eager to sell quickly, mutually chasing each other, but sales were limited to this street, causing the market to fall more and more sharply. As a result, both thick and thin geng rice continued to fall by 2 to 3 jiao to 4 jiao.

Ke Geng: Yesterday, 2,000 to 3,000 bags of heads arrived. Hoarders still had sales. The market was originally soft, but inland groups, etc., heard that rice prices in the Hangzhou area had fallen sharply by 4 to 5 jiao, and their purchases became weak. In total, only 400 to 500 bags of rough rice were sold. There was no smooth movement among various households on this street. In total, no more than 3,000 bags were transacted, and market prices fell by 2 to 3 jiao. Those that had been stored for a long time and were generating heat fell by 3 to 4 jiao. However, Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice, although scarce in the market, were also affected by geng rice and fell by more than 2 jiao.

Foreign Rice: After the new Dingxi Huang No. 1 and No. 2 rice was verified, the atmosphere in the market had already changed. However, there is not much foreign rice floating on the current market. Gao Saigon is still asking for 23 yuan for delivery including freight, but buyers find the price low.

Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, the sentiment in the rice market changed, because its sales were weak, so it also fell by 2 jiao. Hong Kong glutinous rice was also weak, falling by 3 to 4 jiao, now opening at 19.6 yuan to 19.8 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Various Beans and Rice Each Have Their Own Sales Channels

Yesterday, most miscellaneous grain transactions were still in the real sales market. There was a slight increase in purchases by various groups due to the fact that the banking industry would be on holiday from July 1st for semi-annual settlements, so the market conditions for various grains remained stable. It is estimated that 200 bags of Dalian soybeans were sold (market prices are detailed in the market price section), 50 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 300 bags of Dingbai Pi beans, 260 bags of Wuhu Bai Pi beans, 100 bags of Chongming Runpian Bai Pi beans, 30 bags of Wuhu Mao peas, over 100 bags of Zhangjiakou beans, 80 bags of Chongming red beans, and over 90 bags of Chongming corn.

490 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Huizhou White Opening at a Weak 29 Yuan

According to foreign reports, there were no changes in the sugar markets of the Netherlands and Hong Kong. However, the London market continued to rise, with August rising by 0.75 to 8 shillings and 1.5 pence, December unchanged, and March of next year rising by 0.25 to 6 shillings and 3.75 pence. In the local Sugar Merchants Association's spot market, August fell by 0.2 jiao. Spot goods: Four Coarse White were originally priced at 19.2 yuan, 20.6 yuan at foreign warehouses, and the transshipment price for newly arrived goods rose to 20.8 yuan. Taikoo Armed White of the upper grade rose by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao, West Warehouse B Mark at 29 yuan, 200 bags were transacted, CW Mark at 28.8 yuan, CX Mark at 28.5 yuan, and DY and HX Marks were unchanged. The original prices were maintained for other Che Chi, He Chi, and local cotton white sugars. Yufeng Henghao opened trading on about 200 bags of Huizhou white sugar, with the higher price at 27.8 yuan to 27.4 yuan, and the next highest at 27.1 to 27.2 yuan. Yesterday, 100 bags of imported sugar came from Tianjin and 340 bags came from Beihai.

### Newspapers, Public Opinion, and Journalists

— Bai Ying

Some say that newspaper reporters are uncrowned kings, which may be too much flattery. However, this statement accurately reflects the importance of public opinion in modern society, and therefore the responsibility of newspaper reporters, who wield this important task, cannot be regarded as simply a cultural endeavor. Newspapers have become spiritual necessities for general society. A modern person, regardless of the degree of education they have received, may no longer read many books after leaving school due to their occupation or other reasons, but they rarely stop reading newspapers—regardless of whether they are interested in editorials or theater advertisements, political news or scandalous news. Even lower-class figures who are considered illiterate or semi-literate often want to hear "what the newspaper man is saying." (Based on my personal experience, progressive laborers are more enthusiastic about reading newspapers than the average person.)

Newspapers have become educational tools for the general public today—education that is far more meaningful than school education. A modern organized country has what is called a press policy. A political or social movement cannot succeed without the promotion of public opinion. The importance of newspapers in peacetime cannot be overstated, and the importance of newspapers in a wartime country is even greater—in other words, the responsibility of reporters is even greater. Modern warfare is so-called national power warfare. Whether it is material or spiritual power, all must be mobilized to participate in the war. Public opinion is a spiritual force that cannot be underestimated. The propaganda war between belligerent countries is mainly based on the war of public opinion. The scope of this war is even greater than the actual war's cannons and fire. This demonstrates the power of the pen, which is sometimes not only "like a knife" but also has influence surpassing a knife. The best evidence is the situation in Shanghai for the year and a half since the National Army left Shanghai. The fact that four million Shanghai citizens have always been loyal and righteous citizens of the Republic of China is attributable to the power of public opinion.

Although the job of a reporter has its position of honor, we know that the general living conditions of Chinese reporters are not good, and sometimes even inferior to ordinary occupations. I remember that Shen Bao published a "Visit to Mr. Feng Bingnan" not long ago, at the end of which there was a paragraph about Mr. Feng's concern for the life of reporters. He said that he had two wishes in his later years: one was to establish an organization to benefit the common people; the other was to set up an organization to care for the bereaved families of reporters. This shows that the life of a reporter is very hard, but the job is quite heavy. Precisely because of this, people without higher spiritual cultivation than technical qualifications cannot fulfill this task.

Writing this, looking back at the internal status of the Shanghai journalism world, there are many things to be happy about, but there are also many things that make people frown. Apart from the vulgar tabloids that specialize in teaching prostitution and theft (because there are also good small newspapers, so I specifically say vulgar tabloids), it is really hard to find a few satisfactory ones among the first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate major newspapers. Economic conditions are certainly an important reason, but the lack of correct understanding of the task itself by journalists is also a major reason. In my personal opinion, the lack of spiritual and academic cultivation of the reporters themselves is a major cause of the poverty of newspaper content. But this phenomenon is not enough to be pessimistic about. China is in transition, and Shanghai is a distorted society. Any legitimate undertaking has parasites. It is impossible to eradicate them all at once because of social conditions. We only hope that the official leaders and practitioners of the journalism world will mutually supervise and cooperate to prevent the dark forces from increasingly encroaching on the journalism world.

Finally, let me declare that this article is just a mix of suggestions and feelings and has absolutely no intention or effect of offending anyone—although the feelings are not without basis.

### Hurry

— Xu Qing

"Old Ling! Buck up! There's a village just beyond the bend!"

Two hairy arms were supporting me. I was dizzy and sweating, and the sweat was cold. My head was shaking, even though it was a hot summer.

White clouds were hiding in the corner of the western sky, and the fields were silent.

Climbing a low hill, crossing a mountain ridge, there was no sign of human habitation, not a drop of water.

"Old Liu! I'm about to fall!" I gasped, like a wounded wild dog.

"Old Ling! Don't worry, look at the source of light over there! There are houses where there's flowing water!"

I opened my half-unconscious eyes and looked. Two verdant peaks were lined up over there, and a silvery stream greeted the sun's high rays, sparkling.

"Then we have hope!" I smiled, and my spirits lifted, even though it was just a vague hope.

Old Liu was my comrade-in-arms of the last two years. He was a head taller than me, with broad shoulders and a wasp waist that almost formed a triangle. His whole body of purplish-black skin concealed a pure white soul. He could carry a wounded friend for dozens of miles, endure hunger to give the steamed bun to others, but he would pretend to be very calm and say, "No! I have enough!"

This mission asked us to hurry a long distance. The road was desolate enough. When I opened my eyes, there was only Old Liu and me. Under the blazing sun, under the guidance of the Big Dipper, we walked and walked and walked. We got countless blisters under our feet.

"Old Liu! I'm dizzy!" Finally, I fainted on the slope.

Water lapped at my chest and forehead, and I woke up again.

I drank a lot of water, drinking all of my water, and all of Old Liu's water.

"Old Ling! Buck up! There's a village just beyond the bend!"

I was dizzy and sweating, and the sweat was cold.

The sun was setting over the mountain corner, and the road was getting darker. A group of indigo traders came down the hill.

"Hey! Folks! Excuse me! Is there an inn?"

The leading man pointed and said, "Isn't that a collection of houses?"

"Great! Hope has finally been realized!"

Evening smoke rose behind the ridge.

### Wishing Everyone a Firm Footing

— Lun Ting

After the storm came, it hasn't left yet, on the contrary, its evil power is increasing. During this period, one careless move could lead to the danger of falling, or straying into a wrong path, walking into a trap.

The reason why evil forces are evil is something even a three-year-old child knows clearly. Unless someone is insane, or obsessed with wealth and doesn't care about excessive pampering, they would recognize the thief as their father, follow the evil forces, not only follow them but also fuel the flames and increase their power. For these people who willingly degenerate, we still hope that they will turn over a new leaf and correct their past mistakes. Otherwise, the law of the land and morality will naturally punish them.

Those who willingly degenerate are, of course, a minority. But we cannot deny that besides this minority, there are still many people who are panicked and whose footing is starting to shake as the evil forces intensify. I will risk being considered a bore and loudly proclaim: I wish everyone would stand firm!

Most young people are full of vigor. They may not recognize things truly at first, but once they do, they will resolutely persist to the end and never compromise. Now that they have recognized what the evil forces are, they will never be subdued by them. Therefore, besides praising and encouraging them, I am completely at ease and have nothing else to say.

I am somewhat less at ease about middle-aged people. Their understanding of things is certainly genuine, but most of them bear the responsibility of supporting their families. In the midst of this difficult life, they cannot rely on their own efforts to earn a living. In order to survive, they inevitably have to resort to drinking poison to quench their thirst. The path is truly dangerous. I wish they would make a firm decision not to be fooled, and if they are about to be fooled, they would pull back from the brink and turn back immediately! The most difficult are the elderly. Some have been frustrated all their lives and want to use this opportunity to vent their anger; others have forgotten the ancient teaching of "be wary of getting," and want to fill their insatiable desires. Of course, there are also those who are forced by the pressure of life. I want to tell them that this is a dead end. Not only will they not be able to vent their anger, but they will also leave behind a bad name for ten thousand years. They will absolutely not get rich this way; what is taken in must be taken out!

The evil forces of the storm are openly attacking us. We can only stand firm and resist desperately. Even if we cannot win in the short term, we will eventually achieve the final victory. Even if one or two people die trying, they will ultimately preserve the upright existence of the majority. We don't need to worry, as long as we stand firm! It seems that new blows are gradually coming, and some expected pressures may indeed appear. If we want to be human beings, people who are not ashamed before Heaven and not ashamed before others, we will stand firm, not surrender, and not compromise!

### Impelling Attack

### A Bundle of Messy Grass

Heroes

In the stories children read, the emphasized and glorified figures are always deified heroes. The young minds are filled with a colossal shadow. Truly flesh-and-blood warriors, on the other hand, seem rather blurred.

During the day, Xuanzi sang the lotus drop song: "Seeking heroes who save the country and protect the people." I showed him a photo of a warrior, but he wasn't interested, looking somewhat disappointed, as if it lacked the magic he had imagined.

Ever since I understood the sadness in the saying "One general achieves fame on ten thousand bones," I lost my wonder for heroes. Heroes who have lost their cause often meet with misfortune. At the end of the road, they can only sigh deeply, vainly crying out "Heaven is destroying me!" Didn't that unparalleled hero eventually die lonely on the island of Saint Helena?

We sing praises of the collective body, award the collective, the isolated individual is always insignificant. Join the collective, dedicate yourself to the collective, we are all heroes of the nation.

Now is the era of the collective.

### Untitled

— Jie Qi

Cannot hear the ticking of the clock, cannot see the sun racing by, the sky darkens, the sky brightens again.

Swallowing food hastily, rushing east and west, sweat beads covering the forehead; thus the road slips under the feet, all kinds of things escape from hands and minds, forgotten, blurred, leaving behind only sweat stains, and hurried breaths.

Sometimes, life can be as profound and mysterious as climbing high mountains, crossing steep ridges, wading through wide rivers, and traversing vast oceans, things that should be eternally engraved in the heart, but the still waters of consciousness gently carry away the wonders!

Finally, eating, rushing, and sweating in carefree ease!

Thus the rapid passage of time is welcomed and seen off in a daze.

Everyone will eventually awaken, and the more blurred things are, the sooner one will feel clear-headed and despise the past life.

I am no exception; I will also be very clear-headed. The future is a dead end; continuing to walk down it will become so narrow that there will be no room to stand.

The sweat stains have accumulated thickly, and the hurried breaths are almost suffocating; life is gradually growing old, and vision and mind are becoming duller day by day. The result will be an extremely tragic fate, and the road will be completely impassable.

I raise my hands and lift my feet, feeling that they still have some strength, enough for other actions.

While my mind can still be sharpened and my eyes can still see the distance, I will seek a new path and ponder how to move forward!

It seems that someone is waving to me again. Indeed, the bright road needs countless clear-headed young people to be witnesses and leaders, as long as their feet move forward!

Hearing the ticking of the clock, seeing the sun racing by, the sky darkens, the sky brightens. Every minute and every second has the value of life!

Spring and Autumn

### Visiting Tongue Painting Expert Huang Ernan

— Lan Yan

Tomorrow at Aurora University, Painting Exhibition Held, 5 to 6 PM On-Site Tongue Painting Performance

Tongue painting expert Huang Ernan has arrived in Shanghai and has been staying for half a month. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the Shanghai art community specially welcomed him at the Xin Ya Tea Room on Nanjing Road, and I had the opportunity to chat with him for half an hour.

The location where I met him was Room 304 of the China Hotel. Also present were his two female disciples.

Speaking with a fluent Beijing accent and sporting a short mustache on his lips, his face was very ruddy and his voice was loud. He said that he was already 56 years old this year, and his spirit was much worse than before. A painting eight feet long used to be completed within two hours, but now it must be painted in two days. Indeed, this thing is too tiring.

Mr. Huang asked his female disciples to unfold an eight-foot-long tongue painting for us to see. The bamboo and rocks painted on it were created using three inches of an imperishable tongue to paint the bamboo leaves and stones. This is indeed an arduous task.

Now, I will write down the details of Mr. Huang's speech here.

Three Difficulties of Tongue Painting

Regarding the specialized technique of "tongue painting," Mr. Huang said that it is not an easy task. Those who do not have a deep understanding of traditional Chinese painting cannot start.

First: When painting, one relies on a burst of energy, a mouthful of air held in the mouth. Without this air, one cannot paint anything.

Second: When the tongue is painting, the eyes are only an inch away from the paper, and the eyes are no longer effective. At this time, you can only keep a rough draft on the painting surface, otherwise you won't know where to start.

Third: When painting, the head must not only move up and down, but also swing left and right. If the spirit is not good, you will immediately feel dizzy.

Based on these points, you can know the difficulty of "tongue painting."

How to Paint Tongue Painting?

The method of tongue painting and the prior preparations are very simple, according to Mr. Huang. First, rinse your mouth with brandy, then fill your mouth with ink, and wave the three-inch tongue tip on the prepared paper or silk.

I asked Mr. Huang how to handle colored paintings. Mr. Huang said that the colors he uses are all Chinese pigments, so there is no problem when painting. Only one yellow color (knee yellow) is toxic, so it cannot be ingested. When he was in Beijing, a doctor at Peking Union Medical College gave him a non-toxic yellow color, but unfortunately this pigment has been used up and a substitute pigment cannot be found for the time being.

Served as Cavalry Brigade Commander

Mr. Huang left Beijing after the "July 7th" incident. His family is still in Beijing. When he left Beijing in a hurry after the incident, he only carried sixty yuan for travel expenses. But along the way, in places such as Datong, Southern Jin, Xi'an, Chengdu, all the way to Kunming, then to Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai, the amount he painted in Xi'an and Chengdu for disaster relief children and various school scholarships totaled more than four thousand yuan, while his own travel expenses totaled six thousand yuan.

Mr. Huang advocates painting more for disaster relief children, but in the inland, especially under the fierce air raids, who is still interested in buying paintings? But for the sake of friends, artists, art and drama in various places, the introduction is considered to contribute a bit of strength to the country.

Two Exhibition Painting Societies

Mr. Huang was in Shanghai eleven years ago. On the surface, Shanghai does not seem to have changed much. Old friends in Shanghai, such as Liu Yazi from the former Southern Society, have not yet met. Many Chinese and Western painters in Shanghai met yesterday, and he was very happy.

Although he has been in Shanghai for half a month, he rarely goes out. Mainly, he is rushing to paint fifty paintings for Aurora University, which are to be used for an exhibition to be held on July 1st. Mr. Huang is also preparing to personally perform "tongue painting," with the time being from 5 to 6 PM. The income from the ticket sales and the purchase of paintings will be used for the Aurora University "Scholarship."

After the Aurora exhibition ends, Mr. Chu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng are preparing to hold an exhibition for Mr. Huang at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and half of the income will be allocated to disaster relief children. However, the date has not yet been determined.

Regarding his own experience in learning tongue painting, it has been more than ten years. He began learning in 1928. In the early days, the subjects he painted were bamboo and rocks, and later he painted flowing water, flowers, and birds.

He himself had always lived a military life in the army, and he once served as a cavalry brigade commander. It seems very interesting that a soldier transformed into an expert in "tongue painting."

Two Novel Paintings

Yesterday, he painted two very novel paintings in the hotel. The painting method is to use the colors of the petals and branches of flowers to paint the original flowers (using fingers). For example, when painting roses, use rose petals and rose branches and leaves to paint, without using other colors. The painted roses are still purple-red roses, and the green branches and leaves are still the original colors.

Fortunately, Mr. Huang's exhibition will open tomorrow. Those who like to admire Mr. Huang's tongue paintings may wish to visit Aurora University.

### Mr. Huang Ernan's "Tongue Painting"

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 13: Encouraging Learning, Storing Talent for the Country; Retaining the Strong, Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Field.

At this time, Zhu Ai'ren asked: "Father! (The Suzhou people's term for 'village head') You said that our visit today to open a factory is the third one. Who are the other two? We don't know." Village head Zhu said: "You are busy with hospital matters all day long, so naturally you don't know. The first one was already signed for a land lease half a year ago, and the factory building has already been built. That is a paper mill, but it is not large-scale. If it were to produce the kind of paper for newspapers, such as web paper, it would require a large scale and large capital. This small place is not enough to use. Don't we have a paper mill in Lan Yu, Zhejiang, that specializes in making web paper? This one here is small-scale. I heard that their capital is only 500,000 yuan. They are semi-mechanized and semi-manual, specializing in making daily-use paper products, using bamboo and wood waste as raw materials, and selling them to the inland. Now China uses more and more paper. In the past, much of it was foreign paper, and imports were really high every year. Now many of our paper products are made domestically, which recovers a lot. The most ridiculous thing is that we used to see too many imported goods, and we also clamored to boycott foreign goods and promote domestic goods. We wrote slogans and distributed leaflets, making a lot of noise. But on closer inspection, the pens and paper used for writing slogans and distributing leaflets were foreign goods, wasn't that ridiculous? Now that factory focuses on daily-use paper, half of which is made by hand. I very much agree, because China has so many people, and manual labor must be vigorously promoted." The two Miss He listened with great interest and said: "Then Freedom Village will open many factories in the future, because the water and land transportation here is very convenient!" Village head Zhu shook his head and said: "That's not possible! For this matter, we have held several meetings in the village. One resolution was that within ten years, Freedom Village is not allowed to build more than ten factories. Moreover, these factories must all belong to light industry, and the establishment of each factory must be reviewed by our village to see if it is harmful to the village. Because recently, many factories, even though they are light industry, still harm the local area. For example, they are chemical industries. Are these chemical materials toxic? How do they discharge waste? If the discharged waste is toxic and flows into the water, is it harmful to the villagers? Also, how can the villagers not find the smoke from the chimneys annoying? And the sound of the machines, rumbling all day long. And if business is good, and the factory works overnight, will it disturb the villagers' sleep? All of these must be considered." (149)

### Punishing Another Kind of Criminal

— Mei Qiao

A robber who steals is punished, but now there are many people whose acts of robbery go unpunished.

When a landlord rents out a house, they charge a key money; when a sub-landlord transfers a house, they collude with the big landlord's accounting office and demand a large transfer fee; especially a sub-landlord, who rents a house for fifty yuan, charges sixty yuan for the entire floor. The concession authorities restrict rent increases, but the restrictions only apply to the big landlords, while the sub-landlords openly extort, evict tenants, and force rent increases, as if they live in a society without any laws, because they have not been punished.

It should be pointed out that those who are exploited by them are all from the middle and lower classes. Half or even most of their income is used for rent. Which society has such a distorted image? The landlords are guilty of obtaining property by fraud, but not only are they not punished, but they themselves seem to be the judges, able to arbitrarily force rent increases or evict tenants.

Now, who will speak for the countless tenants in Shanghai who rent three or four rooms? Of course, this responsibility should be borne by the authorities of the two concessions. At present, an organization should be established to specifically solve the rent problem, so that the suffering of the tenants can be redressed, and the social thieves, those open robbers, can be punished. We have seen many cases of fighting, murder, and litigation over rent issues. Now that the standard of living is becoming higher and higher, the landlords are becoming more and more ruthless. We should also have a "safety first" campaign in this regard. We believe that this "safety" is more important than "safety" on the road, more concerning to the majority of people, and more beneficial to the security and order of the two concessions.

### "I Love Sailors"

— Qi Hua

"Give me a sailor"

This Diane Davis, second only to Martha Lambeth, seems to have won the Miss Legs competition last year. Therefore, in "I Love Sailors," this "Thirteen O'Clock" Miss is not only able to sing and make noise, but the director also wears "Won the National Miss Legs Competition," special leg close-ups, etc. From this starting point, the content of "I Love Sailors" can be imagined.

We have seen many films about "military discipline," although they are all the same, praising the solemnity of military schools and encouraging young people to serve the country, this solemn theme is still worthy of praise, such as "A Patriot's Heart," which writes about a military doctor who fled during a war, and later felt ashamed to see his son who was studying at a military school. This contrasting writing is enough to encourage people's hearts, and make people with white powder on their noses feel ashamed, right?

But when it comes to movies about "sailor" life, it's either "song and dance" or "fooling around." This "I Love Sailors" is a comical love affair between a pair of brothers and a pair of sisters that unfolds from sliding down the muzzle of a navy gun. In fact, Martha Lambeth is an actress who can act. If the screenwriter and director can abandon this "business eye" that is not a "business eye," and give her an opportunity to fully act.

### "Children's Debt"

"Boy Trouble"

Parents with many children are often envied as "blessed," while parents humbly say "they are all debt collectors"! From this, it can be seen that Chinese people all regard their children as a kind of private "property."

Although "Children's Debt" does not directly address this issue, it satirizes treating children as private property to some extent. After Homer and Wendy had a conflict, Wendy believed that Homer was anxious about his son. And Homer's wife went to the orphanage to bring Zoe back, which gave Homer even more trouble; however, Homer finally adopted them.

Because of the decision of the role of Chili Rogers, the director purely wrote "Children's Debt" as a comedy; however, the plain narration makes the whole play seem very loose.

Chili Rogers' Homer cannot be said to be bad. Both children can also act.

Random Memories of Mei Bian, Part Four (II)

During the meal, whatever we needed, this waiter would translate for us. He also told us about the local customs and conditions of Vladivostok without hesitation. After the meal, we became more and more spirited! From the naming of the selected hotel (Chelyuskin is the name of an exploration ship) to talk about Arctic exploration, from exploration to talk about the forests of Northwest Siberia, from the forests to talk about the development of collective farms and industry, and then to the Five-Year Plan, and then to the world situation, from the world situation to suddenly change course and talk about China's problems, especially the problems between China and Japan, as if counting family treasures! Talking eloquently like a river bursting its banks! We talked for more than eleven hours. Only then did we disperse in high spirits. Unexpectedly, on the first night of arriving in Russia, we had "the first lesson of the Soviet." Group member Guo Jun Jianying thought that Soviet education was too developed! An ordinary employee actually knew so much! But I suspect, I suspect that he is a secret detective from the International Police Agency, and I am afraid he is also a propagandist! Mr. Yu Youren also said: "The Russians appoint those who are specially trained in their party to entertain tourists and journalists." So we decided to treat ourselves as radios, listening with our ears, but not uttering a word.

From the time Mr. Mei arrived in the Soviet Union until he left, a staff member of the Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries was dispatched to entertain him. In Mr. Mei's car, there was even a "bodyguard," a burly and taciturn man who only spoke his native language. As for English, German, and Chinese, he said he did not understand any of them. Readers! Did he really not speak foreign languages? No! He not only spoke English, French, and German, but also spoke Chinese and Mandarin perfectly! How did we discover this? Before Mr. Mei left Moscow, because he had been following him day and night, protecting him closely, Mr. Mei wanted to give him some money as a reward for his spirit, but he refused to accept it! At the same time, he asked Mr. Mei to give him a signed photo and books about Chinese drama. At this time, he spoke very fluent Chinese, saying "Thank you!" very smoothly! Mr. Mei was greatly surprised! He asked him: "Have you been to China? Why do you speak such good Chinese?" He, this mysterious bodyguard, replied "smiling without saying a word."

When we were in the Soviet Union (spring of 1935), the Trotskyites and the so-called "red turnips" had not yet been completely purged (the red turnip has a red skin and a white inside, used to represent "the White Russians who superficially obey the Soviets." These people were mostly in Siberia, all exiled there. When our train passed through Siberia, the curtains had to be drawn to prevent attacks. But in the process of going back and forth, we were still unable to avoid being greeted by bricks twice, almost hitting the bright head of the great musician Xu Lanyuan. Since the strict purge last year, this situation may no longer exist.) Therefore, Mr. Mei's car had to have a bodyguard to avoid endangering the distinguished guest. At the same time, it may have also been intended to monitor, to see what the initial comments of foreigners on socialism were. (The Soviets deeply understand that "comments in front of the face" are mostly false, and "comments behind the back" are the truth.) In fact, the impression we got at ordinary times (mainly with Minju drama) was that one or two out of ten were debatable, and eight or nine out of ten were commendable. Therefore, no matter how strict their dispatched detectives were, we asked ourselves that we had nothing to feel guilty about.

### As I Heard It: Yan Jupeng

— Only Me

Of today's "Laosheng" performers of the Li school, only Yan Jupeng and Tan Fuying remain, as Shu Dang's voice is ailing, and Shuang Kui is deceased. While Tan Fuying is undoubtedly good, judging by experience and skill, he seems inferior to Yan Jupeng. Therefore, Yan Jupeng is esteemed as the sole authentic Tan school Laosheng of recent times. Yan Jupeng transitioned from an amateur to a professional, achieving his current level of artistry through diligent effort. Here, I briefly recount his early history to supplement the lacking details in the article "Farewell to Poverty, Welcome to Prosperity."

Yan Jupeng's original name was [blank], and he was the direct great-grandson of Song Wenqing Gong Jun of the late Qing Dynasty. He had two brothers, and Yan Jupeng was the youngest. From a young age, he was fond of Peking Opera. In the second year of the Republic, he worked at [blank], where he befriended Tong Hu'ai (Bo Xiyuan). He sought advice from Tong Wu, eventually becoming his student. The first play he learned was "Battle of Puguan," marking the beginning of Yan Jupeng's artistic training. At the time, Lao Tan (Xinpei) was performing in the old capital, and Yan Jupeng never missed a performance, regardless of the weather. If he lacked the money for a ticket, he would borrow from friends, determined to understand everything. His deep fascination with Lao Tan is evident. Yan Jupeng listened to Lao Tan's performances with extraordinary focus, memorizing the lyrics and gestures of each play. He would then seek advice from Tong Wu, who sometimes consulted Qian Duofu, Wang Changlin, and Wang Yaoqing to provide guidance, as these two Wangs and Qian had all previously performed with Lao Tan. Yan Jupeng greatly benefited from the guidance of Qian and the Wangs. Around 1917 or 1918, Chen Yanheng lived in old Beijing and became close friends with Yan Jupeng. Chen asked about the most insightful studies of Tan's art, and Yan Jupeng's skills were already quite developed. With Chen Yanheng's explanations of the plays, his artistry greatly improved. At that time, Yan Jupeng occasionally made guest appearances as an amateur (the posters would say "Mr. Yan Jupeng"), which caused a sensation in the nine cities of Beijing. The northerners often referred to Yan Jupeng as "the second Lao Tan." Yan Jupeng first came to Shanghai more than ten years ago, the same year Mei (Lanfang) and Cheng (Yanqiu) were both performing there. Yan Jupeng came with Lanfang. Although the posters still read "Mr. Yan Jupeng," he had actually been officially hired.

There was a time when Yan Jupeng was incredibly popular, but his popularity led to a change in his voice. The reasons for this were twofold: first, failed speculation in public bonds, where wealth and fate intertwined, causing Yan Jupeng excessive stress; second, indulgence in vices, which ruined his voice. In addition, he experienced many family problems, causing his once-great voice to deteriorate. Yan Jupeng, out of necessity, developed what became known as the "Yan style." While the "Yan style" was welcomed by some, it was ultimately less valuable than the "authentic Tan school," leading to Yan Jupeng's disappointment in recent years, with his reputation and status falling behind Tan Shiying, Ma Lianliang, and others.

Now, Yan Jupeng has long abandoned all vices, and his voice has regained the quality it had ten years ago. Yan Jupeng has studied Tan's style for nearly thirty years and can be considered one of the most insightful students of Tan's school in recent times. Although his appearance is not ideal and his martial arts skills are somewhat lacking, his hand gestures, eye movements, body postures, and footwork are all excellent. In particular, his clear enunciation and precise pronunciation are unmatched by others. Yan Jupeng will perform at the Golden Stage tonight. I write this article as a message to those who support Yan Jupeng, hoping he can truly inherit the mantle of the Tan school, which would not only ensure the continuation of Tan's legacy but also be good news for the audience.

### Recent News from the Storytelling Theaters

— Jin Xiu

Business in general is sluggish. Summer is traditionally a "slow month" for storytelling theaters, so many of them have a practice of "summer closure." Because the costs of running a storytelling theater are low, and the facilities are generally simple and inadequate, there is little air conditioning or electric fans (and even if there are, the number of installations is definitely not large). Listeners are reluctant to sit in the stuffy, hot stalls. Therefore, business declines to some extent every summer. Currently, in Shanghai's storytelling theaters, it is rare to see even seventy percent of the seats filled, and the evening performances are even emptier. The "Huyuan" evening performances have been suspended, and "Yiyuan" has been forced to switch to performing "Women's Literary Drama." Even the leader of the storytelling theaters, Quan Quan, has had to reduce the number of performances and shorten the time. However, there is another major reason for the particularly bleak business in the storytelling theaters this summer, and that is the high cost of goods and the rising cost of living. Most of those who frequent storytelling theaters are from the lower and middle classes, and they feel the financial strain and have to economize. As a result, they visit storytelling theaters less often.

The whereabouts of Huang Yian: Huang Yian is famous for singing "Romance of the West Chamber" in storytelling theaters. Since the suicide of Zhu Lan'an of Yushan, who was also involved in the [blank] affair, Yi'an is the only one left who performs "Romance of the West Chamber." Because something rare is valuable, Huang has had great success and became famous for a time. Recently, he suddenly "cut his shows" at all the venues where he was performing, and his whereabouts are mysterious, with conflicting reports. Some say he is ill, some say he has opened a gambling den and become rich, and some even suspect he is involved in a romantic affair. Old listeners, because they value "Romance of the West Chamber," cannot help but be concerned about Huang's whereabouts.

Wen Suchen quietly leaves Shanghai: Wen Suchen, who was active in the entertainment circles of Shanghai, was originally a popular figure. Whether in Peking Opera or Yue Opera venues, he was warmly welcomed by audiences everywhere. A film company even planned to adapt his stories into films, making him extremely popular for a time. However, Tang Zailiang's storytelling performances of "Wen Suchen" at the "Huyuan" and "Yiyuan" storytelling theaters have been met with resistance everywhere, and they are not well-received by the audience. He was even met with boos and jeers. Wen Suchen could not bear this humiliation and had to quietly leave Shanghai to seek other opportunities.

### Yuan Meiyun Resurfaces

Yuan Meiyun has a long history in the film industry. However, the film she starred in that was most popular, needless to say, everyone knows was "The Girl Incarnate" in 1936. Because Yuan Meiyun played the role of a young man, cutting off her hair and wearing a suit, it caused a sensation in the city. It was truly a unique play, especially with the addition of the treasures Han Lan'gen and Guan Anda. The film was particularly outstanding, and the audience welcomed it even more. So, the following year, Yuan Meiyun filmed "The Girl Incarnate Sequel," and the situation was even more enthusiastic. Everyone knew about it, and everyone enjoyed watching it. Yuan Meiyun could not stop. This year, she had to resurface to meet everyone's expectations. Now, "The Girl Incarnate Part 3" is being screened at the New Light Theater, and the materials in "Part 3" are particularly rich. So it's really a must-see.

### A Ying Rewrites "Sleepless City"

"Sleepless City," written by A Ying, was previously performed by the Qingdao Theater Company at the New Light Theater, and the box office results were quite good. However, A Ying felt that there were many places in the script that still needed to be enriched and revised. Now, at the invitation of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Amateur Association's "Bao Lian" drama troupe, he has decided to rewrite it, preparing for the Bao Lian troupe to perform it in the Shanghai vocational industry's drama charity performance.

The Bao Lian troupe, because some members did not have time to rehearse in the evenings, withdrew from "The True Story of Ah Q" and planned to stage another play to participate in the charity performance. After selecting several scripts, they finally decided to perform "Sleepless City," and asked A Ying for his consent to rewrite it. The directing will also be the responsibility of A Ying, who will hire [someone] or perhaps Chen Xihe, or maybe he will do it himself. The script is currently being rushed, and it can be completed by the end of the month.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The reason is that they all have a foundation in Peking Opera, and about 90 percent of the plays they know are Peking Opera. Studying three or five Kunqu operas is just a way to show off their broad knowledge. How can they compare to Mr. Xiyuan, who has studied no less than a hundred Kunqu operas, so of course his pronunciation is exceptionally accurate. Some people say: "Although Elder Pu is proficient in both Kunqu and Peking Opera, Kunqu is superior to Peking Opera." Whether this is true or not, I dare not say, because I have rarely seen Mr. Pu perform. Now, the old actors in the Pear Garden are almost gone. The old masters are no longer to be seen. Mr. Xiyuan is not only a precious treasure, but also a unique mentor for both insiders and outsiders. Because he knows so much and is proficient in so much, and he is capable in both civil and martial roles in Kunqu and Peking Opera. If you really want to work hard to study opera in order to succeed in the future, who else can you ask for guidance if you abandon this good mentor?

Film Companies Should Invite Shang Heyu to Make a Film

Before the July 7th Incident, the Central Cultural Association had a proposal to invite the martial arts master Yang Xiaolou to make a film. The proposal was unanimously approved. If the war had not broken out, the Central Film Studio would have sent people north to contact Yang and implement the plan. The reason for the proposal was that the domestic costume dramas have been praised by Chinese and foreign audiences in recent years. At the same time, Yang's long-robe plays, such as "Changban Slope," "Farewell My Concubine," "Picking the Carriage," and "Iron Dragon Mountain," are all works that represent the ancient Chinese heroes and generals. After filming, they can not only be kept as models for future students, but also be transported to foreign countries and Southeast Asia for screening, so that foreign ladies can also learn about Chinese drama art on the screen. As for the demeanor of the ancient Chinese generals, only Yang Xiaolou can perform it well enough to express it. Unfortunately, this plan was not realized, and Yang has already passed away, which is a great regret. Fortunately, Mr. Shang Heyu, who is on par with Yang, is still alive. In terms of his art, apart from his voice and appearance being slightly inferior to Xiaolou, his martial arts skills are likely to be more skillful and refined than Yang's. Although he is older, he has no vices, so he is getting stronger in his old age. —— (Forty-nine) ——

### Completion of Renji Hospital

Renji Hospital has been rebuilt on its old site with a large compound that has been completed. This hospital is elaborately arranged, with a large hall downstairs, 39 feet long and 29 feet wide, to accommodate the many outsiders who come to seek treatment. There is a reception hall, a consultation room, a fire pit, and three wards, each with twelve beds, upstairs, altogether accommodating seventy patients. The rooms are tall and spacious, the walls are strong and thick, and the orientation is south-facing, warm in winter and cool in summer, which is much better than Chinese houses. The construction cost a total of 5,500 taels of silver, which was raised from Chinese and Western merchants. By the end of last year, 4,597 taels of silver had been donated. After including the costs of purchasing equipment, there is still a shortage of 2,000 taels of silver. The list will be presented to Western benefactors, as well as Chinese benefactors, such as Supervisor Shen and Mr. Feng, the director of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau, silver firms, and silk and tea guilds, each of whom will receive a copy. Dr. Joanneson, the Western doctor in the hospital, contributed the most to this project, and his earnest efforts helped to make this great undertaking a success, which is admirable! Dr. Joanneson does not take credit for his success, but praises his Chinese physician, Chunfu, saying that he is skilled in Western medicine, does not refuse hard work, and has greatly assisted in the hospital's affairs.

### New Western Theater

A new theater built by Westerners is located on Macau Road, not far from Suzhou Creek, and is now completed. This theater is larger than both the Jinkui and Dangkui theaters, and is very clean. It has two floors of seating, and the chairs are comfortable. Behind the stage, the area is large, and under the stage is the place for the musicians. In Western theaters, no one is seen on stage except the actors. And there are several screens on the stage to block the back of the stage, so when acting, whether a house or a street scene, it is made by pulling the screens with ropes, and the scene is like a painting. The new theater is complete and well-equipped, which is pleasing to the eye.
