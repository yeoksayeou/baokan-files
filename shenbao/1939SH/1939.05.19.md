### Japan’s Demand to Amend Shanghai Land Regulations Sternly Rejected by U.S. Government; U.S. Urges Return of Area North of Suzhou Creek to Municipal Council; British, American, and French Navies Jointly Land on Gulangyu; Majority of Japanese Troops Withdraw, Public Confidence Restored

(Washington) – The U.S. State Department yesterday officially rejected Japan’s request to amend the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement. The American note, delivered to Tokyo by Ambassador Grew, stated that this issue cannot be considered until the situation returns to stability. The note further declared that, given the abnormal circumstances created by Japan’s military aggression in China, no satisfactory resolution of Settlement matters can be achieved at present between the United States and Japan. The note not only warned Japan against exploiting this turbulent season to undermine the internationally governed Settlement, but also urged Japan to return the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Settlement Municipal Council. It stated:

“Regarding any necessary amendments to the Land Regulations, the United States, as in the past, is prepared to engage in friendly and systematic formal negotiations. However, the United States must point out that Shanghai’s current condition is far from normal, and thus there is fundamentally no basis for fair and comprehensive discussion of these complex issues by the parties concerned.”

The note continued:

“The Settlement authorities have endeavored to carry out their normal peacetime duties, but the Japanese military authorities’ refusal to restore the area north of Suzhou Creek to Settlement control, along with unlawful activities in areas adjacent to the Settlement, has severely hampered the Council’s ability to perform its functions. The United States again urges Japan to consider that, by acknowledging the excellent work of the Settlement authorities and returning full jurisdiction over the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Council, the efficiency of the Settlement administration would invariably be enhanced. In short, the United States observes that the development of the Shanghai Settlement has largely depended on the dedicated efforts of expatriate communities of various nations for the public good. In this development, the Settlement occupies a critically important position; therefore, anything that affects the Settlement’s status and welfare will also affect a majority of nations, the United States included. Regarding amendments to the Land Regulations, the United States believes that discussion must await a generally more stable period.”

It is also reported on authority that, concerning Japan’s demand for greater governing authority within the Settlement, Secretary of State Hull has been in communication with Ambassador Grew and U.S. Consul‑General Gauss in Shanghai. It is said that, before this note was delivered to Tokyo, the United States had been in contact with other concerned powers. It is expected that Britain’s reply to Japan will be substantively identical to the American note, stating that, in view of the abnormal military circumstances resulting from Japan’s aggression in China, now is not the time to amend the Land Regulations.

Secretary of State Hull

(Hong Kong) – According to Japanese sources in Xiamen today, most Japanese troops on Gulangyu withdrew several hours before the British, American, and French naval landings. Only a small detachment remains on the island’s Settlement. The island’s Chinese and foreign residents, relieved by the arrival of Allied forces, now feel secure. The few Japanese troops still stationed in the Settlement have gradually concentrated around the Japanese‑run hospital. Reports indicate that the number of British and American Marines who landed on Gulangyu matched the number of Japanese troops remaining. The Anglo‑American landing took place at 6 p.m. yesterday, and the French cruiser Bading arrived later and sent troops ashore at midnight. Observers note that this swift joint action by the British, American, and French navies has transformed Gulangyu’s status from perilous to secure, a development that will significantly influence Japanese policy toward the Shanghai International Settlement going forward. (18th, Associated Press)

(Washington) – The U.S. government has recently informed the Japanese government that it rejects Japan’s current request to revise the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement and to alter the status of the Chinese courts within the Settlement, and it has asked Japan to hand back to the Settlement Municipal Council the areas north of Suzhou Creek currently occupied by Japanese forces.

Foreign Warships Concentrate at Gulangyu

Gulangyu – Of the two hundred Japanese sailors who landed here last Friday, most had withdrawn by nightfall, and only forty‑two remained this morning. At 6 p.m. last night, forty‑two sailors each from Britain, America, and France landed here, matching the number of Japanese troops still present. Before the Allied landings, Admiral Noble, commander of the British China fleet, had warned the Japanese that if their troops did not immediately withdraw, British forces would also go ashore, declaring that there could be no arbitrary changes to Gulangyu’s statutes or its Municipal Council. Yesterday, two destroyers also arrived offshore. Present here are one British cruiser, three British destroyers, one American cruiser, one American destroyer, and one French cruiser—international warships now assembled on the island. (18th, Reuters)

The Zilin Daily reports that on Tuesday, British China fleet commander Admiral Noble arrived at Gulangyu aboard the cruiser Birmingham and will remain indefinitely to observe developments. Noble was originally scheduled to reach Shanghai on the 19th but has since delayed his arrival. Meanwhile, the cruiser Touseisha, set to depart Shanghai shortly after Birmingham’s arrival, will remain in port until the Admiral leaves Gulangyu for Shanghai. Other sources indicate Admiral Noble will stay on Gulangyu for two days before proceeding by ship from Xiamen to Shanghai.

U.S. Far East Policy Turns Proactive

(New York) – Reports in local papers state that the U.S. government has sternly rejected Japan’s demand to increase the number of Japanese representatives on the Settlement Municipal Council. The rejection note, delivered yesterday by Ambassador Grew, is this morning’s focus. These papers link it to the Anglo‑American landings at Xiamen—viewed as the first step in an “active American Far East policy” and a demonstration that Britain and the United States have already taken joint action to safeguard their common interests in the region. (18th, Havas)

Surprise Expressed in Tokyo

(Tokyo) – Today, Foreign Ministry officials declined to predict the next Japanese military move regarding the Settlement, while a naval spokesperson expressed astonishment at the sudden Anglo‑American‑French landings on Gulangyu. Although the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on future operations, it is understood that Washington’s opposition to Japan’s proposed amendments to the Settlement’s Land Regulations will have the following consequences: (1) Japan will hesitate before sending troops into other foreign concessions in China; (2) Japan may renew efforts to conclude military pacts with European powers; (3) Japan will reproach the Western powers for failing to understand Japan’s objectives in China. Today, Foreign Minister Matsuoka informed the British Ambassador, Sir Robert Craigie, that the Japanese landing on Gulangyu was an emergency measure to protect Japanese residents and that the troops would soon be withdrawn. The same assurance was given in Japan’s formal reply to Britain’s protest. The naval spokesperson said he was surprised by the Allies’ sudden landing, noting that last year Japanese forces had also landed there without provoking any protest from Britain, France, or the United States. He declared the Allied action “unnecessary” and reiterated that last year, between May 22 and July 31, Japanese naval troops had landed on Gulangyu without any protest from foreign consuls. He insisted the current operation was purely a security measure and saw no link between it and Japan’s demands to amend the Land Regulations or reorganize the Municipal Council. (18th, Associated Press)

(Tokyo) – Naval spokesperson Kanazawa, responding today to questions about the Gulangyu affair, admitted that before the Marines landed, Japanese residents on the island had neither been attacked nor suffered property damage. He claimed the Japanese Navy viewed the Allied landing as an emergency self‑defense measure but saw no need for Britain or the United States to take similar action. He said he could not understand why Japan’s actions on Gulangyu should provoke such alarm abroad, since last year, when Japanese troops also landed there, no protest was raised. (18th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) – Last night, the Foreign Ministry sent its reply to Britain’s protest over the Japanese landing on Gulangyu to the British Embassy; the contents have not yet been made public. (18th, Reuters)

Favorable Impression Among Chinese

(Chongqing) – The resolute stance taken by the great powers over the Gulangyu incident has left a very positive impression on the Chinese here. It shows (1) that the great powers will not be intimidated by Japanese threats and will adopt even firmer measures in future negotiations with Japan; (2) that a steadfast position by the powers will cause Japan to retract. This morning’s editorial in the Chongqing United Daily states that Japan is gradually stripping away the rights of foreigners in China, aiming to eliminate them entirely. It is clear that to safeguard their interests, the great powers must employ forceful measures—any conciliation or concession would merely encourage further Japanese advances. (18th, Reuters)

U.S. State Department Issues Communiqué

(Washington) – Today, the State Department issued a communiqué explaining the current situation on Gulangyu, stating: (1) At 6 p.m. local time, the naval authorities of Britain and the United States each decided to deploy a small Marine detachment to land on the island to protect the Settlement; (2) the American cruiser Marblehead and destroyer Palmart, and the British cruiser Birmingham and three destroyers, are all stationed at Xiamen; (3) the Japanese naval landing force, which numbered 150 when it went ashore on the 11th, has now been reduced to forty-two. (17th, Havas)

(Washington) – According to the State Department’s statement last night, fearing that the Japanese might seek to occupy the International Settlement and cause unrest, the U.S. Navy landed forces on Gulangyu yesterday to protect American lives and property. The landing force was not large. The Marblehead and Palmart are both now anchored at Xiamen. (18th, Associated Press)

(London) – Reuters has learned from the British Admiralty that British, French, and American warships at Xiamen each landed forty-two Marines on the Settlement at Gulangyu, matching the number of Japanese troops already ashore. (17th, Reuters)

Hull Addresses Reporters

(Washington) – Concerning Japan’s request to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that he could not reveal the contents of the Japanese proposal, which the State Department is reviewing. A reply will be issued shortly. The same reply will apply to both the Shanghai and Xiamen (Gulangyu) Settlements. Meanwhile, officials here say the State Department is consulting with Ambassador Grew in Tokyo and Consul‑General Gauss in Shanghai to draft its response, and is maintaining contact with other governments involved. (17th, Havas)

(Washington) – Secretary Hull stated today that, regarding the Shanghai Settlement, the Department is preparing a note to Japan in reply to its request to increase the number of Japanese members on the Municipal Council. The contents of the note are not being disclosed, but informed sources say that the United States is already in consultation with Britain and France on this matter. (17th, Reuters)

Zilin Daily’s Commentary on the Gulangyu Incident

Since the Gulangyu affair, Western newspapers in Shanghai have published editorials condemning Japanese actions. Even the measured Zilin Daily has strongly voiced its opinion. In a short commentary titled “Reaction to Gulangyu,” translated in yesterday’s Japanese papers, the Daily criticized Japan’s demands. Yesterday it ran a full editorial titled “The Gulangyu Incident,” from which we translate the following excerpts:

At the time of writing, there was no sign that the situation on Gulangyu had improved. Japan had sent armed forces to land on the island, placing the Municipal Settlement effectively under Japanese military control, and had presented five demands aimed at placing municipal administration entirely in Japanese hands. Judging from Japan’s proposals of May 14 to the Settlement Municipal Council, these demands were the result of deliberate calculation. The Council’s reply—which we understand Japan could not accept—simply stated that, according to the Land Regulations forming the basis of the Settlement, the Council could not comply with Japan’s proposed changes. Given all the facts, this was the only stance the Council could justly adopt. If Japan’s demands were fully accepted, it would amount to handing over to Japan the rights and special privileges assigned to the International Settlement and converting an administration of an international character into one solely under Japanese control. Although the number of other foreign representatives on the Municipal Council would remain unchanged, in practice Council resolutions would be executed only by Japanese officials.

Any guarantees Japan now makes about avoiding interference with third‑party rights ring hollow in light of these demands. Foreigners in Chinese treaty ports enjoy clear and defined rights, including membership in international bodies to manage their own affairs. Any infringement on these rights is an unwarranted interference with the interests of foreigners, and Japan’s actions clearly seek to curtail these rights.

While wartime inevitably brings incidental impacts on neutrals, the present case is different: it rests entirely on the use of force to alter rights that have long been legally established, with no plausible justification. This is something we must keep in mind: Japan cannot establish a “new order in Asia” by trampling on fixed, recognized rights, let alone by violating its own assurances. Japan’s demands make it unmistakably clear that it intends to place the administration of Gulangyu’s International Settlement entirely under Japanese control—even while superficially retaining a few non‑Japanese representatives on the Council, who, under the circumstances, would be mere puppets. Japan’s deployment of troops was effectively a show of force to coerce the Municipal Council into making concessions it had no authority to grant. Unless the Council refers matters to the Consular Corps—which alone has the power to agree to amendments to the Settlement’s status—it has no recourse. Even the Consular Corps must obtain instructions and approval from their respective governments before acting.

Japan’s proposal to cooperate with the Council to curb anti‑Japanese activities may seem benign, but today there is no legitimate Chinese organization empowered to nominate the three Chinese Council members Japan seeks. Any nominees would inevitably be seen as Japanese puppets, proving Japan’s true intent: to seize full control of what should be an international administration. Japan’s tentative actions on Gulangyu should be recognized as a challenge to the other treaty powers concerned, and cannot be ignored. If they publicly affirm that Japan must not be allowed to change Gulangyu’s status by force, they will send Japan a message it cannot misunderstand and will uphold their own positions in this part of the world (Shanghai).

Editorial

### Rule of Law in Shanghai

Within a single day yesterday, four Shanghai newspapers were severely punished. The papers differed in ownership, in the form and severity of punishment, and in the stated reasons; what they had in common was that they were all Chinese‑language papers thriving on Anglo‑American commerce. Such a large‑scale suppression would occur only during a profound upheaval of the state and its authority; there is no precedent for this in Shanghai, and it cannot be judged by ordinary standards of common sense or propriety. Moreover, although these four cases were actions taken by official agencies and must be regarded as exercises of legal authority, the nature of those actions—whether political, administrative, or policing—varies; whether legal or illegal, within or beyond jurisdiction, appropriate or excessive, there are standards for judgment, but no single principle covers all. Once a matter becomes one of legal authority, from the moment that authority is invoked until the issue is resolved according to law, no individual views or personal sentiments are permitted to influence the process. This is the realm of modern legal governance and freedom of the press, which must be strictly upheld. The suppression of these four papers is exactly what we find most distressing—nearly suffocating.

We respect the spirit of legal governance and would not ordinarily comment on the content of cases once they have become matters of legal authority. Yet we feel compelled to raise our voices in defense of the rule of law. Two months ago, Shanghai had descended into a state of terror, and the authorities scrambled for measures to respond. We observed: “If anyone wants to destroy Shanghai, no one… If anyone can destroy Shanghai, everyone…” and we advocated for “establishing rigorous methods suited to reality” and hoped that “all parties would exercise mutual restraint and adhere to strict procedures.” Six days ago, speaking of the desire for Shanghai’s stability, we wrote: “Each should fulfill their role, and above all confirm every legal status; opinions may differ, but obeying the law is reasonable, and only by obeying the law can normalcy be maintained.” We also said: “Perverting or breaking the law equally destroys it; once the law is destroyed, there is nothing to protect, and each will act as they please to their own ruin. Such destruction is internal collapse, not to be blamed on the larger environment.” All of this stemmed from faith in the rule of law and a profound trust in Shanghai’s governance—relying solely on the law.

To speak of legal governance in Shanghai does not imply that Shanghai’s authorities have, to date, acted in a lawless manner. But Shanghai’s circumstances appear to cast doubt on whether strict adherence to established rules can adapt to the present environment; and yet, to abandon the law in desperation or to rely on extralegal measures in the name of “understanding” and “cooperation” seems excessively high‑minded and divorced from reality. Such painstaking efforts deserve sympathy from the enlightened, but will they produce better outcomes or worse? Those who believe in the rule of law have a clear answer: without law, without governance—if one destroys the law to preserve order, it is as futile as seeking fish in a tree. Moreover, wavering in one’s faith in the rule of law only exacerbates the underlying instability. This is an undeniable truth.

Today, however, the fundamental issues concerning Shanghai have been addressed with clarity by the firm stance of Britain and the United States, which insist that all matters relating to Shanghai be governed according to the Land Regulations, the international treaty by which the Settlement is constituted. This claim is the most reasonable and must prevail, and it will restore stability to Shanghai’s foundations. Once stability is reestablished, not only will there be internal respect for the rule of law, but the conditions for robust enforcement of the law will be greatly enhanced. We advise the Settlement authorities: up to now, whatever measures have been taken within the Settlement, whether trusted and welcomed by residents of all nations or met with suspicion and resentment, there has been no dispute over their legality. Therefore, from today on, advancing the rule of law and demonstrating its spirit remain entirely feasible. The authorities must show, in every measure, the legal basis of their actions, so that all can see clearly that they are lawful and willingly submit to legal governance. Even the rare suppression of the four papers in Shanghai calls for explicit explanation.

### Japanese Attack on Heshan Valley Wharf Repelled; Troops Concentrate at Jiujiang and Heqing; Fierce Fighting on New Heshan–Jiangfu Routes

(Hong Kong) – According to reports, the Japanese forces attacking the Valley Wharf at Heshan were repelled by Chinese troops yesterday. Currently, the majority of Japanese forces along the lower Xijiang River have concentrated at Jiujiang and Heqing, intending to cross the river. Heavy fighting continues on the New Heshan and Jiangfu routes. Ozawa’s detachment, after a day of bloody battle yesterday, has been driven back. (18th, Special Cable)

Zhaoqing – At 7 a.m. this morning, two Japanese shallow‑draft vessels approached under Heshan County, opened fire on the shore, and launched several rubber boats to attack Huangbaokeng. The Chinese garrison rose up and drove them back. (18th, Local Report)

Zhaoqing – After recapturing the strongpoints at Tangxia and Jinggen, Xinhui’s Chinese forces pressed forward swiftly. Over the past two days, their vanguard reached Qianjin on the Fen Shui River between Mau Wo and Damaishi, where they cleared out remaining enemy elements, and dispatched units to advance around Yunfeng and Guifeng mountains. Huicheng is expected to fall at any moment. (18th)

Wengyuan – On the morning of the 17th, a Japanese detachment advanced from Shilong toward Boluo and by noon reached Changning Lake west of Hualongwei, intending to attack Boluo. Chinese forces are conducting a pincer encirclement. (18th, Special Cable)

### Shanxi Chinese Army Launches Multi‑Pronged Attacks on Japanese Forces

Xingji – Chinese troops around Fancun, north of Hejin, continued their assaults, and on the 15th engaged in fierce fighting all day. The Chinese forces penetrated Japanese positions, destroyed two Japanese artillery pieces, and killed more than twenty Japanese soldiers. Another unit attacked Jishan, reaching areas north of the city near Zhangjiadian, Gaomao Village, and Hanjiazhuang on the 14th, where they clashed with Japanese troops. The Japanese garrison of over 400 at Yuanping in North Shanxi had harassed Chinese positions at Zhangjiadian and Dazheng (southeast of Qixian, east of Juhe River) on the 11th at noon, suffering heavy casualties in a Chinese counterattack. At noon on the 12th, they made another eastward incursion but were once again repelled. On the morning of the 13th, Japanese units advancing westward in western Shanxi and Jingle were ambushed by Chinese forces near Liujiacun, inflicting over twenty casualties and forcing them back into the town. (18th)

### Chinese Forces Fiercely Assault Dengkou Railway Station

Xingji – Since the 12th, Chinese forces have attacked Dashuwan, south of Baotou, engaging more than 2,000 troops of the Japanese and the puppet Fourth Division under Iwata and Matsui in a fierce battle that lasted five nights. Both sides suffered over 200 casualties. Meanwhile, Chinese units crossed the river and launched a surprise attack on Dengkou railway station. A Chinese company commander was hit by a bullet and killed in action. (18th)

### Japanese Violation of British Interests in China – Britain Must Stand Firm in Resistance – The Yangtze Cannot Be Permanently Blockaded by Japan – Speech by the Chairman of the China Society in London

(London) Today Mr. Schwyer, Chairman of the China Society, in his address at the annual meeting, stated that in his personal view the Yangtze River issue has become a symbolic means for critics to attack Britain’s position in China. As for whether Britain should permanently allow Japan to enter the Yangtze and maintain a long-term blockade, that is highly questionable. Mr. Schwyer went on to welcome the creation of a Chinese Currency Stabilization Fund as a much-needed measure, since it could demonstrate British sympathy for China and serve as a clear signal to His Majesty’s Government of the United Kingdom’s concern for the war. He continued by expressing the hope that the government would uphold this position and make every effort to resist Japanese infringements on British interests in China. In past incidents, the British government has been intimidated by the Japanese into making unnecessary concessions. Mr. Schwyer further discussed monetary issues in North China and the Japanese-imposed trade restrictions, asserting that if the British Empire and the United States continue to purchase Chinese products under such conditions, there would be no justifiable reason to doubt that Japan will use a significant portion of the proceeds to defray its military expenses. At the same time, he proposed effectively eliminating foreign competition outside North China. Mr. Schwyer anticipated that British merchants would again demand that the authorities prohibit the importation into North China of British goods unless accompanied by consular certificates indicating that the goods were purchased on an open market for freely convertible foreign exchange. He hoped the government would consider this suggestion sooner rather than later. Mr. Schwyer has been duly elected Chairman of the China Society; his Deputy Chairman is Mr. Baker. (Reuters, 17th)

Soviet Report on Japan’s Reserve Forces – Japan’s Decline is Irrefutable

(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper, in an article on the manpower reserves of the Japanese Army, stated: “The prolonged war in China has not only exhausted Japan’s economy and finances, but its reserve manpower is also steadily weakening. Experts estimate that Japan has no fewer than 8.5 million men of conscription age who fully meet military service requirements. However, as the material living standards and economic conditions of Japan’s working masses have deteriorated in recent years, an increasing number of conscripts are medically unfit for service. In 1936, out of every thousand conscripts, as many as five hundred were deemed unfit. At the same time, desertions during conscription, feigned illnesses, forged documents, and self-inflicted injuries to evade service have continued to rise. It is estimated that in 1933 there were as many as thirty thousand such draft‑evaders. Once enlisted and dispatched to the front lines, there have frequently been incidents of insubordination to officers or refusal to serve. Japan’s Army Reserve primarily draws from the rural population. At present, 25 to 30 percent of eligible rural recruits have already been conscripted into active service. Japan’s combat engineers are mainly recruited from civil servants, the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, and small landowners; they receive specialized training upon enlistment. In the future, engineers will have to be drawn from skilled industrial workers, but such workers are few in number in Japan, and drafting the necessary quota of them would adversely affect the military-industrial sector. Henceforth, the Japanese militarists will undoubtedly conscript large numbers of reserve troops from colonial populations. However, preliminary trials have already proven such reserves to be unreliable. Colonial or occupied Chinese troops, when facing Chinese Nationalist or guerrilla forces, frequently surrender en masse. Within Japan itself, it has been demonstrated that the military’s claim of an indomitable national spirit and will to fight is rapidly diminishing. Thus, the unreliability of Japan’s Army Reserve has, of itself, become an inescapable fact.” (TASS, 17th)

### Japanese Forces Unable to Invade Xiangyang-Fancheng; Chinese Army Retakes Tongbai and Huaihe Shop; Major Battle Expected on the Nanyang Front

Nanyang—Since the 15th, the North Hubei Chinese Army has launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese. One unit attacked the Japanese at Tongbai with fierce intensity. After a fierce battle that lasted until the morning of the 16th, the Japanese, unable to hold their ground, retreated to Huaihe Shop. Tongbai was immediately recaptured, and the Chinese forces pursued and retook Huaihe Shop. The highway between Tongbai and Huaihe Shop is now clear of Japanese presence. In this engagement, over 4,000 Japanese were killed, with countless prisoners taken; investigations are ongoing. Another unit advanced from Tanghe and Xinye, attacking Japanese positions at Pingtian Town, Huyang Town, and Guo­tan Town. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese were completely routed and the areas were secured. The remnants of the Japanese forces have gathered near Zaoyang, where the Chinese Army is now vigorously pursuing them. Tanghe and Xinye counties are free of Japanese troops and order has been restored. On the 16th, Chinese forces launched a fierce assault on Japanese positions northwest of Zaoyang at Yangjiachang, and after intense fighting until last night, the Japanese were completely annihilated. (18th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to a Chungking telegraph, on the 15th a Chinese unit attacked Japanese forces east of Zhongxiang, killing their transport commander, Lin Zhou, along with over a hundred soldiers, burning 37 Japanese vehicles, and seizing large quantities of arms and ammunition. Another Chinese division attacked Japanese forces at [location redacted]; Zhongxiang is now under Chinese control. (Special dispatch, 18th)

(Yichang) After days of intense fighting in central and northern Hubei, Japanese losses have been extremely heavy. The 3rd Division, Japan’s most elite unit, has been completely destroyed by Chinese forces, with two regiments almost entirely annihilated. The remaining Japanese in northern Hubei have been forced east of Xianghua Road by the advancing Chinese. The two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting north of Jingzhong Road. On the Xiang-Yi Line, Chinese forces are steadily pushing eastward, and Japanese forces at Zaoshi are showing signs of wavering. A Chinese detachment has reached Jingzhong Road and is advancing forward. In Tianmen, Chinese troops have broken into the city walls; the Japanese main force has withdrawn outside the city, and Tianmen is expected to fall soon. (18th dispatch)

(Chungking) Reports from Chinese sources here, based on military communications from the Hubei front, warn that the Japanese are urgently planning to invade and occupy Xiangyang and Fancheng. Their concentrated efforts aim to: (1) encircle and attack the Chinese forces guarding Suixian, Tongbai, and the outskirts of Zaoyang near the Dabie Mountains and Dahongshan; (2) besiege Nanyang, a key city on the Henan‑Hubei border. Consequently, a major battle is expected soon on the Nanyang front. (Reuters, 18th)

(Luoyang) The Japanese forces that had invaded Tanghe were repelled by the main Chinese force with over a thousand casualties. The retreating troops were intercepted by local militia near Huyang Bo, who exploited the terrain to surround the Japanese, inflicting heavy losses. The survivors fled northeast to Taiping Town, Zaoyang. (18th dispatch)

Shashi—After reclaiming Yuekou, Chinese forces forced the remaining Japanese to retreat toward Tianmen. Chinese main forces are now advancing on Tianmen, gradually capturing strongpoints. The Japanese garrison inside is in a state of panic. On the 17th, the Japanese used thirteen motor vehicles, three towed guns, and large quantities of heavy equipment to move toward Zaoshi to guard against a Chinese attack, suggesting preparations for withdrawal. (17th dispatch)

(Chungking) According to reliable reports here, 10,000 Japanese troops have been dispatched to Kaifeng as reinforcements. Towns along the Longhai Railway and in northern Henan have been bombed by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese Air Force is also highly active along the Yellow River, indicating a possible advance south along the Longhai and Pinghan Lines to link up their forces in northern Hebei and southern Henan. This move is intended to compensate for their losses in that area while continuing to advance toward Nanyang. Meanwhile, Chinese forces have completely repelled Japanese assaults on Tanghe and Xinye, inflicting severe losses on them in both places. (Associated Press, 18th)

### Japanese Forces Arrive at a County in Eastern Henan

(Luoyang) On the 10th, a Japanese force of over 1,300 men from Kaifeng and Lanfeng reached a county in eastern Henan. Japanese presence has been detected northeast of the Huiji River on the east side of the county, and Chinese troops have been dispatched to monitor them. (17th dispatch)

### Soviet Pilots Willing to Join the Chinese Air Force

(Chungking) According to well-informed sources reporting to the Associated Press, 150 Soviet aviators who previously assisted the Spanish Republican forces have recently requested to join the Chinese Air Force. It is said that Moscow has approved their departure, but Chinese authorities have not yet granted permission. This request contradicts the policy set since the disbanding of the 14th International Bomber Squadron in Hankou last year. (Associated Press, 18th)

### Incident of Two British Vessels Detained in South China

Tokyo—Naval Department spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa, in response to inquiries about the detention of two British vessels in South China, stated that of the two, the Sullustris had been boarded by a Japanese naval officer in Chao’an Bay near Shantou. It was found to be carrying large numbers of regular Chinese soldiers, demonstrating that the vessel was clearly used by the Chinese authorities for military purposes. Although the ship was registered in Britain, many points required clarification, so it was to be held at Macao for further investigation. It was discovered among its cargo was Chinese government salt, and that the vessel had previously made seven voyages carrying the same cargo. Under these circumstances, the Japanese naval authorities concluded that the Sullustris was not engaged in peaceful commerce but was assisting the Nationalist Government; hence further investigation was necessary. The spokesman added that he hoped British merchant ships would avoid actions that might cause Japanese misunderstanding in the future, and stated that he had not yet heard of the detention of the other British vessel.

### Two Proposals of Note in the Production Conference Draft – Assistance for Chinese Small‑Scale Industry, Promotion of a New Cooperative Movement

(Chungking) The financial community here is particularly pleased with two points in the draft proposals of the National Production Conference. First, the government has decided to instruct provincial governments and banks, within feasible limits, to assist Chinese small‑scale industries in areas behind Japanese lines. Second, the government has resolved to vigorously promote a new cooperative movement, recognizing that small‑scale industrialists may suffer losses once their localities are occupied by Japanese forces. Plans call for providing loans at the lowest possible interest rates, with any losses due to the invasion to be written off and repaid by the government. This measure will reduce the fears of small industrialists and, once fully implemented, will serve as China’s best weapon against Japan’s “economic development” efforts. It will enable Chinese behind Japanese lines to avoid economic dependence on Japan. As peasants, no matter how patriotic, without clothing or food they have no choice but to purchase Japanese goods. China’s plan is to prevent them from buying Japanese products and encourage them to use domestic goods. It is also planned to establish a National Cooperative Bank with capital of 10 million yuan to develop cooperatives, which will also serve as an economically valuable weapon.

### Registration of Chinese in Hong Kong Begins

(Hong Kong) The colonial government in Hong Kong has announced that voluntary registration of the Chinese will commence on the 18th, open to all Chinese residents regardless of British nationality. Focus will be placed on those with specialized skills. Registration is expected to be completed by the end of June. (Special dispatch, 18th)

### Macau Silver Insufficient for Circulation

(Hong Kong) Private hoarding in South China is active, and large quantities of silver are being smuggled out from the mainland, amounting to several hundred thousand taels each month. As a result, Macau’s supply of silver is insufficient for circulation, and the price of the silver dollar has risen. (Special dispatch, 18th)

### Chungking Initiates Large‑Scale Evacuation Measures; Mayor Announces Four Regulations; Air Defense Facilities Also Strengthened

(Chungking) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek yesterday issued directives instructing the Chungking authorities to implement large‑scale evacuation measures to guard against Japanese air raids. The first directive is to boost morale for the war; the second and fourth pertain to the evacuation plan; the third is to increase agricultural production. After receiving these orders, the newly appointed mayor of Chungking, He Guoguang, issued a notice detailing four regulations: (1) conduct a household census; (2) construct fire‑ and wind‑resistant barriers; (3) register the population for evacuation planning; (4) reorganize various service corps to work closely with the Garrison Command. Among these four measures, only the population registration will require more time; the other three can be completed shortly. In addition, the authorities have decided to establish an Evaluation Committee, in cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce, to regulate prices—especially of daily necessities—to maintain balance; violators will be severely punished with no exceptions. As for air defense, facilities have been strengthened. All government offices, schools, hospitals, and other institutions have been ordered to relocate to outlying districts. Financial agencies and banks have set up offices outside the city, and several shops have closed to relocate in the suburbs. (Havas, 18th)

(Chungking) According to reliable sources here, residents of major cities across Sichuan Province are also actively evacuating, following official directives. In large cities, more than half the population is to be evacuated, putting a strain on rural areas, which are experiencing unprecedented traffic growth. At the same time, factories and handicraft workshops are moving from cities to the countryside, elevating the rural production role. According to police reports, while the large‑scale evacuations have filled the countryside to an unprecedented degree, order and discipline have remained excellent. (Havas, 18th)

### Japanese Control of North China Currency System Affects Foreign Trade; British MPs Raise Questions, Preparing Further Serious Representations

Peking—The semi‑official Peking Gazette reports that the North China “Federal Reserve Bank,” under Japanese control, has decided to revalue its currency, the “Federal Reserve note,” changing its value from 1 shilling 2 pence to 8 pence. The aim is to reduce the disparity between the Legal Tender Yuan and the “Federal Reserve note,” promote foreign trade, and lower prices, which in many cases have doubled since before the war. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) Labour MP Leslie today in the House of Commons proposed banning the export of war materials to Japan. Leslie asked the government, given its repeated declarations of a non‑aggression policy, whether it would instruct its representatives at the League of Nations Council in Geneva to advocate prohibiting gasoline and minerals necessary for continued operations in China from being shipped to or sold to Japan. Lord Whitehall replied that the Chinese government’s request had been included on the agenda of the current League of Nations Council session and would be fully discussed by the Council, though he could not predict the outcome. Leslie asked what instructions had been given to the British representative to the Council; Whitehall was unwilling to provide a binding statement, only saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax himself would attend. Leslie further asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware of large quantities of nickel being sent from Canada to Japan and whether action should be taken now; Whitehall said he was confident the matter would be considered. He then addressed (1) Britain’s representations to Japan regarding continued Japanese air raids on civilians in Chungking and other places, and (2) Britain’s possible proposal of a long‑term non‑aggression pact with Japan. He said that with regard to the bombing of civilians, the British government had already made serious representations, and the League had passed resolutions, so Halifax saw no need for further action. As to a separate long‑term non‑aggression pact between Britain and Japan, both were signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and therefore no new framework was necessary. Conservative MP Marston asked about the Japanese order requiring North China exporters to sell foreign exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence to purchase Federal Reserve notes, and whether the government had protested to Japan and received a reply, as foreign trade in Tianjin was still seriously affected by this decree. Whitehall replied that the Japanese government’s response stated briefly that Federal Reserve notes were the only legal currency in North China. To ensure their full function in commerce, the authorities had compelled North China exporters to redeem Federal Reserve notes. They did not intend to control general commerce or foreign exchange in North China. If Britain followed this procedure, no difficulty would arise, and there would be no question of treaty rights. The North China Provisional Government had full sovereignty over trade, so this measure did not conflict with Japan’s assurances of respect for third‑party rights. The British government found this Japanese reply unsatisfactory and was considering making further serious representations. The Japanese measure continued to severely affect foreign trade in Tianjin.

### Negotiations for an Anti‑Aggression Alliance – Britain and France Offer New Proposal and Seek Soviet Government’s Opinion – Soviet‑Turkish Secret Agreement Concluded

(London) On the organization of an anti‑aggression bloc, the government’s diplomatic adviser twice met today with Soviet Ambassador Maisky to explain the British government’s views. Ambassador Maisky immediately reported by long‑distance telephone to the Soviet government. According to Balkan sources here, these talks may not bear fruit, as the Soviet Union is not satisfied with Britain’s new proposal and still insists on its plan presented on the 15th, calling for a formal mutual assistance pact among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This is the Soviet Union’s minimum requirement, not its maximum. The Soviet government would be willing to accept the French compromise formula for the three powers, which provides that if any one country comes under threat while fulfilling League obligations, the other two will assist it. Whether Moscow will accept this remains in doubt. In short, unless a formal mutual assistance pact is signed among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviets are prepared to refuse cooperation. This position remains unchanged. (Havas, 17th)

(Paris) On the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to organize an anti‑aggression bloc—

(London) Reliable sources here say that Foreign Minister Piétri has telegraphed Ambassador Cavendish in London with a new proposal to present to the British government. (Havas, 17th) Balkan insiders here also report that while Britain and the Soviet Union are negotiating collective security, the Soviet Union and Turkey have secretly concluded an agreement with broad terms, stipulating: (1) In the event of any aggression that could threaten the status quo in the Balkans, the Soviet Union and Turkey will jointly counter it; (2) in the event of war, both countries will coordinate all resources and forces for mutual defense. The two armies will be under unified command of Turkish generals; the two air forces under unified command of Soviet officers. The Soviet navy will defend the safety of the Black Sea, while the Turkish navy, together with the British and Greek navies, will defend the eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, if necessary, both countries will redeploy their Caucasus defense forces to the Black Sea coast for rapid transport to the Balkans. The Soviet government also demands that foreign warships wishing to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosporus be restricted; in short, except for those already bound by non‑aggression pacts with the Soviet Union, no foreign warships will be allowed through the straits. It is said that the Arab states have all expressed agreement with this Soviet‑Turkish pact. (Havas, 17th)

(New York) At the Soviet pavilion of the World Exposition today, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky, in an inaugural speech, stated that the Soviet Union is prepared to cooperate with other peace‑loving countries on the basis of full mutual assistance and equality, but that the Soviet people will neither be intimidated nor seek alliances. (Reuters, 17th)

### Italy’s Ambassador to Japan Visits Arita; Italian Foreign Minister to Depart for Germany Tomorrow

(Tokyo) Italy’s ambassador to Japan, Volitti, this afternoon called on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Details of their conversation have not been disclosed. (Reuters, 17th)

(Tokyo) Today the English‑language Guangzhi Daily published a special essay titled “Japan Considers Its Policy,” offering a detailed review of meetings on Japan’s policy toward the European situation. It states that this issue has been discussed repeatedly at meetings of five ministers, the Cabinet Councillors’ conference, and by the leaders of the navy and army, and remains a principal topic among government figures. Various signals now suggest that a decision may soon be reached. Discussions on strengthening anti‑Communist defenses began during the last Diet session, when some Lower House members requested that the government clarify its intended course of action. Thereafter, the matter has been scheduled for discussion in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. Here it is regarded as a pressing problem Prime Minister Hiranuma must address, and not an easy one, since he must reconcile many divergent viewpoints: on the one hand, those of Japanese government personnel, and on the other, the interests of both Germany and Italy. The newspaper adds that this responsibility requires great adaptability. Japan has thus far followed a path of compromise and may propose a new best solution to break free of this difficult situation. Former Prime Minister Konoe once identified himself as a proponent of compromise, lending credibility to the view that Prime Minister Hiranuma possesses the qualities of a mediator—an attribute essential for a successful premier. This defensive strategy, adopted in times of crisis when various domestic sentiments must be balanced, deserves commendation. (Reuters, 18th)

(Berlin) Official sources here recently announced that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive in Berlin before the 20th of this month and formally sign the German‑Italian political and military pact with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the morning of the 22nd, after which he will hold further talks with German government officials. (Havas, 17th)

(Rome) It is reported here that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano’s trip to Berlin to sign the German‑Italian alliance will last three days, and that he will meet with Hitler for final discussions. Officials here say that speculative remarks about the alliance are “purely idle talk.” The Rome Observer, citing Berlin sources, states that the alliance may stipulate automatic military assistance between the two countries in the event of hostilities and define spheres of influence in Southeast Europe. The pact will remain in force for ten years, after which it will be reviewed. It is said that, even if only one of the two countries is drawn into armed conflict, both will hold military consultations and undertake joint military and political actions. (Reuters, 17th)

### Polish Express Train Derails Outside Danzig Station; Mysterious Cause; Britain Hopes for German‑Polish Reconciliation

Danzig—The express train from Warsaw to Gdynia derailed outside Danzig station early today. Several cars overturned and the locomotive was destroyed by fire. The cause remains inscrutable. The train made no scheduled stop in Danzig and there were no obstructions on the line. The driver and fireman were seriously injured; passengers suffered only minor wounds. (Reuters, 18th)

Warsaw—Germany today has registered Poles living in Germany as Germans, provoking great indignation here. It is said that over one million Poles have been erased by this statistical method, and there are fears that, under various pressures, only a few hundred thousand Polish residents in Germany will declare themselves Polish in official records. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) At this afternoon’s session of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied in writing to Labour MP Mr. Fleumer, stating that Britain’s current policy aims to encourage Germany and Poland to establish good relations and, whenever possible, to facilitate a satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues, but that any definitive action must have the agreement of both parties concerned. (Havas, 18th)

(Paris) It is reported that 35,000 members of the Nazi Party’s Storm Troopers and the Stahlhelm defense organization have already arrived in the Free City of Danzig, and that ballots for the city’s plebiscite have been printed. These signs may be viewed as indications of imminent German action regarding Danzig. However, diplomatic circles here believe Germany may not risk anything reckless: any violent move against the Free City would almost certainly trigger a German‑Polish war, drawing Britain and France to Poland’s aid. Germany is said to understand this and will act with caution, especially after the signing of the German‑Italian political and military pact: since Italy would be obliged to assist Germany in any war, it would have the right to influence German policy in advance. Prime Minister Mussolini is reportedly exerting every effort to prevent Germany from taking any irrevocable action. The diplomatic situation remains confused, and the stances of various countries are still wavering. Germany’s current endeavor appears to be to secure the alignment of as many nations as possible. (Havas, 18th)

### Denmark and Lithuania Sign Pact with Germany; Finland Refuses

Vilnius—Officials here recently announced that Foreign Minister Urbšys will travel to Berlin within days to sign an agreement. Drafted under the terms of the March 22 accord on the return of the Memel region, it provides that in any future dispute between Germany and Lithuania, neither party shall resort to force. (Havas, 18th)

Copenhagen—It is reported that the Danish government has accepted Hitler’s proposal to conclude a non‑aggression pact. (Reuters, 17th)

Helsinki—It is reported that Finland has rejected Hitler’s proposal for a non‑aggression pact on the grounds that the Nordic countries have agreed to maintain strict neutrality. Sweden and Norway have responded similarly. Their reply will be published on the 19th of this month. (Reuters, 17th)

Warsaw—Local newspapers report that in Lębork, Moravia, the city police chief and twenty‑eight officers were arrested yesterday by German authorities on charges of distributing anti‑German leaflets. (Havas, 18th)

(London) Today’s report from the Daily Mail’s Warsaw correspondent states that Moravia, Bohemia, and Slovakia are very uneasy. In Prague, the noted lawyer Skornina and three former Czechoslovak deputies were arrested for their alleged involvement in a recent plot to assassinate Hitler discovered in Prague, and they have been detained in Germany. (UP, 18th)

### Japan to Control Raw Silk

(Tokyo) The Yomiuri predicts that from June the government will control raw silk. The export price will be set at 1,200 yen per package. All raw silk in Japan will be purchased and traded exclusively by the Imperial Silk Company. If prices rise above 1,200 yen, the company will sell on the market until prices fall; if export prices fall below 1,200 yen, the company will buy on the market until prices rise again. Domestic reeling mills will be assigned quotas for foreign shipment and compelled to produce a minimum amount; their output must be sold to the Imperial Silk Company, which will have the right to control distribution and consumption of domestic raw silk and to set domestic and export prices. (Reuters, 17th)

### Palestine Question: Britain Publishes Compromise Plan; Independent State Within Ten Years; Jews Rise in Opposition

(London) The government published a White Paper this afternoon on the Palestine question, stating that January’s round‑table conference, aimed at finding a solution, has failed. As the mandatory power, Britain has four responsibilities: (1) to protect Palestine’s holy places; (2) to create a political, administrative, and economic environment making Palestine a national home for the Jewish people and facilitating Jewish immigration; (3) to safeguard civil rights and religious freedoms of all inhabitants; and (4) to foster development of self‑governing institutions. The government says a clear definition of its policy and objectives would greatly benefit peace and welfare in Palestine. The policy is explained in three parts: constitutional framework, immigration policy, and land policy.

(a) Constitutional framework: The goal of the mandate is not to convert Palestine into a Jewish state in a way that would conflict with the wishes of the Arab inhabitants. Britain has no intention of suppressing Arabic language or culture or subordinating them to Jewish cultural dominance. It solemnly declares that making Palestine a Jewish state is not part of British policy and would contradict its obligations to the Arabs. It regrets that Sir Henry McMahon’s 1916 declaration was misunderstood as promising an Arab state. In short, Britain’s objectives are fivefold: (1) to establish, within ten years, an independent Palestine that will enter into treaties with Britain, satisfying mutual commercial and strategic needs; (2) to ensure Arab and Jewish communities share executive authority to protect each community’s vital interests; (3) during the transition, Britain will retain governing responsibility while gradually allowing both communities to participate; (4) once order is restored, administrative bodies will be staffed by Arabs and Jews proportionate to their populations and will gradually be led by members of both communities; and (5) after that stage, the administrative committee may become a cabinet, and residents may later establish a legislative council.

(b) Immigration policy: Unrestricted Jewish immigration would conflict with Arab wishes, while a total ban would be unfair. A compromise is proposed: Jewish immigration will be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, raising the Jewish population to one‑third of the Arab population. After five years, further Jewish immigration will require Arab consent.

(c) Land policy: Sales of land in Palestine to Jews should be limited. (Havas, 17th)

(London) Today the Jewish Agency issued a statement on the White Paper, calling the new policy a betrayal of the Jewish people’s right to rebuild their nation in their ancestral homeland. It says the policy transfers power to the Arab majority, reduces Jews to subjects in their own land, and confines them to a local Jewish area. Jews regard this as a breach of faith and capitulation to Arab terrorism, which has deepened the rift between Jews and Arabs. They will not passively accept a policy enforced by force; today is one of the darkest days in Jewish history. Britain seeks to deprive Jews of their last hope and cruelly cut off their path home, but it cannot subdue the Jewish people. Meanwhile, Arab leaders in London have also expressed strong dissatisfaction with the proposed “transitional period” before joint Arab‑Jewish administration in an independent Palestine. They argue it should last no more than three years; any longer would conflict with Arab interests and make the creation of an Arab federation in Palestine impossible. Muhammad of the All‑India Muslim League, speaking for Indian Muslims, also called the transitional period too long. (Reuters, 17th)

Jerusalem—Orthodox Jews have been ordered to observe a full‑day fast today, from dawn until midnight. Jewish commerce and transport have ceased, and meetings are being held to protest the White Paper. British authorities are discussing security measures and have put military and police forces on alert. Yesterday the Jewish National Council announced an “emergency registration” requiring all Jewish men and women aged 18 to 35 to register, a process that continues this afternoon. (Reuters, 18th)

### Laurel Divorces

Los Angeles—Film comedian Stan Laurel today divorced his third wife, the Russian‑born singer Ilina. Laurel cited numerous instances of his wife’s drunken behavior as seriously hindering his work. (Reuters, 17th)

### Canadian Prime Minister Hosts Banquet for the King; Unprecedented Public Enthusiasm

Quebec—From early morning until late at night today, tens of thousands of people cheered the King and Queen of England. At 3 pm, 30,000 schoolchildren on Abraham Plain sang “God Save the King” and “Canada” to welcome Their Majesties. Soon after, the King and Queen issued a written message thanking Canadians and Americans for their letters and telegrams of welcome and goodwill, expressing gratitude and regretting they could not reply individually. Tonight Government House hosted a grand banquet in honor of the King and Queen. Prime Minister King spoke of the honor it is for the sovereign of the Empire to visit this land, noting that today the monarchy has become the center of national life in a way never before seen. Their Majesties, traveling from the Old World to the New, are like joining one family from another. The King responded with thanks. Senator and government party leader Dandurand delivered an address in French, recalling Quebec’s founding in 1608 by Champlain and welcoming the King in Champlain’s language in the capital of “New France.” The King also replied in French, praising Champlain’s bringing of civilization to both banks of the Saint Lawrence River and celebrating the harmonious coexistence of two great peoples today. He lauded Quebec’s spirit of hard work and preservation of ancient traditions as a fusion forming Canada, embodying the ideal of federation to endure forever. (Reuters, 17th)

### Labour MP Inquires About Japan’s Warship Construction

(London) At this afternoon’s House of Commons session, Labour MP Mr. Earle asked the First Lord of the Admiralty how many Japanese capital ships were armed with guns of 14 inches or greater, and whether the Admiralty had information on this. Parliamentary Secretary Mr. Shakespeare replied that, to the Admiralty’s knowledge, Japan built only two such capital ships before the signing of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. Mr. Earle then asked whether the Japanese government had since ceased building such warships. Mr. Shakespeare answered that the government had received no credible reports on the matter.

### American Youth Armed with Knife Attempts to Assassinate Roosevelt; Arrested Scaling White House Wall; Suspected Insane

(Washington) Today a 22‑year‑old man from Philadelphia, armed with a knife and stones, attempted to scale the outer White House wall to assassinate President Roosevelt. He was immediately arrested by detectives and interrogated vigorously. He openly confessed, saying, “America needs a dictator, so I wanted to kill the President.” His speech and behavior suggest he is mentally ill. (Havas, 17th)

### Japanese Forces from Huai–Lianfu Invading Fenggu Village Suffer Crushing Defeat; Ambushed Twice by Chinese Army; Over 600 Troops Involved, Nearly Half Killed

(From Huaian) Japanese forces from Lianfu in the two Huai regions advanced on Chinese positions at Donggou and Yilin. The Chinese, having devised a plan, lured them into the area around Fenggu Village and inflicted a crushing defeat. The details are as follows: About 600 Japanese troops, with seven or eight artillery pieces, converged from the two regions and reached the Chenjiazhi Banhhu area on the evening of the 5th, then attacked the Chinese positions at Donggou and Yilin. Upon learning this, the Chinese command ordered the garrisons at those towns to hold fast and block the advance while dispatching an elite force to ambush the Japanese around Fenggu Village and the nearby Qinggou Town to the southwest. With rear defenses secure, the units at Donggou and Yilin fought fiercely for two or three nights, killing forty to fifty Japanese and buying time for the ambush forces to take their positions. Since holding those towns was no longer necessary, the Chinese made one final fierce stand and then withdrew quietly.

Setting the Final Ambush in the Suburbs  
The civilian population had been evacuated in advance. After the Chinese withdrew overnight, the Japanese only discovered it at dawn but dared not proceed hastily. Only after deploying traitorous interpreters and scouts did they resume their attack. As intended, they rushed into Fenggu Village, where the Chinese held back until the entire Japanese force was inside. Ambush units, spread across fields and hills, then encircled and fell upon them.

Encirclement and Furious Assault  
Japanese troops inside the village, stripping off their gear to rest and forage, scrambled in disarray and failed to coordinate. The Chinese tightened the ring, and amid cries of slaughter, repeatedly repelled desperate Japanese breakout attempts. The ambush killed 170 to 180 Japanese. The remnants stampeded, some fleeing through Yangjiazhi near Qinggou (southwest of Fenggu Village), another pre‑set ambush area, where dozens more were killed. In total, of the roughly 600 invading soldiers, only about 300 remained. The casualties were unprecedented in recent battles, marking one of the largest annihilations in northern Jiangsu. The remnants fled chaotically back toward Lianfu’s Banhhu. Having secured Qinggou, Fenggu Village, Yangjiazhi, Yilin, and Donggou, the Chinese are pursuing the remnants toward Banhhu, having killed over 200 more, captured dozens of rifles, and seized countless supplies. Deputy Commander‑in‑Chief Han has ordered commendations for the officers and soldiers who distinguished themselves in the operation.

### Suzhou Mobile Unit Night Raid on Xietang; Puppet Police Repelled Three Times

(Suzhou) At Xietang, outside Fengmen, where canals from Jinji and Dusu converge, a puppet police unit under Xiao Long was stationed. On the night of the 15th, half a mile north of town, a small detachment of puppet police billeted in a house owned by a man named Xu was suddenly attacked by the mobile unit. Overwhelmed, they called for reinforcements. A fierce battle ensued, with the mobile unit continuously reinforced from Weiting and armed with light machine guns, persisting until dawn. The mobile unit even broke into the town before withdrawing in good order. Both sides suffered casualties; bloodstains were found in nearby wheat fields. Puppet police, twice repelled, were on high alert but did not discover the source of the opening attack. Innocent Chinese, forced to wear Japanese uniforms as guides, were later found killed and hastily buried.

### Chinese Forces Besiege Huaiyin; Advance on West Gate, Attempt to Scale Walls; County Government Offices Dismantled

(From Huaiyin) Chinese counteroffensive troops briefly reached the city walls. On the night of the 7th, County Magistrate Wang of Siyang arrived near Chenji, and on the 9th, Magistrate Lu reached Wangjiab Bridge. A certain brigade, diverted west to reinforce Xuyi on an urgent call, also moved to Wang Bridge on the 11th. On the night of the 13th, they attacked Huaiyin: Siyang’s standing brigade advanced to Hancheng Township, and another unit together with the Huaiyin standing brigade reached Longzhuoleng. However, time was short and, with dawn approaching, they could not fully exert their strength. On the night of the 14th, they renewed the attack: the Siyang standing brigade reached Hongmen and attacked the West Gate, but the Japanese had already filled the gate passage with earth and repelled them. One Chinese regiment advanced to Shilichang Street, East Gate Huajie, and South Gate Xiaojie, selecting spots to scale the walls, but Japanese had dug the moat six to seven feet deep, making it impassable, and sentries shone searchlights at the gates, thwarting the attempt. The Chinese then swept the defenders with machine-gun fire and bombarded the city with artillery, forcing the Japanese to retreat within the walls. The Chinese captured four puppet self‑defense sentries at East Gate Huajie at dawn; by morning all units had returned to their original positions. Troops remain deployed around Huaiyin, closely watching the Japanese inside. They have also mobilized civilians to destroy bridges on the Qingshu, Qinghuai, and Qingsu roads to hinder Japanese movements. They await another opportunity to renew the siege.

Reports indicate that during the Chinese counterattack on Huaiyin, a Japanese reinforcement detachment was withdrawn north due to tensions at Xuzhou, and tanks were also redeployed. Currently only 400 Japanese remain in Huaiyin, with a few holding outposts in four surrounding villages—most notably the camp at Wangying. The Huaiyin County Government and seven district commissioner offices were dismantled by the Japanese; building materials and looted goods from shops and residences were loaded onto sixty to seventy civilian vessels and taken north.

Since Huaiyin’s fall two months ago, the occupying force of over 300—mostly Korean and Manchurian puppet troops—has been notorious for indiscipline. Upon arrival, they frequently roamed villages two to three miles outside the city, committing rape, plunder, and arson while foraging. Later, widespread guerrilla ambushes in the surrounding villages deterred them from venturing out; they remained shut inside the city, setting up barbed wire along major roads. Residents inside live in dire conditions. The puppet Maintenance Association is chaired by Zheng Dazi, vice‑chaired by Li Yushu, with general affairs, education, public security, and finance departments, and subcommittees in city wards and towns led by gangs of miscreants holding puppet posts. There is also a procurement office run by Director Huang Zihou, supplying goods and food to the Japanese. These collaborators, treating their occupiers as patrons, live under strict Japanese surveillance and cannot move freely. The Japanese command is headquartered in the county government building, the military police are housed in the elementary school annex, the propaganda and pacification unit operates a Farmers’ Bank, and a brothel for Japanese soldiers has been established in a southern alley of the city.

### Pinghu, Japanese Troops Ambushed and Captured Alive

Two Japanese Motorboats Also Sunk

Pinghu, local dispatch—More than 300 Japanese troops, imagining they could sweep the Chinese forces in the nearby suburbs, arrived at Pinghu County Town two days ago. For guides, they forcibly recruited vegetable vendors. After setting out, they had only advanced to a place called Xujia Embankment, several li from the city, when they were suddenly surrounded by Zhang Ziming’s Chinese unit and decisively attacked. On the spot, they sank two Japanese motorboats, killed thirty-eight Japanese soldiers, seized more than sixty rifles and pistols, and captured over ten Japanese soldiers alive. Among the captives was one Man Yeh Jin-an-tsin, who confessed he was twenty-four years old, from Tokyo, serving as a private first class in the Tanaka Unit. Its headquarters was in Songjiang under Commander Tanaka Yoshio. Last year, he was sent from Tokyo to Fengjing first. He is an only son, with an elderly mother and a beautiful wife, press–ganged into the army by the warlords; he had no choice. At the time of interrogation, he wept bitterly, his condition deeply sorrowful. This routed Japanese detachment had four motorboats in total.

### Chinese Forces Threaten Jiashan

Western Bridge and Tracks Destroyed

Japanese Troops Await Reinforcements in the Town

Jiashan, local dispatch—Chinese forces that crossed from Zhejiang’s eastern sea by landing at Jinshanwei are now being fully deployed. At Xiashi Wangdian section, the tracks have been wrecked. The first passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai derailed and plunged into the river. On the western outskirts of Jiashan, the 63–64 numbered foreign bridge was blown in two, and thirteen rails outside the East Gate were removed. Along the line, the Japanese railway guard squads frequently suffer ambushes, so the trains on the Hangzhou–Shanghai line are often held up. On the western outskirts near the West Gate of Jiashan, two days ago a Chinese regiment passed through with forty-three civilian boats fully loaded with troops. On Anqiao Bridge, they mounted artillery aimed directly at the town. In a Japanese lookout post, seventeen men were slaughtered; the puppet police substation was burned down. Inside the town, the Japanese garrison has only about twenty men. They no longer check identification certificates, letting civilians come and go freely, but they order residents from door to door not to shut their doors at night and forbid women from going upstairs to shelter. The purpose of these orders is unknown. Although the Japanese repeatedly appealed to the Hangzhou–Shanghai garrison for help, only about three hundred men, mostly speaking a Northeastern accent, have been dispatched to nearby suburbs. In Fengjing, Japanese troops, earlier probed by Chinese forces at the East Gate, engaged in fierce fighting for three hours with casualties on both sides. Now they hold the four gates firmly; town residents are forbidden to step outside the gates, allowed only to move freely within. Travel permits have been suspended and all boats from the four neighboring towns are cut off.

### Residents of Jiading, Taicang, and Other Counties Oppose Reorganization into the Puppet Municipality—Seven Counties Too Vast to Combine as One

After the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality, the old territory of Baoshan was reassigned to the municipality. However, the two prefectures of Shanghai and Baoshan remained under the Jiangsu Provincial Government and never experienced an administrative interval. Since last winter, the puppet mayor Chuan Xiao’an has taken office, and finding no revenue, sought to annex the six counties of Jiading, Fengxian, Chongming, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Fengxian—more recently adding Taicang—seven counties in total—to his jurisdiction, advancing his scheme of annexation. This has provoked the strong opposition of the people of the seven counties—led by Wang Chongfu, Li Weiji, Wu Shouying, and others—who argue that although these counties are directly or indirectly contiguous to Shanghai, their land quality varies in fertility, their industries differ in scale, and all are agricultural areas with underdeveloped commerce. Moreover, Nanhui and Fengxian lie on the east bank of the Huangpu River, about a hundred miles from Shanghai; Chuansha and Jiading are sixty or seventy miles away; Chongming is marooned offshore, requiring a five- or six-hour boat ride. Such vast distances cannot be administratively merged into one. Administrative boundaries have never followed military zones that shift with troop movements; if administrative divisions were changed constantly, organizational confusion and operational disruption would ensue. After the war, Shanghai will be especially devastated. Although the seven counties have also suffered wartime destruction, it is lighter than in Shanghai proper. Mayor Chuan Xiao’an’s intention to annex them is purely to seize their resources, throwing their people into ruin. Recently the puppet municipal government sent a so-called division chief, Jiang, to the seven counties to survey them for takeover. The outcome is unknown.

### Jiayu and Qixing Bridge Briefly Retaken by Chinese Troops

Japanese Fortifications Destroyed

Jiayu, local dispatch—On the evening of the sixteenth, Chinese forces captured the town of Qixing Bridge in Jiayu County. Riding the victorious momentum, they then attacked the Japanese railway protection garrison at the station, engaging in fierce battle. The result: the Japanese forces retreated in rout, suffering eight fatalities. After recapturing the station, fearing Japanese encirclement, the Chinese troops demolished all Japanese fortifications and then withdrew.

### Chinese Forces in Pudong Rout Japanese and Puppet Troops

Large Amounts of Arms Captured

The Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong, based at Zhoupu and Xinchang, have been reinforced and supplied for several days, with large formations intending to advance southward. When the leader of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, Colonel He Jian, learned of this, he led the Eighth Detachment of his brigade to attack at dawn on the sixth, recapturing Shen Village, Su Family Bridge, and Chenxing. They seized two light machine guns, fifty-three rifles, six submachine guns, numerous pistols and other military supplies, and killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. At the same time, they mobilized local militiamen to destroy sections of the Zhoupu–Xinchang road for several li. By daybreak, having achieved their objective of annihilation, the Loyal and Righteous Army withdrew.

### West Green Handball Singles Final—He Qinggong Falters; Qu Keling Retains Title by Two Sets to One; He Wins First Set but Drops Next Two

The West Green Handball Singles Final was held yesterday at 6 p.m. in the West Green court, contested between Chinese player He Shuoqing and Qu Keling, refereed by Blat. After two hours of exceptionally thrilling play, He Qinggong unfortunately lost one set to two. Yesterday, despite the lopsided appearance of the match—He winning the first set—he could not sustain his strength and dropped the next two. Qu Keling’s advantage lay chiefly in physical strength; in skill, He was superior. This defeat is most regrettable. In the opening set, contact was made at He’s eye corner, but after a brief rest he continued despite the injury, eventually dominating with a 21–3 victory. In the deciding set, he led 7–2, but Qu Keling gradually equalized. In the final set, both exerted their utmost, but He’s stamina fell short; though he took an early lead, his shots lacked power and he suffered fierce counters, ultimately losing 16–21 and the match 1–2. Qu Keling thus retains the singles championship; results as follows:

### Ministry of Education Orders Provincial and Municipal Authorities to Emphasize Sports

(Chongqing dispatch) The Ministry of Education, aiming to cultivate wholesome recreational habits among the public, strengthen body and mind, and enhance wartime resistance, resolved at a recent regular meeting to give special attention to public sports.

### Philippine–Taiwan Cup Tennis Representatives—Sanches and Anthony Departed for Shanghai

The Philippine representatives for the Davis Cup, Sanches and Anthony, departed Manila for Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th), set to perform here this Sunday. Philippine tennis’s first appearance in the Davis Cup in eleven years; this is the third Cup. They will compete in the North American Zone, facing winners from Australia and Mexico in the second week. Sanches is a 20-year-old university student, 5’4”, the Philippine champion for two consecutive years, recently winning the national and Manila singles titles. Last year he reached the semifinals of the Saigon International. His play is exceptionally calm, with sure groundstrokes—truly a rare talent. His entire family excels in tennis; his father represented the Philippines at the 1929 Far Eastern Games, competing against China and Japan, earning Sanches the moniker “son of a tennis dynasty.” Anthony, only 18 and still in secondary school, 5’2”, is the nation’s second-ranked player. Yugoslav Davis Cup player Kojošebeck fell victim to his play in Manila last November. His strokes are slow, high and soft, landing sharply in both corners—typical “sticky toffee” style, difficult to defeat. His father, also a tennis star and national champion, was selected for the Philippine team at the 1930 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo.

Education News

### Overview of Education for Overseas Chinese—Over 2,400 Overseas Chinese Schools; 200,000 Yuan Annual Central Subsidy

(Chongqing special report) Before 1928, overseas Chinese education was managed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission’s Chinese Education Committee. When that committee stalled, the former Academia Sinica took charge. Abroad, there was no direct local administrative body for overseas Chinese education. In 1929, the Ministry of Education issued regulations for consuls and commercial counselors to manage overseas Chinese education. In 1930 the Ministry assigned overseas education to its Department of General Affairs and established a Chinese Education Planning Committee for design and recommendations. After the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission reorganized and formed an Overseas Chinese Education Office, that office took charge of administrative affairs, with the Ministry of Education in a supervisory role. The Planning Committee effectively paused, and consular involvement did not meet expectations. To date, overseas Chinese education administration has yet to be properly adjusted. It requires special attention going forward. The history of overseas Chinese education administration is summarized below:

Legal Framework  
In 1930, the Ministry of Education promulgated regulations for overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools, stipulating school funding, facilities, curriculum, discipline, school boards, staff, students, and associations as guidelines for school management. It also issued regulations on school board organization, school registration, and policies for overseas Chinese returning to study domestically, completing the key legal framework. After the reorganization of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, both parties jointly revised all regulations, changing “overseas Chinese” to “overseas nationals” and marking them as amended, but largely retaining their original content.

School Registration  
In the past ten years, the number of overseas Chinese schools registered with the government has increased annually. Currently there are forty-eight secondary schools, 360 primary schools, and over 2,400 unregistered schools. Registered schools constitute less than one fifth. The main reasons: obstruction by colonial governments in various countries and a lack of local administrators to supervise, resulting in low registration enthusiasm.

Financial Subsidies  
Since the Commission’s reorganization, the central government has allocated 200,000 yuan annually for overseas Chinese education subsidies. Registered schools with insufficient funds and financially disadvantaged but academically excellent students returning to domestic study receive support. Each allocation is decided by meetings convened by the Commission, with Ministry of Education representatives in attendance. Currently these funds are disbursed at 70 percent of the approved amounts.

Inspections  
In 1936, the Commission and the Ministry jointly dispatched personnel to inspect overseas Chinese education in various ports in Southeast Asia and in British and American territories, with overall satisfactory results. Other projects, such as training teacher cadres and preparing for a Chinese Education Congress, remain active tasks led by the Commission.

### Youth Employment Guidance (2)

Speech by Mr. Shen Guanglie to Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Students’ Advancement and Career Guidance Class

Four Paths to Employment

Having just left school, where do we look for jobs? Sitting at home behind closed doors, obviously “work cannot fall from the sky” unless someone finds a job for you. Thus, job seeking must rely on action. Broadly there are four ways:

1. Public Agencies Registration  
In Shanghai, there are three public registration offices: (1) the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Bureau under the China Vocational Education Society; (2) the Young Men’s Association Placement Department; and (3) the Worldwide Chinese Students Association Placement Office. On the mainland, there is also the National Academic Work Consultation Office; the Ministry of Education now also has a special office for this purpose, though limited to specialized personnel. These offices serve society free of charge. Procedures and recommendations are as follows:  
(a) Fill out the form—essential for job registration, allowing assessment of your resume and status as the basis for job placement. Be meticulous; the form is the first impression and matters greatly. If your contact information changes, notify immediately to avoid invalidation.  
(b) Interview—demonstrate your specialties or focus areas (e.g., mathematics, literature, accounting, typing). Do not say vaguely you can do “anything,” since employers have specific needs. Those hardest to place are generalists.  
(c) Follow-up—after a suitable period, politely inquire about opportunities. When introduced, do not hesitate over compensation. Adopt an experimental attitude and pursue contact.

2. Recommendations from Friends and Relatives  
Two methods:  
(a) Correspondence—ensure neat handwriting and concise, appropriate wording. Avoid long-winded letters. Enclose your resume with each letter, detailed enough for the recipient’s review.  
(b) In-Person Meeting—dress neatly and maintain humble yet confident demeanor. Come prepared to seek work as a proper activity; do not be shy. Focus on the other’s needs and what you can offer. When the conversation has progressed sufficiently, stand up to signal departure.  
(c) Follow-up inquiry—after some time, check in again. Vary your approach with discussions of personnel matters, current events, or news to avoid awkwardness.

3. Proactive Inquiries  
Through personal observation or hearsay that there is demand somewhere, do not hesitate to investigate. Classified ads in newspapers, though not always reliable, can also expand your experience. Success is gratifying; failure is no disgrace—keep trying, and success will come.

4. Self-Employed Initiatives  
Being self-employed or starting a partnership to maintain a living, such as opening a small shop—an example. Avoid vanity and class prejudice; be ready to “roll up your sleeves.” I recall a former county superintendent selling rice dumplings in a restaurant, earning a thriving income, or a youth shining shoes who also earned over forty yuan a month, covering living expenses and remitting home support while still training himself—truly admirable real-life examples.

Once Employed, Work Diligently  
After obtaining a job, be content with your compensation, always recalling the hardship of unemployment and that many are worse off than you. Maintain equanimity. If you can work hard, you will earn superiors’ trust and increase your pay. Outside work, attend supplementary schools to gain practical knowledge. If circumstances prevent that, self-study in related disciplines. Value on-the-job experience and never neglect it.

If Unemployed, Be Patient  
If temporarily without suitable work, do not despair. In life, disappointments outnumber successes. As long as you are determined to improve, opportunities will not pass you by—like a long voyage cannot enjoy a favorable wind every day. Persist through adverse conditions; fair weather will come. The more difficulties you face, the closer you are to success. History is full of such examples everywhere. Cherish your efforts. As for the principles of employment, time constraints require we discuss them another time.

### Ministry of Railways to Issue Subsidies to Private Schools—338 Schools to Benefit

The Ministry of Railways’ Department of Educational Affairs has decided to increase the current year’s public and private school subsidy budget by 220,000 yuan. A special commissioner investigated each school’s operations and academic performance to determine subsidy amounts. The investigation is complete, and the distribution has been decided; funds will be issued shortly. This year, 338 Chinese private schools will receive subsidies.

### Developments in Fudan University’s Shanghai Campus Education

In Fudan’s Department of Education, following the departure of Department Chair Zhang Yi to become Director-General of the Ministry of Education’s General Affairs Department, President Li has appointed Qian Weizong to succeed him. Professors Chen Kemei, Wei Yin, Jiang Zaihua, and He Qingru teach in the department. This semester, Dr. He Qingru has been invited by Harvard University to lecture on vocational guidance in the U.S. and left at the beginning of March. Since his appointment, Qian has encouraged students to pursue scholarly research diligently. This semester the university library has acquired many educational reference books and subscribed to four Western education journals for student reading. The psychology laboratory apparatus, partly relocated to the Chongqing campus, has been supplemented with new purchases. Qian has invited educational experts to lecture, stimulating research interest. Last Saturday, Deputy Director Chen Xuanshan of the Ministry’s Division of Chinese Education lectured on “The Role of Experimental Methods in Education,” analyzing conditions, limitations, and common errors in experimentation in detail. Regular educational lecture and debate meetings have been held to enhance students’ oral presentation skills. Recently a competition on secondary education and educational administration was held; Qian personally funded forty yuan to purchase books as prizes for outstanding students. To verify what they learn, students under faculty guidance have visited the municipal girls’ school, Detong Academy, American School, Gongxue, and Chinese-Western Girls’ School. Before the war, the department published a journal well received externally; wartime disruptions have halted it, but it is planned for revival when possible.

### Education Briefs

Shanghai students in exile held a reception for various sectors on the 13th in Hong Kong to report their work and seek societal support.  
The Zhejiang Finance Department has recruited the Jiangxi College of Arts and Sciences; a commissioner has been dispatched to liaise with school authorities.  
Guohua Middle School will host a lecture by educational expert Chen Songchun this week. The graduation commemorative journal of all senior and junior classes will be published around mid-June.

### Two Concessions Take Strict Precautions: U.S. Marine Corps Prohibited from Leaving Camp; British Destroyer Koae Arrives in Shanghai to Reinforce

According to the English-language American Evening Post, following the Gulangyu incident and the ensuing rumors in Shanghai, the British and American troops stationed here have been closely monitoring the situation. Over the next few days, they will continue to do so. The U.S. Naval Marine Corps will not be permitted to leave their camp tomorrow (the 19th). The White Russian unit in the French concession has also been ordered to stand ready. The British destroyer Koae has departed Hong Kong bound for Shanghai to bolster defenses. It is possible that the British ambassador will travel on that ship, though no official announcement has been made. The Municipal Council’s Police Department has indeed heightened its vigilance to strengthen general control and maintain good order. In particular, the Special Constabulary and certain units of the International Merchants’ Association have recorded members’ addresses and telephone numbers, indicating that necessary precautions have been taken over the past two days.

French Concession Recruits White Russian Volunteers

The French concession authorities here recently undertook the recruitment of seventy White Russian volunteers, to be named the “White Russian Auxiliary Battalion.” Officers will be selected from the senior White Russian unit in the concession, which currently numbers around three hundred men trained by French officers. On April 1st they celebrated their seventh anniversary. Upon enlistment, each volunteer will receive a monthly salary of forty‑five yuan, increasing annually; corporals and sergeants will earn over one hundred yuan per month. Uniforms and lodging are all provided by the concession authorities.

Public Concession Inspects Hotels

At 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, personnel from the Municipal Council’s Police Department, accompanied by members of the Russian Merchants’ Association, proceeded to the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road and the Anton Hotel on Hubei Road, conducting room‑to‑room searches. It was said they were seeking terrorists, but nothing was found in either establishment. The search was completed by 10 o’clock.

### Hongkou Openly Distributes Anti‑British Leaflets; Children Paraded on Trucks Led by a Brass Band

According to the Zhilin Daily, just after 2 p.m. yesterday (the 17th), four trucks slowly drove along Disway Road in Hongkou. The first truck carried a brass band playing marches; the next two carried Chinese children not yet of school age; the last carried a detachment of Japanese soldiers as guards. They distributed anti‑British leaflets to passersby. Drawn by the music, many Chinese came forward to pick up the leaflets and read them. On duty in that area were Chinese and foreign officers of the Municipal Council’s Police Department, who collected a large number of leaflets. As the four trucks proceeded along Disway Road, they attracted considerable attention. The children on board threw leaflets to left and right, causing laughter. The content was vehemently anti‑British, urging the Chinese people to rise up against the British presence in China, overthrow the imperialism that has allegedly exploited China for years, and refrain from depositing money in British banks. However, most readers were laborers, making the action of dubious necessity. Another leaflet bore an illustration depicting the suffering of the Chinese people under British rule during feudal times. The procession continued along Disway Road, followed by a large crowd, until the leaflets were exhausted. It was reported that the children then proceeded to a reception where they had been used to distribute these anti‑British materials to Hongkou’s Chinese residents. Police personnel soon collected all the leaflets from the street, took them to the Hongkou police station, and forwarded them to the Central Police Station for translation.

### Bogus “Mayor” Fu Xiaoan Again Sends Letters to Concession Authorities; Reiterates Five March Demands; Concessions’ Silence Regretted

According to the Zhilin Daily, Shanghai’s self‑styled “Mayor” Fu Xiaoan last night (the 17th) instructed his secretary to deliver letters to Municipal Council Chief Director Franks, Consular Corps Leader Nilon, and French Consul General Baudé. He demanded an early reply to his March 10 note regarding implementation of measures to control terrorism, and expressed hope that the Public and French concession authorities would cooperate with the “Shanghai Municipal Government” to maintain peace and order.

Five Demands  
In Fu’s letter to Chief Director Franks and Consular Corps Leader Nilon, he recounted the five demands from his March note: (1) implementation of measures to control terrorist crimes; (2) restoration of the Daxi Road police substation; (3) transfer of jurisdiction over the Special Court; (4) return of land bureau records; (5) prohibition on flying the Kuomintang flag.

No Reply Received  
The letter noted that on March 28 Fu had written to the concession authorities to draw attention to these matters but received no reply. On March 23 he met with Municipal Council President Fei Xundun, who promised sincere consideration of roads outside the West Boundary, yet no action followed. In yesterday’s letter, Fu requested Fei to communicate on these issues. The letter concluded by stating that there is now a “Special Municipal Government” in Shanghai, and hoped the Municipal Council and consular corps “for the sake of peace and order in the Public Concession and the welfare of the people” would cooperate with that “government.”

Deep Regret  
In a similar letter to the French Consul General, Fu expressed deep regret over the failure of both concessions to respond to his note, and recounted his March 10 note to the consul general, requesting measures to control terrorism, transfer of the Special Court, and prohibition of the Kuomintang flag.

Flag‑Flying Incident  
Fu stated that the ban on flag‑flying had been issued only once and not fully enforced, and that he saw no indication from the French authorities regarding terrorism control or court transfer. He again requested an immediate reply and hoped the French concession authorities would cooperate with the “Special Municipal Government.”

### Following Advice, Fresh Pork Industry Decides to Resume Operations; Begins Weighing and Selling Existing Pigs Today; Solemnly Reaffirms Original Stance

Since the fresh pig and meat trade was forced to halt operations several days ago, merchants have held a firm stance, awaiting the concession authorities’ resolution. During this period, incoming livestock, though few, could not be delayed, and traders appealed for relief measures to preserve their capital. Yesterday’s survey found over 1,400 live pigs in the South Market and over 600 in the North Market, totaling more than 2,000 heads—yet the two concessions normally require over 2,000 pigs per day.

Concession Authorities Advise Resumption  
In the French Concession Municipal Council, authorities invited representatives of the Fresh Pig Trade Association and pig merchants yesterday morning, advising them to weigh and sell pigs in stock on the 19th to ensure food supply; refusal would contravene the Council’s purpose. Similarly, the Public Concession’s Municipal Council, at its bureau meeting yesterday at 3 p.m., heard a report on the halted pork trade and advised resumption to secure food for the people.

Fresh Pig Trade Decides to Resume  
At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Fresh Pig Trade Association convened all pig merchants, conveying the concession authorities’ advice. Managers stated they would uphold their original position but, out of respect for the repeated advice, agreed that on the 19th they would first weigh and sell their stock and immediately informed the fresh meat trade to do likewise. It was heard that fresh pig merchants would resume operations today, though the existing stock in the concessions will supply only one day’s sales.

Slaughterhouses to Resume Meat Supply Tomorrow Morning  
The French Concession Municipal Council’s slaughterhouse, along with the Su‑Xi Slaughtering Company and the Xin‑Ninghai Slaughtering Company in the Public Concession, will resume pig slaughter today. Consequently, over 2,000 fresh meat shops and stalls citywide will have fresh meat for sale starting tomorrow (the 20th). Due to the market halt, prices have soared to over 0.8 yuan per catty. It is expected that with resumed slaughter, prices will return to normal, but with limited supply, the meat trade’s prospects remain bleak.

Two Slaughterhouses Previously Pressured  
The Su‑Xi Slaughtering Company at No. 50, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, and the Xin‑Ninghai Slaughtering Company at No. 4, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, halted slaughter on the morning of the 13th. On the evening of the 16th, several Japanese arrived unannounced, forcing the plants to resume slaughter. Workers firmly refused until the Chengdu Road police station intervened. To comply with the Municipal Council’s goodwill, the companies reluctantly slaughtered. It was also reported that at noon yesterday they found an unexploded hand grenade near a wooden utility pole in front of the company; it was taken by police for examination, and whether it was meant to intimidate remains unclear.

### Speculators Continue Manipulation: Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday; Rice Market Forced to Close Early; Deadline for Owners to Register Stored Rice Extended

Yesterday morning, the rice market, starved of spot stocks and overwhelmed by demand, saw prices suddenly surge to a high of 17.7 yuan per package. The market was forced to close early and convened a meeting urging owners to register their stored stocks and extend the registration deadline. Rice merchants met yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Details follow.

Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday Morning  
After advising merchants to adhere to price limits, strictly clamp down on black‑market trading, and reward informants, rice prices had eased and the market seemed stable. However, upon opening yesterday, buyers far outnumbered sellers, sending prices soaring to 17.7 yuan—nearly 20% above the 15 yuan cap. The cause was again speculator hoarding, leading to a dearth of spot trades. Inland supplies had increased but remained far short of surging demand, with little rice in storage to release.

Market Forced to Close Early  
Noting the market upheaval and persistent black‑market deals despite strict monitoring, the Market Management Committee found enforcement impossible amid tacit agreements between buyers and sellers. Chaos ensued, forcing closure around 11 a.m. A meeting was held to urge compliance, but to no avail.

Registration Deadline for Stored Rice Extended  
Since the 12th, the Rice Valuation Committee handled registration of stored rice owners, with a one‑week period originally ending at 5 p.m. yesterday. Registrations were sparse—only about 61,000 packages—due to owners’ wait‑and‑see attitude. As the deadline approached, merchants rushed to pick up forms, prompting a surge in registrations. The period has been extended by one to two days. The Committee will, after concluding registrations, report to both concession authorities for further action.

Rice Merchants’ Association Agrees to Identify Speculators  
Following the Chamber of Commerce’s request to identify speculators by name for appeal to the concession authorities, and the Bean and Rice Industry Association’s call for merchants to uphold price limits and report violators, the Shanghai Rice Merchants’ Association held its 20th executive committee meeting at 5 p.m. yesterday. They discussed (1) how to urge peers not to buy above price limits to stabilize prices, and (2) how to urgently identify speculator identities, among other key issues.

Rice Merchants Complain of Difficulties  
Member merchants such as Nanchang Rice Store, citing difficulties in adhering to caps, sent a letter to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, stating: “As dealers selling directly to consumers, we must have goods before meeting market demand; we cannot buy today’s needs in advance for tomorrow’s. With many rice varieties and uncertain customer preferences, stocking too much risks unsold inventory, while stocking too little broadens circulation. No rice merchant can go ten days without restocking. Now, speculators are flagrantly buying above price limits for over half a month, yet expect us to comply while refusing to purchase. This is neither reasonable nor feasible.”

### Spring Cocoons Hit the Market: Zhejiang Cocoons Arrived Yesterday; Jiangsu Cocoons Must Wait Until Month‑End

After spring cocoons began hatching across Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Japanese‑owned China Central Company initially planned to centrally control cocoon purchases. Faced with practical difficulties, it abandoned village‑level control and allowed independent manufacturers and surplus cocoon traders to buy freely. Now, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and Hang County areas, spring cocoons have arrived in the market since yesterday. Although some dealers have suspended advances and insurance companies have stopped insuring cocoons, merchants still set up scales to buy. However, the number of active scales is far below pre‑war levels. In Wuxi, Changzhou, and other areas, cocoons will only reach the market around the end of the month.

### In Front of the Grand Building on Higer Road, Patrol Officers Withdraw; House Owner Gives Written Assurance No Casino or Dance Hall Will Be Opened

According to the Shanghai Times, in the Public Concession a casino was to be set up at No. 448 Higer Road. The Police Department ordered removal of obstructions in front of the house by April 9. Within a day or two, barriers blocking the two road entrances were removed, and the patrol officers stationed there withdrew, though fences and barbed wire remain. The Department’s decision follows the house owner’s written guarantee that no casino or dance hall will be opened on the premises. However, the Department wishes to see compliance before removing all nearby obstructions. Located behind Hong’en Hospital, the property underwent major renovations a month ago, and rumors of a planned gambling den prompted police action.

### Two Plainclothes Japanese Search Youth Association; Record Names of Room Occupants; Attempt to Enter American Staff Officer’s Quarters Fails

According to the Continental Daily, on the 17th at around 10:30 p.m., two plainclothes Japanese, accompanied by French Concession police, visited the Youth Association on Mintiyin Road and requested entry to Room 36. Association staff replied that no such room exists, as all rooms are numbered above 100. The search party did not specify what they sought and then cited other room numbers for entry. The association permitted access; they recorded the occupants’ names, then went downstairs and finally requested entry to the quarters of the association’s U.S. staff officer, Oliver, but were refused. Oliver has since left Shanghai.

### Concessions in Grave Turmoil: Chinese‑Language Newspapers Unfortunate Fate—Wen Hui and Translation Daily Suspended for Two Weeks; Licenses of American Daily and Sino‑American Daily Revoked

Ordered to Suspend Publication  
Our city’s Wen Hui Daily, Translation Daily, and other English‑backed Chinese newspapers, for publishing the telegraphed speech of Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing Production and Construction Council without completing required submission procedures, were yesterday notified by the British Consular Office that, per the British ambassador, these papers are suspended for two weeks starting immediately.

Licenses Revoked  
The Municipal Council’s Intelligence Department announced that yesterday afternoon, the Council revoked the registration certificates of two Chinese newspapers—the American Daily and the Sino‑American Daily. The Council solemnly stated that the revocation was not due to publication of General Chiang Kai‑shek’s speech summary, nor failure to submit political speeches for special review as requested by the police chief. The real reason was that certain phrases in the published speeches were deemed incompatible with maintaining legal order within the Public Concession.

### Municipal Council Health Committee Holds First Meeting; Fears Future Import Difficulties; Considers Procuring Emergency Medical Supplies

On the 12th of this month, the Municipal Council Health Committee held its inaugural meeting of this term, electing Commissioner He Lai as chairman. Among the proposals discussed were:

(1) Leasing the Hongkou Open‑Air Swimming Pool  
The Health Department received several applications to lease the Hongkou pool. The pool and filtration system require repairs estimated at 7,000 yuan. A majority of the committee favored leasing by tender to avoid indefinite closure. Bidders of any nationality may participate; the highest bidder wins. It was decided to recommend the board require the lessee to deposit 7,000 yuan in cash to cover repairs, refundable once the pool reopens to the public. During the lease, the lessee bears repair responsibility. The board retains discretion in awarding the lease.

(2) Japanese Expatriate Hospital  
The Japanese Residents’ Association claimed existing Japanese hospital facilities are insufficient and requested a free lease of a hospital to accommodate indigent Japanese patients. The committee deemed the request reasonable and will propose that the board allow lease of the Chinese Isolation Hospital on Haining Road, allocating 15,000 yuan for repairs and charging a nominal annual rent of 100 yuan.

(3) Dental Clinic  
The British Women’s Association requested establishment of a free dental clinic for the poor. While sympathetic, the committee felt existing funds have more urgent public health uses and decided to postpone action.

(4) Stockpiling Emergency Medical Supplies  
Fearing future import difficulties, the committee considered purchasing various medicines, bandages, and surgical supplies for emergencies. It resolved to recommend board approval in principle, with detailed planning and budgeting to be decided jointly by the health and finance department heads.

All recommendations were approved by the board at its regular meeting on the 17th.

### Commodities Seized in Guerrilla Zones; Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Ban—Fifty Companies Including Jiufeng

To ban goods in guerrilla warfare areas that have been seized, controlled, or exploited, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has notified provincial and municipal governments: under Article 2 of the Banning Regulations, any goods of factories or businesses within guerrilla zones that have been seized, controlled, or exploited should be designated for ban by this Ministry at any time. It has been determined that fifty factories and businesses within guerrilla zones—including Jiufeng Flour Mill Co., Ltd.—have been seized, controlled, or exploited. All products from these concerns are now banned. Telegrams have been sent to provincial governments under the Ministry of Finance, instructing local customs and relevant authorities to enforce the ban. Industry associations in each province and city are to notify their members not to purchase these banned goods; violators may be reported by their associations to the government for investigation. In the Beijing‑Shanghai‑Suzhou‑Wuxi region, if a banned factory reestablishes production in other rear or safe areas with no relation to the original operators, its products may be distinguished from those of the original factory. Original factory owners may draft proposals for differentiation, submit them for Ministry approval, and, once approved, have their new products released separately.

### Holiday Camp for Jewish Children to Be Established at Hongqiao

### Ningbo Defense Commander Specifically Authorizes Resumption of Ningbo Service; Ship Mofu Arrived in Shanghai Two Days Ago, Scheduled to Sail for Ningbo Tomorrow Morning; Gaodeng to Resume Ninghai–Ningbo Route Today

To facilitate cargo transport, the Ningbo Defense Commander has, in addition to permitting the Ningbo–Dinghai and Shanghai–Dinghai routes to resume service, approved the Shanghai–Ningbo route. Vessels on these routes must apply for prior approval. German firm Lihe & Co.’s ship Mofu arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday and is scheduled to depart directly for Ningbo tomorrow morning. The Japanese side has continued to oppose foreign vessels resuming Ningbo service—evidenced by the forced return of the De Ping ship carrying medical supplies to Ningbo—but Mofu has negotiated with the Japanese side and reportedly obtained approval.

Gaodeng to Sail to Dinghai; Ningbo–Dinghai Service Restored  
Although the Ningbo–Dinghai route was approved for resumption, the Portuguese firm Zhengde Co.’s Libo, German firm Shiyide Co.’s Tianbao, and German firm Lulin Co.’s Gaodeng were successively detained by the Japanese side, interrupting the route. Now that Gaodeng has been released through the German consul’s intervention, it was originally to have sailed from Shanghai to Dinghai yesterday to resume the Ningbo–Dinghai route. Due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been rescheduled to depart today (the 19th) at 3 p.m. directly for Dinghai. Thereafter it will serve exclusively the Ningbo–Dinghai line.

Hanna Maintains Shanghai–Dinghai Service  
The Far East Company of Germany’s Hanna, after receiving Ningbo Defense Commander approval for the Shanghai–Dinghai route, found operations difficult and planned to switch to the Shanghai–Wenzhou line. However, to maintain the Shanghai–Dinghai service, it will continue on that route. The company’s notice reads: “The German ship Hanna will sail directly to Dinghai at 4 p.m. on May 19, berthing at Jinliyuan Wharf. For business, please contact our manager at No. 5 Cathay Temple Street, French Concession.”

### Refugees at Cade Shelter Plead to Delay Eviction

At No. 742 Jing’an Temple Road, the Cilian General Association’s Cade Refugee Shelter houses over 800 refugees, mostly dock workers and nearby factory employees with jobs. Recently, the property owner, Bank of China, leased the premises for a cinema. The Municipal Council Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the owner signed an agreement requiring vacation of the premises by the 22nd of this month, with plans to relocate all refugees to the First Refugee Shelter on Duxin Road. This has caused extreme panic among refugees, as Duxin Road is remote in western Shanghai; relocation would place them too far from work, leading to mass unemployment and hardship. Refugees are now electing representatives to petition the Municipal Council Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the owner, pleading for a two‑month extension to find alternatives or to be relocated to a more suitable site that will not disrupt their livelihoods. Whether they will succeed is uncertain. Refugees are resolute and appeal to all sectors for assistance to achieve a satisfactory resolution.

### Yongan Opera Society Completes Fundraising through Performances; Ticket Sales Total Over 34,000 Yuan

To aid refugees from Shanghai and Guangdong, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Guangdong Fellow‑Townsmen Relief Committee for Guangdong Refugees in Shanghai, and two Benevolent Societies arranged with Yongan Company’s Yongan Opera Society to perform Cantonese opera for six nights starting the evening of the 11th at the Huangjin Grand Theater. Concerned citizens generously purchased tickets, and the event concluded successfully. Ticket sales are tallied as follows: Yongan Company, 16,036 yuan; Refugee Association, 3,000 yuan; Sincere Department Store, 1,700 yuan; Dashin Department Store, 1,510 yuan; Taihexing, 1,050 yuan; Lihua Company, 1,030 yuan; Feng Bingnan, 1,025 yuan; Xin Xin, Li Ji, each 1,000 yuan; Chaozhou Troupe, He Quansheng, each 600 yuan; Chen Qizhao, 500 yuan; Zhang Zaiyou, 295 yuan; Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, China Tea Company, Pan Zhiquan, each 200 yuan; Chen Qifen, 131 yuan; Jiang Hechun, 120 yuan; Sang Yunzhai, 120 yuan; Shenxin Yarn Mill, 110 yuan; plus 100 yuan each from Hongzhang Dye Mill, Guangdong Bank, Fang Yusheng, Gan Chixian, Miss Feng, Pan Chengbo; and other donations under 100 yuan through the Fundraising Office’s sales and five additional donations totaling 2,972 yuan. The grand total is 34,099 yuan.

### April Hospitality Industry Refugee Donation Results

Over 24,400 yuan

The Shanghai City Hospitality Industry Association’s refugee donation drive totaled 26,200 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen in March; the funds have been forwarded and official receipts obtained. The April drive concluded yesterday with a total of 24,438 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen. Of this, the Eastern Hotel contributed the most, amounting to 1,380.86 yuan; the Yangtze Hotel next with 1,165.07 yuan; and third was the Nanjing Hotel with 1,023.02 yuan. The total has now been reported to the Refugee Relief Association.

### Shanghai Post Office Ordered to Change Examination Regulations: Junior Postal Clerks to Have Two Tests; Registration by the 22nd of This Month

The Shanghai Post Office recently received a directive from the General Administration to revise the examination regulations for junior postal clerks. The new rules are as follows: the first and second tests are combined into one, and the third test (the oral interview) becomes the second. The first examination will be held on June 4. Anyone who passed last year’s first test and wishes to sit for this session may be exempted from the three similar subjects of the combined first test. Candidates must, before the 22nd of this month, present their first-test passing certificate—issued by this office—to collect an application form. Once completed, they must submit the form along with their certificate and three photographs to the bureau. Those already registered need not apply again.

### Post Office Resumes Sending Large and Small Parcels to Yunnan and Guizhou; Bulk Commodity Parcels Still Not Accepted

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday stating, “From today onward, all large and small parcels bound for Yunnan and Guizhou provinces may be accepted.” However, bulk commodity packages remain suspended due to transportation disruptions.

### Chinese Guerrilla Forces Once Broke into Tongxiang

A refugee who arrived in Shanghai from Tongxiang yesterday reported that on the night of the 13th, Chinese guerrilla forces attacked Tongxiang and fought fiercely with the Japanese garrison there. A portion of the Chinese forces penetrated through the North Small Gate into the Chongshi Primary School and set fire to the county government building. The Japanese then dispatched additional battalions for a counterattack and sent aircraft to drop bombs, forcing the Chinese troops to withdraw to their original defenses. On the same day, as the Japanese advanced, they also bombarded Puyuan—over ten li from Tongxiang—with artillery, destroying several civilian homes there.

### Consoling Ningbo’s Bombed Countrymen: National Government Allocates Emergency Funds; Thirty Thousand Yuan Already Distributed to Households; Ningbo Fellows in Shanghai Enthusiastically Contribute

Ningbo suffered eight air raids by Japanese planes, resulting in many civilian casualties. To aid the victims and expedite relief work, the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association first advanced 10,000 yuan to the relief headquarters in Ningbo and actively solicited donations in Shanghai. Fellow villagers here responded with great generosity. According to the association, the National Government Relief Committee, deeply moved by the plight of the Ningbo victims, has authorized the Zhejiang Provincial Office to allocate 30,000 yuan for emergency relief. The relevant telegram from the Sixth District Commissioner’s office reads as follows (omitting the beginning):  
“Reports of repeated air raids on Yin County have moved the Central Government to set aside 30,000 yuan in national currency, transferred via the Jinhua Farmers’ Bank. Please inform the Yin County magistrate to conduct a detailed survey of each affected household. Provide 20 yuan for each family with a fatality; 10 to 15 yuan for seriously wounded; 4 to 8 yuan for lightly wounded. Issue payment receipts accordingly and mail them to this office. Await further instructions.  
—Wang Xiyin, Member and Commissioner, Zhejiang Office, Central Relief Committee.”

### Chinese Army Advances North of the Qiantang River, Strengthening Mobile Strategy; Military Personnel Arrive in Pudong; Future Operations Under Unified Command

According to reports from the Pudong guerrilla region, regular Chinese army units advancing northward along the Qiantang River consist of four divisions organized under the latest wartime structure. Each division comprises 20,000 to 25,000 men (5,000 to 10,000 more than peacetime strength), totaling 80,000 to 90,000 soldiers. Of these, 30,000 to 40,000 have entered the Shanghai–Hangzhou line area. Experienced military officers have been dispatched to various guerrilla zones to convey high command’s orders to irregular mobile units and to coordinate command between regular and irregular forces, thereby strengthening liaison. In the Pudong and Punan areas, guerrilla contingents under Ding Xichu, Tao Sheng, and Zhang Huifang have all received such officers, who have been instructed that henceforth all actions must obey regular army orders and no unauthorized advances or retreats are allowed. Irregular groups compelled by circumstances to defect are also welcome to return and be granted opportunities for rehabilitation. It is confirmed that most puppet “army” units have sent representatives to negotiate, and the situation is showing significant change.

Jiaxing Puppet Army Redeployment

Along the Shanghai–Hangzhou Railway, the puppet unit commanded by Xu Pucheng in Jiaxing, under orders from Yamada, Commander-in-Chief of Japanese forces in Central China, has been redeployed to defend Hangzhou. The Hucheng defensive duties left behind have been filled by Japanese garrison troops. The railway’s Japanese forces are now severely depleted, most having been concentrated along the Beijing–Hangzhou Highway and around Hangzhou to guard against Chinese attacks.

Japanese Troops Withdraw from Huangdu

Chinese guerrilla units active near the Jiwangchao area in western Shanghai clashed with Japanese forces. Under the command of Colonel Zhao, leader of the Fourth Company of the Fourth Detachment, Third District Provincial Security Corps of Jiangsu Province, more than 100 Chinese soldiers launched a surprise assault on the Japanese, who then withdrew from Huangdu. Dozens of Japanese were killed, and the Chinese captured two machine guns and over ten rifles.

### Korean Rōnin Establish Drug Trafficking Ring; Initially Busted and Arrested but Released; Continued Operations and Busted Again; Chinese Lookouts Sentenced to Three-and-a-Half Years

Since the puppet regime legalized opium sales, narcotics have also flowed into the International Settlement. Despite strict crackdowns by the foreign authorities, many criminals, lured by high profits, continue to traffic in secret. Recently, an unemployed ruffian nicknamed “Love Much Hemp Hide” teamed up with Korean rōnin to set up a drug ring at No. 14, Lane 53, Xiamen Road, selling heroin. Business was booming, with over 400 yuan of drugs sold daily. Detectives Feng Xiushan and Liu Zhaotian of the Old Town Police Station and officers from the Japanese Consulate Police raided the site on the 5th of this month, arresting two Koreans and seizing narcotics, then handing them over to the Japanese consulate. Two days ago, Feng and Liu received word that the Koreans had been released and were operating at the same location. They and consulate officers returned, capturing Koreans Won Ik-cheng, Ji Changzhu, and Bae Sun-gi, as well as a Chinese lookout, Sun Shengcai. An on-site masseur, Gao Fuhai, had picked up a packet of heroin from the floor and was also arrested. Later, they found another Korean, Kim Seong-jin, at No. 8, Lane 112, Fujian Road, and seized over 60 more packets of heroin. The ringleader Peng Ziyu (nicknamed “Little Uncle-in-Law”) escaped. The Koreans were sent back to the Japanese consulate for interrogation, while Sun Shengcai and Gao Fuhai were delivered yesterday morning to the Special Court No. 1, Criminal Division I. Counsel Ru Baoyi and Chen Ming documented the arrests and requested legal penalties. Sun Shengcai admitted he served as lookout for one yuan per day at Love Much Hemp Hide’s introduction. Gao Fuhai said he picked up the heroin intending to turn it over to police, but was arrested. After court-appointed attorney Wu Zhiping defended them, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye sentenced Sun Shengcai to three years and six months’ imprisonment as a warning; Gao Fuhai was acquitted and released.

### Accountant Chen Xianmo’s Opinion on War Losses: Listing Losses as Deferred Assets; Accountants in Full Agreement

The handling of war-related losses was first proposed by Accountant Xi Yushu and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Experts have since submitted their opinions. The Shanghai Association of Accountants convened two committee meetings to discuss the matter. Accountant Chen Xianmo offered the following view:  
“The objective is to protect enterprises. First, since the outbreak of hostilities, many corporate enterprises have suffered losses exceeding one-third of their capital. Under the Company Law, a shareholders’ meeting should be convened to report this. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has amended these regulations, and law is not immutable. Furthermore, if a company’s assets become clearly insufficient to cover its debts due to war losses, it should declare bankruptcy. By this measure alone, many corporate enterprises would currently qualify as insolvent. It would be unwise to rigidly apply the old statutes without regard to human circumstances. As the saying goes, law is for the people. Regarding the interim regulations, many examples exist where wartime rules have superseded peacetime law. Clearly, treating war losses as deferred assets meets the practical needs of business and is sometimes unavoidable. Thus, although there was heated debate at the first committee meeting, by the second meeting there was unanimous approval.  
“Second, having agreed to list war losses as deferred assets, the question arises whether surplus earnings should be used to pay dividends and bonuses. The Ministry’s directive implies that once losses are deferred, any remaining profits might be available for distribution. However, to balance corporate and shareholder interests, Xi Yushu proposed that if an enterprise’s earnings are ample, it may distribute dividends but suspend bonuses. This point was ratified by all at the accountants’ meeting. Accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo further suggested capping dividend distributions at 5%. These dividend proposals will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. In short, temporary legal amendments during wartime are neither rare nor unprecedented.”

### Exhibition of Invitations and Memorial Notices: Exceptionally Rich Collection

The joint exhibition of invitation cards and memorial notices organized by the city’s banking and cultural circles has been in preparation for three months, with meticulous efforts to collect every type of card. Invitations and notices have been solicited from all schools in the city—large, medium, and small—and all responded enthusiastically. Recently, the committee received countless items, including many rare pieces. One highlight is the elaborate marriage invitation of Zhang Saiwei’s daughter Ziyi—a luxurious album bound in clay-cover boards, its label printed in imitation Song-style characters, detailing all marriage rites from the coming-of-age ceremony (guanli) through the wedding (hunli). Other treasures include the mourning announcement of President Li Yuanhong and the thank-you note of the late Qing scholar Yu Yue. According to the exhibition’s organizer, a preview held at the Bankers’ Association drew high praise. The formal opening is set for the 31st of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yuqiaqing Road. Tickets are priced at three jiao, and all proceeds will be donated to refugees. Commemorative medals engraved with rare invitation motifs and a special exhibition brochure will also be issued. The exhibition runs for one week, closing on June 6.

### White Tiger Gang Active at Pudong’s Individual Wharves

The White Tiger organization has been very active along the Pudong wharves, dispatching ruffians by boat each night to loot cotton from foreign warehouses and ships along the river. Their attacks, carried out in large gangs, have been rampant. Late the night before last, Customs and the Water Patrol Station apprehended nine ruffians in central Pudong, who named the ringleaders Xiao Defu, Lu Miaojin, Zhu Wenyuan, Xiao Jiangfu, and Lu Baishi. Yesterday, all suspects were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation, and a manhunt has been ordered for their accomplices. Additionally, at the alley entrance to Chang Wharf in Pudong, another White Tiger cell led by puppet “Self-Defense Corps” commander Yao Jinxiang, Japanese translator Yang “Big Baozi,” and ruffians Chen Chaosheng and Chen Qiaosheng have nightly looted large quantities of cotton. Owing to jurisdictional limits in Pudong, they remain at large.

### After the Death of Songjiang Tycoon Qian Xuanqing, Woman Demands Division of Estate; Nephew Also Files Same Claim; Parties Advised to Reconcile Out of Court

The principal wife of Songjiang tycoon Qian Xuanqing, Madam Zhou, predeceased him, leaving two daughters. The elder, Qian Runwen, married a Mr. Han and bore five sons—Han Jiefan, Zan Yu, Chunshou, Shengjue, and Shengqi—all now residing at No. 16, Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. The younger daughter, Qian Runduan, age 36, married a Mr. Tang and lives at No. 59, Xinglong Village, Pushi Road, Shanghai. Qian Xuanqing also had a concubine, Xie Jianjia, who bore him five children—Qian Runlin, Runhu, Runci, Runliang, and Runming—all residing at No. 2, Xiafei Lane, Beitilu Road, Shanghai. Qian Xuanqing died in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. His estate is substantial, including 3,970 acres of prime farmland in Zhangkan, Qiwu, Songjiang County, and west of Shanghai Hongqiao Airport; five houses and over 30 acres of land in Songjiang; and movable assets comprising shares in Shanghai Yongyu Pawnshop, Xinyuan Pawnshop, the World Book Company, gold ornaments, and other items valued at 519,000 yuan in national currency. These assets are controlled by Xie Jianjia and her children Qian Runlin and Runliang. It is reported that Tang Qian Runduan and the five grandsons through Qian Runwen (one of whom, Han Jiefan, is deceased), along with lawyers Yan Jiang, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren, have filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court under Articles 1138 and 1140 of the Civil Code. They accuse Xie Jianjia and her children Qian Runlin, Runhu, Runci, Runming, and Runliang of withholding the entire estate and request division into seven equal shares. The first plaintiff, Tang Qian Runduan, demands one‑seventh; plaintiffs two through six (the five grandsons) also each claim one‑seventh. Yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu of Civil Division VII summoned both parties for testimony; defendants Qian Runlin et al. were represented by attorneys Zhang Yipeng and Xu Jiaji, who pleaded their case. Judge Ma briefly questioned both sides, then adjourned for a later hearing and urged the parties to reconcile out of court.

### Rickshaw Puller, Beset by Poverty and Illness, Commits Suicide by Jumping into Well

Wang Liansheng, 51, from Nantong, made his living pulling a rickshaw in Shanghai and lived alone at No. 42, Yuanshengli Lane 326, Caishi Road, French Concession. Last month he fell ill and could not afford treatment, and his condition worsened. Driven by poverty and illness, he took his own life by jumping into the well outside his back door on the evening of the 17th. Fellow lodgers rescued him from the water but found him already dead. The police arranged for his body to be taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Hall morgue. Yesterday, the Special District No. 2 Court’s chief prosecutor examined the body and concluded that Wang’s death was due to suicide by drowning after illness. With no next of kin, the authorities handed the remains to the Benevolent Society for burial. The Special District Rickshaw Pullers’ Mutual Aid Association has agreed to cover the funeral expenses.

### Kidnapping Girls for Prostitution; Five Convicted

Three women—Mrs. Deng Yang of Jiangbei, residing in a bungalow on Hede Road; Mrs. Zhu Lu; and Mrs. Zhang Wang of Nanjing—conspired to lure a 16‑year‑old Jiangbei girl, He Gendi; a 14‑year‑old girl, Gao Gendi; and a 16‑year‑old Tianjin girl, Chen Xiuying, by claiming they would secure jobs at Yangshupu Textile Mill paying one yuan per day. They secretly took them to a brothel at No. 10, Zhiheli, Yunhe Lane, Yunheli, owned by Mrs. Feng Lu, and confined them upstairs as prostitutes. The girls resisted and wept all day. From April 25 at 11:00 AM to the 28th at 4:00 PM, Mrs. Feng Lu’s husband, Feng Zhengbiao (a Chinese detective at the Old Town Police Station), refused to release them. When the case came to light, officers from Putuo Road Police Station’s Chinese and Western detective units arrested the five—Deng Yang, Zhu Lu, Zhang Wang, Feng Lu, and Feng Zhengbiao—and brought them before the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi of Criminal Division III sentenced Deng Yang to three years’ imprisonment; Zhang Wang to one year and six months; Zhu Lu to five years; Feng Lu to one year and six months; and Feng Zhengbiao to ten months, as a warning to others.

### A Curious Case in Fahuazhen: Detective Arrested During Investigation; Puppet Precinct Officer Slapped

Reported yesterday: At 12:30 PM, Chinese detective Wang Jinsheng of the Jing’an Temple Road Police Station was ordered to Fahuazhen to handle a case. He and two other detectives rushed to West Fahuazhen. Because the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, they first met at the puppet police station with puppet precinct officer Wei. Together they proceeded to Deji gambling den in East Fahuazhen, then in full swing with gamblers in attendance. Upon entering the den and mounting the stairs to the third floor accounting room to state their business, they found several Japanese staff from the “West Shanghai Entertainment Supervision Department” inside. When questioned, Wang declared his purpose, but the Japanese rebuked him for not coordinating with the Japanese military police. Wang replied he had already met with the puppet police station personnel. The Japanese, enraged, slapped Officer Wei several times, then produced handcuffs to arrest the three detectives. Wang protested his status as a public official, but to no avail. Overpowered, he was escorted downstairs by Japanese staff and taken to the Japanese Supervision Office on Yuguo Road, where he remains in custody as of press time.

### Young Girl Just Escaped Tiger’s Den, Then Raped by Fisherman; Woman Yang Xiuqin’s Sinister Motives; Group of Men and Women Arrested

A ten‑year‑old girl, Yang Xiaojiu, from Yangzhou, had been living with her blind mother in her hometown when she was kidnapped and brutally abused by foreign settlers. After losing her virginity, she managed to escape and return home, where she told her mother of the trauma. Fearing further assault, her mother sought help from fellow villager Mrs. Yao Zhu and brought her to Shanghai. Unbeknownst to the child, Mrs. Yao Zhu promptly handed her over to matchmaker Mrs. Yang Xiuqin of Suzhou in exchange for over 200 yuan. Having escaped one danger, the girl fell into another: on the afternoon of the day before last, Mrs. Yang introduced her to fisherman Xu Huaizhou of Jiangbei, who took her to a room at the Carde Hotel on Carde Road in western Shanghai and raped her. The girl endured threats and saw no means of escape until detectives from the jurisdiction learned of the crime, raided the hotel, and arrested all involved. The girl was sent for medical examination, while the two women and Xu were detained. Yesterday morning they were brought before the First Special District Court; police counsel Li Zhishan demanded severe punishment under the law. Judge Xiao, citing public morals, barred spectators and reserved judgment. Initially, all defendants denied wrongdoing, but under repeated questioning and the spotlight of the courtroom, they confessed—except Xu Huaizhou, who, defended by attorneys Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, claimed the encounter was consensual at Mrs. Yang Xiuqin’s instigation and involved payment, not rape. The court remanded all defendants pending sentence.

### Ordnance Discovered in the Accounting Office at Roosevelt Wharf; Items Reported and Taken In for Inspection

Yesterday at about 2:00 PM, during inventory at the accounting office of the new channel at Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession, staff moved all miscellaneous items outside and found a heavy wooden box over two zhang in length. Uncertain of its contents, they pried it open and discovered four rifles, more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and numerous other munitions. As this concerned military ordnance, the company notified the Xiaodongmen Police Station, whose officers seized the weapons and the box for further investigation.

### Massage Girl, Pregnant, Takes Poison; Lover Avoids Meeting; Girl in Despair Attempts Suicide

Ye Axiang, 22, of Yangzhou, lived with her mother and maternal grandfather at No. 22, Bing’anli, Alake Road, French Concession. While working as a masseuse at a salon on Yuqiaqing Road, she became involved with a customer, 30‑year‑old Tianjin man Li Yuwen. She became pregnant, now five or six months along, and could no longer work. As her due date approached, she repeatedly sought out Li to arrange for the birth, but he evaded her. Distraught after fruitless visits, she took poison at home around 5:00 PM on the 17th. Her grandfather discovered her and called the police, who sent her to Guangci Hospital. Her poisoning was too severe, and she died at 8:00 PM that night. The hospital notified the police, who transferred her body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Hall morgue. Today the Special District No. 2 Court will dispatch an official for a death investigation.

### White-robed Man Organizes Gang to Commit Violence, Injuring Carriage Drivers

Drivers Wu Zhenhua, Zhuo Shiliang, and Gao Rongsheng of Xiangsheng Automobile Company went yesterday (17th) afternoon to dine at Fuxing Restaurant opposite Zhaofeng Park on Yuyuan Road. At that time, owing to the crowding of diners, Wu’s foot was stepped on painfully by a mourner named Wang Agen. A verbal dispute ensued, and Wang summoned his followers Wang Shaoxiang, Xi Yusheng, Lü Zhicai, and others, who rushed into the kitchen, seized kitchen knives and spatulas from the staff, and engaged in a violent fight with Wu Zhenhua and the others. Outnumbered, Wu had his leg slashed and Zhuo Shiliang suffered a deep cut to the head. Their injuries were severe. Nearby Chinese constable Hua, on duty, hurried to the scene and arrested the assailants Wang Shaoxiang, Xi Yusheng, and Lü Zhicai. The injured Wu Zhenhua and companions were taken by carriage to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning the police station escorted the defendants to the First Special Court, Criminal Division Eight, charging them with assault. Judge Fang convened the hearing, but as the victims were too severely injured to appear, the court took brief statements from the defendants and ordered them remanded, with the hearing postponed to a later date.

### Case of Patrol Officers’ Pistols Seized: Two More Accomplices Arrested, Remanded for Joint Trial

On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, between 9 p.m. and about 1 a.m. the next morning, at No. 211 Binglang Road at the Witai Printing and Dyeing Factory, clerk-constable Hua and two constables at Nos. 3337 and 3416 Gordon Road, while on duty near Changping Road and Xianping Road, were relieved of three service pistols in succession by robbers. On the previous afternoon at 6 o’clock, at Tianguan Restaurant, No. 15 Binglang Road, Detective Chief Zhu Hanpo of the Gordon Road police station arrested the suspect Li Xiaowuzi, a native of Fuping, Jiangbei. Two other suspects surnamed Li were also arrested, and one of the stolen “Xiaoma” brand pistols from the Witai Factory was recovered. They were delivered to the First Special District Court and remanded on the 17th at 5:10 p.m. Handling the case, the Sino-Western detective later apprehended accomplices at Zhifengyuan Restaurant, No. 225 Changping Road: Yin Huaixue and Ma Qifu, both from Jiangbei, who were taken into custody. At dawn yesterday they were brought before Criminal Division Three, where prosecutor Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that investigation revealed the two defendants, together with the already detained Li suspects, had:

(1) On the 11th of this month, on Laobosheng Road at No. 1486, shot at and attempted to kill a constable;  
(2) Robbed one pistol from the Witai Factory clerk-constable at No. 181;  
(3) Robbed two pistols from constables at Nos. 3337 and 3416;  
(4) On the evening of the 9th, stole property worth 173 yuan from Dachang Rice Shop at No. 257 Singapore Road.

He requested that proceedings be consolidated and postponed for joint questioning with Li Xiaowuzi and the others. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the two, they were remanded, with the joint hearing date to be announced.

### Qichang Wharf Incident: Patrolman Beaten

A Russian patrolman and a Chinese night watch leader employed at the British firm Jardine, Matheson & Co.’s Qichang Line Wharf in Pudong were assaulted twice by workers from the Japanese Field Post Office. The company reported the matter to the British Consulate, which took it up with the Japanese authorities. The incidents occurred on Sunday (14th) and Monday (15th) at the Japanese Field Post Office housed within the South Seas Tobacco Company in Hongkou. More than a hundred Chinese laborers employed there commuted daily via ferry from Gonghexiong Wharf in Pudong, under the supervision of a European manager. On the afternoon of the 14th at about 5 p.m., over a hundred laborers returned by ferry from Hongkou; after disembarking, about ten began kicking a ball on the wharf’s open ground. Fearing disorder or broken windows, the Russian patrolman politely intervened. In response, head foreman and translator Yang Wenjin, small foreman Wu Miaosheng, Yang Kun, Peng A’er, and others directed laborers to surround and brutally beat him. Chinese night watch leader Aju attempted to mediate but was also severely beaten. Aju’s whistle was mistaken by the wharf fire brigade for a fire alarm, and responding members were also attacked. With no responsible official on duty during the holiday, the workers departed after achieving their aim. On the morning of the 15th at about 7 a.m., the same group of post office workers, including over ten Japanese, returned by ferry from Hongkou, dragged the wounded Russian officer from his recovery and beat him again with iron rods and other weapons, inflicting a head wound and severe injuries. The European manager, alerted by the commotion, intervened, and the assailants finally returned to Hongkou. The injured patrolman was taken to the hospital. Pudong General Office reported the incident to the British Consulate, which negotiated with the Japanese military. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, two Japanese naval officers and an interpreter, together with the chief supervisor of Gonghexiong Wharf, visited the scene in Pudong to investigate the assaults, with a view to punishing the perpetrators and preventing future incidents.

Enticement to Criminal Acts, Abuse, and Abandonment – Woman Sues for Support; Awaiting Injury Report for Further Hearing

Cheng Baohua, a 26-year-old woman from Qingpu, represented by attorney Yuan Zunying, and accompanied by her four-year-old son Zhong Xiaomao, filed a complaint yesterday in the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court against Zhong Xuchu (25, native of Hubei, residing at No. 9 Dakang Lane, Bai’er Road–Wangzhi Road intersection). She alleges that the defendant lured her into illicit cohabitation and, upon discovering she had no husband, abused and then abandoned her and their child. She seeks criminal prosecution under Articles 229, 277, 286, 293, and 294 of the Criminal Code and, in a related civil action, requests that the court require the defendant to pay her 30 yuan per month for support until age 60 and 20 yuan per month for the child’s maintenance and education until age 20.

According to her statement, she arrived in Shanghai in November of the 24th year [1935], was seduced by the defendant’s claim of being unmarried, and cohabited with him at No. 7 Xiesheng Li, Laoshengu Road, until December 20 of the same year when she gave birth to a boy, the second complainant Xiaomao. She repeatedly urged him to marry her, but he delayed with various excuses. In November last year he brought her to his home, where she learned he had a wife. After reproaching him, he began to abuse her. On March 22 this year he beat Xiaomao’s left foot, and on March 26 he again beat Cheng’s chest. She reported him to the police station, and he was detained overnight, but thereafter he abandoned them. She then requested an injury examination from the prosecutor’s office. She asks the court to proceed accordingly and to order the defendant to meet living expenses as noted. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang opened the hearing and summoned both parties. After brief statements from each side, the court ordered the case files from the prosecutor’s injury examination and adjourned for further hearing.

National Medicine and Dietary Therapy

### Shad (Hilsa) Fish

— Chen Jiazhen

According to Li Shizhen’s Compendium of Materia Medica, “Shad fish is also called plague fish.” The origin of this name is unknown. People call it hilsa because it appears only in early summer, marking the season. The shad is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic. Though its composition has not been chemically analyzed, its rich, fatty flesh implies a high lipid content. Fish meat generally contains abundant phosphorus and protein, and hilsa is no exception. Some say its composition resembles turtle liver oil, though there is no conclusive proof. Today many savor hilsa for its flavor yet neglect its medicinal value, eating the flesh and discarding the scales—what a shame!

Shad flesh is usually served with meals or wine, but its therapeutic effects are remarkable and it can be used externally. Briefly:

(1) Internal Tonifier. Meng Shen said, “Shad can replenish deficiency.” Zhang Luyu said, “Shad is tonifying, warms the middle, and boosts qi.” Modern doctor Wang Jimin also asserted, “Fish liver oil is extracted from turtle liver as a supreme lung tonic. China’s hilsa has similar effects. Fifty years ago, British physician McGovern, then residing in Ningbo, claimed it could treat tuberculosis.”

(2) External Remedy for Burns. The Ningyuan Materia Medica states, “Steam the hilsa flesh, collect the oil in a jar buried in earth, and apply the ointment to scalds and burns with great effect.”

When harvesting shad scales, do so when the fish is alive, plucking two scales from the dorsal region; longer, pointed scales are best. Scales from dead fish are far inferior. The scales also have these uses:

(1) Treating scalds and burns. The classic Fengyuan Materia Medica says, “For scalds and burns, apply hilsa scales fried in sesame oil; immediate effect.”

(2) Treating bleeding nevi. Cai Yunbai said, “If a person’s birthmark bleeds uncontrollably, apply a hilsa scale; it immediately forms a scab and heals.”

韮菜青菜

— Nanzi

Zhou Ying of the Jin dynasty lived simply, despising city life; he spent his days at home tending vegetable plots with wine for pleasure. He particularly loved chives and bok choy, claiming no delicacy could surpass them. He said, “Early spring chives and late autumn bok choy sustain one through the long year.” Wealthy urbanites scorn such humble garden greens while Zhou delighted in them. Chives prefer moist soil near water and even more shade. Though not regarded as gourmet fare, Hunan and Jiangxi locals prize them; villagers always plant chives much like herbalists rely on licorice. In mid-spring, tender yellow-green chive leaves are lovely and palatable; after a month their flavor wanes, though new shoots replace them. By late summer they become waxy and tasteless, yet the fresh shoots are even more delicious—a curious marvel. Chives suit digestive health and villagers use chive roots to treat bruises, centipede and snake bites, reputedly invigorating blood.

Bok choy, called qingcai by Hunan natives—a puzzling name—thrives in cold seasons, though some varieties grow any time. In Shanghai, bok choy is abundant. Mild in flavor and nourishing, it contains many vitamins, as Westerners note. Simply eating vegetables and plain rice benefits body and mind without question. Bok choy also prefers moisture and frost; winter frosts improve its flavor. Young shoots of bok choy are prime for stir-frying with meat. After winter, when leaves yellow, villagers pull up and sun-dry the roots, pickle them as “salted greens,” which are delicious stir-fried with cured meat or in soups. In these hard times, cultivating home vegetables is economical and healthful, serving both country and individuals well.

### Foods Suitable for Yin-Deficient Constitutions (Part II)

— Chen Cunren

(17) Soft-shelled Turtle Shell Soup—The hard shell of the soft-shelled turtle, sold in pharmacies as “biejia,” costs only 0.80 yuan per liang and is richest in yin-nourishing components. Take five qian daily with several red dates, boil and sip as tea; it treats yin deficiency with tidal fever, bone steaming, cheek flushing, and palm heat. Frequent drinking harms none.

(18) Garlic—Known to benefit the digestive tract and lungs, garlic supports lung health but does not cure tuberculosis. It is a supplementary food that nourishes the lungs and enhances resistance. Those accustomed may eat liberally; others should limit to one or two cloves daily. Avoid garlic when fever or internal heat from lung disease is severe. Raw garlic is best; pickled garlic is less potent.

(19) Chives—Also lung-nourishing, with effects similar to garlic but milder.

(20) Euryale Seeds, Chinese Yam, Lotus Plumule—These three foods, when eaten as snacks, help those with seminal emission issues, offering mild kidney reinforcement. Chronic cases may need medicinal treatment.

(21) Job’s Tears (Coix Seeds)—Also called “yimi,” coix has lung-clearing and nourishing effects, rich in protein, harmonizing and powerful. It aids damp elimination and guards against tuberculosis. Cook a bowl daily; those with yin deficiency or suspicion of lung issues can eat it regularly. Coix requires about four hours to cook and often contains weevil holes; pick carefully. If it appears milky or causes discomfort, discontinue.

(22) Lotus Root Starch—Excellent for those prone to hemoptysis, it nourishes blood and stops bleeding better than veal liver. Women with scant blood should also eat it. Genuine lotus starch is costly. Before the war, only Sanyou Industrial Co. sold authentic starch; it best aids recovery in hemoptysis. The white tablet starch sold in southern goods shops is often adulterated arrowroot or potato starch, forming a white jelly but not true lotus starch—an unfortunate shortage.

(23) Blood Soup—Chicken blood soup is extremely nourishing; pig blood soup has equal value. Once considered barbaric by Westerners, modern organotherapy has proven “blood begets blood.” Cooking chicken or pig blood with chicken broth or spinach heightens the effect.

(24) Cuttlefish—Has modest yin-nourishing ability and is not disadvantageous.

(25) Chicken Eggs—Long recognized for health maintenance, need no elaboration.

### Eating Cold Rice

— Ren Lide

Many people, to beat the summer heat, enjoy eating cold rice. In the morning they cook all three meals’ rice at once, then eat the chilled rice for lunch and dinner. This seems economical and refreshing, saving time. However, cold rice takes longer to digest because the stomach must generate extra heat to process it, and moisture loss in the cooled grains makes them harder and more reliant on stomach juices. These factors often lead to gastric problems. Is saving a little effort worth risking greater harm?

### After Weaning

— You

Weaning is a critical milestone for children, presenting significant challenges in care and nutrition. The difficulty arises partly from the abrupt change in environment and partly from the child’s developing habits. The end of nursing marks the start of a new life stage: gradually replacing breast milk with adult foods. If a child feels uneasy losing the nursing habit, caregivers must patiently teach drinking from cups and eating from bowls. Once the new feeding routine is established, nursing will fade naturally.

Form is one matter; substance another. After weaning, besides matching flavors and textures to the child’s preferences, the physical properties of food are crucial. Hard or tough foods hinder digestion and can injure the child’s digestive tract. Initially, thin congee mixed with fresh beef or young chicken broth is best, helping the child gain weight in a month. After a month, introduce fiber-rich vegetables such as bok choy, spinach, celery, lettuce, and amaranth, finely chopped into soups or thin congee, or baked into simple biscuits with flour. Both raw and cooked eggs, fresh milk, pork bone broth, orange juice, yam, and well-cooked beans can also be given. Portions should suit the child’s appetite—rather, give small amounts more frequently—and avoid overfeeding. Additionally, regular sun and fresh air baths are essential.

### What Is “Miscellaneous Gastric Disorder”?

— Zhang Ruwei

Commonly Known as “Fire in the Stomach Disease”

When one’s diet is irregular or one’s emotions depressed, indigestion often follows: food is eaten yet the abdomen swells, even to the point of vomiting—this is due to excess gastric acid. Over time it easily develops into symptoms such as acid reflux and a sensation of food stuck in the chest. By contrast, the so‑called “miscellaneous” disorder behaves almost oppositely. With slight hunger the stomach immediately pains, and only eating brings relief; after a while the pain returns, growing worse day by day until one appears sallow and emaciated, spiritless and fatigued, unable to move. Simple miscellaneous gastric disorder often afflicts those with busy work schedules: irregular mealtimes, eating late when already full, or ignoring chilling foods; or working strenuously immediately after eating. Each day around eleven in the morning and five in the afternoon—just before lunch and dinner—the pain strikes violently, yet upon finishing a meal it disappears as if by magic. The cause lies in excess “fire” in the stomach, which causes the pain; a weakness of stomach qi, which drives one to rely on food for relief; but the food is consumed by the fire and yields no nourishment. Hence even though one continues eating, one remains yellowed, emaciated, and fatigued. 

Treatment should employ Xiao Jian Zhong Tang without cinnamon twig, adding one to two portions of Sichuan peony root and two to three qian of gardenia seed to harmonize liver and stomach; combine with licorice, wheat, and large dates to strengthen the spleen and gently harmonize the center. Also serve roasted Chinese yam mixed with lard and white sugar as a snack—soon recovery will be swift.

### Correction

In the last issue’s article on coix seed, the phrase “adding sugar makes it liable to produce disease” contained a misprint: the character for “disease” should have been the character for “phlegm.” In the monograph on foods for yin deficiency, the sentence “soft‑shelled turtle is turtle‑plastron soup” contained a misprint: the character for “is” was replaced by a similar but incorrect character.

### Finance: Rumors Dispelled, Spot Cash Market Plunges

Yesterday the spot cash market—red‑hot in off‑exchange trading—suddenly reversed violently, repeatedly breaking through the two thresholds at 2,140 yuan and 2,130 yuan. The catalyst was a report indicating that Britain, America, and France appeared poised to adopt a united, resolute stance on the Gulangyu incident, and that most of the Japanese landing forces had already withdrawn—signs of a gradually easing situation. All the rumors previously circulating in the market were thus dispelled. At the same time, it was learned that the Chinese and foreign banks in both concessions still refused to accept banknotes issued by the Hua Wo Bank, making it difficult to shake the entire Chinese financial establishment. Consequently market sentiment turned weary; goldsmiths, pawnshops, and cash exchange houses vied to dump holdings, and even a certain currency‑exchange concern that had recently bought in began liquidating. Although some bullion houses continued to add speculative purchases, the sellers’ momentum dominated, and the market price plunged, closing at a low of 2,127 yuan—down 17 yuan from the previous close. Trading volume remained flat, only about 600 taels of opening trades, while ornament‑gold prices at the silver shops fell by one yuan. Customs gold and 22‑carat pure gold remained unchanged.

Down 17 Yuan

From early morning—each bar of ten taels—sentiment weakened immediately. The first sellers called 2,110 yuan per tael, but buyers held back. Calls then gradually lowered until the silver‑shop syndicate sold 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,135 yuan as the opening price, nine yuan below the previous close. Shortly thereafter another bullion house absorbed 50 taels from fellow dealers at the same price. Cash exchange houses followed, selling 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,134 yuan. The bullion house’s interest waned and it kept pressing the price down. Money‑exchange brokers and dealers trailed by exchanging 50 taels at 2,131 yuan. Next the silver‑shop syndicate and cash exchange houses each sold 50 taels to the bullion house at 2,131 yuan. The selling intensified, immediately breaching the 2,130‑yuan level. Money‑exchange brokers offloaded a total of 100 taels to a bullion house, driving the price down to 2,128 yuan. Soon after, at the same price, brokers again transacted 50 taels. Thereafter the selling calmed and the price instantly rebounded two yuan when brokers bought 50 taels from cash exchange houses at 2,130 yuan. A bullion house then bought 50 taels from brokers at 2,129 yuan as the midday close. Afternoon trading was very thin—initially stable, with a bullion house selling 50 taels to brokers at 2,129 yuan. Thereafter silence reigned until about 3:30pm, when brokers sold 50 taels to a bullion house at 2,127 yuan, the market bearing a languid tone. After that the market quieted again. The evening close remained at 2,127 yuan—17 yuan below yesterday’s late close, with an intraday range of eight yuan. Cash exchange houses sold at 2,135 yuan and bought in at 2,120 yuan. Spot gold stayed roughly fifty yuan below the listed gold price, with no new opening trades.

Ornamental Gold Down Only One Yuan

The silver shops’ initial quotes for gold ornaments per tael remained unchanged. By 10:20am, as the spot cash market turned downward, they also listed prices one yuan lower: major firms at 217 yuan, newer houses at 215 yuan, with buy‑back at 109 yuan.

Pure Gold Unchanged as Before

London, 17th—Pure gold in London remained unchanged at 7 pounds 8 shillings 5½ pence per ounce. As a result, the Bank of China’s purchase price for Chinese cash silver stayed at 1,211 yuan 90 cents. The customs‑quoted gold price held steady at 2 yuan 39.96 fen, and Shanghai’s standard gold price remained at 1,207 yuan 20 cents.

### Foreign Exchange Forwards – Heavy Turnover in Resales

In yesterday’s foreign exchange market, spot rates moved little due to persistent offers from non‑bank speculators, though forward rates saw both profitable arbitrage (by Japanese banks and Tianjin syndicates) and heavy selling pressure from outside speculators. The overall tone was firm but somewhat rigid, with active trading. Swap rates tightened slightly. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market was rather stagnant, showing no clear gain or loss.

At the morning open, London sterling near and far forwards were unchanged; New York silver was steady, and London banknote gold saw no change. Exchange rates—sterling against the dollar, sterling against the Haikwan (Shanghai Customs tael), sterling against the franc, and likewise the dollar against sterling, Haikwan, and franc—were all flat. The central bank’s posted rates for all currencies remained as before. At the banks’ morning spot selling, sterling was 8s2½d, the U.S. dollar was 16.0625 yuan, both matching the previous close. After opening, foreign firms scrambled to absorb spot sterling and dollars, supplied jointly by British and American banks, yet rates held at 8s2½d and 16.0625 yuan. When HSBC announced its board rates, they also did not move. Upon publication of the silver balancing tax, there was no change, remaining at 5.5%. Meanwhile, profitable forward deals (by Japanese banks and Tianjin syndicates) continued: June sterling at 8s1.875d, July sterling at 8s1.25d, and June dollars at 15.9375 yuan. Despite ongoing arbitrage bids, heavy selling from speculators led Dutch firms to offer July dollars at 15.8125 yuan and 15.84375 yuan for arbitrage—a slightly firmer tone. Approaching noon, spot Hong Kong dollar traded at 55.375 yuan, the market calm. At the banks’ noon spot close, sterling and U.S. dollar rates matched the morning; the Hong Kong dollar remained at 55.375 yuan.

Subsequently, profitable forward sales first covered by purchasing McGeary & Co.’s spot sterling at 8s2½d, then by purchasing China & Co.’s spot dollars at 16.0625 yuan; foreign houses also bought China & Co.’s spot dollars at 16.0625 yuan. Supply and demand balanced, leaving the market unchanged. Afterwards, Anderton & Co. supplied foreign houses with spot Hong Kong dollar at 55.375 yuan—also steady. At the evening close, banks’ spot selling rates were sterling 8s2½d, U.S. dollar 16.0625 yuan, and Hong Kong dollar 55.375 yuan—unchanged from yesterday’s noon close.

### Bill Premiums Ease Slightly

Premiums on bank‑accepted bills have slightly declined over the past two days, with the highest around 1.50 yuan and the lowest down to 0.50 yuan—that is, a 1,000‑yuan note now trades at 0.0050 yuan in bill premium swaps on 1,000‑yuan face.

### Discount Rates Plunge One Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange‑accepted bills fell sharply, dropping in the morning to the 55‑yuan level per 1,000 yuan face, closing at 50.025 yuan at noon. In the afternoon it stabilized, marking a one‑yuan plunge from the previous day. Call‑money rates remain at 0.1 yuan.

### Ample Funds Released, Foreign Currencies Dive

Yesterday, pure British gold and sterling‑dollar exchange rates were unchanged, but local foreign‑exchange houses were busy settling funds with banks, which had strong appetite. With ample supply from foreign banks, market prices were stable. When the spot cash market opened hot, bullion houses and money‑exchange dealers dumped holdings, weakening conditions. As international authorities took a firm stand and concession situations eased, confidence steadied, and surplus funds were released. Small holders followed in selling, supplying abundant chips and causing prices to plummet. In the afternoon the market lingered weak: compared to the previous day large declines ensued. Sterling and dollar banknotes in active issue soared in supply; Hong Kong and Australian notes were in lesser demand; all moved downward. Transactions in the exchange guild did not open. Yesterday’s price changes: Banknote sterling fell by 0.3 yuan, sterling bills by 0.04 yuan; U.S. dollar bills down 0.2 yuan, dollar notes down 0.017 yuan; Hong Kong notes down 0.002 yuan; Canadian bills down 0.01 yuan; Australian notes down 0.1 yuan; other currencies unchanged.

### Tianjin–Shanghai Remittance Stable; “Central Bank Notes” Continue to Rise; Hong Kong Exchange Slightly Higher

Tianjin, 18th—At the remittance houses compared with yesterday: sterling rose by 0.03125 yuan, U.S. dollar by 0.0625 yuan; Shanghai remittance unchanged. Morning open prices: sterling 7s9.375d, U.S. dollar 15.50 yuan, Hankow remittance (per 100 yuan Shanghai receipts) 100.00 yuan.

Further telegrams report: on the dark‑pool market for the Tianjin Joint Bank Note at morning open the 18th compared to the 17th, the note rose 1.50 yuan per 100‑yuan French‑denominated note, now purchasable at 121 yuan Joint Bank Note for 100 francs. “On‑the‑spot Joint Bank Note” at 1 yuan par is now worth 0.8244628 francs.

Hong Kong, 18th—At local remittance houses, the morning open matched yesterday’s noon; at 10:55am sterling rose by 0.03125 yuan to 1s2.875d, the U.S. dollar rose by 0.0625 yuan to 29.00 yuan, and Shanghai remittance rose by 0.25 yuan to 180.25 yuan per 100 Hong Kong dollars. By 2:30pm sterling, the dollar, and Shanghai remittance were unchanged from the morning. Morning open: sterling 1s2.84375d, dollar 28.9375 yuan, Shanghai remittance 180.00 yuan per 100 Hong Kong dollars.

### Securities: Telephone Stock Converts One‑for‑Ten, Hits New High of 99 Yuan; Domestic Bonds Continue Rising, Foreign Bonds Weaken

In the off‑exchange securities market yesterday, sentiment was buoyed again by the firm Anglo‑American stance on Gulangyu, and by a decisive statement from the U.S. government anchoring confidence. Prices of many bonds were driven higher by multiple buyers—some up as much as 0.68 yuan—but the rapid rise prompted profits‑taking sales and a subsequent pullback. The market opened with strong sentiment and heavy buying: Lianhe, Tongkang, Yongfeng, Songmao saw eager purchases, and B‑ and W‑class issues surged past 52 yuan. Buyers then sold high in Tianjin, Datong, Dafeng, while Xiefeng, Hongkang, and Series No. 4 and 51 also saw selling, retracing back under 50 yuan. The early strength gave way to a natural reaction. In the afternoon the market stabilized, trading thinned, still showing early firmness then later fatigue. Tianjin Shengtong, Dafeng, Xinfeng, Yongkang continued to see selling. Most buyers were small holders; Xieda, Tongkang, Lemao, and Renchang also put shares on the market. As a result, the gains by day’s end were smaller than in the morning. Overall the market still rose by 0.15 to 0.10 yuan, with total turnover around 1,000,000 yuan. A concise summary follows.

In stock trading, fifty shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco sold at 7.30 yuan.

On the public share front, business was firm and active, with many buyers. Jardine Matheson saw broad transactions, rising to 18.90 yuan. Telephone Company stock, owing to an announced dividend and capital increase (converting each 50‑tael old share into 10 yuan of ten new shares), reached a record high of 99 yuan. Tramway stock enjoyed healthy demand, trading widely at 39 yuan. Swire & Co. shares were 7.85 yuan; Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Co. shares were 36.25 yuan, both attracting buyers. SMC stock attracted much inquiry, trading at 7.90 yuan; Colonisation & Agricultural Co. was firm at 8 yuan.

Rubber stocks saw scant trading: asking prices were too high.

In London, Far Eastern Company shares on the 17th (Wednesday) opened steady, with no change in any issues.

London‑quoted Chinese foreign bonds were sluggish on the 17th: selling offers were weak and there was no change. For example, the Anglo‑Chinese Five‑Percent Gold Loan (with bond scrip valued at 5,000 pounds face or 25,000 dollars) offered at 64 pounds 5 shillings, about 5 shillings below market rates.

### Cotton Yarn: Banks Offload Stock, Yarn Market Shows Sudden Slack; Shuangma and Tiannv Fall by Five Yuan

The cotton‑yarn market was uninspiring, continuing lower. Reports of repeated bombings at Shantou shook confidence, and prices already hovering at highs were easily unsettled. Rumor also spread that a bank was offloading its hoarded yarn, showing some market slack. Even the Shantou syndicate purportedly paused purchases, further dampening sentiment. Demand from the Hong Kong syndicate remained firm, but with some psychological caution, holders dumped stock, fearing no immediate rally. Trading was sparse and lacking vigor.

At the spot yarn market’s morning open, conditions were quiet. Dealers took a round of quotes before trading peacefully. Only around 10am did the market open: quotes were down by 0.50–1 yuan. Twenty‑count Shuangma yarn was 428 yuan spot, 417.50 yuan invoice, but buyer interest was weak. The Shantou syndicate cited bombing fears and made no buys. The Hong Kong syndicate bought only at cheap prices. Soon, unable to find buyers, holders rushed to sell: twenty‑count Shuangma yarn plunged to 424 yuan spot, invoice down to 415.50 yuan. By close prices were flat. In the afternoon rumors of financial sector liquidation kept market sentiment weak; intra‑dealer trades fell off. By close Shuangma spot was 423.50 yuan, invoice 416.50 yuan on few transactions. Total daily syndicate purchases totaled 1,000 bales. Twenty‑count Mahedi and Tiannv each fell by 5 yuan; Biqiudi fell by 4.50 yuan; Muyang by 4 yuan; thirty‑two‑count fine yarn remained unchanged; ten‑count coarse yarn fell by 2–3 yuan. Today shipments include 280 pieces to Tianjin, 2,080 to Shantou, 250 to Hong Kong, 115 to Guangzhou Bay, 550 to Beihai, and 75 to Haiphong. Syndicate buy‑volumes as follows: Tonghang 4; Hong Kong 5; Inland 6; Shantou 5; Yunnan 1; Total 1.0.

On the cotton‑cloth front, calico fell in the morning then regained by afternoon, ending slightly higher, though actual trading remained dead. Out‑town orders were scant. However, after several days of local declines, buyers covered positions, pushing prices back up. Twenty‑count Yueqin yarn reached 361 yuan—up about 2 yuan.

### Recent American Cotton to Reach Nine Cents; Domestic Cotton Shows Improvement, Prices Slightly Up

Overseas cotton‑cloth prices—New York cotton cloth rose sharply on news from Bombay and Liverpool, spurring buyers and covers, with July as the active month. Some forward and loan‑cotton releases caused slight retracement, yet visible export figures kept contracting. With current shortage, the near‑term rise to nine cents in July seems likely; if cotton prices climb further, loan‑cotton may be released. Yesterday Indian cotton jumped 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton over 10 pence; converting to yuan, U.S. and Brazilian cotton rose 1.50 yuan, Indian up 1.40 yuan, Egyptian up 0.60 yuan.

In Shanghai’s imported‑cotton market, overseas cotton’s rise kept local trading quiet, while incoming shipments crowded the docks, causing mills to defer purchases. A few days ago some orders were placed, but none yesterday. However, raw cotton remained scarce: mills bought 3,000 bales of Albizia cotton at 59–65 yuan. Below are yesterday’s mill‑delivery prices:

[Price list omitted in original Chinese—no data to translate]

Domestic cotton business, though not booming, was slightly livelier than days past, as Indian cotton’s strength lifted local prices. White Chinese cotton in good demand—mills seek it again to blend with imports. Yong’an Mill took 400 bales; dealers sold 750 bags of “Huojihua” from transit stocks, keeping spot cotton prices firm. Meanwhile pressed Indian cotton continued rising briskly. Domestic cotton prices followed suit.

No new shipments from northern Jiangsu—transport remains difficult—so none arrived yesterday. Current spot‑cotton conditions are as follows:

[Data omitted owing to lack of original figures]

### Eastern Fine Cloth Predominantly Sold Off; Leading Brand Falls to 13 Yuan; Domestic Weaves Also Weakening

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday eastern white‑goods fine cloth offers sharply declined, causing sentiment to slacken and buyers to stand aside. Unbleached coarse cloth remained firm at mill quotes, held steady by hand‑carried stock at stable prices. Zhejiang, Anhui syndicates continued procuring brands at 11.3–14.3 taels for over a hundred bales; local dealers took nearly fifty bales. Fine cloth fell about 0.10 yuan per bolt; twill fell 0.10–0.25 yuan per bolt. Canton‑Zhejiang and local wholesale houses purchased only small lots of 50–60 bales. Dyed and finished autumn–winter weaves, flannel, and pile cloth from remote regions (Sichuan, Yunnan, Tianjin) saw light demand, while in‑season summer goods were fully absorbed by local syndicates, leaving little new buying. Deep and light dyed cloth both weakened, though locally tailors continued to transact summer‑weight whites: poplin, white gaunt, twilled canvas, and khaki saw vigorous trading at strong and high asks. However, striped府綢 (fu‑silks), bleached twills, striped bleached calicoes, and standard cloth all struggled, with buyers unloading hand stock at markdowns. Lun Chang floral cloth also retreated: all goods fell 0.10–0.50 yuan per bolt.

Eastern Fine Cloth

White‑goods fine cloth and twill faced a sharp collapse under heavy selling by large dealers, creating tremendous downward pressure. The market centered on the leading‐brand fine cloth as the benchmark, with everyone rushing to sell, pushing prices progressively lower. Early trading was chaotic: the leading brand plunged as low as 13.00 yuan. Other brands saw almost no official quotes. Later, profit‑taking buyers covered shorts and actual buyers made cheap purchases, so prices rebounded sharply. By close the leading brand fine cloth was quoted at 13.45–13.50 yuan—still about 0.20 yuan below yesterday’s board. Local dyers and wholesalers handled 400–500 bolts, while Jin‑Tsing syndicates bought over 200 bolts at the lows.

Exports

On the 18th, forty‑two bolts shipped to Tianjin; on the 19th, 115 to Tianjin, 60 to Yantai, 280 to Shantou, 115 to Hong Kong, 35 to Beihai.

### Silks & Tea: Japanese and American Silk Rally Pauses

Overseas raw‑silk and silks from Japan and America have paused after their recent rises. Yokohama spot and forward silks each fell 12.00 yuan; New York nearby down 0.05 yuan, forward down 0.045 yuan. However in Lyon, silks from Japan and China saw gains: Japanese up 3 francs, Shanghai’s “Ziyu” silks up 4 francs, “Ziku” up 2 francs, Guangdong silks up 1.50 francs. The recent Japanese‑American rally, beginning around the 20th of last month, had driven Yokohama spot from 1,140 yuan to a record 1,300 yuan. But according to a long‑distance report from Yokohama, recent monthly raw‑silk exports have fallen to only 1,000 tan, compared with over 4,000 tan monthly in former days—an anomalous phenomenon.

Locally, yesterday’s silk market was also quiet; price drops were modest, trading slow. New York saw little business, Lyon had small spot transactions at 1,820 yuan—unchanged from the prior day. Dachang and Renchang bought 50 tan; Indian and African buyers remained cautious, awaiting fresh impetus.

New tea arrivals are few; offers still around the 200‑yuan level. Since last week’s Huzhou new crop offerings, selling displays looked firm, yet actual arrivals remain scant and trading little changed. This season foreign firms’ costs are high, and although navigation on the Zhejiang–Fuzhou line has resumed, no cargoes have yet arrived. Available supply comes via the Hangjiahu region, carrying higher costs. Yesterday China Tea Company bought 26 chests of Feng Zhenmei at 200 yuan, 20 chests of authentic Huzhou Zhenmei at 198 yuan; Po Chong & Co. took six chests of Wuyue buds at 245 yuan. Jubilee, Jardine, and others made small purchases, but volumes were negligible. Prices were steady.

### Grain and Flour North and South: Distribution Channels Clear; Wheat Market Silent

The rice market shows little change; the atmosphere remains one of brewing developments. Northern syndicate sales continue slowly, driven by local mill‑price falls and shifting financial conditions, resulting in almost zero large‑lot interest—though existing consignments are mostly being loaded, prompting infrequent small trades. Mill‑asked prices remain firm, keeping the market dull. Southern syndicates are also clearing stock in bits. On‑street and inland syndicates continue selling, totaling nearly 40,000 bags—No. 2 flour at 4.55 yuan, while Nos. 3 and 4 see little demand and no trades. The market remains on standby. On the 19th, 3,000 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin.

The wheat market is extremely quiet. Mills’ foreign wheat arrivals continue uninterrupted, while domestic buyers remain unalert, and North China buyers are also dormant. As a result, the market is stagnant. Current price stands at 66.20 yuan, and newly arrived lots stubbornly refuse markdowns; even mill deliveries are scarce. The market remains deadlocked.

### Rice Prices Keep Rising—What Is the Meaning of Price Limits?

Yesterday, sources of japonica rice reported arrivals at Nangang, Fenglian, and other syndicates receiving No. 7–8 grades; Che Lun, Baozi, Su‑Tong‑Kun syndicates took 3,600–3,700 bags; Changzhou syndicate 250 bags. The market grew more chaotic: buyers, seeing high prices, still made purchases, so shops, to secure supply, bought at high quotes. At such tense times, though the market committee has tried to impose price limits, this is impossible. As a result, the limits have been breached and the off‑exchange market has vanished. All rice varieties now trade around 16–17 yuan, up 0.20–0.30 yuan from the last off‑exchange quote—this applies to both japonica and indica. Only the white glutinous variety, priced like foreign glutinous rice, remains stable. In short, this market phenomenon is wholly due to manipulation and monopoly. Based on stock levels, warehouse and shop inventories total over one million dan, yet such outcomes—tragic for Shanghai’s populace—have arisen. It is noted that 3,681 bags of rice have just arrived via Hong Kong.

### Added Tax on Handling Permits, Wuhu Supplies Unhindered, Rice Pushed to Fourteen Yuan, Hope for Fixed Foreign Rice Prices

Yesterday, ordinary indica rice stocked in shops was traded in over 6,000 bags throughout the day. With warehouse holders allowed to pay levies as before, all high-grade quotas uniformly rose, up another 20 to 40 cents compared with the previous market. The price of indica rice has been pulled up to the 14‑yuan limit. Premium Wuhu-milled rice in the grey market opened at 14 yuan 70–80 cents, and sellers are still calling as high as 15 yuan. Nanjing indica rice has already exceeded 15 yuan. Market sentiment and prices continue to trend upward. 

As for the previous report that existing shipping permits from production areas remained valid for transport, our earlier issue noted this; but yesterday rice merchants confirmed that old permits now require an additional tax of 80 cents per bag, and there is no hope of issuing new permits. Therefore, rice from Wuhu can still flow uninterruptedly—Wuhu glutinous rice arrives continuously just like Hong Kong glutinous rice—making it difficult for inland prices to recover. 

Hong Kong foreign‑currency rice continued to arrive yesterday, but indica rice stocks are gradually dwindling. Western rice is holding firm at 19.50 yuan, refusing to budge for the moment, though overseas fixed prices are gradually approaching the Shanghai market. Trading houses have been eager to sell; yesterday there was demand for 2,500 tons from Saigon at 19.50 yuan, but grain merchants countered at 19 yuan and have already wired inquiries, which may be finalized in today’s or tomorrow’s return telegram.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Hankou Beans – Profiting at Others’ Expense

Yesterday’s soybean market remained lackluster, owing to still‑limited sales venues and the fear that Hankou beans handled by Japanese merchants might continue flowing endlessly. From yesterday they began undercutting prices to attract buyers, causing more losses than gains ahead. In our district roughly 1,000 bags of Hankou soybeans changed hands at 8 yuan 30 cents per bag, down 10 cents from the opening price the day before. Additionally, 200 bags of Zhangyan beans bound for Hong Kong traded at 9 yuan 50 cents; 100 bags of Wuhu beans at 8 yuan 93 cents; and two railcars of Dalian beans at 8 yuan 70 cents ex‑warehouse, delivered at 8 yuan 80 cents—all down 2 to 3 cents from the previous market.

Today 1,620 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 1,700 bags of shelled corn to Tianjin.

### Oil Cakes: Crude Soybean Oil Market in a Holding Pattern

Yesterday’s crude soybean oil trading showed slight activity, improving sentiment and lifting market prices by roughly 40–50 cents. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern. A total of 100 cases of Jiaozhou crude oil and 150 road‑delivery cases were opened at 29 yuan each; 370 tins of Dalian‑packed crude oil at 37 yuan 50 cents; and 50 barrels of Dalian barrelled oil at 38 yuan 50 cents. Soybean oil trades included 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil (see market‑price column), 100 cases of Qingqi oil, 300 tins of Qingdao oil, 300 barrels of Dalian oil, 30 barrels of Dalian bleached oil, and 50 barrels of Dalian Fengnian oil.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Easier, Jianhua Factory Products Meet Demand

London dispatches report a slight easing: August futures at 7 shillings 1 pence per cwt, December at 6 shillings 2 pence, February next year at 6 shillings 2½ pence. Dutch cables show no change. Hong Kong landing charges set the mid‑price at 19 yuan 7 cents. Hence local guilds set two calls on coarse white refined: small grade at 2.5 cents, at 27 yuan 3.2 cents for 50 bags; small grade at 5 cents, at 27 yuan 2.5 cents for 100 bags. Bonded stock called at 19 yuan 1 cent, importers offered 19 yuan—negotiations pending. On‑hand stock at this warehouse under “Big Gold Money” label called at 27 yuan 6.5 cents. “Tai Che” white has no fluctuation: label at 26 yuan 9.0 cents for 100 bags, 26 yuan 1.5 cents for 100 bags. “Cotton White” small at 2 cents; Zhenji No. 1 at 26 yuan 8 cents; No. 2 at 3 cents; No. 3 at 25 yuan 8 cents; No. 4 at 3 cents. On the 18th, 195 bags arrived from Hong Kong, and 1,350 bags from Shantou.

Jianhua Sugar Manufacturing Co., Ltd., recently registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was founded by Messrs. Ze Nan and Tang Renyu. The factory, located at Xuhui’s Xuhong Road, has already released products: “Xin” brand No. 1 rock sugar at 32 yuan 1 cent; “Jingjian” white rock sugar at 34 yuan 5 cents; “Jinghua” yellow rock sugar at 34 yuan 4 cents; “Wenjian” white tablet sugar at 40 yuan; “Cha” yellow tablet sugar at 44 yuan; “Xin” brand No. 1 granulated white at 26 yuan 5 cents; “Shang” brand No. 4 at 25 yuan.

### Hardware: Black Iron Sheeting – Strong Then Weak

Black iron sheeting had been extremely firm as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yanbian guilds and local hot‑water‑bottle factories scrambled for stock. But recently heavy factory shipments and ongoing overseas orders have flooded the market, sapping demand and sending standard prices down 30–40 cents and 80–90 cents respectively. Offers now include: three‑sheet lots at 22 yuan 50 cents; four‑sheet at 22 yuan 75 cents; five‑sheet at 23 yuan; six‑sheet at 23 yuan 20 cents; seven‑sheet at 23 yuan; eight‑sheet at 23 yuan 50 cents; nine‑sheet at 23 yuan 75 cents. For eighteen‑sheet colored stock, which is relatively scarce, the asking price is 23 yuan 50 cents—already down 70 cents from before.

### Means

— by Geng Zhi

To succeed in any enterprise, great or small, one inevitably needs certain abilities—what we call economic talent or skill. From self‑cultivation and family order to governing a state and bringing peace to the world, this ability is indispensable.

Within this ability, however, we can distinguish two kinds of approaches: one follows the official, straight, orderly path—what is called the Way of Kings (wangdao); the other cares only about ends, sparing no means—what is called the Way of Hegemony (badao). In theory, the Way of Kings has been praised and practiced by ancient sages and kings, promising inevitable success and natural fulfillment. Unfortunately, in my view, this Way of Kings has never truly been practiced, or if tried, has never succeeded. A look through history reveals only examples of the Way of Hegemony.

Every founding emperor—from Liu Bang to Zhao Kuangyin to Zhu Yuanzhang—rose to power through the sword or by usurping thrones. Isn’t that the Way of Hegemony? Once on the throne, they indeed practiced benevolent rule, the so‑called Way of Kings; yet if we examine their motives and those of their descendants, who genuinely acted for the country and the people? Who did not seek to preserve their private realm? They borrowed the mantle of ancient sages to control the people and invoked sacred traditions to justify absolute loyalty—turning the populace into subjects who dared not move. Rituals, learning, and propaganda were but tactics to dull the people’s minds, akin to burning books and burying scholars. Wherein lies the Way of Kings? It remains the Way of Hegemony! Immediate conquest is hegemony; reluctant, forced governance remains hegemony.

If nations can only practice hegemony, it is no wonder that societies and families also resort to it. In such realms, there is no need to uphold proper talents or righteous methods—only expedient means matter. Indeed, expedient means have two facets, both characteristic of hegemony:

First, ruthlessness. Wielding life‑and‑death power against dissenters, scraping every inch of profit, shunning petitioners, and denying pleas. Best to make people suffer in silence or fear your mere shadow. All such brutality is an expedient means, effective for achieving one’s ends.

In truth, expedient means must be ruthless: lofty “writings” need a “ruthless hand”; great favors unrequited have led to murder to silence gratitude; much less ordinary affairs! How could one avoid ruthlessness?

Second, deception. Warfare never scorns deception, and since military affairs are paramount, deceit pervades all “business.” Without Zhuge Liang’s seven captures and releases, could he have ensured the southern tribes never rebelled? Elders still advise: “Speak only one‑third of what you know,” passing on the art of deception.

In a complex society—indeed in civilized circles—honest, straight‑laced people are often doomed to be labeled naive and fail utterly, while those adept at cunning and dazzling stratagems bloom like sunflowers in spring. Hence the best method is to set a trap in which people willingly walk or fall—never openly reveal your true aims or plead directly for help.

A person adept at ruthless means may succeed; one skilled in deceit may succeed. If ruthless and deceitful in equal measure, then one conquers all under heaven.

Reflecting on this, I find I am not extreme: Confucius, who preached the Way of Kings, how did his life end? Mencius, who embraced a hegemonic twist on kingly ways, what became of him? Did Liu Bang, Zhao Kuangyin, or Zhu Yuanzhang read Confucius and Mencius? And Christ, who spoke of the heavenly Way—what was his fate? Meanwhile, Hitler and Mussolini certainly were no devout Christians. Thus I say: the Way of Kings never truly existed; we wield the Way of Hegemony, and they wield hegemony—and in our time, that alone is real and justified!

“The world itself is at peace; fools create its turmoil.” This speaks to hegemony—the ruthless and the deceitful. Unable to change fools, we are doomed to employ their methods and thus entangle ourselves in perpetual self‑disturbance. Self‑disturbance is, in fact, the one true course of life!

### Return Journey to the Hometown (Part II)

— by Wang Li

The next afternoon I arrived at Lizhuang Bridge. Since the boat to Wujin had already departed, I had to wait until eight the next morning to catch one, so I paused my journey here.

Passing a teahouse entrance, an unfamiliar man suddenly grabbed me from behind. Startled and stunned, I turned—he merely smiled and pointed inside, saying, “Our squad leader asks for you!”

My heart leaped. When I looked into the teahouse hall, I saw our scout squad leader smiling at me. I stepped in with relief.

“How did you get here?” he asked with a grin.

“And you?” I replied.

They then told me they had captured someone and showed me the documents they had seized. Since I was feeling unwell and dizzy from the long journey, I planned to rest. A local comrade newly assigned to our squad insisted on booking a room for me at a nearby inn.

At eight the next morning, I boarded the boat to Wujin. Still dizzy, I propped my baggage against me and lay on my side.

When the boat stopped at a small riverside village, a man wearing dark glasses disembarked. No one paid him any heed—until midway, when we reached a no‑man’s‑land between our forces and the enemy’s. Lost in a haze, a gunshot snapped me awake. Turning, I saw the dark‑glasses man with a submachine gun emerging from the stern.

“Everyone, be reasonable!” he barked, pointing his weapon.

The entire boat fell silent.

He frisked each person, quickly stuffing any finds into his pockets. An upsurge of anger welled in me; I planned to strike his gun away when he reached me. Feigning sleep, I lay with eyes half‑closed. Yet after a round of searches, he passed me by. Once the boat docked, he escaped.

All the passengers muttered accusations at each other. By six that evening I set foot on another world’s soil—Wujin’s brightly lit streets—feeling as though I had descended into hell.

I walked among bustling compatriots, past puppet policemen, glaring neon lights, and charred, shattered ruins. Gritting my teeth, silent tears of grief and rage fell.

Without a good‑citizen certificate, I was refused by every inn until some townspeople guided me to a secret lodging. It was a half‑ruined wooden shack amid rubble, filthier than a pigsty, with only straw mats on the floor and two broken beds in the next room.

That night dizziness and exhaustion plagued me, yet excitement kept sleep at bay until dawn.

The next day I slipped past the health inspectors and boarded a steamer to Wuxi, then switched to Suzhou that afternoon. From the cabin window I saw scorched towns and villages—the land a wasteland. In silence, hatred aflame in my heart, I thought of home.

Had my hometown been reduced to ashes too? I felt grief, then reproached myself: how could I hope my home alone survive? Our vast land was occupied; millions of compatriots had lost life, property, and freedom. I must not selfishly wish my village safe nor guard it greedily!

On the way to Suzhou I endured a fifth inspection, restraining my anger with all my might. Rage only intensified my dizziness; my body felt as weak as one stricken by serious illness.

After one night in Suzhou, I took a boat home. From afar, as I glimpsed the countryside, a chaotic blend of sorrow and relief gripped me.

Stepping onto native soil, I found it changed under recent tensions, yet spared major disaster. In my father’s and younger brother’s astonished joy at our reunion, my heart felt as though a heavy weight of lead had lifted. Exchanging all that had happened in the past year, we embraced as if reborn.

Once excitement subsided, my frail body felt as slack as an unstrung bow. Glancing at my father’s face, I saw how much older he had grown in this past year.

### Seeking

— by Li Chen

Wildflowers sprout at the base of walls; bright blossoms emerge amid tangled undergrowth, offering a weary traveler a fleeting comforting smile. Yes: if this turbulent world is a desert, the flower is a single spring. Amid the swirling winds and thunderous cosmos, through it we glimpse a cleared, sunlit sky.

In solitude, flowers seem the tranquilizers for a restless life—who would not find their wounded spirit soothed by them?

Yet this world seems so narrow it cannot contain even one fragrant bloom!

Thus, when the boundless journey unfolds before us, each person drifts like a rudderless sailboat. Where will the wind carry us? No one knows.

To find a flower, a bit of solace, countless lives must be sacrificed—to free fragrant grass pressed in rocky crevices; to guide a lost lamb home; to beautify the world and warm the universe. Who would begrudge a handful of sweat, a drop of blood, or even one’s life?

Braving forests and deserts, countless souls courageously embark on the journey, bearing wind and frost, shouldering hardship, trudging miles upon miles. Yet some meet lions or tigers on mountain paths and perish together in fierce combat; others, through a single mistake, swallow a lethal but lovely‑looking blossom…

I am moved by these “aspirants who die in pursuit.” Through their lives they removed obstacles, leaving a broad avenue for the future. They offer us the lesson of “struggle” and the warning of “poisoned flowers.” Is the ancestral legacy more precious than this “bloody experience”?

If you cling to a potted plant by your window or yearn for early blossoms in a greenhouse, then look afar: the free kingdom full of brilliant blooms waves to you. Strive bravely to seek it! The blood and flesh of our ancestors have already paved the great path for you!

### Upside‑Down Monologue

— by Dongfang

I’ve opened this small foundry, which never harmed any of you—so why all the scowling and harassment? Heaven spared me from starvation, left me this little livelihood; bombs haven’t blown me up, fires haven’t burned me. Covered in filth like a dog, I crept back, pieced together this shabby place, and took on a bit of business to steal a bite. Yet you treat me like I’ve struck it rich! Getting rich? Only by becoming an “official” or a “bureau chief,” or by selling one’s conscience—extorting everywhere, relying on special power to bully your own people. Someone like me, just not starving is enough! Who’d have thought that surviving hunger would get me executed by you? You beat me until I could hardly stand! Where could I even lodge a complaint? 

I bought that iron in broad daylight, with a seller and an invoice—yet you thought you’d found a loophole, shouting and hauling me off, tying me with hemp rope, then in handcuffs! Am I a bandit? Bandits accuse the innocent of being bandits! How could I escape your clutches? Such force was needless. Your “headquarters” flogged me with whips until I rolled on the ground—what crime had I committed? You beat me mute, then shoved me into a back room, dark and damp, the air fetid with mildew and stench. Yet since you pitied me enough not to starve me, I got two bowls of rice a day—more than I could eat. Five days in detention, then on the sixth they hauled me out, released me, and cuffed a fist into my back, saying, “Be reasonable, friend, off you go.” I’m a bandit—so why let me go? Back at home I learned you demanded 100 yuan! You’re kidnappers, bandits, wolves! You use special power to bully your own people. If you need money, no need to be so brutal—beating a man to this state when I never robbed anyone, never killed your father! How long will these wounds take to heal? I ache—where can I complain? 

To whom can I complain? Relatives? Friends? They grit their teeth, dare not help; they’re all afraid! You say, “Behave, or we’ll hand you over to the military police.” Ah! To whom can I complain? Just reminding you: 

Is there any place to live here? You swagger past me, glaring with red eyes—I tremble all over. If I don’t starve, I’ll sure die of rage! I cannot go on living; I have to leave, leave for…

Ah! The pain!…

### Ryukyuan Tribute Envoy Crosses the River

(See our May issue, Tongzhi 11th Year)

On the 26th the Ryukyu envoy passed through Zhenjiang and delivered his goods to the capital. Over twenty official boats were used for the river crossing, lashed side by side—a magnificent sight.

### Chongqing’s Lamp Oil Spring

A friend returning from Sichuan’s Chongqing reports a town called Ziliujing where oil springs from the ground unaided. The flow is abundant, and its quality matches foreign kerosene exactly. The locals, ignorant of its value, let anyone take it for a few cash per ounce at local stalls. This oil closely resembles American petroleum. When Americans first discovered such natural oil springs, they rapidly developed mines, and many grew wealthy. China now imports all its kerosene from America, shipping it worldwide—proof of its profitability. The Chongqing oil has a slight odor, likely due to a lack of proper refining methods. If those could be perfected and widely applied, would this not be a great boon to the nation?

### Russian Crown Prince Visits Shanghai

Reports say Russian Prince Alexei departed Hong Kong aboard the steamer Guangdong—chartered for him alone—and has arrived in Fuzhou. In about 12 to 13 days he should reach Shanghai. It is said he plans to linger here for several days to enjoy sightseeing, then board a vessel to sail up the Yangtze to Jiujiang, Hankou, and other locales, visiting the scenic Kuling Mountains and the remains of the Yellow Crane Tower, and to admire China’s famed culture and heritage. After this tour he will return to Shanghai, proceed to Nagasaki, then travel overland via Heilongjiang to Siberia, reaching Russia directly.

Tomorrow’s issue will include: “Opening the Mongol-Russian Trade Route,” “Leisure Theatre Reviews,” and Several Short Verses.

### Report on the Commodity Exhibition

— by Lan Yan

It is the best method for evaluating domestic product samples, and I hope it will stand alongside imported goods for direct comparison.

Although May is a month of blood‑soaked remembrance, various exhibitions have been bustling: the Penglu Relief Produce Expo, the Dashin Company’s art charity sale, and yesterday (the 15th) from 2 p.m. at the corner of Jing’an Temple Road and Muerming Road, the Shanghai Commodity Exhibition opened.

This exhibition differs from those in commercial markets. Not long ago two new markets opened, yet they peddled inferior goods—so shameful! One market’s opening ceremony even featured many female celebrities holding ribbon‑cuttings, as though enticing people to buy shoddy wares—surely infuriating. In contrast, the exhibition in the new Shanghai market comprises solely domestic manufacturers, and every product has undergone strict vetting. I believe this exhibition should fulfill three meanings:

(1) To reward new domestic products—not previously available—by granting special awards, encouraging manufacturers to innovate and imitate.

(2) To introduce and promote new domestic items or inventions within the exhibition.

(3) To investigate and publicize recent improvements and advances in domestic goods, awarding and praising them.

If the exhibition can achieve these points, it will have deep significance. Otherwise, merely displaying domestic samples yields minimal effect.

My impression yesterday was that the venue was too small. Housed on the second floor of the last row of shops in the new market—accessible via the left staircase—there is also a newly opened “Apricot Blossom Village Teahouse,” which fortunately has been doing brisk business since its opening. The exhibition hall lies just beyond a small door, but stalls are cramped and each manufacturer has only a tiny display area.

Displays consist of each firm’s products arrayed in custom showcases, with rental rates fixed at 20 yuan for the upper tier, 30 yuan for the middle, and 10 yuan for the lower. A full‑suite showcase rents for 60 yuan.

Among the exhibits, medicines predominate, followed by knitted goods, cotton textiles, rubber products, silverware, undergarments, stationery, ropes and belts, electrical appliances, oil stoves, soaps, and more. This is indeed an excellent way to appraise domestic samples—but regrettably, the items are only for display; they cannot be sold or handled.

I sincerely hope future exhibitions can secure larger venues, widely solicit domestic samples, and clearly mark price comparisons with imported goods, so buyers recognize domestic products’ genuine affordability.

### Steps

— Fo

One must first have a sequence of steps. For example, in chess: what is the first move, what is the second move, what is the third move—there is a definite order.

To deal with such a sequence, one also needs a set method: how to counter the first move, how to counter the second, how to counter the third. If you face circumstances without a fixed procedure, the result is bound to be failure.

It is like tuberculosis: if you do not seek treatment in the first or second stage, once it reaches the third stage—even if Hua Tuo were revived—there would be no remedy.

### Sketch of a Fountain Pen Hospital

— Xinliang

Is your fountain pen broken? No—do you mean it’s sick?

Right now in Shanghai, there is an establishment called the Fountain Pen Hospital. Inside are many “physicians” who will examine your pen in great detail for any ailments. If there is even the slightest hope of recovery, their diagnosis and treatment will be as thorough as possible.

A pen with a mild “disease,” once brought in for treatment, can be returned to its owner on the spot. But if the condition is more serious, there is the hassle of “hospitalization,” lasting anywhere from a day up to a week.

The cluster of fountain pen hospitals is located around the Commercial Press on Henan Road: there, readers will find many shops specializing in fountain-pen repair. Before the war, near the South City Animal Shelter, there was also a large-scale pen hospital; besides that, there were several more at the West Gate.

At present, the most fully equipped and largest establishment is the “Fountain Pen Hospital” near the Commercial Press. On its signboard is prominently painted a red cross; those who do not know any better might truly believe it is a medical clinic.

The doctors at the pen hospital say, “We can treat any disease related to fountain pens.” They also claim they can take a pen that is totally unusable and turn it into a new, splendid fountain pen. Although this boast is somewhat exaggerated, it is undeniable that they can indeed repair pens that are slightly damaged.

“Our workmanship is very honest,” said an assistant at one hospital when I asked him. “No matter what kind of pen is brought in for repair, we only charge a very modest service fee.”

Casually, he then took out a pen and proudly said, “These pens are all brand-new. Many people think we only sell secondhand goods, but they’re mistaken. This is a proper shop—just like in a large corporation—you can get a very good pen here.”

“These are the old pens,” the clerk continued, taking out some used fountain pens. “We gather these secondhand pens from various places, give them proper repairs, and then sell them at low prices.” He told me that due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, these older pens are not particularly cheap. Generally, two empty-barrel Parker pens sell for around thirty to thirty-five yuan.

At the same time, the fountain pen hospitals also sell nibs. Ordinary ones go for about fifty cents apiece; slightly better ones range from one yuan up to ten yuan.

When they repair a pen, they first use a magnifying glass to inspect the nib for cracks; if cracks are found, they will inform you immediately that the nib must be replaced. Otherwise, after repair, it would be hard to please the customer.

“A good fountain pen lasts forever,” the clerk continued. “So when you are choosing a pen, you must pay attention and avoid buying inferior models that have been superficially altered.”

“Poor-quality pens usually have two defects: either the feed cannot draw ink, or they leak. A good fountain pen will never leak.”

Walk along Nanjing Road or Henan Road and you will likely encounter friends trying to sell you what look like new, high-quality pens. The prices really are cheap, but I advise you not to be deceived by this bargain. A pen that looks fine but works poorly will frighten you when you use it. Once it breaks, and you bring it to the Fountain Pen Hospital, the “doctors” there may refuse to “admit” such a “patient.” Wouldn’t that be a waste of your money?

### Red “Blue” Film and the Three Primary Colors

— Renzhi

The Soviet film “The Woman Warrior” is a color motion picture made using red, “blue,” and the three primary colors. After its release, it received unanimous acclaim among critics. However, regarding its color achievements, some have raised objections. Here, I wish to offer some principles I’ve read in books for reference. I hope not to be mocked as an “expert” and have my sincere teaching enthusiasm chilled.

Color can be divided into light color and pigment color. Sunlight contains waves of varying length. The display of the seven colors is due to these differing wavelengths. White light passing through a red filter appears red. The reason is that only red wavelengths can pass through the red filter, thus appearing red. Since equal parts of red (Red), blue (Blue), and green (Green) light combine to form white light, red, blue, and green are usually called the three primary colors of light. This differs from the three primary pigment colors.

Speaking of light colors, equal parts of blue and green mix to form cyan (blue-green). Two parts cyan mixed with one part red also form white. What we call red “blue” here is cyan. We can see that the colors achievable from three primaries can also be produced from two primaries, though the proportions differ and the process is more cumbersome. In fact, red and blue mix into yellow; red and green into magenta; using yellow and green or magenta and blue as primaries can also yield the same results.

The coloration of objects corresponds to pigment color. If an object absorbs green wavelengths but reflects red and blue, it appears yellow. If it absorbs red but reflects blue and green, it appears cyan. If it absorbs blue but reflects green and red, it appears magenta. Therefore, when shooting a yellow object with a three-primary-color camera, the red and blue negatives will retain the image while the green negative shows none. With a red-“blue”-primary camera, both the red and “blue” (cyan) negatives will show the image, but in different proportions. When projecting these two sets of film back, in theory they should yield identical color results. This shows that, in terms of color proportioning, two primaries are more challenging than three. In the shooting process, two primaries are simpler than three. In any case, the fact that the Soviet Union has achieved its current success in filming with two primaries cannot but be considered quite successful and worthy of admiration.

Chapter Ten: The Wise Woman in a Skirt, the Honorable Mother; The Silver-Bearded Elder in Green Sleeves, the Energetic Senior

He Shuangyu asked, “Why do some things require approval and others not?” Zhu the Village Chief replied, “There are various considerations that cannot be exhaustively explained in a moment. The establishment of any factory must suit the local conditions; our village too must undergo a round of review. For example, the two young ladies planning to open a silk-weaving mill would surely pass. Many villages here engage in sericulture, producing considerable raw silk each year. Raw silk and silk fabrics are inevitably closely connected.

Although in recent years our country’s raw silk exports have ranked first in the world, domestic demand remains strong. I recall eight or nine years ago during the war, Japanese raw silk exports plummeted, and our own sericulture also suffered. Provinces across our nation vigorously promoted silkworm breeding; provinces that had never done so began rearing silkworms, yet still could not make up for the shortfall in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The United States was the first to worry; using scientific methods, they invented various types of rayon, but it could never match the quality of natural silk.

After the war, our silk industry boomed; America, the Soviet Union, and European and American countries all wanted our silk. Our raw silk leapt to first place in world exports. For the sake of postwar frugality, domestic consumption of silk fabrics has decreased. However, our shortcoming is that we export few finished luxury goods. Now, the two young ladies plan to establish a textile mill to sell fabrics abroad, which is a further step forward.”

He Nongyu said, “We’re not certain we can handle foreign trade. But our father has several old friends in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who support us. They know we, his nieces, studied textiles in America and have some knowledge, so they suggested we give it a trial. Consider: countries that don’t produce silk import raw silk to manufacture finished goods for export. We, as a silk-producing nation close to the source, why can’t we make fabrics and sell them worldwide? Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang are raw-silk provinces, and their silk fabrics are renowned, we want to set up our mill there. This is a new village organized by our grandfather’s efforts, and it is our mother’s hometown; we wish to establish our foundation here. We ask grandfather to help and guide us.”

Zhu the Village Chief said, “Another factory here would surely enrich the locality. We are certainly willing for your mill to be established here. After dinner, let us take a look. If it seems suitable, we will present it to the village council.” (113)

### Success of American Television Films (Continued)

This summer you can enjoy movies without leaving home; high prices, however, may prevent widespread adoption

(3) Research Advances

Once a method is established, those studying television film naturally focus on cathode-ray research, which is precisely what is currently in use. In addition, in contrast to this type of television film, there is the Wilhelmy voplays vibroacoustic mirror: by mounting a camera and a dry plate (similar to a photographic dry plate) on a cathode-ray tube. This dry plate is coated with countless light-sensitive cells, onto which the image is focused. A sheet of cathode rays scans this plate line by line, quickly transmitting the image. The actions of the camera and the receiver are perfectly synchronized, sending and receiving the same images multiple times. One oscillation is vertical, the other horizontal. Using this method, films must have 441 lines to transmit images repeatedly. During transmission, audio is also sent through a sound channel, and at the receiving end, various signals must be separated and amplified.

(4) High Cost of Equipment

Since the machinery is so complex, both the transmitter and receiver cost far more than ordinary wireless broadcast or radio sets. In this situation, the screen size must be appropriate, and a good receiver produces an image at least seven by eight inches, requiring a large cathode-ray tube—which is very expensive. Roughly, each set costs between US$350 and $500. If you insist on spending less, you can only view a smaller film of roughly three by four inches, priced at about $150 to $200 per set. Currently, cheaper receivers are not yet available. Large cathode-ray tubes require strong protective measures. Films must be limited to high-current operation to avoid accidents; yet due to spontaneous arcing and heat conduction, “snowflakes” may appear on the screen. Ultimately, one must use 200 lines instead of 441, which becomes a significant issue for television film. Nevertheless, engineers generally remain optimistic, believing these minor issues are easily resolved. It is said that once cathode-ray television films become popular, these problems can be solved within a few years. (End)

### The New Plan for the New Rooftop Garden

— (Shuimo)

Creating a Hollywood-Style Glass Broadcasting Studio; Adding a Garden Restaurant, Theatrical Venue; Cancelling the International Dance Hall to Open a Shopping Mall

Shanghai’s amusement venues can stay packed year-round because their founders use extremely low ticket prices and local operas from various provinces to attract Shanghai’s diverse population. This strategy has, of course, been highly effective.

Take the Dajie World, the New World, and other companies’ venues—aren’t they full all year? Yet since the Nationalist forces’ westward retreat, these venues, to draw customers, have slashed prices to rock-bottom. Dajie World’s highest ticket is now only two dimes (and you get one ticket free for each purchase); the New World venue charges as little as five cents—truly as cheap as it gets.

“But because the big companies’ venues are so scattered and cheap, their revenues haven’t matched past levels. To address this, they’ve decided to change strategy and aim for the upscale market—hence, the New Rooftop Garden.

Those not following amusement-venue news closely may not have noticed the New Rooftop Garden’s recent closure. In fact, it has been closed for many days.

Simultaneously ceasing business was the New Company’s International Dance Hall. Now let me separately discuss the New Rooftop Garden’s future plan.

According to Mr. Xiao Zongjun, head of the New Company, they have decided to dismantle the former New Rooftop Garden venue and, with higher ticket prices, attract an upscale audience.

His plan is as follows: on the company’s sixth floor, they intend to spend sixty thousand yuan renovating into the following new entertainment spaces:

(1) Glass-Covered Broadcasting Studio—Shanghai’s studios have never invested heavily in building glass enclosures; if at all, we’ve only seen such facilities in Hollywood films. Now they have decided to construct such an elaborate glass studio, in which broadcasting inside is fully visible from the outside.

(2) Sound Film Theater—in cooperation with the New China Company, exclusively screening New China’s second-run films.

(3) Shanghai Opera Theater—Xiao Wenbin has been engaged for long-term performances.

(4) Shaoxing Literary Opera—no troupe has been finalized, but they plan to hire Shanghai’s top performers.

(5) Garden Restaurant—located just outside the glass studio, serving Western cuisine with air-conditioning in hot weather.

Ticket prices for the venues are set at fifty and eighty cents, with all seating brand-new. They expect to open by the end of June at the latest.

Given the success of the Lvbao Theater, this upscale strategy will likely ensure victory.

Regarding the dance hall: there was originally a plan to set up an open-air rooftop dance floor, but due to various complications, it has been cancelled.

The former site of the International Dance Hall will be converted into the New Company’s shopping mall. Henceforth, the International Dance Hall will be but a memory.

### Dou Ping’s Singing Voice

— (Kun)

Insured for One Million Gold Dollars

In Hollywood, the star Diana Dou Ping is undoubtedly the most prominent. Her acting is truly admirable; her singing is even better. She is now one of New Universal’s principal stars. Several songs she sings in The Full Courtyard Blossoms, when played in cinemas and then in dance halls (on wind instruments), have become wildly popular among the masses: also hits are films like “Little Bird Clinging to the Man,” “Adolescent Blossom,” and “Phoenix at Dawn,” which draw sold-out audiences in major world cities. Actually, Dou Ping is only sixteen and cannot yet be considered a fully mature star. Everyone believes she has a very bright future. New Universal’s management is extremely attentive to her voice and has recently signed a contract with a New York insurance company to insure Dou Ping’s voice for one million dollars, the same amount as insured for Shirley Temple’s voice. Such luxury among film stars is indeed an unrivaled spectacle.

### Reflections on Amateur Instrumental Music

— Ni Qiuping

After tea and wine, plucking the strings and singing is a joyful affair. Performing onstage brings further delight, but there are hidden bitter aspects that outsiders don’t know. For instance, if you can play but not very well, people may invite you to perform, not because of your skill but to save money. You, thinking it a chance to show off, don’t realize that once you step onstage, you are immediately criticized. Whispers and gossip fly around the venue; you end up sweating but accomplishing nothing. What a pity!

If you are truly skilled, Zhang San invites you today, Li Si tomorrow, and then you have rehearsals and guest performances every day. If you accept them all, you’ll be overstretched; if you refuse, everyone calls you ungrateful. And if you frequently take the stage, bystanders think you’re a local celebrity.

Home practice is best, but playing the erhu requires it to be set up, and in the biting north wind, only the higher notes sound; the low ones are gone. Also, applying rosin makes a dreadful mess; changing strings risks chipping your teeth—none of which is pleasurable. Now, in Shanghai, with so many people overcrowding, five or six families share a house, so you can’t practice quietly. In the morning, third-floor sisters won’t allow practice before noon. In the afternoon, the auntie next door naps. At night, from ten to eleven is the Ministry of Works’ regulation; if you go overtime, you get fined. Should we cause trouble by playing “too much,” or not?

Then there’s budgeting: a yuan a month for rent, plus the horse fare to Beiping, plus mail and remittance fees. Asking friends to bring rosin is a favor; and you must get snake-skin [rosin cases]. Without three or four instruments you’re busy all day.

Those aren’t the only woes. If you discover a new fine instrument, you can’t help buying it—then one this year, two next year. Soon, dozens of unwanted useless instruments crowd your home. Counting erhu cases alone, new and old, I have thirty-nine. If I travel, I can’t carry them all and must check baggage.

### Entertainment Tidbits

The Peony Troupe Announces Accounts: To demonstrate trust and transparency to all members, the Chinese Peony National Theater Troupe leadership announces its accounts. The gross income from the China-Philippines Theater was 52,161.8 yuan, half of which—26,080.09 yuan—belongs to the troupe. The troupe’s total expenses were 25,126.9 yuan, leaving a net surplus of 953.99 yuan. However, allowances for members’ losses and other miscellaneous expenses incurred over four months before leaving Shanghai cost more than that, so the nine-hundred-yuan surplus was far from sufficient.

Jinxin Company to Manage the New Theater: The performance stage will be taken back by Pang Laichen for private management, forming the Jinxin Entertainment Company with Dong Yongjun, with all preparations actively underway. It is rumored they will hire the famous Dan Dan Xun Huisheng for performances in the South.

Uncertainty Over Li Zhonglin’s Southward Tour: Recently, rumors have circulated that the veteran Wenwu performer Li Zhonglin has been invited to the South to join the Thirty-Two-Episode Red Lotus Temple. A reporter, visiting backstage manager Chen Yuelou, asked about this matter, and he emphatically denied it. Li’s representative, Mr. Guo Chunpu, also said he had heard nothing of it.

Zhu Cuimei Comes to Shanghai to Recuperate: Kun Dan performer Zhu Cuimei and her husband Zheng Zuan traveled to Shanghai; their goods were bombed en route, suffering heavy losses, nearly leading to bankruptcy. She now plans to rest in Shanghai for two to three months; if unable to join a troupe, she will head north to seek further training. Her mother, originally from Linchuan County, Jiangxi, has already fled to Lichuan County.

### Outside the Pear Garden

Two Noteworthy Stories About the Late Actor Luo Kuifang

He said, “Since I came south, I suddenly discovered a young sheng named Li Guifang whose performance is excellent. His style is very upright; with that role, in Beijing one could not find his equal—(apart from the more senior Zhu Suyun and Cheng Jixian). Later I learned he was a late apprentice of Yang Rongshou, and thus a junior brother to Jixian, which explains his ability. Today, upon hearing a single line, one sees your skill is uncommon. Among the Tan school of bearded sheng, you are at the forefront. You and Guifang are both talents I chanced upon in the south.” After he finished speaking, they coaxed Bao Zhong to perform a segment of “Scolding Cao” in its original style, with Hong Shou accompanying on the qin. The four lines were completed with difficulty. It was truly unappetizing—call the small trick a grand spectacle! Young Chen and Young Yang, sitting to one side, saw everyone sympathizing with Bao Zhong and expressing goodwill; he then walked up to him, sat beside him, clasped his hand, calling him “big brother” repeatedly, leaving everyone bewildered. After the two bid farewell, they asked Little Bao, who explained that Bao Zhong addressed him as “big brother” in reference to Lord Wang (Yaoying), whose wife was Bao Zhong’s aunt. Initially, Little Bao studied dan roles under Yaoying before switching to sheng roles. Due to that connection, Bao Zhong felt it appropriate to call him “big brother.” Actually, Bao Zhong and Shuyan are of the same generation; if Bao Zhong were to call him anything, it should have been “senior brother.” Then Young Yang would have had to address him more respectfully. (Little Bao died in the 14th year of the Republic at only forty; he would now have been fifty-four, perhaps a year or two older than Shuyan.) In his early dan days, he had an extremely beautiful stage presence and great reputation; then, in a sudden fit of anger, he switched to sheng roles—a story with much to tell, revealing him as a man of integrity. Also, there is one notable act of righteousness that could compare, one after the other, with Judge Di in “The Widow Ma Opens a Shop.” Hence I wish to specially commend him. The two stories are entitled: “Embarrassed at Being a Senior Actor’s Plaything, He Switched Masters in Anger to Forsake Dan for Sheng” and “Refusing to Tarnish His Reputation after Fracturing His Brow Bone, He Feigned Insanity to Rescue Another.” (15)
