Jinhua: This morning, over two hundred Japanese soldiers were added to the Sheyan Fort Hill area of Kanmen in Yuhuan. Yuhuan County Magistrate Qu Yin-zhi continues to lead his team in constant resistance. By 10:00 AM, the defenses were completely destroyed, and Kanmen was abandoned. After entering Kanmen, the Japanese troops immediately set it on fire. The blaze has not been extinguished by evening. The battle is still ongoing. (28th Dispatch)

Liuhuang: Frontline telephone report: The invading Japanese troops in Chao'an launched a fierce attack on the suburbs of the city on the morning of the 27th, dividing into southeast routes. With no defenses to hold, Chinese troops withdrew from the county seat at 1:00 PM. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops northwest of the city. (28th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military news, today over two thousand Japanese troops, under the cover of naval artillery and aerial bombardment, landed on Yuhuan Island outside the port of Wenzhou. Chinese troops have built strong fortifications in the Kanmen area of the island, so the fighting there is exceptionally fierce. As for the Shantou area, the Chinese side admits that Caitang and Fuyang between Chaozhou and Shantou have been lost. The Japanese troops are now advancing northeast, approaching Chao'an, where there is often fierce fighting. (28th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Today, this office received a Chinese telegram confirming that Japanese troops landed simultaneously on the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces yesterday morning. It stated that these two landings are the initial step for large-scale operations in the future. Yesterday's actions were limited to attempting to seize the forward points of Fuzhou harbor and Yuhuan Island north of Wenzhou harbor. Chinese troops were not deployed in the forward point, so the area was occupied by Japanese troops yesterday. However, Chinese troops are resisting on Yuhuan Island, and the battle is currently ongoing. It has been found that the forward point is outside the water barriers built by Chinese troops at the port of Fuzhou. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports: Large numbers of Japanese warships and transport ships are now concentrated at the Minjiang and Oujiang estuaries. It is rumored that a large-scale landing will be carried out on the 29th. Military sources say that the Japanese decision to attack Chaoshan resulted in many casualties, and their forces are limited, so they seem unwilling to risk a deep incursion. (28th Special Dispatch)

(Fuzhou) Fujian Chairman Chen Yi recently went to various coastal areas in eastern Fujian to inspect defenses. The Minjiang estuary has been strictly blockaded since the 29th, and all Chinese and foreign ships are prohibited from entering or leaving. (28th Special Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the vanguard of Japanese troops infiltrated the outskirts of Chaozhou yesterday morning, and the sound of artillery fire could be heard in the city. Residents have been fleeing to the upper reaches of the Han River since the night of June 26th. At the same time, Chinese reinforcements are now heading to Chaozhou, deploying defenses on the mountains west of the city to prevent the Japanese troops from penetrating deeper. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

Shantou: The Chengdong property of Butterfield & Swire in this city was occupied by Japanese troops today. The British flag hanging above it was removed twice. Now it has been replaced with a Japanese flag. Japanese troops are now using the property as an unloading point for supplies. Japanese transport ships are moored beside it. At the same time, it is quite inconvenient for foreigners to land in Shantou from Queshi. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

Liuhuang: A Central News Agency reporter traveled to a certain location on the 24th to meet with a certain commander. According to discussions on the Chaoshan battle situation, the Japanese side, due to dwindling troop resources and war-weary people, is attempting to divert public attention with new stimuli. The terrain of Chaoshan is flat and close to the sea, lacking military value. After gaining compensation, the Chinese side will naturally shift positions according to the tactics of the second phase of the war of resistance, continuing to engage with Japan. The commander also stated that the estimated Japanese troop strength in Chaoshan is two regiments, with the 10th Division as the main force, interspersed with some puppet troops and naval landing forces. Their fighting spirit is unusually sluggish, while the morale of the Chinese side is strong, and the people's hearts are stirred. If the Japanese penetrate deeper, they will inevitably suffer heavy losses. Furthermore, a certain adjutant recounted the circumstances of the withdrawal from Shantou, stating that on the 23rd, dozens of Japanese aircraft carried out repeated low-altitude bombing runs. The Chinese troops guarding Shantou city and the remaining few civilians stood firm and did not retreat. In the evening, the Japanese landed at the Chaoyang pier and Butterfield & Swire pier, encountering ambushes by Chinese troops along the way, suffering many casualties. Chinese troops fought and retreated, making heroic sacrifices. Buildings in the city were set on fire, and Shantou city has almost become a ruin. (27th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Japanese troops have increased their forces in Shantou to over two thousand, using mechanized units to attack Anbu and Meixi along the railway. Fierce fighting occurred for two days, with heavy casualties on both sides. Over a thousand Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive. Chinese troops are holding the Caitang and Huamei stations, confronting the Japanese. A certain Chinese force has arrived in Jieyang and is rushing to the front lines to annihilate the enemy. The attack on Chaoshan is being carried out by the 104th Division of Guangzhou, with six thousand men. After occupying Shantou, they launched a rapid attack on Chao'an along the Chaoshan Railway and the Han River. By the afternoon of the 27th, Chinese troops, due to heavy casualties, reluctantly withdrew, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. (28th Afternoon Special Dispatch)

Jinhua: More than half of the Japanese troops who landed in Kanmen, Yuhuan on the morning of the 26th were annihilated by Chinese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to their ships. On the morning of the 27th, six more Japanese warships and a dozen speedboats arrived near Kanmen, cruising back and forth. Two Japanese aircraft also circled overhead, seemingly intending to land again. The Chinese side is on strict alert. (27th Dispatch)

(Fuzhou) Four Japanese warships sailed to the Hai'er Sea of Fuqing, more than a hundred miles south of the Minjiang estuary, yesterday afternoon. Several speedboats carried two to three hundred Japanese soldiers, who attacked the Qingfeng Township area of Dongyang Island, which belongs to Pingtan County. Fierce fighting broke out with Chinese self-defense forces. Japanese warships fired artillery bombardments, and multiple Japanese aircraft also assisted in the battle. The artillery fire was intense. The Pingtan County Magistrate is supervising the self-defense forces and continues to fight hard. Pingtan is also an island, and its position is similar to Yuhuan Island east of the Oujiang estuary. Dongyang Island is east of Pingtan Island, divided into the two islands of Daxiang and Xiaoxiang. (28th Dispatch)

### Resolution of the Tianjin Incident; British and Japanese to Hold Negotiations Soon; Japanese Side Puts Forward Four More Demands; British Side States Only Local Issues Will Be Discussed; Consuls from Both Countries Stationed in Tianjin Go to Tokyo to Participate in Talks and Discuss Solutions

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain today answered questions in the House of Commons regarding the situation in Tianjin, saying that British and Japanese authorities will meet in Tokyo to discuss the Tianjin case. The British government's intention is that actions such as strip searches should cease. This is the actual situation. The Prime Minister answered six questions on the order paper, saying that first the local situation will be discussed, and the delivery of fresh and perishable foods remains intermittent, with only a small portion of the usual supply reaching the British concession. British authorities are making every effort to remedy the current shortage. Since the start of the blockade, British citizens passing through the obstacles have been subjected to strict searches, but this has not been seen in the past day or two. British Ambassador to Tokyo Sir Robert Craigie has been in contact with the Japanese government for some time regarding the Tianjin case. Now I am able to announce that the British and Japanese governments, after exchanging views, have agreed to hold mutual discussions in Tokyo in order to resolve various issues concerning the Tianjin situation. These talks are about to begin and will focus on local disputes, aiming to ensure the maintenance of neutrality in the concession while preserving the British authority in the concession intact. Representatives from the British and Japanese authorities in Tianjin will now be invited to Tokyo to carry out this matter. The British government, in view of these talks, dares to expect that actions such as strip searches in Tianjin should cease. This is the actual situation. The British government, in this situation, believes there is no need to submit this case to the League of Nations Administrative Council for adjudication. A member asked whether the Tokyo talks would be limited to local disputes or would include the broader demands put forward by the Japanese spokesman in Tianjin. The Prime Minister replied that the talks concerned local disputes. Conservative MP Major General Knox asked whether, while the Tokyo talks have not achieved results, the Prime Minister will firmly insist that all interference with British citizens in Tianjin should absolutely cease, and will declare that we are a great power, so the patience we have maintained in the past two weeks is greater than that held by any great power in history. The Prime Minister did not answer this. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared in the House of Lords today that he has protested to Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu in the strongest terms regarding the strip searches of defenseless British citizens in Tianjin, and said that negotiations will begin in Tokyo soon in order to resolve the situation in Tianjin. Former President of the British Empire Chamber of Commerce Lord Elibank said that no diplomatic language used by the Foreign Secretary could be more forceful to make the Japanese government realize that Britain and its empire have been outraged by the unbearable insults inflicted on its nationals by the Japanese side, the improper coercive actions taken against trade interests by the Japanese side, and the Japanese government's lack of intention to curb this behavior. Labor Lord Snell continued to speak, saying that in the talks held in Tokyo, the recent Japanese bombing of China, which resulted in the death of a Canadian missionary couple, will be investigated. The Foreign Secretary replied that this matter certainly cannot be ignored. The Foreign Secretary also told Lord Elibank that the future talks in Tokyo will concern local events, and that he fully feels the strength of the natural and legitimate emotions that the Tianjin dispute has stirred up in the British people. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tianjin) According to an announcement by the British Consulate General today, British Consul Major Herbert will depart from Tanggu at 5:00 AM tomorrow aboard the British warship HMS Tadworth to go to Tokyo and participate in the British-Japanese Tianjin Incident negotiations to be held there. It is also heard that Tianjin Japanese Consul Tagami will also depart for home tomorrow to report on the Tianjin situation. The general situation in Tianjin has eased somewhat today. No untoward incidents have been reported at the entrances and exits of the concession. Because the tense situation here has shown signs of easing, the attention of the general public has shifted to the Tokyo aspect. There is much worry and speculation about the outcome of the future negotiations and their impact on British interests in North China. Yesterday afternoon, a British tugboat carrying several Chinese and foreign passengers was detained at the Dalian pier inspection point for as long as seven hours. It was not released until after repeated negotiations between the British side and the Japanese consular authorities, arriving at the Bund of the British concession at 11:00 PM in the evening. Upon arrival, it was again blocked by a Japanese military patrol boat, but there were no further actions. Tianjin US Marine Corps Commander Lieutenant Colonel Hawthorne visited Tianjin Japanese Garrison Commander Honma this morning. The Japanese commander visited in return in the afternoon. Regarding general shipping conditions, there are no unexpected reports today. Only the Japanese do not allow rickshaws to enter the property of a certain British shipping company in Tanggu, forcing general travelers to walk half a mile before being able to hire a car. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

British Newspapers Suspect Tokyo Talks

(London) British newspapers have welcomed Japan's agreement to begin Tianjin negotiations with Britain in Tokyo with cautious language, but their words contain a strong sense of doubt. The News Chronicle published an article by the famous reporter Mr. Bartlett, saying that he had heard authoritative warnings from faraway countries such as the United States, India, and New Zealand, that if a "appeasement" policy were to reappear in the Far East, it would be enough to bring about harmful effects, but now he dares not immediately guarantee that the government has not planned appeasement. The Japanese side has not publicly apologized for the atrocities committed against British citizens in Tianjin, causing countries in the Far East to have the mistaken impression that Britain has submitted itself to Japan's hegemony in China. The Manchester Guardian said that the Japanese side will test how far it can push Britain in other areas such as the currency of North China. It is hoped that the British government will not return to a policy of appeasement, which can only obtain temporary comfort and is not a permanent solution. The Daily Mail said that today's question is what kind of cooperation the Japanese side will express. If the Japanese side puts forward demands to undermine the autonomy of the concession, urging that the residents of the concession be handed over to a puppet who is in fact controlled by Japanese warlords, then accepting the demands is out of the question. As for the economic aspect, if the Japanese side demands recognition of the United Reserve Bank of China notes and the handover of 50 million yuan of the National Government's cash currently in the British concession, these are all out of the question. The Daily Telegraph said that Japanese Army General Honma gently mentioned that the "traffic restrictions" cited during the Tianjin blockade are still the main point of contention in Japanese policy. The implementation of these traffic restrictions is to retaliate against the Western powers. Now it seems to have reached the point of putting the possibility of restricting the economic traffic of British citizens at the forefront of any negotiations. The Times published a letter from Mr. Phillips, who earnestly stated that a large number of Oriental communities under British rule in Hong Kong, Malaysia, North Borneo, and other parts of the Far East, if the British government continues to fail to protect the people of the British concession in Tianjin and allows them to be insulted by the Japanese, the impact on the aforementioned communities will be unimaginable. When the House of Lords met today, MP Lord Elibank asked a question, earnestly stating the danger of the Tianjin situation being unable to break the siege, and asking the government to pay attention to what consequences would occur if the Japanese were to inflict unbearable insults on British citizens again. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo Newspapers Threaten Britain

(Tokyo) Today, the newspapers here are paying attention to Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin incident. Chugai Commercial News stated that the British concession in Tianjin is nothing less than a "microcosm" of Britain's pro-Chiang policy. It is well known that Britain is eager to protect its interests in China, but if Britain fails to pay due attention to the "reality" of North China, it may lose all of its interests in North China. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the British side will not be able to resolve the Tianjin dispute simply by handing over the murderer of Cheng Xigeng, or have any benefit in adjusting the increasingly hostile situation between Britain and Japan. The newspaper also stated that the force of circumstances has forced Britain to revise its pro-Chiang anti-Japanese policy. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Japan Blocks All of China's Seas

In the recent war against China, after suffering major defeats in Jinxi and Northern Hubei, Japan's clay feet are sinking deeper and deeper, into an utterly helpless situation. Yet suddenly, it is attempting to expand its battlefield: openly taking a challenging attitude towards Britain in North China, using violence to blockade the British concession, and wantonly insulting British military personnel and civilians, almost without resorting to anything; in the Northeast, the war with the Soviet Union is also openly igniting. Judging from the number of enemy planes shot down claimed in the war reports of both sides, the severity of the situation is actually no less than the rekindling of the Zhanggufeng Incident; in China, Japan is tightening its coastal blockade and dispatching troops to land everywhere on various seaports and islands. A few days ago, it had just seized Shantou, and recently it successively occupied places such as the Zhoushan Islands. Yesterday, it occupied Hutou Island and Kanmen Port on Yuhuan Island along the coast of Wenzhou, as well as Chuanshi Island outside the Minjiang estuary. Looking at it this way, almost all of the few remaining seaports along the coasts of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong in China have been blockaded and occupied by the Japanese army.

In the eyes of the Japanese naval and military personnel, these successive demonstrations and victorious occupations (?) are truly war achievements worthy of exaggeration and boasting! People in the international community who do not understand the inside story may be shocked for a moment, thinking that Japan still has the ability to do something and still has so-called prestige; and the Japanese people who are trapped in the news control network may have their views and hearings shifted for a moment, and thus become more excited; even those who want to compromise with Japan may therefore be more likely to soften and surrender. But how much does this ultimately harm China's strength to resist Japan?

Are we talking about blockading the source of China's military supplies? Because of the difficult inland transportation, these seaports have never been used as routes for military supplies to enter. The current blockade naturally does not hinder China's source of military needs. Are we talking about destroying China's main military forces? The site of the decisive battle between China and Japan is already not on the coast but in the interior; and since internal transportation in these ports is difficult, the Japanese army's occupation of these places is no different from the previous occupation of places such as Xiamen and Qiongzhou, merely wasting military strength and without any war results. The result is only to provide China with materials for the "war of attrition." As for hindering China's commercial traffic and the general coastal economy, there may be some truth to it; but we must understand that China's current economic activities have actually developed as much as possible towards the southwest, which is the base of resistance against Japan. China is planning to isolate the prosperity of the controlled economic forces in the occupied areas, in order to avoid the suspicion of providing resources to the enemy; even if coastal traffic is cut off, this is also a manifestation of the spirit of a brave man cutting off his wrist when stung by a poisonous snake, so what is there to worry about! Moreover, coastal blockades can at least limit the convenience of leaks and circulation for some nominal domestic goods and high-priced foreign goods, which is not without benefit to the war of resistance economy.

Therefore, from China's perspective, the actual damage from the Japanese army's blockade and occupation of coastal seaports is actually very small; the central issue is that Japan's destruction of the interests of European and American countries in China has become more prominent and has fallen into an unrecoverable situation. We know that the only remaining interests of European and American countries in China are the so-called shipping industry; however, the Yangtze River is not allowed to be navigable, and various restrictions are imposed on the Pearl River and Qingdao, so the degree of damage they have suffered is considerable; now, several important ports along the coast, such as Shantou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, have been completely blockaded by the Japanese army, so what coastal shipping industry can European and American countries talk about in the future? Therefore, Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast is in effect no different from thoroughly driving out European and American businesses in China, which is obvious.

Now that Britain and the United States still want to talk to Japan about legal principles, it has already given you a de facto disregard. The pitiful isolationists in the United States still think that the fire has not yet burned their eyebrows; and the pitiful Mr. Chamberlain, in the anti-British movement in Tianjin, has already admitted to suffering great "unbearable insults," but still does not give up hope of compromising on the spot; now Japan has also abruptly blockaded all of China's coastal British shipping, in order to maintain its position in China, I wonder how Britain will try to obtain a compromise? The British Navy seems to be still obsessed with legal principles, thinking that the Sino-Japanese war is an undeclared war, and that ships of third countries should have the freedom to enter and exit occupied ports, hoping to obtain Japan's permission for this reason. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side openly acknowledged that the undeclared war is a common occurrence in ordinary wars, and openly acknowledged it as a "wartime blockade." We know that a wartime blockade is entirely a wartime act after a declaration of war. How can Japan wage war against China without a declaration of war, and use the name of a blockade to hinder the entry and exit of ships of other countries? Isn't this a blatant violation of the principles of maritime freedom and neutral commerce in international law? Isn't this intentionally mocking the UK for being powerless?

I remember when Japan first announced the blockade of the Chinese coast, it also declared that it would respect the trade of third countries; later, it repeatedly harmed the trading interests of the UK and the US, and the UK and the US remained silent and did not take any action in practice. Now Japan is intensifying its efforts to implement a thorough blockade of the entire coast. This intimidating arrogance is merely a threat to the UK and the US. If the UK and the US are truly willing to abandon their commercial interests in China and completely withdraw their Far East national defenses, then so be it; at this moment, we really no longer need arguments about legal principles, but only a manifestation of action. This decisive matter may be the last touchstone!

### Japan Forbids Foreign Ships to Stay in Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Britain and the United States Ignore It. Japan Must Bear Any Damages. British Warship Carries Passengers and Mail into Shantou Port.

(Washington) An official of the State Department stated today that the United States would ignore the Japanese warning to foreign ships and foreigners to leave Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Japan must be responsible for any damage suffered by American ships. (Reuter, 27th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently spoke in the House of Commons about the situation in South China, saying, "The Japanese authorities have announced their intention to take military action against the two ports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou in China on the 27th of this month. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, made a request to the British Consul-General, Phillips, stating that merchant ships and warships of all countries should leave these ports before noon on the 29th of this month. The British Consul-General immediately rejected this request, saying that the right of British ships to navigate to various ports in China should not be infringed upon. Regarding this matter, the British government believes that the Japanese authorities have no right to unduly interfere with the movements of British ships and the lives and property of British citizens." (Havas, 28th)

(Hong Kong) The British ships Sistan and Guangdong have been waiting outside Shantou all day, unable to enter the port. The situation is unclear. However, it is understood that the British destroyer Sunart (905 tons) has already carried the passengers and mail of the Sistan into the port. What is currently known for sure is that the two merchant ships are still anchored outside Shantou. (Reuter, 28th)

(Hong Kong) British ships and other foreign ships in Wenzhou and Fuzhou had Japanese planes flying over them yesterday afternoon, dropping canisters containing notices requesting all ships to leave the port immediately. Norwegian and Italian ships docked in Wenzhou complied with this request, but the two British warships and the British ships Hai Qing and Xinjiang in Fuzhou ignored the warnings and remained in port. At the same time, the Japanese side announced that it had occupied key points outside the Oujiang River estuary in Wenzhou this morning at 10 a.m. and occupied several islands at the Minjiang River estuary, thus blockading Fuzhou and Wenzhou. (Reuter, 28th)

(Fuzhou) Eight Japanese warships gathered off the coast of the Minjiang River estuary. Six of them left at 11 a.m. this morning, and eight more arrived at 4 p.m. in the afternoon, including an aircraft carrier carrying 21 Japanese aircraft. Four Japanese warships also arrived off the coast of Fuqing south of the Minjiang River estuary. There are now a total of fourteen Japanese warships and many Japanese boats. Japanese aircraft have been taking off alternately over the past two days, attacking the Minjiang River and the coastal area, dropping hundreds of bombs in places such as Changmen, Meihua, Wulongjiang, Diezhou Township, Hongshan Bridge, and Baisha Township. Various places are under air raid day and night. (Telegram, 28th)

(Washington) Regarding the Japanese notification requesting ships of third countries to leave Fuzhou and Wenzhou, a State Department official said today that the American Consul in Shanghai, Gauss, had rejected it, on the grounds that American citizens have the right to reside in and travel to the treaty ports (i.e., commercial ports) in China. If the Japanese cause any damage to the lives and property of American citizens, the United States government will hold Japan accountable. It is reported that the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, also gave the same response, saying that the United States has the freedom of navigation in the waters off China. (Associated Press, 28th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the Japanese side has decided to occupy the two ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in China, and has requested that all ships and residents of various countries withdraw from these ports. The State Department has received reports of this matter. It has been found that the Japanese side has made such requests before taking military action in various parts of China. As for the claim that withdrawal is required before noon on the 29th of this month, the State Department has not received an official report. (Havas, 27th)

(Hong Kong) The British ships Xin Haimen and Guangdong, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou on the morning of the 27th, arrived in Shantou on the morning of the 28th and were prevented from entering the port by the Japanese army. After negotiations by the British Consul and the captain of the British warship Dannat with the Japanese Consul, it was ineffective. It is reported that the British naval authorities have decided to send warships to escort the two ships into the port on the afternoon of the 28th. (Telegram, 28th)

(Hong Kong) After the emergency in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, Zhongjiao and other banks suspended remittances to these two places starting on the morning of the 28th. Telegrams are still working. Britain has decided to ignore the Japanese military's announcement limiting ships to leaving Fuzhou and Wenzhou. After Noel returns to Hong Kong from Singapore on the 30th, he will personally handle the Japanese military's unreasonable blockade of Chinese commercial ports. In other news, Britain will equip larger ships sailing in the Far East with two cannons for armed self-defense. (Special Dispatch, 28th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul-General in Shantou, Matsudaira, has rejected Britain's request to allow foreign ships to enter Shantou Port. It is reported that Matsudaira replied to the British Consul-General, Mr. Li, that foreign ships cannot be allowed to enter Shantou Port in order to maintain peaceful order. Matsudaira also asked Mr. Li to pay attention to the unfriendly attitude taken by the British authorities towards Japanese military operations in South China. It is reported that the British naval authorities have decided that if the Japanese side does indeed attempt to prevent foreign ships from sailing into Shantou Port, they intend to send warships to protect foreign ships heading to Shantou. The ships Guangdong and another British ship are currently anchored outside Shantou Port. The British naval authorities are now planning to escort the two ships into port today. (Reuter, 28th)

(Hong Kong) The British Consul in Shantou, Mr. Li, along with the commander of the British destroyer, visited the Japanese Consul-General in Shantou yesterday afternoon. Mr. Li requested that the Japanese authorities recognize the principle that foreign ships have the right to freely enter and leave Shantou Port. His reasoning was that since China and Japan have not declared war, third countries do not need to comply with the obligations of neutral countries. The Japanese Consul-General replied that British ships were attempting to disrupt Japanese military operations (referring to hindering the Japanese army's landing in Shantou), and that Britain was taking an unfriendly attitude towards Japanese military operations in South China. Now that the waters off Shantou are under the control of the Japanese army, in order to maintain order, the passage of foreign ships is temporarily prohibited. However, for the convenience of foreign residents, one British ship per week will be allowed to enter the port to transport food and mail. This is a special accommodation. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

(London) Churchill said in a speech in London today that July, August, and September must be regarded as the most tense period in the European situation. He attaches great importance to the position in which he finds himself today, which is very similar to what was discovered last year. The only important difference is that there is no room for retreat this year. He does not believe that war is inevitable, but if one examines Germany's preparations, the tone of the newspapers under the German government's control, and the speeches of the Nazi leaders, it is impossible to argue that the worst-case scenario will not occur or will not occur immediately. He wishes to advise Hitler that before rashly plunging into a terrible war with unknown consequences, he should consider whether his lifelong task of liberating Germany will be reduced to nothing. Britain has now reached the point of no return, and Hitler should be aware of this. He also agreed with the French Prime Minister Daladier's statement that the forces of aggression have gathered. He now knows that British defense forces, especially the air force, are mostly in a state of active alert. (Reuter, 28th)

Churchill also praised the government's calm attitude in confronting Japan, believing that the Japanese provocative actions in the Far East were in tacit agreement with the German side, in order to lure the main force of the British fleet to the Far East, and then Germany would launch in Europe. Fortunately, the government dealt with it calmly, and the conspiracy did not succeed. (Associated Press, 28th)

### French Prime Minister Firmly States: Maintain Peace with Armed Force. The Moment of Critical Importance Is Approaching on the Eve of a Great War. Encourage the Entire Nation to Unite and Face the National Crisis Together.

(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies announced its adjournment today. Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier attended and delivered an important speech, stating that the seriousness of the international situation today is unprecedented in the past twenty years. "They are concentrated outside our borders, with nearly three million soldiers, not counting members of paramilitary organizations and factory workers. Moreover, in recent times, even larger numbers of troops have been concentrated. The primary duty of our government is to strengthen national defense. The government spares no expense, using hundreds of billions for national defense, and the reason for this is that we are prepared to cooperate sincerely with all nations to consolidate peace, but we are also determined to confront any attempt to control the world by force with all our strength." (All deputies cheered unanimously.) Prime Minister Daladier finally said that the Chamber of Deputies can be convened at any time if necessary during the adjournment. In addition, the Prime Minister also delivered a speech in the Senate, stating, "Today, the most important tasks we bear are threefold: first, to expand military preparations; second, to unite the whole country; and third, to closely monitor the development of the situation. Indeed, if France is not strong or united, there is no hope of preserving freedom. We are determined to maintain peace in Europe and will resolutely oppose any attempt to undermine peace." (Havas, 27th)

(Rome) The Italian Army is scheduled to hold a week-long exercise in the western Po River valley from August 3rd to 9th. Once the exercise is over, the participating troops will be personally inspected by King Emmanuele III. (Havas, 27th)

### Thousands of Germans Sneak into Danzig. Join the Nazi Volunteer Corps.

Warsaw The official news agency, the Pat Agency, recently released news that last night, 1,400 Germans, from East Prussia, snuck into the Free City of Danzig in many armored vehicles and cars to join the newly organized Nazi Party volunteer corps. (Havas, 28th)

### Britain Issues New Instructions. The Three Countries Reopen Negotiations. All Demands Proposed by the Soviet Union. Britain Can Accept in Principle.

(London) A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government last night issued new instructions regarding the negotiations for the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression pact to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union and Special Envoy of the Foreign Office Strang. It is expected that after these instructions arrive, the British representatives and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will hold further meetings within this week. (Reuter, 28th)

(Paris) According to absolutely reliable sources here last night, the British government authorities are about to accept all the demands of the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time and jointly sign a military alliance treaty with France and the Soviet Union. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has instructed Foreign Office Envoy Strang to accept the conditions proposed by the Soviet side and conclude a military alliance treaty on the spot in Moscow as soon as possible. According to the British attitude, if it fails to achieve results, and the Soviet government strictly adheres to neutrality as a threat to Britain, the British side sent new instructions to Strang last night. It is learned that Strang has requested the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to receive him on Thursday, at which time the Soviet conditions can be implemented and accepted by the British representative. It is heard that he will have the right to give a nominal guarantee to the security of the Baltic countries. Also, according to the Soviet Union's claim, the provisions on mutual assistance should take effect immediately, so that the Soviet authorities can implement preliminary actions when Poland, Romania, or the Baltic countries are threatened by aggression. This has already been prepared for acceptance by the British side. In addition, the British government has also expressed its agreement to the holding of staff meetings by the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and to the plan for cooperation between the naval, land, and air forces. (Associated Press, 28th)

(London) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic figures recently stated that the government's new instructions will be telegraphed to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union tonight, so that he can continue negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov based on the following two principles: (1) The United Kingdom should promise to give automatic and indirect guarantees to the "neutral countries," namely Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, in principle. (2) The names of the three countries can be clearly stated. The reason why these instructions must be sent at night is to carefully consider the wording so that the Soviet government can accept it in principle without any further objections. Moreover, the outline of the instructions was already discussed and finalized by the United Kingdom and France last week. (Havas, 27th)

### Berlin Watches

(Berlin) The progress of the negotiations for the mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union has attracted much attention from political and journalistic circles here. The Politische Auslands-Korrespondenz fiercely attacked the attempt to force a guarantee on the Baltic coastal countries, saying, "This method aims to achieve its own goals and does not hesitate to sacrifice the sovereignty of third countries. This is common in international affairs. Those Baltic coastal countries believe that it is appropriate to remain neutral in war, but other countries are trying to control their destiny. The military ambitions have already been revealed. In short, the British government, in order to avoid accepting new constraints in the Far East, does not hesitate to make major concessions to the Soviet Union in Europe. This is especially evident." (Havas, 28th)

### Soviet Black Sea Fleet Completes Maneuvers

(Moscow) According to the Pravda, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet completed its maneuvers today. Soviet Naval Minister Kuznetsov inspected the fleet's maneuvers. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

### Outer Mongolia Attacked Again. Soviet-Mongolian Planes Take to the Air to Fight Back. Seven Japanese-Manchukuo Planes Shot Down.

(Moscow) Semi-official sources recently received news from the General Staff of the Soviet and Outer Mongolian Armies, stating that 80 Japanese-Manchukuo fighter planes and 30 bomber planes launched an air raid today on the areas of Tanchak and Bulak, 120 kilometers inside the Outer Mongolian border. The Soviet and Mongolian air forces immediately took to the air to counterattack, resulting in the downing of five Japanese-Manchukuo fighter planes and two bomber planes. At the same time, six Soviet and Mongolian planes did not return to base and are being searched for. As a result of the air raid, only two cottages were damaged and five people were injured in the Bayanhongor aimag. (Havas, 27th)

(Moscow) According to news from the Soviet military headquarters, Japanese-Manchukuo air forces today again invaded Outer Mongolian airspace and attacked the Danchai Bulak area, 120 kilometers from the border. Six Soviet and Mongolian aircraft did not return to base and are currently being searched for. Also, five people were injured. (TASS, 27th)

(Chongqing) The Central Weekly Society and more than 30 cultural organizations telegraphed Mongolian compatriots, commending their resistance and hoping that they would strive to kill the enemy and establish strategic links with the Central Plains war. (Telegram, 28th)

### Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Recalled Home. German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to Post.

(Tokyo) Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Mr. Smithanin, has been recalled home and will depart on July 5. Since the former Ambassador, Mr. Raftski, was recalled, the affairs of the embassy have been handled by Mr. Smithanin. The negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Japanese government on the fisheries issue were conducted by Mr. Smithanin. It is found that the first secretary, army attaché, and naval attaché in the Soviet Embassy have all been ordered to be recalled, but have not yet returned to their posts. The positions have been vacant for a long time. It is not known who will be responsible for diplomatic affairs after Mr. Smithanin leaves Japan. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

(Berlin) According to sources here, German industrialists held a meeting at the end of last week, advocating the dispatch of a military-commercial delegation to the Soviet Union to discuss trade issues between Germany and the Soviet Union. As for the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Berger, after returning home this time and discussing matters with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has now returned to the Soviet Union to continue his duties. He will return home for instructions within six weeks. It is intriguing what negotiations will be conducted with the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Wellington Koo Speaks in England: Importance of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Powers Cannot Stand Idly By as Japan Destroys It.

(London) Chinese Ambassador to France, Dr. Wellington Koo, recently gave a speech at the Billington Building here, entitled "The Open Door Policy and World Peace." He first described the origin of the Open Door Policy and elaborated on the importance of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, stating that the signatory countries of the treaty, except for China, all declared that they would respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. In China, it was promised to maintain the Open Door Policy. All these principles have greatly benefited the prosperity of China and other signatory countries. However, since the September 18 Incident in Shenyang on September 18, 1931, Japan has been trying to exclude the interests of other countries from China. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the trade figures of various countries in the occupied areas of China have been constantly declining, while Japan's trade with China, which accounted for only 6.5% of the total trade of various countries with China in 1936, increased to 38.5% in 1938, which can be seen. (Havas, 28th)

, when he vehemently condemned Britain's weak attitude toward the Tianjin incident, he received unanimous support. As for another group of people, they advocated that American foreign policy should be governed by international law. According to the opinion of Republican isolationist Senator Fess, the Bloom Act would make the United States join hands with Britain and France, so it cannot be considered a neutrality law. (Associated Press, 28th)

### The Blum Bill: Six Key Points

(Washington) The Blum Neutrality Act Amendment proposed by Chairman Blum of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has six key points:

(1.   After the outbreak of war, to ensure the safety of the United States, or to maintain peace for the United States, or to protect the lives of American citizens, the President may, if necessary, designate the countries at war as belligerents.

2.   Once a belligerent country is designated, American citizens may not travel on ships of that country.

3.   Once a belligerent country is designated, it shall not be granted credit or loans, nor shall securities be bought or sold to it. Only short-term commercial credit may be granted, and the details shall be announced by the President every three months. Violators of the above prohibitions shall be subject to imprisonment and a fine of up to $50,000.

4.   All goods shipped to belligerent countries shall have their ownership transferred before export. According to this provision, the shipment of American arms to belligerent countries is not prohibited.

5.   Donations of funds or goods from American citizens to belligerent countries based on humanitarian grounds shall be announced by the President.

6.   The provisions of this law shall not apply to Latin American countries in the event of war.

In addition, the current procedures for obtaining export licenses for arms will be maintained. It is reported that the most intense attacks from the opposition were on the following two points: first, that the President could designate war zones and prohibit American ships and people from entering them; second, that the terms of commercial credit granted to belligerent countries could be determined by the President's full authority. In order to make the Blum Amendment easier to pass, the leaders of the House government faction have decided to eliminate these two points. Regarding the second point, most members of Congress may accept it, but with a limit of ninety days, according to a Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th.

### Roosevelt Vigorously Argues to Congress to Maintain Currency Control Power, Saying That the Abolition of This Power Will Affect National Defense, Silver Prices Plunge, Mexico Suspends Foreign Exchange Transactions

Hyde Park, New York. After the Senate passed an amendment yesterday to abolish the President's power to change the fineness of the dollar, President Roosevelt met with reporters here and made a statement, saying: "If this power is abolished, our national defense will inevitably be affected. If a country's foreign trade is affected, its national strength will inevitably weaken. However, the Senate's vote is not the final decision on this issue and still requires a joint committee of the House and Senate to discuss it. In short, my term for this power expires at midnight on the 30th of this month. If it cannot be extended before the expiration date, then currency control will revert to Wall Street, which will be enough to prompt speculators and international bankers to manipulate the price of the dollar for their own private interests, as they did before 1933. The impact of this will be the arrival of a period of international monetary chaos again. The economies of the United States and other countries will be adversely affected and it is appropriate to find ways to avoid this." This statement has been explained by government officials, saying that the President is determined not to let Congress deprive him of his power and will respond strongly with all his strength. At this moment, a compromise solution can still be sought, but if the opposition insists on a "negative" attitude, then President Roosevelt will make Congress understand where its responsibilities lie. In view of the President's statement that national defense will be affected, it is known that the President's main focus is still on the international situation. Regarding this, people close to the President said that if the President's power is limited, all totalitarian states will believe that American foreign policy has been constrained and the chances of European conflicts will increase, which President Roosevelt is eager to avoid. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)

Foreign Policy Will Not Change

(Washington) The Senate yesterday passed the Townsend Amendment, deciding to stop buying silver abroad. Semi-official sources have commented that this does not mean that the United States is changing its current foreign policy. The Townsend Amendment was rejected mainly from the perspective of domestic politics, so there is not much to worry about. On the contrary, what the government authorities feel anxious about is the Senate's refusal to grant President Roosevelt two other powers: first, the power to change the gold content of the dollar, and second, the power to regulate domestic silver prices. The government must do its best to maintain these, especially the power to purchase silver from abroad. After the United States stops purchasing silver from abroad, the most directly affected will be Mexico. Members of Congress have long been dissatisfied with the Mexican government's confiscation of American merchants' oil mines and its failure to meet the demands of the American companies involved. No one defends Mexico. Moreover, after hearing about the passage of the Townsend Amendment, the Mexican government immediately asked the United States to provide assurances regarding the continued purchase of silver from abroad, in order to compare it with the government's persistent attitude in the oil mine confiscation case. There is a great difference between their current obsequiousness and their previous arrogance. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)

Not Much Impact on China

Washington. According to experts from the Treasury Department, they have no intention of manipulating the domestic economy by using presidential privileges. Their only intention is to protect American currency from being affected by foreign currency devaluations. If the bill to abolish the silver purchase law is passed by the House of Representatives, then China may not be affected, because the amount of silver that China can sell is already very small. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)

Senators Unanimous

(Washington) There is currently a feeling in the US Congress that if President Roosevelt wants to maintain the equalization fund, he must accept the termination of his dollar devaluation powers and higher silver prices. Currently, a group of forty-eight senators is united. If the House does not agree with the Senate's amendment yesterday and returns the original bill to the Senate, then they will do everything possible to prevent the passage of the entire currency bill. It is reported that the Senate approved the government's $2 billion equalization fund yesterday and passed the following amendments: (1) Allowing the Treasury Department to have a 40% seigniorage tax when buying domestic silver and increasing the price of newly mined domestic silver to 77.4 cents per ounce; (2) Stopping the Treasury Department's power to buy silver from abroad; (3) All of the President's powers to reduce currency values will terminate on June 30th. (Reuter's dispatch on the 27th)

Treasury Reduces Silver Prices

(Washington) The US Treasury Department today reduced the price of buying foreign silver in New York from 43 cents per ounce to 40 cents. Officials have not yet announced the reason for lowering the foreign silver purchase price, but some say that the difference between the London and New York market prices is widening. If the purchase price does not change, then the quantity of deliveries to the US Treasury Department will be huge, so the US Treasury Department has to take this action. According to the official price of large silver from Handy & Harman in New York, it has been reduced from 42.75 cents per ounce to 39.75 cents. (Reuter's dispatch on the 27th)

(Washington) The United States currently sets the price for buying silver from abroad at 43 cents in US currency per ounce. The Treasury Department has decided to reduce it to 40 cents per ounce, effective from noon today (local time) for a period of 24 hours. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)

(London) Silver merchants here are generally pessimistic due to the US Treasury Department's large cuts in foreign silver prices and expect silver prices to continue to fall. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)

Government Can Still Buy Gold

(Washington) President Roosevelt's currency powers will expire on the 30th of this month. The government has submitted a bill requesting a two-year extension. The Senate yesterday passed an amendment to "abolish the President's power to change the fineness of the dollar." This matter has been commented on by experts from the Treasury Department, saying that even if the House of Representatives follows the Senate in abolishing the President's special privilege, the President can still find ways to change the value of the dollar when necessary, because the President still has the power to order the Treasury Department to buy gold, and its terms and methods are not subject to any restrictions. As long as the purchase of gold continues, the price of gold can be increased, and the value of the dollar will be lowered accordingly. Previously, in 1933, President Roosevelt raised the price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35, which is a previous example. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)

Mexico Suspends Foreign Exchange Transactions

Mexico. Banks in Mexico yesterday suspended foreign exchange transactions. It is reported that this move is the result of the US Senate's passage of the bill to abolish the silver purchase law. Also, the black market price of the dollar here is 5.25 pesos (Mexican silver dollars), a decrease of 0.75 pesos compared to the past. According to the announcement by the Bank of Mexico, the supply of foreign exchange will be temporarily suspended until the United States continues to purchase foreign silver. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)

Mexico. The Silver Mining Association here claimed today that if the US Treasury Department decides to stop buying silver, it will be a fatal blow to the Mexican silver mining industry. It is reported that the total investment in Mexico's silver mining industry amounts to 1,000,000,000 US dollars, mostly American capital. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)

### "Federal" Puppet Organization: Rumors of Imminent Appearance

(Beiping) It is rumored that the Japanese authorities here are preparing to announce a kind of Chinese federal government on July 7, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War.

### The Soviet Window to the West

— Te Ye

"Wehrmacht," the official newspaper of the German Army General Staff, recently published an article. From reading it, one can see that Germany is extremely worried about the Soviet Union's military deployments along the Arctic coast, because it fears that if the Soviet Union seizes the mineral resources of the Scandinavian countries, it will be very unfavorable to Germany. Reading this article also reveals the reasons why Germany has been making every effort to win over the four countries in Scandinavia to conclude non-aggression pacts with it, and why Finland has been vigorously advocating the fortification of the Aaland Islands, while the Soviet Union has been vigorously opposing it. Currently, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have all signed non-aggression treaties with Germany, but Finland has refused. As for the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands, Finland, intimidated by the power of the Soviet Union, is reportedly going to give up.

The desolate Murman coast lies on the edge of Northern Europe. There are no forests there. Only moss grows on the rocks. Even if there are trees, they are only a few stunted ones, swaying precariously. The strong winds blowing from the Arctic Ocean sweep into the Kola Peninsula, and are unstoppable. However, the warm Gulf Stream has chosen this place as its stopping point, so the coastal area is free from ice all year round. Perhaps another generation will pass before Europeans are willing to live there. If there is no significant progress in science, then these remote corners of the Arctic Ocean will remain the same as they have been for centuries, without any inhabitants.

The Soviet Union's Arctic attack base has become a reality. A country encompassing two continents has established such a strong base in this far northwest corner. This is a natural result of Russia's active diplomatic policy. Moreover, the Soviet Union is the successor to the Tsarist Empire, and naturally will not relax its grip on a single step, as it has a great political game to play.

Peter the Great was the first to organize the poorly trained troops of Great Russia to back up his clear diplomatic policies. He had two goals: (1) "To open a window to the West" and gain insight into Europe; (2) To become a maritime power. He never achieved the latter goal, and neither did any of the Russian emperors who followed him.

Until recently, Russia had no channel to the sea. Someone said: "Russia's only gateway to the sea is this Murman coast abandoned by God" and there is no other place. This may seem absurd, but a look at the map of Russia confirms that this is indeed the case. Although Russia has the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea as its borders, both places can be blocked by smaller countries in the event of war. Moreover, the Russian corner of the Baltic Sea is frozen for several months of the year. Vladivostok freezes in the winter and faces Japan, so it cannot be considered a "useful window on the Pacific." As for the remaining Arctic coast, it is far from the country's industrial centers, and can only be accessed for a little over two months of the year. Even when it is accessible, it is very dangerous.

Therefore, Russia only has the 200 miles of land along the Murman coast in the far north that is ice-free all year round. However, heavy ships can only find anchorages in an area of less than about 50 miles.

One of the Soviet Union's main goals is to gain the status of a world power. If this is the case, then the first step must be to become a maritime power. Stalin, the sole heir to the Tsar, ordered that no expense be spared to reach the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore used manpower, materials, and money on a grand scale to achieve this goal. The Murman Railway was completed long ago, and it is said that double tracks have now been laid, or that the line has been electrified by hydroelectric plants. The branch lines leading to the Finnish border will also be completed or are under construction. The road network is also constantly expanding, especially the work in Karelia.

Military mobilization requires good transportation lines. According to news from the north, the current transportation is sufficient to move several divisions of troops. Another transportation artery from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea has directly connected Leningrad to the Arctic ports, which has reduced the sea journey around the Scandinavian Peninsula by half. Unfortunately, that canal is also blocked by ice for half the year.

The Kola Peninsula has abundant and important raw materials, such as apatite for making phosphorus, as well as iron, nickel, and other metals. Even in southern Karelia, important treasures have been discovered.

In recent years, the population has increased rapidly, exceeding many times the previous number. The majority of Finnish-speaking residents, originally in Russian Karelia, have gradually moved out. A large area along the Finnish border has no civilians living there, and is garrisoned by crack troops. These huge numbers of special border guards are directly controlled by the secret military affairs department. In this Arctic and sub-Arctic land with a sparse population, it is extremely important to station well-trained air force units. Therefore, many airfields have been built. No one knows how many there are or what their capacity is. It is said that two of them each have hangars that can accommodate 40 aircraft.

The Murman Railway is 1,000 miles long and terminates in Murmansk. This was originally an insignificant place, but in the past ten years, the population has increased to over 100,000, and modern docks and harbor facilities have been built. Arctic icebreakers and fishing boats are moored there, and foreign trade income is increasing year by year. 20 miles north of Murmansk is Polyarnoye (formerly Aleksandrovsk). The fortresses in the town are constantly being reinforced with military equipment. The long-range artillery can effectively prevent enemy ships from entering the 50-mile-long bay. Currently, only smaller warships are moored there, such as torpedo cruisers, mine boats, submarines, auxiliary ships, and even aircraft carriers. Last year, according to news from certain sources, there were 25 torpedo boats and 15 submarines in the harbor, all of which were recently built. The submarine equipment can be used as mine-laying vessels. Today, even Sweden feels threatened by the Soviet Navy in the Arctic. Most importantly, it is said that several new cruisers, which will soon be completed, will be assigned to serve in the Arctic Ocean. (To be continued)

### Intense Battles with Japanese Troops Invading the Jiangsu-Anhui Border, More Than Two Thousand Troops Dispatched in Seven Routes, Exhausting Their Tactics, They Resort to Poison Gas

Correspondent in Xuzhou: The Japanese troops in Xuzhou consider the guerrilla units in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area to be very active, and intend to actively carry out their so-called "mopping up" plan before the green crops grow tall. In the middle of last month, they dispatched troops to attack the Chinese army positions in Xiao, Su, and other counties west of the Jinpu Railway. On the 29th, they were equipped with more than 300 troops, 14 cars, 2 armored vehicles, and 1 plane, and occupied Shicun. On the 30th, they occupied Yinjihu. On the 31st, Shuanggo, Xuzhou, Suining, Jiagou, Fuliji, Shicun, and other Japanese troops launched seven routes, a total of more than 2,000 people, more than 90 cars, 15 tanks, and more than 20 flat-firing guns, and attacked Zhangshan, Chulan, Shixiang, Mengzhai in Xiao County, Dahong, Li Chuanqiao, Qianyang Meishan in Lingbi, and Da Li Ji, etc. in Sui County. The Chinese guerrillas of the × Column and the Lingbi Regular Army first came into contact with the Japanese troops in Shuanggo Fangcun in the Dahongli area, and there were casualties on both sides. Subsequently, the Lingbi Regular Army fought with the Japanese army to seize the major hills several times. Although the Japanese army fired more than a hundred shells, the Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army did not succeed. At the same time, ×× Detachment also encountered the Japanese army in Dayang Qianyang Meishan Zhangshan Chunshu Wang Sunzhai Mengzhai and other places, and fought fiercely. Nearly a thousand Japanese troops in Zhangshan Meishan Mengzhai fought with the Chinese × Route Army to seize the hills, which were lost and recaptured several times. The Japanese troops, exhausting their tactics, disregarded humanity and fired poison gas three times, causing hundreds of casualties among the Chinese × Route Army. Also, the Chinese Security Regiment, the × Commissioner, and the × County Regular Army contacted the Japanese army in the Chulan Shixiang Gongshan area and sacrificed valiantly. After holding out until the afternoon, the Chinese troops temporarily moved to suitable locations to reorganize their troops and plan another counterattack. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 300 casualties, destroyed 9 cars and 2 tanks. The Chinese troops also suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese army's "mopping up" did not succeed. The next day, they returned to Xuzhou.

Jiangsu Mobilization Committee, Unified Title

The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee, recently telegraphed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone, was ordered by the Military Commission of the National Government to investigate that the mobilization agencies in various places have many names and complex organizations, and their drawbacks are either mutual shirking, waiting and hesitating, or acting independently, with divergent opinions, and the people do not know what to do. In order to unify the names and unify the authority, all should be reorganized into mobilization committees, prefixed with the words "Lu-Su War Zone," "a certain province," "a certain city," or "a certain county." All mobilization matters shall be the responsibility of the said committee. In addition to separate orders, a joint order is hereby issued that you faithfully comply with the reporting requirements and transfer the order to your subordinates to comply with it in its entirety, etc. After receiving the order, the said committee immediately prefixed the name with the words "Lu-Su War Zone" and slightly revised the rules of procedure to facilitate the progress of the war of resistance.

### Inside Huai'an City: Internal Strife Between Japanese and Puppet Troops; Mutual Casualties

Bao Ying Correspondence: According to news from Huai'an, on the morning of the 16th, puppet troops inside the city, due to the severe oppression by Korean soldiers, a small unit of puppet troops intended to revolt. This was detected by the Korean soldiers, and a sudden clash erupted. For a time, the sound of machine guns and rifles roared, ceasing only after an hour. Both sides suffered casualties. Furthermore, cracks have also appeared within the Japanese army inside the city. Coupled with the threat from the Chinese army in the suburbs, they are extremely frightened. On the evening of the 16th, a unit of about seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers marched out of the city and stationed themselves outside the South Gate at places like Baiyi'an Wharf and Zhunti Temple. Several Japanese soldiers were dispatched to survey the area and draw maps. Around 7 PM, they fired three blank shots as a show of force, and only returned to the city at dawn. At around 10 AM on the morning of the 17th, dense machine gun fire, numbering in the hundreds of rounds, was heard near the Xiaojiaochang (small drill ground) inside the city. In the suburbs, there were intermittent noises and shouts. Detailed information is still being gathered.

### Border of Wu and Qing: Struggle for Shuangta Town; Japanese Casualties Exceed Half; Puppet Troops Annihilated

Suzhou Correspondence: Shuangta Town, located on the border of Wu and Qing counties, is situated on the shore of Dian Shan Lake, making its terrain very strategic. After the troops crossing the Yangtze River from Zhejiang Province, they recovered the town. The Japanese army repeatedly launched counterattacks with significant military force, but all attempts failed. On the 23rd of this month, the Suzhou Japanese Army Headquarters ordered over two hundred soldiers from the Jin Cang unit in Jiaozhi Town, together with over one hundred men under Zhang Zhixiong of the First Brigade of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police, to invade the town. Before the invasion, two merchant ships and over thirty civilian boats were seized. Subsequently, due to rain, the operation was postponed until daybreak on the 24th, when they finally set out, heading straight for Shuangta. The puppet troops led the way, while the Japanese army suppressed from behind. However, the Chinese army had already received intelligence, so they evacuated the residents in advance. When the Japanese and puppet troops landed, the Chinese army, ambushed in the shops in the town, launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army, caught off guard, couldn't land and had to lie prone in their boats, hastily fighting back. The puppet troops leading the way were caught in the crossfire between the Chinese and Japanese armies, and before they could fight, they were all killed in the water within half an hour. The Japanese army bringing up the rear also collapsed in disarray after an hour. In this battle, the Japanese and puppet troops left behind over one hundred and several dozen bodies, over one hundred rifles, and two machine guns. The number of Japanese soldiers wounded and killed in the boats is unknown. The Chinese army, due to careful planning, suffered minimal losses. Furthermore, it is reported that the Japanese army retreating from the battle, in their eagerness to escape, increased the horsepower of the small steamboat they had seized, causing the engine to malfunction mid-way. They were forced to stop in Cheng Lake within the Chenmu Town boundary of Wu County. At that time, the Japanese army forcibly accused the Chinese driver of the boat of deliberately obstructing them, so they shot and killed several sailors on one of the boats to vent their anger over the defeat.

### Women Who Have Just Finished Menstruation Are More Likely to Enthusiastically Flirt with Their Husbands

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labour University

If there is no initiation of reproductive behavior between husband and wife, they naturally cannot get along well. Therefore, reproductive behavior is indeed an indispensable and important element after marriage. Usually, the husband is in the active position in initiating this reproductive behavior. However, only during the period when the wife has just finished menstruation does the situation reverse. At this time, the wife begins to feel the interest in reproduction and will use various methods to seduce her husband, causing his sexual desire to surge, in order to satisfy her sensuality. This is because women have a sexual tide that repeats itself in cycles. The peak of this tide is when menstruation ends. Therefore, researchers in biology even compare a woman's menstruation to the mating season of animals, and even consider the menstrual period to be a variation of the mating season. Although this may not be entirely believable, it is not without considerable insight. Therefore, there are many women who are usually extremely demure, chaste, and do not smile easily, but suddenly change their demeanor during their menstrual period. This is related to various aspects of the nervous system, not just sexual desire. However, the impulse of reproductive desire must also be regarded as a powerful main reason, without a doubt.

Menstruation is a necessary physiological phenomenon for every woman. However, if women who have just finished menstruating feel sexually starved, then husbands should also be discerning and not let them feel disappointed. Moreover, menstruation only occurs once a month. One or two sexual acts per month cannot be considered indulgence. However, the question lies in the husband's energy, whether he is able to cope. If his energy is scattered and he has a history of premature ejaculation, the consequences will be worrying. The reason for discord between husband and wife may lie in this. However, it is not difficult to remedy this deficiency. Based on my 20 years of experience in treating kidney deficiency, purchasing and taking the German testicular essence preparation "Body康" for men is the most effective. After taking it, primordial yang is abundant, and premature ejaculation and impotence are swept away. The women's version has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. Now, I will cite an example of a patient's treatment to prove the efficacy of this preparation.

The patient, Luo Aomin, is 29 years old (self-reported). Due to excessive indulgence in his youth, he suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage. Every time he had intercourse, the longest time he could last was no more than fifty seconds. Sometimes, he even suffered from penile erection problems. Therefore, although he had been married for six years, he had no children. (Treatment process). I instructed him to pay attention to his health and prescribed a large dose of "Body康", along with daily electrotherapy. After twelve weeks, his sexual function was active and healthy, and his energy was abundant. His health recovered.

Modern Medicine

### The Problem of Prostitutes and Gonorrhea

— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

There is an old saying in our country, "Home flowers do not smell as sweet as wild flowers." Therefore, even men who have wives often like to frequent brothels, indulging in pleasure. As a result, they often contract gonorrhea, and their innocent wives suffer, with leucorrhea and hidden diseases emerging endlessly. Furthermore, young people in the spring of sexual arousal, with weak wills, are easily lured by bad friends and lose themselves in brothels. Or, they are trapped by economic difficulties and unable to marry, so they pluck flowers and climb willows, seeking temporary comfort for their spirit and body.

From this, it can be seen that the rampantness of gonorrhea is originally due to the general bitterness of sexual life. On the other hand, because gonorrhea itself is difficult to treat, it lingers and spreads, leading to transmission and varied changes. If general membrane-permeable sterilization therapy or chemical therapy is used, it will not be able to fulfill the responsibility of completely curing gonorrhea. This is because such therapies can only exert a superficial sterilization effect on the local area, but their side effects are significant. After taking them, the stomach is irritated, vomiting increases frequently, and dizziness and facial pallor occur. Therefore, countries around the world no longer trust these therapies and enthusiastically promote the application of "克淋儂" (Kelinnong), invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, as its efficacy is the most significant. As a result, excellent results have been achieved. This is because "克淋儂" is based on the non-specific therapy of gonorrhea, made from a mixture of protein and yellow pigment. After a long period of experimentation, it is known that after taking this medicine, it can boost the cellular anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effect. Thus, both male and female gonorrhea can be guaranteed to be completely cured. For acute and chronic prostatitis, orchitis, urethritis, cystitis, and other conditions, "克淋儂" is also effective and can be completely cured in three to five weeks. On the one hand, "抗淋水" (Anti-Gonorrhea Water) can be used externally to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions. As for female gonorrhea leucorrhea, "卡而雪地陰道片" (Ka'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets) can be used externally as suppositories, while also taking "克淋儂" internally, which can also achieve rapid results and a thorough cure.

### People Prone to Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The origin of lung disease stems from the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria, which usually occurs before the age of twenty. People with weak bodies, narrow chests, and incomplete development are most susceptible to infection. Therefore, people with the above-mentioned conditions must take strict precautions. The precursor to lung disease is often a persistent cough. Therefore, patients with persistent coughs that are not cured should also be vigilant about the arrival of lung disease. Since coughing is the precursor to lung disease and patients lack effective medications, I, in my capacity as a doctor, dare to introduce the medicine "補肺拿爾" (Bufei Na'er). This medicine definitely has the function of relieving coughs, resolving phlegm, and treating the lungs. Therefore, no matter how stubborn the cough is, taking "補肺拿爾" can quickly produce results. For treating the lungs, this preparation certainly has special efficacy. Regardless of whether it is stage one, two, or three lung disease, taking this preparation can truly have the magic of bringing back spring. Patients should not delay themselves.

### Example of Cured Spermatorrhea: Neurasthenia Caused by Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

The patient, Dong Qimin, is from Taixian County, Jiangsu Province, and is 25 years old (self-reported). He committed masturbation when he was fifteen or sixteen years old. He knew the harm and quit, but he inevitably often imagined lewd scenes. As a result, he often discharged semen. Over time, a small amount of semen flowed out during defecation or erection. Needless to say, he suffered from nocturnal emission. His memory was greatly reduced. He often felt palpitations. He felt tired after doing a little work. He was mentally depressed and extremely pessimistic. (Treatment process). I first prescribed "耐而斯遺精片" (Nai'ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets) to stop spermatorrhea. I also prescribed a large dose of "補體康" (Body康) to replenish weakness. After two months, the disease was cured, and both his mind and body were extremely healthy.

### A Case of Rescue for Someone Suffering from Underdevelopment

The patient, Wu Jianping, is from Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, and is 20 years old (self-reported). Since he was about ten years old, he enjoyed fondling his genitals, which later turned into masturbation. When he was fifteen or sixteen years old, he should have been developing, but this was destroyed and caused developmental obstacles. Therefore, although he is now twenty years old, his genitals are still like those of a child. Spermatorrhea occurs as often as twice a week. (Treatment process). He was prescribed "耐而斯遺精片" (Nai'ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets) and "補體康" (Body康). Along with daily electrotherapy, he was cured after three months.

Gonorrhea Forum

### The Leucorrhea that Wives and Children Resent

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

As the saying goes, "One person does the deed, one person takes the blame." This is a general statement that when a person does something wrong, they bear the responsibility themselves. But when you get sick, especially gonorrhea, if you are not careful, your wife will have to share the burden with you. So if you have a wife, it is best to cure your gonorrhea before living together to avoid spreading the infection and never being able to cure it completely. It creates a messy and unpleasant situation, and the wife and children resent you. Isn't that your own fault? The most easily overlooked aspect by gonorrhea patients is the condition of chronic para-urethritis. Because after the acute phase passes, the pain subsides, and the patient no longer worries about it, indulging themselves as if they were never sick. The terrible gonorrhea toxin then spreads to the wife. Sometimes, because the patient believes they have fully recovered, they see their wife's lower body developing gonorrhea leucorrhea and suspect her of infidelity. Isn't that a deep injustice? Therefore, a wise husband must quickly cure his own gonorrhea to maintain the love of his wife. Otherwise, not only will the gonorrhea toxin spread to his wife, but the baby during childbirth will pass through the birth canal and the leucorrhea will enter the eyes, risking blindness. I have seen many patients in my clinic who complain about this suffering. However, if one can take the special gonorrhea medicine "克淋儂" (Kelinnong) and use German static electricity therapy, because "克淋儂" has superior sterilizing power that far exceeds the general chemical therapies on the market, and if one can use static electricity therapy to unleash the sterilizing power of this drug, a quick recovery can be achieved. In addition to taking "克淋儂" orally, women can also use "卡而雪地陰道片" (Ka'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets) externally as suppositories for a short-term cure. Clinic Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM From today onwards, 20 appointments are offered daily. Each appointment costs only 5 jiao and includes a free copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Swimming Competition: Many Difficulties; Hong Kong Lacks Talent and Faces Economic Panic

(Hong Kong Dispatch) Regarding the Hong Kong-Shanghai interport swimming and ice hockey competition, the Victoria Recreation Club of Hong Kong received a letter from the Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association inviting the Hong Kong team to go north at the end of this swimming season to resume the competition. However, before the establishment of a swimming association here, preparation is extremely difficult. At the same time, the problems of personnel and finance are also difficult to solve. The Shanghai side has notified the Victoria Recreation Club that, due to the sudden increase in exchange rates, they cannot send a team to the south. Moreover, this year it is Hong Kong's turn to go to Shanghai, so it is impossible to ask Shanghai to come to Hong Kong. The future of this year's interport competition is particularly bleak. Hong Kong's biggest problem is the lack of personnel. Laurence, the champion of all Hong Kong and interport championships, has just returned to Hong Kong from his honeymoon and is starting to practice. Li, who is most promising, has left Hong Kong, and Luo Chai has gone to Manila, so the Hong Kong team is indeed facing a shortage of talent. Chen Qisong, the former Chinese champion in the 50, 100, and 200-meter freestyle, is also currently in Hong Kong, but his performance has declined. The second obstacle to the interport competition is the financial problem. In the past, the expenses for the Hong Kong interport team's travel were actually borne by the Victoria Recreation Club, or it would rely on the ticket revenue from the inter-club competitions between the Victoria Recreation Club and various swimming clubs in Hong Kong to make up for it, it is said.

### Finance: Silver Plunges; Gold Prices Soar; The Rich Restore Their Thoughts of Hoarding; The Market Suddenly Feels Supply Falls Short of Demand

Yesterday, the spot red gold market, which had been trending downwards for five consecutive days, suddenly rebounded sharply, rising as much as 2,575 yuan at one point. This was mainly because silver prices had plummeted overseas and the situation in Tianjin had eased slightly, causing foreign exchange rates to suddenly tighten. As a result, people's confidence suddenly turned firm, and the local wealthy restored their thoughts of hoarding and storage, and entrusted the exchange industry to compete for purchases. Although securities firms and certain banks and spot gold firms successively released their holdings, it still felt like supply fell short of demand, causing market prices to rise frequently. However, before the close of the evening, prices fell slightly due to profit-taking, but the market trend remained extremely firm, closing at 2,568 yuan, a rebound of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active throughout the day, reaching more than 700 taels. Gold jewelry prices also increased by eight yuan in a row, while the prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Red Gold Jumps 68 Yuan

From the morning, the buying interest of the exchange industry was quite strong for each bar (ten taels), and the sellers were reluctant to sell due to the sudden tightening of foreign exchange rates. The market opened at 9:40 am and immediately raised the price by 10 yuan. An exchange firm bought 20 taels from a spot gold firm at a price of 10,510 yuan. Subsequently, another exchange firm also bought 30 taels from a securities firm at a price of 12 yuan. At that time, the northern firms entrusted securities firms and exchange firms to successively provide supply, causing a slight pullback. An exchange firm sold 50 taels to a gold jewelry firm on behalf of the northern firms at a price of 10 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm also sold 10 taels to a gold firm at a price of 0.08 yuan. Later, an exchange firm sold 50 taels to a gold jewelry firm on behalf of the northern firms at a price of 0.09 yuan. Soon after, the securities firm sold another 10 taels to a gold firm at a price of 0.08 yuan. After that, the northern firms stopped selling, and the price suddenly rose by 6 yuan. An exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 14 yuan. Subsequently, the gold jewelry firms bought 30 taels from a spot gold firm at the same price. At that time, foreign exchange rates continued to tighten, and a certain exchange firm had a strong buying interest, coupled with a severe shortage of sellers, the price rose by another 6 yuan in an instant. A certain exchange firm bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 20 yuan, and then flew up another 5 yuan. A certain exchange firm bought another 20 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 25 yuan. Soon after, the price rose again by 5 yuan. A certain exchange firm bought another 30 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 30 yuan. At that time, sellers became more scarce, and the price soared by another 10 yuan. An exchange firm bought 10 taels from a certain bank at a price of 40 yuan. Later, a certain exchange firm came to buy again, but fortunately, the willingness of other firms to supply was still good, so the situation turned flat. A certain exchange firm bought 100 taels from other firms at a price of 35 yuan and 37 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange rates tightened again, and another exchange firm also stopped selling and turned to buying, so the price rose again, soaring by 9 yuan in an instant. An exchange firm bought 50 taels from a certain bank at a price of 46 yuan, and then rose by another 8 yuan. Exchange firms did 50 taels with each other at a price of 54 yuan. At noon, it was heard that the black market US exchange rate had broken the 13 yuan mark, causing sellers to disappear, and the price soared again by 10 yuan. Exchange firms did 30 taels with each other, with 64 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the market trend was quite firm because foreign exchange rates continued to soften after the close. The market opened high by 5 yuan. Gold firms did 50 taels with each other at a price of 70 yuan. At that time, the buying interest of exchange firms was eager, and the price soon rose by 5 yuan. Exchange firms did 20 taels with each other at a price of 75 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms sold 50 taels to exchange firms at a price of 74 yuan. After that, retail investors and spot gold firms took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market pulled back downwards. A spot gold firm sold 20 taels to an exchange firm at a price of 67 yuan. Later, exchange firms did 50 taels with each other, and the price returned to a high of 71 yuan. At 2:50 pm, exchange firms did 50 taels with each other, at 2,568 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 68 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 67 yuan for the whole day. The capital of spot gold firms was 10 yuan higher than that of spot red gold. The current standard gold price is hanging about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and it is said that there are very few transactions.

Gold Jewelry Prices Rise Eight Yuan in a Row
The exchange price of gold jewelry in gold shops did not change at first. However, at 10:20 am, because the potential of spot red gold was firm, all were listed at 261 yuan for Da Tong Hang, and 259 yuan for Xin Tong Hang, with a purchase price of 253 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged
According to the London telegram on the 27th, the price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged, at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence, so the market prices of various banks of the Central Bank were also consistently flat. The purchase price of Chinese cash was 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, the listed customs gold price was 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li, and the Shanghai standard gold price was 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### The Economic Meaning of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions

By Gu Xiaohui

On the 14th of this month, Japan, using the excuse of not obtaining the extradition of the suspect in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the "President of the Joint Reserve Bank of Tianjin" in the British Concession of Tianjin, implemented a blockade of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. Today is the fourteenth day. The Japanese side openly said, "The sword has been drawn," and the door to negotiations has been closed. The blockade policy will not be abandoned unless Britain completely shows its submission to Japan. On the British side, they are preparing for action, and suddenly their attitude is strong, wanting to retaliate; but according to recent news, Britain and Japan are negotiating again in Tokyo, so Britain can be said to be able to endure humiliation for the sake of preserving the overall situation in dealing with Japan.

(1) Excluding the Trade of the Three Countries in the North China Market

Why does Japan want to blockade the British Concession in Tianjin? Superficially, it is for political reasons, but in reality, it is an economic conspiracy for the trade of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France in China. Except for Shanghai, which represents Central China as a port of entry and exit and accounts for the largest part of the country; in North China, Tianjin is the hub. The trade of the three countries in Tianjin, taking the United States alone, usually reaches more than 200 million yuan per year. Originally, the trade of various countries in China, especially the United States, Britain, and Japan, was fiercely competitive. Since Japan invaded North China, it has implemented control over the ports of North China, such as Qingdao. Because there are concessions in Tianjin, the commerce of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France can take advantage of this to operate, which is what the Japanese side is jealous of. For example, in the Tianjin market, the famous businesses of the United States and Britain include the British-American Tobacco Company, the Asia and other oil companies, and various import and export merchants, purchasing raw materials such as wool, cotton, fur, bristles, eggs, etc., further forming conflicts with the Japanese side. All these activities are within the concessions, and the Japanese side has no right to interfere, so the Japanese side is jealous and angrily resorted to the blockade. This is one of the most important reasons for the blockade.

(2) Threatening the Activities of Chinese and Foreign Banks in the Concessions

The activities of Chinese and foreign banks in the Tianjin Concessions are also something that the Japanese side is unhappy about. Currently, the Chinese and foreign banks in the Tianjin Concessions include:

Chinese Merchants
Issued Amount (Unit: Thousand Yuan)

Central Bank 32,343 yuan
Bank of China 115,161 yuan
Bank of Communications 55,840 yuan

British Merchants Paid-up Capital

Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 50,000 thousand Hong Kong dollars
Mercantile Bank 3,000 thousand pounds

American Merchants

Citibank 127,500 thousand US dollars
American Express Bank 6,000 thousand US dollars
Chase Bank 5,000 thousand US dollars
Commercial Credit Bank 48 thousand US dollars

French Merchants

Banque de l'Indochine 120,000 thousand French francs

Because there are such Chinese and foreign financial institutions, foreign merchants can still operate businesses in Tianjin. In order to exclude the trade of Britain and the United States in the North China market, the Japanese side is threatening the activities of these banks. At the same time, because the foreign banks in the concessions are not bound by exchange restrictions, and the Japanese banks must maintain a fixed exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, foreign merchants can use the low exchange rate to give exporters extra convenience, so that the foreign exchange that North China exports should have obtained flows into foreign banks. Japanese banks have no third-country foreign exchange transactions, and these banks all use legal tender as currency, so Japan believes that the existence of these banks is destroying its "new currency system policy" and cannot implement its control system. This is also a reason. (To be continued)

### Foreign Exchange Rebounds Sharply; Tianjin Firms and Sassoon Fight to Buy; Foreign Firms Have Many Settlements at the End of the Month

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed price. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, the market trend was relatively stable at first because Japanese banks continued to sell. After 9:30 am, it was heard that the relationship between Britain and Japan in Tianjin was slightly easing, and in addition, foreign banks were profitable (on behalf of Tianjin firms) and Western merchant Sassoon and others struggled to buy, and foreign firms had many settlements due to the imminent end of the month. Furthermore, foreign banks were reluctant to sell, and they were unwilling to sell unless the price was high, so under the intense buying pressure, the market rebounded sharply, recovering almost half of the five-day decline. Although foreign cables reported that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Indian Silver Company were selling, the banks in this city only had buying prices and no selling prices, resulting in a situation where demand exceeded supply. It was heard that the British gold interest rate tightened to 6 pence 59375 after the close, and the US exchange rate also softened to 12 yuan 8125. In addition, the exchange rate between British and American currencies rebounded, so the British exchange rate was more tight than the American exchange rate, and there was no turning back in the middle. Trading was quite active during the morning, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened sharply by one yuan, softening to around 45 yuan 125.

US Exchange Rate Enters the 13 Yuan Mark Again

In the early morning, the London bulk order price, both near and far, dropped sharply by 6895, and the New York silver price also shrank sharply by three points. The London raw gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American currencies was one cent and three mils higher, the exchange rate to Shanghai was 0.0625 higher, and the exchange rate to France was one cent higher. The exchange rate of American to British currencies rose by 0.0625, the exchange rate to Shanghai remained unchanged, and the exchange rate to France was 0.0625 higher. The listed prices of various currencies in the Central Bank remained the same. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 6 pence 875 and the US exchange rate at 13 yuan 40625. There were no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, although the Japanese banks continued to sell, the foreign banks had a good appetite, so there were few changes. It is estimated that the Japanese banks sold spot British gold at 6 pence 875 to HSBC. When the HSBC listed price was announced, it did not change, and the silver balance tax was announced to be exempt (because the bulk order price started to be levied at 19 pence 1875). After that, although the Japanese banks continued to have a willingness to sell, Western merchant Sassoon vigorously settled, and various foreign firms also started to compete for purchases, and the supply of various foreign banks was sluggish, so the situation gradually tightened. It is estimated that Sassoon bought spot British gold at 6 pence 8125 from the Japanese banks, and then the foreign firms settled spot British gold with HSBC and Wahbi at 6 pence 75, and also bought spot US exchange from Datong and a certain bank for 13 yuan 25. Although foreign cables from Hong Kong and the Indian Silver Company supplied and maintained, Sassoon was still buying non-stop, and the Tianjin firms had a strong appetite, so it still felt like a drop in the bucket, and the situation continued to tighten sharply. It is estimated that Sassoon and Yuli (on behalf of the Tianjin firms) competed to buy spot British gold from the Hong Kong Cable, the Indian Silver Company, and foreign banks from 6 pence 75, tightening to 625, and bought spot US exchange from 13 yuan 25 softening to 13 yuan. It was already noon, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened to 45 yuan 125. Extending to the midday close, the banks' spot selling price was British gold at 6 pence 625, and the US exchange rate had broken into 13 yuan, at 12 yuan 96875, which was close to HSBC's maintenance price. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 25, and the US exchange rate softened by 4375. The Hong Kong exchange rate also rose by one yuan. It was heard that after the close of the spot British and American exchange rates, the buying interest of the buyers was still strong, so the market trend continued to tighten. The British gold exchange rate had tightened to 6 pence 59375, and the US exchange rate had softened to 12 yuan 8125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Cotton Yarn: Settlement Period Nears, Yarn Market Struggles to Recover, Inter-trade Transactions Sharply Decline, Prices Fall by 500-700 Yuan

Spot trading of cotton yarn is limited, but the trend is looser in the morning and tighter in the afternoon. Ultimately, 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at the same level as the previous day, while other yarns fell by about 3-4 yuan. Market sentiment remains mixed. However, many speculative bulls, facing urgent credit needs and the approaching end of the Year of the Ox, must unload their goods for cash to settle their accounts. Inter-trade buying and selling has significantly decreased, and even certain large firms are experiencing similar difficulties, with new settlements in the market. This explains the weakness in morning prices. Major players are waiting for the issuance of exchange allocation certificates on July 4th and to assess whether the news is bullish or bearish before making a final decision, with most adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market opened flat in the afternoon, but news of slightly higher gold prices revitalized the market, and prices rebounded by 2-3 yuan. However, actual demand from customers remains sluggish due to the unfavorable environment. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse spot yarn was 477 yuan, soon falling to 474 yuan. Warehouse receipts initially traded at 473.5 yuan, then later at 471 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat, and following news of rising gold prices, there was another step up, with 20-count Double Horse spot yarn from external warehouses trading at 478 yuan, and warehouse receipts at 473 yuan. Ultimately, the day's total transaction volume was estimated at 800-900 bales, with inter-trade transactions still accounting for the majority. Double Horse prices were flat, while 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd yarns fell by 5-7 yuan, Double Globe fell by 4 yuan, and Special Golden City fell by 6.5 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn was unchanged. Today, 90 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Quanzhou.

The Japanese yarn market remains quiet, but since delivery for this month's goods can be extended by half a month, market conditions have stabilized and prices have risen slightly. The price for this month's 20-count Moon Harp yarn is 380-382 yuan.

### Japanese Yarn Delivery for This Month Extended by Two Weeks

Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram to Shanghai was followed by all banks and firms, Japanese yarn transactions have been done with full payment upfront, making operational procedures extremely difficult. With the end of this month (June) approaching, many disputes have arisen between buyers and sellers regarding the yarn. The Yarn Industry Association convened a meeting of traders to discuss the matter, resulting in the decision to extend the delivery period for transactions this month by two weeks, until July 14th.

### Banks Refuse to Provide Loans, Cotton Merchants Face Difficulties, Stocks Sold Off at Low Prices to Cover Exchange Drafts

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was firm yesterday, with a lively opening. Short covering and strong buying from the South were seen. Negotiations in Washington regarding barter trade are progressing smoothly. Spot traders were also active. As a result, New York rose by 7-8 points, and Indian cotton is also predicted to rise by one rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by over 10 points.

Since the government issued an order restricting withdrawals in the Shanghai foreign cotton market, banks have refused to provide loans, resulting in an unusually tight credit situation. Moreover, with the end of June being the banks' settlement period, a large volume of goods has arrived by ship for foreign firms. Due to the timing of exchange drafts, the exchange rate difference between this month's drafts and next month's is enormous, reaching as much as 10 yuan per picul. Local firms face difficulties in raising funds, and foreign firms are pressing for payment. Therefore, they can only sell off their stocks at low prices to cover their exchange drafts. Foreign firms are also worried about difficulties in collecting payments, with both sides complaining endlessly.

Only one transaction of domestic cotton was completed, involving a mere 80 bales, an unprecedentedly low volume. Factories face unresolved issues regarding restricted withdrawals, preventing them from procuring raw materials for the time being. Even inter-trade buying and selling is fraught with disputes over payment upon delivery, making it difficult to resolve. Although there have been several meetings regarding factories allowing traders to take delivery and settle payments, no concrete results have been achieved, and the future remains uncertain. Only 311 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in Tongzhou. Today, 20 bales of cotton are being shipped to Quanzhou. Here is a record of the current cotton situation:

Xia Sha, American Upland, 93.00, Traded within the industry, 80 bales, Exchange allocation, warehouse delivery.

Bai Luo, Grade unknown, 87.50, Also, 300 pieces, Cash again.

### Oil Cakes: Oil Market Cannot Operate, Bean Cakes Continue to Fall

The crude soybean oil market has been hampered by the withdrawal restrictions, making it difficult to operate. Even large, powerful traders feel overburdened and find it difficult to manage. Therefore, a suggestion has been made to limit the payment period for goods to 10 days (the industry rule is 15 days from the date of transaction). If the goods are not cleared within 10 days, 80% of the payment must be made, and all responsibilities are borne by the buyer. However, some have not agreed, so it has not been implemented and remains subject to verbal agreement. Yesterday, 20 barrels of crude soybean oil from Kobe and Dalian were traded on paper at a price of 47 yuan, a reduction of 70 cents from the previous day.

Although bean cakes are similarly constrained by the oil market, their price is lighter, making buying and selling easier to manage. However, judging by the season, it is now the active sales period. The market volume did not exceed 5,000 pieces. In short, this special situation is due to various environmental constraints. Yesterday, in addition to both sides matching 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji brand bean cake for June delivery at a price of 3 yuan for the original disc, other prices continued to fall. Yuanji brand traded 2,000 pieces at 2.97 yuan, and mixed brands traded 2,000 pieces at 2.95 yuan.

Yesterday, 110 pieces of soybean oil and 500 tins of sesame oil arrived from Yantai, Shandong, and 14,500 pieces of bean cake arrived. Additionally, 2,000 pieces of cottonseed cake arrived from Ningbo.

Today, 5,350 tins of crude oil are being shipped to Quanzhou, as are 580 bags of soybeans. Another 130 bags are being shipped to Hong Kong, and 2,100 pieces of bean cake are being shipped to Quanzhou.

### Securities: Stock Market Quiet

The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce opened quietly yesterday. However, there was demand for several well-known industrial stocks during half-day trading, and transaction prices also made progress.

Transactions and Opening Prices:

Mutual Land: Selling price 33.25, Bidding price 33.25. Tramway: Selling price 39.50, 40.50. Jardine: Bidding price 18.20, 18.90.

There is still little interest in rubber stocks, but sellers are unwilling to sell at these low buying prices. The bond market is very sluggish.

London Stock Exchange quotations for Far Eastern companies on Tuesday, June 27th: The trend is stable, with no changes in any stocks. London quotations for Chinese foreign debt on Tuesday, June 27th: The downward trend has temporarily stopped, with no further price movements. 1,000 pounds of Jinghan Railway bonds were traded at an opening price of 16 pounds, down 1 pound from the market.

### Grain: Cash Position Not Ample, Flour Transactions Stalled, Japanese Mills Actively Buying Wheat

Flour: Although there was an intention to procure in the wholesale market yesterday, it ultimately failed due to a lack of cash. Factories insisted on cash transactions and would not accept drafts, so the dull situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. Retail transactions on this street continued as usual at a cash price of 4.65 yuan, with only a few thousand bags changing hands. Both incoming and outgoing sales of foreign flour were quiet. Since being affected by cash payments, not only has wholesale demand been weak, but retail sales on this street have also been sluggish. The market price is around 5 yuan for national allocations, and the market is also brewing. Today, 28,900 bags of flour are being shipped to Quanzhou, as well as 1,100 bags of flour skins.

Wheat: Yesterday's supply was continuous. New wheat from various regions has reached the threshing season. However, due to the current financial crisis, both buyers and sellers are less active. Yesterday, demand from Chinese flour mills remained sluggish, while Japanese mills and local sales continued to be active. A total of over 900 bags of wheat from Danyang, Nanjing, and Caishiji were sold at prices ranging from 6.58 yuan to 6.53 yuan. There was no significant change in the market.

### Oversupply, Rice Prices Plummet

Du Geng: Yesterday, no supplies arrived from the various gangs in He Xia. 2,300-2,400 bags of Che Lun Bao Zi arrived from Changzhou, Nanxiang, and other places. Since the price limit on rice, people's hearts have calmed down, and hoarders have disappeared. All sales have been limited to retail stores on this street, causing concern among those holding goods, who are all trying to sell. The market supply has suddenly become crowded, making it even harder to maintain prices, and prices continued to depreciate. As a result, the price of both thick and thin Geng rice fell by 20 cents.

Ke Xian: Production areas have been reporting small amounts for days, and affected by orders for foreign rice, large outside speculators are eager to sell at market prices. However, local demand has weakened as Geng Jian rice prices have flattened. Only 300-400 bags were procured from inland gangs yesterday, and the supply of mid-grade machine rice and broken rice is often high, with depreciated prices being sought to realize cash. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday morning, prices fell step by step. High-grade rice fell by 30-40 cents, while old and second-grade rice fell by 40-50 cents. Total transactions for the day were over 2,000 bags.

Foreign Rice: Spot trading remains quiet. Sellers are asking 23 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, but even with freight and commissions included, there are few buyers. Future prices will inevitably need to be reduced again in order to be sold. As for new foreign rice orders, due to foreign exchange purchases and other related factors, the actual secured order quantity is not as large as rumored. It is said that only the first batch of 300 tons has been confirmed, and the second batch has only secured 3,000 bags.

Glutinous Rice: The market for glutinous rice has been soft recently, and coinciding with the weakness in Geng Jian rice, prices have also fallen by half a yuan.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Production Prices Rise Repeatedly, Ou-Yong Shipping Obstructed, Domestic Sugar Unable to Rise

According to yesterday's foreign telegram reports, sugar prices have generally risen. Dutch raw white sugar for September/October delivery has seen a rebound, with prices at 8.00 Dutch guilders. The cost of Hong Kong raw white sugar, including bagging fees to Shanghai, has risen to 11.40 full-warehouse dollars. London telegraphs show a sharp increase of 6.25 pence for August, to 8 shillings 0.75 pence. December increased by 75 pence, to 6 shillings 5 pence. March of next year increased by 1.5 pence, to 6 shillings 5.5 pence. Therefore, the local chamber of commerce allocation disk has tightened slightly. Spot No. 24 raw white sugar rose by 20 cents. Local warehouses are at 29 yuan, and foreign warehouses are at 28.8 yuan. Transshipment goods rose by 10 cents, with 400 bags traded. Taikoo sugar rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cents in varying amounts. West Warehouse B mark is at 28.8 yuan, totaling 100 bags. CW mark is at 28.6 yuan, CX mark is at 28.4 yuan, DY mark is at 27.8 yuan, HY mark is at 27.6 yuan. Due to obstruction of Ou-Yong shipping, domestic sugar importers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, unlike the excitement of the previous few days. One firm sold 50 bags of mixed-grade Qing as a trial at 16 yuan, but has refused to continue selling at that price and remains tight. Moreover, shipping costs from Xiamen to Shanghai have increased by 25%, significantly increasing costs. Adding the discount on exchange allocation, the tightness is self-evident. Xinghua's ordinary Da Gongfen is offered at 27 yuan, but no transactions have occurred. Today, 15,000 bags of sugar are arriving from Holland.

### Silk and Tea: Italian Artificial Silk Arrives Again

Another large batch of artificial silk has arrived in Shanghai. On the 27th (the day before yesterday), the Italian ship Conte Biancamano arrived from Italy with 2,745 cases, which were unloaded at the Gonghexiang warehouse at the Red Mouth. Among them were also 95 cases of autumn woolen suit fabrics.

### The Coast is Unsettled, European Sales of Green Tea Are Increasingly Buoyant

Yesterday, the foreign firm green tea market was increasingly robust. Due to the tense situation along the coast, exports of red and green tea from the interior are becoming increasingly difficult, making existing stocks in the Shanghai market even more valuable. British firms such as Jardine, Concord, Tongfu, and Baochang are all scrambling to procure tea. Transactions in Chun Mei are exceptionally active, and fine needle Mei is also becoming more active. The entire city traded a total of over 740 cases of green tea. Prices for plucked cores ranged from 295 yuan to 332 yuan. General Chun Mei prices ranged from 253 yuan to 276 yuan, and needle Mei prices ranged from 52 yuan to 88 yuan.

### Hardware: Galvanized Iron Pipe Prices High, Sales Sluggish

The largest market for galvanized iron pipes has always been waterworks. There are also transactions in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and other places. Since the shortage of spot goods last year, prices have skyrocketed. However, due to the excessively high asking prices, actual sales have been greatly affected. Recently, spot goods have been arriving in large quantities, but there are still few buyers. Recently quoted prices, such as 4-fen pipes at 48 cents per foot, 6-fen pipes at 58 cents per foot, 1-inch pipes at 80 cents, 1.25-inch pipes at 1.40 yuan, 2-inch pipes at 1.85 yuan, and 3-inch pipes at 3.30 yuan, are all 10-20 cents and 80-90 cents higher than the previous market prices.

### Imports and Exports: Many Goods Arrive from the Netherlands and Southeast Asia

Yesterday, a large volume of goods arrived in Shanghai from the Netherlands, including 3,400 bags of tapioca starch, 8,000 bags of white wax, and 3,160 bags of coconut shells. In addition, 150 bags of pepper, 550 boxes of bark and rubber, and 290 boxes of coffee arrived from Southeast Asia.

### Japanese Warships Gather Along the Coast, Traffic to Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian Temporarily Obstructed, Blockade Line at Zhenhai Port Being Prepared, Navigation on Fuzhou Route Also Appears to be Restricted

British and American Warships Planned for Escort

Since naval authorities notified third-country vessels to refrain from sailing to Min and Ou River ports, all voyages to Wenzhou and other outbound ports have been suspended. The Italian merchant ship Kang Sa Yi, which was stranded in Wenzhou, also sailed for Shanghai yesterday morning. In Fuzhou, the British ships Shenfu and Shengu are berthed at Chuanshi for unloading. After the blockade of Ningbo, the Moufu ship was approved to make one more voyage. The ship is scheduled to depart this morning and return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. A blockade line at Zhenhai Port will be implemented if necessary. Details are as follows:

Japan Plans to Blockade Min and Ou River Ports

The Japanese naval authorities notified the Shanghai Consular Corps on the 26th that the Japanese military would take military action at the ports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou. Therefore, all third-country warships and merchant ships were requested to leave the above locations by noon on the 29th (today), otherwise the Japanese side would not be responsible for any damage. However, the British and American authorities have firmly rejected the Japanese note and will make serious representations to the Japanese side. According to the Japanese, dangerous materials will be placed at the entrances and exits of Min and Ou rivers to implement the blockade. The locations of the dangerous materials will be: (1) the central part of the north-south waterway in the eastern part of the Shatou Waterway in Wenzhou; (2) near the central floating pontoon in the eastern part of the Ironing Waterway in Fuzhou. All third-country nationals residing in these areas are advised to evacuate as soon as possible. However, according to inquiries from the shipping industry by reporters from the Dagang News Agency, no telegraphic notice of this information has been received. As for yesterday's newspaper report that navigation in Wenzhou was prohibited on the orders of the Chinese military authorities, it is clearly a mistake, as the shipping industry has not received any notification from the authorities regarding a ban on navigation.

Moufu to Make Last Voyage to Ningbo This Morning

In order to strengthen the defenses of the Zhenhai Port fortress, the Ningbo Defense Commander has decided to prohibit navigation. The three ships Xin Beijing, Deping, and Moufu, which were berthed in Ningbo, all sailed for Shanghai on the morning of the 27th and arrived at the port. However, the Moufu, belonging to the German merchant firm Lihe, was specially approved to make one more voyage for the last time. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 4:00 a.m. this morning, arriving in Ningbo that evening, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. After the ship leaves Ningbo, Zhenhai Port will be officially declared blockaded. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Dagang News Agency, the old Taiping ship, which is reserved to block the gap, is ready to be sunk and will be implemented when necessary. In addition, Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship has now been assigned to the new route Linqiu-Xiudu and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 30th).

Italian Ship Leaves Wenzhou, All Ships Suspend Navigation

Since the Japanese obstructed foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, the Haifu ship, which was stranded in Wenzhou, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Hana ship also arrived at the port yesterday afternoon. The Italian merchant ship Kang Sa Yi left Wenzhou at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning and sailed for Shanghai. There are currently no foreign ships in the Ou River. The Feikang, Baoli, Ende, and the Haifu and Hana, which were originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou, have all declared a temporary suspension of navigation and will decide again depending on how the situation develops.

Shenfu and Shengu Berth in Min River to Unload

As for the Fuzhou route, in addition to the regular sailings by ships of the British firm Yilong, the remaining ships of Taikoo, Jardine, and the Sino-Italian Company are all unscheduled. They have sailed to Min one after another in the past few days and telegraphed that they have safely arrived at Chuanshi outside Mawei Port, unloading cargo as usual. Whether they will sail again in the future will also depend on how the situation develops. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship, originally scheduled to sail to Xiuzhe near Quanzhou, which was newly opened yesterday, has been postponed by one day due to rumors of Japanese troops landing in the Min River. It is now scheduled to sail to Xiuzhe this morning. However, the Fuzhou route also appears to be in a state of suspension.

Yuhuan Island Unrelated to Military Affairs

Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, is an island surrounded by sea and is not important militarily. It is the same in nature as Dinghai County. The Japanese troops' landing at Kanmen in Yuhuan this time is just a bluff. It is not easy to advance on Yueqing from Yuhuan. Moreover, although there are highways connecting Yueqing, Haimen, and Wenzhou, heavy troops have been stationed and are heavily guarded. After the Japanese troops landed, they were met with fierce resistance from the Yuhuan self-defense forces.

Japanese Warships Concentrate, Situation Tense

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that garrisons along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian have been ordered to be on strict alert to prevent Japanese troops from secretly landing. A large number of Japanese warships have concentrated at the mouths of the Min and Ou Rivers along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian, with some kind of attempt. Therefore, the situation along the coast is extremely tense, and the local forces will adopt emergency measures when necessary. Furthermore, Yueqing and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have been bombed by Japanese aircraft for days.

Britain and America Prepare to Provide Vigorous Escort

Britain and the United States have resolutely rejected the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast and obstruction of navigation. The British Consul General has already responded the day before yesterday, stating that "the Japanese must not evade any responsibility for harming British lives and property, whether directly or indirectly." It has also been heard that British shipping companies such as Taikoo, Jardine, and Yilong have decided to maintain their original routes as usual in order to safeguard navigation along the Chinese coast, and will request British warships to provide escort when necessary.

### Italian Ship Returns to Shanghai from Northern Sha Line, Escorted by British Warship

Japanese Warships Block Foreign Ships from Advancing, Shipping to Shanghai Port Sharply Reduced, Companies Planning to Cope

Following the outbreak of war in the northern Sha area, Xin Port and Lingdian Port have been shelled by Japanese warships. Although foreign merchant ships are continuing to navigate, the destination has been changed to Qinglong Port. The number of passengers and cargo has been sharply reduced, severely impacting business, and they will be forced to suspend operations. The aim of this Japanese action is to monopolize shipping and seize cargo taxes from various ports. However, the Chinese military is determined to inflict a severe blow on the Japanese military. Details are as follows:

German Ship on Northern Sha Line Diverts to Qinglong

After Taikoo Company's Wantong ship suspended operations, the German Far East Company's Haiyi ship and Fuhua Company's Jiangding ship departed as usual at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. The number of passengers and cargo did not decrease. At about 2:00 p.m., they passed through Hutong Port, Shuji Port, and Niuhong Port and safely arrived at Qinglong Port. They sounded their sirens and launched rowboats to unload passengers and cargo into the port. The Japanese warship No. 32, which was anchored offshore, still signaled with flags, ordering the ships to anchor there overnight and preventing them from proceeding. They also aimed their guns at the two ships as a demonstration. The shipowners cancelled their sailing plans and decided to sail to Shanghai this morning. The British Jardine Company's Yihe ship was protected by a British warship and sailed back from Shanghai Port, arriving in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Since the Japanese military blockaded the ports along the Northern Sha Line, the business of various ships has been sharply reduced, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, various companies will discuss how to cope with the situation.

Japanese Aims to Monopolize Shipping

The Japanese have been coveting shipping on the Northern Sha Line for a long time and have long had the intention of monopolizing it. This time, taking advantage of the Japanese military's actions, they are obstructing the foreign ships purely to facilitate the sailing of ships of the Nissin Kisen Kaisha. Because the destination of the foreign ships is Qinglong Port, which is occupied by the Japanese military, they cannot compete with the Japanese ships for passengers and cargo in the port. As a result, they will be forced to suspend operations on their own. At the same time, the Japanese military can also search and seize the tax revenue from the Northern Sha Line.

### Banking Industry Handles Mid-Year Closing Accounts

All Banks Operate Cautiously and Maintain Profits, Capital Increases, Financial Stability to Increase in the Future

Tomorrow (June 30th) is the bank's mid-year closing period. Banks have been very busy handling the closing of accounts in recent days. Interest payments for both savings and commercial departments have been completed. Starting from July 1st, there will be a three-day holiday. Since the money industry decided on measures to stabilize the market, the financial market has stabilized. After the mid-year closing, the banks will prepare to handle the use of interbank exchange allocation. Details are as follows:

Mid-Year Closing

In view of the upcoming mid-year bank closing on June 30th, all banks have started to handle the closing of accounts. Depending on the busy ness of the business, internal office hours have been extended. Interest closure for the savings department ended on the 20th, and interest closure for the commercial department ended on the 25th. They have now been completed one after another. The number of bill exchanges in the bill exchange has also increased. In accordance with the regulations of the Association, there will be a three-day holiday from July 1st, and business will open as usual on the 4th. The bank association's semi-annual member representative conference has been decided by the Standing Committee to suspend the convening.

Market Stability

The Shanghai financial market can still maintain its traditional importance. For example, international foreign exchange still centers on Shanghai, and domestic funds are concentrated in Shanghai. As a result, bank deposits have increased sharply, resulting in a surplus of funds. This spring, due to Shanghai's lack of proper means of application, illegitimate speculative businesses such as foreign exchange purchasing and cargo hoarding occurred. Generally, they were deposited and operated by the bank this illegitimate business. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian restricted withdrawals, so speculative businesses gradually decreased due to the lack of legal currency, and the financial market tended to stabilize.

All Achieve Profits

Due to the surge in population and urgent needs after the war, the industrial and commercial industries in Shanghai showed abnormal development. For example, the number of large and small factories newly established and resumed operations in the special zone has increased to 2,700-800. At the same time, the number of newly established stores has also sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and the development is particularly visible. Banks have done their best to accept mortgage loans for the capital needs of industrial and commercial industries within the possible range. Therefore, it is generally expected that this mid-year closing can achieve considerable profits.

Chips Increase

The Bank Joint Reserve Committee has begun to handle the registration of interbank use of exchange allocations. All banks and firms that wish to receive allocations must provide collateral and apply to the Committee for receipt. It will be implemented starting from July 4th. The Federation has decided to issue interbank exchange allocation certificates in order to facilitate interbank exchange allocation and receipt. However, although the use of interbank exchange allocation and the issuance of exchange allocation certificates are both of an exchange allocation nature, they are slightly different. Currently, only the use of interbank exchange allocation is available, and the issuance of exchange allocation certificates is temporarily suspended. The improvement of this exchange allocation system is of great benefit to the entire industrial and commercial industry and can enable the market to increase chips with reliable guarantees.

Sufficient Funds

The total amount of interbank exchange allocation is tentatively set at 50 million yuan. After implementation, the assets of various banks, such as goods, securities, and real estate, can become new chips for exchange allocation. At the same time, the exchange allocations deposited by various banks and firms in the Bank Reserve Committee and the Money Industry Reserve will be allowed to be converted into legal currency at 95 percent over 12 weeks, which will increase the capital of the firms and can fully assist the development of the industrial and commercial industries. However, in order to prevent illegitimate speculative businesses, the Bank Reserve Committee will discontinue the business of interbank exchange allocation discounting from now on and hopes that the money exchange industry will also stop operating exchange allocation discounting.

### City Bank and Others to Refund Deposits: In Accordance with Ministry Orders for Withdrawals

The Shanghai Municipal Bank and Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust Company, previously suspended operations from February 3, 1938, due to environmental factors, have now, upon resolution by the bank and trust's board of directors, decided to refund all types of deposit principal and interest in order to demonstrate good faith and restore confidence in the financial system.  Starting July 4th, the Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House will be entrusted to handle payments.  The details are as follows:

Refunding Depositors

(1) The Shanghai Municipal Bank was established in February of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) with a capital of one million national currency. It was initiated by Mayor Zhang Yuejun and served as the municipal treasury, managing all income and expenditures for Shanghai. The general manager was Xu Fu. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust Company was established in October of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). It was founded by the Shanghai Municipal Government with a capital of one and a half million national currency, managing the municipal ferry, Pudong Waterworks, etc. The general manager was Xu Fu. Since the fall of Shanghai and the retreat of the National Army, the bank and trust were forced to suspend operations from February 3, 1938, due to the environmental factors. Now, the bank and trust's board of directors has decided to refund all types of deposits in order to demonstrate good faith and restore confidence in the financial system, and the Clearing House will be entrusted to handle payments.

Entrusted Handling

The municipal bank board of directors and the trust company board of directors have announced that the payment agency will be located at the Banking Clearing House at 59 Hong Kong Road. All depositors of the bank and trust are requested to register their deposits at the payment agency between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM daily, starting July 4, 1939. After the registration procedures are completed, withdrawals will be made in succession from the payment agency starting ten days later, in accordance with Article 1 of the Financial Stability Measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on August 15, 1931 (each depositor may withdraw 5% of their deposit balance each week, with a maximum of 150 legal currency per household per week).

Settling Debts

Regarding the bank and trust's various debts, Attorney Xu Shihao has been entrusted to urge prompt settlement of debts. The announcement reads approximately as follows: According to representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Bank and Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust, the bank and trust urgently needs to actively recover outstanding debts, and thus has specifically entrusted your firm to publish a notice urging all debtors to prepare funds within 20 days and settle the principal and interest owed in full with your firm. Failure to do so will result in legal action. Therefore, we are publishing this notice on behalf of the representatives to inform all debtors to settle their debts within the deadline and not delay.

### Rice Prices Fall Daily After Strict Enforcement of Price Controls

Speculative Merchants at a Loss, Eager to Unload. Rice Merchants Order 3,000 Tons of Foreign Rice, Deal Concluded

Since the Municipal Council set a price limit of 21 yuan for the bean and rice market and dispatched personnel to supervise the market, prohibiting any transactions exceeding the limit, and since the rice industry associations also set standard prices for various types of rice in a joint conference, market confidence has been restored and order has returned to normal. The rice market is facing the arrival of the moldy season and strict enforcement of price controls by the authorities, leaving speculative merchants at a loss and unable to act. Many are seeking to sell, but market demand is weak, resulting in oversupply. Furthermore, due to the weather turning sunny, the market is showing a trend of more declines than rises.

Yesterday Morning's Market

The market opened at 9:00 AM and closed at 12:00 PM. Thick and thin japonica rice fell by another 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while Lu Yang Jian and Bai Yuan each fell by 0.20 yuan. The market traded approximately 5,000 dan in the morning. Rice industry experts predict that rice prices may fall further within the day. Yesterday, rice and grains transported to Shanghai by land and water routes reached approximately 5,000 to 6,000 dan. The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee will hold its 37th committee meeting at 10:00 AM today to discuss market operation policies. Furthermore, the Rice and Grain Brokers Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating: "The Municipal Council has been dispatching personnel daily to strictly supervise the rice market's price controls."

Strict Supervision

"Members of our association should absolutely comply. The association will not be responsible for any penalties incurred for transactions exceeding the limit. This has been resolved and is hereby announced." According to a rice industry leader yesterday, a small number of rice firms in the city have again entrusted the Dreyfus Company to order,

Saigon No. 2

3,000 tons of foreign rice at a price of 20.40 yuan per bag (large bag) has been concluded. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai by mid-next month. At the same time, another batch of 300 tons is under negotiation by telegram.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Increase in Staff Allowances: Two Types of Allowances, Exchange Rate and Cost of Living. Total Annual Council Expenditure Increases by Over One Hundred Thousand

In February of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the report of the committee on the exchange rate and cost of living allowances for the council's staff, and decided to reconsider the temporary cost of living allowances by the end of June, all of which have been announced. Since January 1st of this year, the council's "B" and "L" grade staff have each received a cost of living allowance of 15%. This allowance was considered reasonable by the aforementioned committee and was superior to the allowances provided by various organizations in the city at the time, and therefore was not changed. As for the "A" grade staff, the council had approved that they would receive an exchange rate allowance equivalent to one-third of their basic salary, and a cost of living allowance equivalent to two-thirds of their salary, the same as the "B" and "L" grade staff, as proposed by the committee.

Exchange Rate Allowance Method Remains the Same

When the committee met this Monday, the allowance issue was discussed in detail. The committee members resolved to request the council to allow "A" grade staff to continue to receive the exchange rate allowance according to the original method, but to change the standard to one national currency yuan equals six British pence.

Cost of Living Allowance Increased Appropriately

Regarding the cost of living allowances for "B" and "L" grade staff (including Chinese staff holding contracts) and the allowances added to two-thirds of the salaries of "A" grade staff, the committee members resolved to request the council to approve an increase from 15% to 25%. This allowance will be re-evaluated by the end of September of this year.

Consider Treatment According to Needs

The various committees stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot bear the full responsibility for the increase in the cost of living for staff, but that the staff should share the burden with the taxpayers. It is unreasonable for staff to seek economic assistance to maintain a standard of living equivalent to when the exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, and seven-eighths. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Treasurer stated that the issue of increasing cost of living allowances should be considered after clarifying the accounts for the first half of the year and the council's financial situation. However, the Civil Service Committee believes that the council should consider the treatment of staff at any time according to social conditions in order to be fair. The recent increase in the cost of living should be taken into account by the council in order to decide how to subsidize the staff.

Ordinary Chinese Staff All Receive Allowances

The Civil Service Committee also considered the issue of allowances for Chinese staff who do not hold contracts. The committee resolved to request the council to abolish the current grading method. All staff in this category whose names are listed on the salary slips of various departments should be uniformly allowed to receive an allowance of 20%. This allowance should also be re-evaluated by the end of September of this year.

Annual Expenditure of Over One Million

According to the Treasurer's estimate, the proposed additional exchange rate and cost of living allowances, based on an exchange rate of six and a half pence instead of eight pence, will require a total annual expenditure of 1,192,700 national currency yuan. The breakdown is as follows:

Exchange rate allowance for "A" grade staff (assuming an exchange rate of six and a half pence)

235,000 yuan

Cost of living allowance (16.67% of basic salary)

113,000 yuan

Cost of living allowance for "B" and "L" grade staff

Foreign staff 350,400 yuan

Chinese staff 53,000 yuan Cost of living allowance for Chinese staff not holding contracts 441,300 yuan

The above estimated expenditure accounts for one-sixteenth of the total municipal rates and land tax. If the exchange rate allowance standard is not reduced below seven pence, the recent exchange rate fluctuations will increase the annual exchange rate allowance by 123,000 yuan.

The above recommendations have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's regular meeting on the 28th of this month.

### Japanese Newspaper in Chinese Warned for Misusing Reuters' Name: "New Shen Bao" Fabricates Reuters Telegram Containing Messages Detrimental to Sino-British Relations, Receives Warning from Shanghai Japanese Consul General After Negotiations

Reuters, Shanghai, 28th: The Japanese-owned Chinese newspaper "New Shen Bao" published in Shanghai, on the first page of its April 22nd edition, published a telegram purportedly from Reuters, citing a Chongqing dispatch date and stating that Reuters' Chongqing correspondent claimed, "Internal conflicts within the current Kuomintang government are deepening." The British Ambassador "received instructions from the British government and went to Chongqing in April to warn the Kuomintang government in good faith to begin peace talks with Japan," and so on. Upon investigation, Reuters in Chongqing or other locations

Did Not Send

This kind of news. Reuters immediately presented the matter to the Shanghai Central Consul General's Office for handling. According to a notification from the British Consul General's Office to Reuters, the matter has been submitted to the Japanese Consul General's Office, requesting that it take necessary steps without delay to prevent the "New Shen Bao" from misusing Reuters' name again and should order the "New Shen Bao" to

Publish a Correction

Explaining that the message was not issued by Reuters. As a result of this request, the Japanese Consul General's Office has recently notified the British Consul General that, after receiving the document and requesting attention to the "New Shen Bao"'s misuse of Reuters' name,

Immediate Warning

"New Shen Bao" must not repeat this act. However, the Japanese Consul General's Office's reply did not mention the "New Shen Bao"'s publication of a correction. The British Consul General's Office is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese Consul General on this matter. (Reuters note: Subscribers to our agency's telegrams must be concerned about our agency's reputation. At the same time, our agency would like to take this opportunity to notify subscribers that we will continue to protect Reuters' reputation in every possible way and prevent misuse.)

### Public Concession Tram Fares to Increase Today

The Shanghai Public Concession Tram Company's fare increase issue has been investigated and considered by the Municipal Council for a long time and is now approved. The company has now decided that starting tomorrow (29th), all trams and trolleybuses operating in the Public Concession will uniformly increase fares by 16.6%, meaning that the previous five-cent fare will become six cents after the increase, and fares above one dime will increase by two cents. The revised fare schedule will be announced tomorrow. It is not known whether the French Concession trams will increase fares at the same time. The Shanghai Public Concession Tram Company's announcement is recorded below: "Shanghai Tram (Public Concession) Company Limited Announcement: Due to the decline in exchange rates and large expenditures, the company's revised fare schedule has been approved by the Municipal Council and will be implemented from June 29, 1939. The revised fare schedule is displayed inside the trams and trolleybuses. This is an announcement."

### Shanghai Business Community to Establish Petroleum Business Promotion Association: Study and Develop Inland Petroleum Business, Solve Industrial and Transportation Fuel Problems

Since the War of Resistance, developing inland industries and fighting the military war in the front have become equally important. The National Government and the business community are paying attention to it. It is heard that some people in the Shanghai business community, in view of the fact that petroleum is the main product used for national defense, transportation, and industry, and that failure to achieve self-sufficiency results in significant losses, and that inland provinces such as Sichuan, Xikang, Gansu, and Xinjiang all have this oil production, it is believed that if the chemical experiment is added, it will be effective and greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the China Petroleum Business Promotion Association is preparing to be established to gather comrades to engage in petroleum research. They are currently seeking founders and sponsors in order to be established as soon as possible. It is learned that the steps they are taking are to start with investigation and research. After this preliminary work is completed, they will advise the government to engage in large-scale mining, or to raise shares to organize a private petroleum company to assist the government in solving the fuel problems of various heavy industries and transportation.

### Japanese Domestic Economy Has Reached the Point of Exhaustion: Naginata Blades and Pen Nibs are Melted to Make Munitions, Tokyo Has Presented an Unstable Atmosphere

Hong Kong Tak Sun West reported that, after nearly two years of Japanese military operations against China, it is now commonplace to see that Japan's economy and finances are about to reach their limits. This situation has suddenly become intense. Japan's lack of money and materials has been around for a long time. This seems to be a normal economic contraction during a country's war and is not surprising at first, but today, every economic barometer in Japan has shown a danger signal. Therefore, neutral observers believe that Japan is now cautiously seeking a solution to the so-called China Incident through a third country. Today's Japan's

Internal Situation

Is roughly as follows: (1) Food. The government now issues milk, white pagoda oil, eggs, and other essential foods according to the population. A California lemon in the United States costs three corners of foreign currency, but even at this price, it cannot be purchased. The total average consumption of food has risen by 13% in one year, and has risen by 23% compared with the time when the military war was launched on July 7th of the previous year. (2) Materials. Old Naginata blades and used pen nibs are all melted for the manufacture of munitions. Thousands of boiler manhole covers have been replaced by wooden ones.

Retail Market

Cotton and wool fabrics have disappeared. Attempts to use vegetable fiber as a substitute have not been successful. (3) Commerce. The profits of the geisha industry are very small. Banks have been ordered to reduce the interest rate on loans to small businesses. Price controls without wage controls have forced many small businesses into bankruptcy and have organized special agencies to help small businesses change careers. (4) Finance. The Japanese yen has recently fallen to

Unprecedented Low Prices

In the nearest foreign exchange market, Shanghai. Compulsory registration of gold objects is now beginning. Companies use public bonds with low face value instead of cash to issue allowances. The Ministry of Finance recently expressed "disappointment" with the mining situation in 1938. In April, Japan did not buy even one cent of war materials from the United States. All of these have produced two significant facts: one is that Japan's foreign exchange reserves have finally fallen to the lowest number, and the most severe measures have been taken to make it fundamentally

Impossible to Flow Out

One is that inflationary conditions have been brewing in Japan. Japan's wartime problem is a fundamental difficulty. Japan lacks resources that are vital to its survival, so it must rely on foreign countries for oil, iron, coal, cotton, wool, pulp, and chemicals. Japan almost entirely needs to purchase these items with hard cash and ship them back on its own ships. The number of purchases has been huge and has been going on for almost two years. As for other countries lending credit to Japan,

The Number Is Very Small

Merchants from all countries must obtain cash before they can let ships carry goods to Japan. When the fiscal year ended on March 31, although the daily bureau kept strict secrets, the public knew that the financial community was about to panic about the lack of foreign currencies and gold at home and abroad. Regarding the amount of gold produced in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan in 1938, no numbers are ever announced, so

It is impossible to know for sure

It is estimated that its annual output is around 6,500 yuan, but given Finance Minister Ishiwatari's disappointment with gold production, the financial community still doubts whether last year's gold production reached this number. Official statistics show that Japan's exports of gold to the United States in 1938 were 32% lower than in 1937. (To be continued)

### Health Movement Propaganda Week Extended for Ten Days, Also Contacting Concession Authorities for Cooperation

In order to promote the health of citizens, the Shanghai Youth Association launched a health movement propaganda week, originally scheduled from July 1st to 7th, to carry out expanded publicity in all districts of the city. Due to insufficient preparations, it has been decided to postpone it to July 10th to 16th. They are now engaged in drawing various charts, hiring doctors as judges for children's health competitions, and on the one hand, contacting the concession health department for cooperation.

### Shanghai-Zhejiang Postal Delivery Studying New Routes: Last Mail to Be Loaded on Moufu

Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang postal delivery is now watching whether this morning's Moufu wheel can drive to Yong. If it does, the post office will be able to load the last batch of mail and transport it to Zhejiang, and then it will be suspended temporarily. However, the post office is now taking other routes that can connect to eastern Zhejiang and are more time-saving in order to facilitate the public.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Levies Property Tax, Residents Must Submit Payment

The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council has issued an announcement regarding the collection of property tax, saying: For the purpose of announcement, notice is hereby given that the property tax for various Chinese and foreign houses for the quarter ending September 30, 1939, is due on July 1, 1939. All taxpayers are requested to note that the property tax for all Western-style houses should be delivered to the Bureau's Tax and Revenue Department at 209 Jiangxi Road by all residents upon receipt of the notice of payment of tax. The Bureau will not send personnel to collect it. This is a special announcement for general knowledge. This is an announcement by General Manager Philip Felliper.

### Japanese Consulate Issues New Penalties, Attempting to Prevent Roaming Japanese Nationals in China from Engaging in Various Activities within Occupied Areas

The English-language *China Press* reports that, according to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese Consulate General has recently issued new penalties aimed at punishing those base Japanese individuals who, taking advantage of the current situation, act with a "degree that hinders Sino-Japanese harmony." These individuals may face expulsion from China. This new directive was jointly drafted by the Japanese Army, Navy, and consular authorities, with the aim of addressing Japanese individuals who possess nothing of value beyond themselves and engage in various activities within occupied areas, causing Chinese people to harbor ill feelings towards the Japanese. Such situations have occurred repeatedly, and the consulate has taken notice. However, there were no specific laws in place to address this behavior, preventing action from being taken. Japanese nationals seeking to come to China are now required to obtain permission, which has reduced the number of undesirable elements. Nevertheless, a small number of such individuals have still managed to enter China.

### Russian Police Officer Dies in Torrential Rain After Being Shot; Political Case, Bullet Fired from Occupied Area near Xujiahui Tushanwan, Strikes Vital Point

Russian police officer Kotov (transliteration), number 49 of the White Russian squad of the French police force, was dispatched at 11:40 PM the night before last (the 28th) to patrol with a Chinese police officer near the iron wire barricades erected by the French garrison in the vicinity of the Panjiazhai area of Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai West. At the time, it was raining heavily. Fearing that criminals might be lurking, the officer used a flashlight to search the surrounding area in the darkness. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew from the Chinese area of the occupied zone to the south, striking the Russian officer's arm and piercing his chest. He fell to the ground, wounded. He immediately ordered the accompanying Chinese officer to fire back towards the south, firing four shots. The other side also returned fire with three shots, but both sides were in darkness, and neither hit their target. The Chinese officer ran back to the temporary office of the French police station in Xujiahui to report the incident. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate and urgently sent an ambulance to transport the wounded Kotov, number 49, to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died en route from excessive blood loss. His body was then transferred to the Westerners' autopsy facility attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour. At noon yesterday, Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, along with a forensic doctor, arrived to examine the body and confirmed that the death was due to a gunshot wound. The body was handled for funeral arrangements and burial by the relevant authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The French police authorities are taking the case very seriously and are currently conducting an investigation.

The English-language *China Press* reports (excerpt above): The French Concession police are currently examining the bullet that killed Kotov. Currently, the prevailing opinion is that the bullet was fired from a Japanese soldier's rifle, but it may not be possible to prove that the shooter was indeed a Japanese soldier, as Japanese soldiers' rifles are quite often in the hands of non-Japanese, most likely guerrillas. Detectives are also working diligently to investigate the trajectory of the bullet from the other side of the river in order to determine the firing location. However, as of this afternoon (the 28th), the investigation has not reached a stage where a conclusive statement can be made. Kotov was only 25 years old and was previously a barber. He had only been with the White Russian squad of the French Concession police for four and a half months. Several of his relatives currently reside in Harbin.

### Sailboat Loaded with Lumber Completely Destroyed by Fire; Ship Owner Demands Compensation from Cargo Owner, Negotiations Between Both Parties Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement

The Xiehe Yongji Sailing Vessel Company on Xinqiao Street, Bao'an Lane, through the introduction of Li Henian of the Senrun Lumber Company on Xin Dagulu, was entrusted by Wu Fuqin, the owner of the Qilin Yinxiangtai Lumber Company in Haimen, to transport a load of lumber purchased in Shanghai. The lumber was to be shipped from Yangshupu to the new port of Haimen, where it would be unloaded. Both parties agreed on the freight charges and waterway fees and stipulated in the contract that the goods would be unloaded upon arrival at the port. The Xiehe Yongji Vessel Company then dispatched the Yonglu sailing vessel to transport the lumber. On the 18th of the same month, the vessel arrived at the new port, and the Xiangtai Lumber Company sent personnel to order the Yonglu sailing vessel to enter half a li into the new port to dock and unload two-thirds of the cargo. Unfortunately, the guerrilla forces and Japanese troops engaged in a battle in the area, and it was also low tide, with shallow water in the harbor. As a result, the Yonglu vessel was unable to sail out to avoid the conflict and was set ablaze by the troops, resulting in the complete destruction of the cargo and the vessel, leaving only the hull. The vessel owner, Xiehe Yongji Company, claims that this damage was due to the cargo owner, Xiangtai Lumber Company, violating the contract by ordering the vessel to enter the port to unload the goods, making it impossible to avoid the disaster. They are demanding compensation from the cargo owner for the loss of the vessel. The Xiangtai Lumber Company is only willing to cover the two hundred yuan in travel expenses for disbanding the ship's captain and crew and sending them back to their hometowns. The vessel owner believes that the cargo owner lacks sincerity in providing compensation and that the amount offered is far too low. Therefore, they have engaged a lawyer to send a letter to Wu Fuqin and Li Henian of the Xiangtai and Senrun Lumber Companies, respectively, demanding joint and several compensation for the loss of the vessel. The two parties have exchanged letters and arguments, engaging in a heated written battle, with no resolution reached. It is inevitable that the matter will be taken to court. This is yet another dispute caused by the war.

### Letter to French Newspaper Calls for Strict Crackdown on Rent Increases; Hopeful the Concession Authorities will Take Notice

Translated by Shanghai Guangshe on the 28th, as reported in the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, a person signing as C. G. F. D. submitted a letter to this newspaper (referring to the French-language newspaper) stating that since Shanghai suffered from the war, a speculative business of key money for old houses and opening fees for new houses has emerged due to the difficulty of finding housing. If this were in Europe, the government would have severely cracked down on it long ago. It is now heard that some people have specially formed companies to engage in this kind of speculative business to exploit the people and cooperate with major landlords and accountants to jointly make this unjust fortune. In Hong Kong, the local authorities have strictly cracked down on housing rent incidents, so fortunately, peace is maintained. So why doesn't the Shanghai French Concession authorities also issue laws to restrict this kind of speculation? Therefore, we hope that the French authorities stationed in Shanghai will, in accordance with the spirit of Shanghai's previous crackdown on high rents, strictly prohibit landlords from evicting tenants or forcing rent increases. As for key money and opening fees, they should be prosecuted for the crime of obtaining money by fraud, and residents will often receive great benefits, it is said.

### Demolition of Lean-To Structures in Xujiahui Nearly Leads to Market Strike

The Li Chongjing River channel in Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, has been in disrepair for many years, and siltation has become increasingly severe. Now, the French Municipal Council is using garbage to fill the river in order to build a road to facilitate traffic. The houses along the river on the east bank, from No. 2190 Haig Road to the Su Xin Bookstore at the intersection of Hongqiao Road, No. 1986, are arranged closely together and face Haig Road. The businesses that have opened after the war have developed abnormally. However, each house has built lean-to structures over the river behind the house for many years. Now, the French Municipal Council, because it obstructs the road, has notified the shops along the river through the police station to demolish the above-mentioned lean-to structures automatically. The stores then publicly elected Zhou Chengxiang, the former chairman of the town's Commercial Association, to request the French authorities to postpone the demolition. Unexpectedly, at about 4 PM yesterday afternoon, Chinese and Western police officers suddenly arrived at the scene and ordered laborers to forcibly demolish the lean-to structures along the river that were obstructing the road. This aroused public outrage, and a large crowd gathered, resulting in a market strike. Dozens of stores, including Xianghe Yarn Store, Da Zhonghua Overshoes Store, Zhu Yongchang Meat Shop, Yitai Meat Shop, Wanhe Ham Store, Yitaifeng Grocery Store, Yongan Foreign Goods Store, Yuankang Clothing Store, Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Store, Lu Gaojian, Shen Shunxing Hardware Store, Heji Meat Shop, and Shenghe Xin Tin Foil Store, temporarily closed their doors and suspended business. Fortunately, Chairman Zhou Chengxiang learned of this and rushed to the scene to persuade them and explained the benefits and harms. The stores then opened their doors and resumed business as usual. The temporary office of the Refugee District of the French Police Station (at the Song Family Cemetery in Tangjiexi) learned of this and ordered the stores to go there for questioning at 9:30 AM this morning.

French Police Auction of Used Goods

On Saturday, July 1, 1939, at 3:00 PM, an auction of used shoes, clothing, broken iron tires, bicycles, rickshaws, and handcarts will be held at No. 28 Xuehuali Road.

### Lawsuit Involving Relatives Living Together; Doctor Accuses Lawyer of Encroachment; Dispute Over Telephone, Admonishing Both Parties to Settle Out of Court

Shao Jingkang, a native of Nanhui who practices law in Shanghai, resides at No. 3 Huayuanfang, Jinshenfu Road. He is now being sued by Yu Xiangzhou, a fellow villager who is a Chinese medicine practitioner specializing in pediatrics, who also lives in the same residence. Yu Xiangzhou has engaged lawyer Li Weibin to represent him in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, suing Shao Jingkang for encroachment on telephone services and obstruction of freedom. According to the claim, the house in which they reside originally belonged to the plaintiff's son. The defendant is a relative. Last year, the plaintiff's son transferred the house to the defendant. The plaintiff lives upstairs, while the plaintiff rents the downstairs living room as a clinic and the servants' quarters for accommodation. Due to the needs of medical practice, the plaintiff, in his own name, installed

A telephone

With the number 77505, which was installed in the living room. However, after the defendant moved in, he suddenly transferred the telephone account and changed the account name to the defendant's name. After the Bureau notified the plaintiff, the defendant discussed the matter with him because he needed a telephone for his legal practice. After an agreement was reached to register with the Bureau in both parties' names, the defendant suddenly disconnected the telephone and installed it upstairs, preventing the plaintiff from using it. Moreover, when someone called to ask the plaintiff to see a doctor, the defendant would reject them on the phone, saying he didn't know or that the person wasn't there. These actions by the defendant constitute encroachment on telephone services and obstruction of freedom.

Request for investigation

Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, summoned the plaintiff and his lawyer to court yesterday morning to hear the case. The defendant did not appear but sent lawyer Chen Zhen to defend him, stating that the plaintiff and defendant were originally relatives. Since the defendant inherited the house, the telephone is an accessory to the house and he naturally has the right to dispose of it. It cannot be regarded as encroachment on telephone services or obstruction of freedom. He requested that the defendant be declared innocent. After reviewing the statements in court, it was determined that since both parties were relatives, they should settle out of court. The hearing was rescheduled for July 13.

### Falsely Established Film Company, Defrauded Money, Two Offenders Detained and Interrogated

Chen Bin, a native of Shaoxing, 29 years old this year, was formerly an actor in the Yihua and Yueming film companies. He currently lives at No. 10 Hongqing Lane, Lane 140, Xinzha Road. Zhu Weikang, a native of Anhui who works in the same industry as Chen, is 23 years old this year and currently lives with Chen in the same residence. Last year, Chen and Zhu rented Room 40 on the fourth floor of No. 25 Fada Road to establish the New Century Film Company. Chen served as director and Zhu as screenwriter and posted advertisements to recruit male and female actors. They charged a small registration fee of two yuan and a handling fee of five yuan. Upon signing a contract to perform in a play and film, the salary ranged from 50 to 100 yuan. At that time, more than 30 young men and women went to register and audition, paying a total of more than 200 yuan in fees. It was only recently discovered that Chen and others had set up a scam and reported it to the French police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Bin and Zhu Weikang one after another. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special District Court, requesting custody for investigation and rescheduling the hearing. Subsequently, the victims, including Zhou Chunying, Xu Zhiqing, Wang He, Xiang Ming, and Zhang Yingying (female), recounted their experiences of being defrauded. When questioned, Chen's confession was vague, while Zhu confessed that Chen initiated the establishment of the film company, and the money collected was spent in dance halls and gambling dens. It was originally planned to shoot films such as *The Sound of Thunder and the Shadow of a Ghost*, *The Three Musketeers*, *Inseparable Brothers*, *Sea Hero*, and *Killing the Thief and Revenge*, but they were shelved due to lack of funds. The judge instructed to verify the confessions, and the hearing was rescheduled to July 5. The defendants were taken into custody.

### Owner of Daxin Woolen Goods Store Accused of Adultery; Affair Discovered by Wife Who Files Complaint; Defendant Claims Plaintiff Agreed, Ordered Defendant to Provide Evidence for Further Verification

Yao Wei寰, a native of Zhenjiang, 35 years old, formerly jointly opened the Dun Kang Woolen Goods Store, and now opens the Da Xin Woolen Goods Store at No. 5 Sassoon Li, Shandong Road, living a relatively wealthy life. Yao married Zhou Rongzhen, a woman from his hometown, in Zhenjiang in 1925. After the marriage, Yao came to Shanghai to do business, while Zhou managed the household affairs in his hometown. They have had

Eight children

Together, but five of them have died early. The remaining children are one son and two daughters. The eldest son is 13 years old, and the second daughter is 8 years old. Zhou is originally a village woman who rarely comes to Shanghai. Recently, because the countryside has been unstable, she came to Shanghai with her children in early spring and lived in the Daxin store. Unexpectedly, she heard rumors that her husband had an affair in Shanghai, so she questioned her husband, which angered Yao, who cut off her living expenses. Zhou became suspicious and investigated in detail.

Recently Discovered

That Yao was living with Tang Guizhen (30 years old), a woman from Yangzhou, in the back building of No. 422 Guangdong Road. Therefore, she reported it to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Li Pengfei, he requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant and rushed to search the premises at 7:30 AM on the 18th of the month. Yao and Tang were arrested on the spot and taken back to the police station. Since Yao and others have established businesses and residences, they were not detained. Instead, they were brought to the First Special District Court,

Issue a summons

Yesterday morning, Yao and Tang were summoned to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special District Court. Yao and others jointly engaged lawyer Jin Ximin to defend them. Judge Meng Tingke opened the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu clarified the facts and prosecuted the case based on Article 239 of the Criminal Law, requesting the court to punish them according to the law. Yao Wei寰's defense was that he has been living with Tang for six years and has had two children with her. This matter was done with the plaintiff's consent, and

Each time she has come to Shanghai

She has lived with Tang. The current incident occurred because the plaintiff's father has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits with me over money disputes, and that caused this incident. Judge Meng verified the confessions and instructed to change the date of the case and ordered the police to conduct a detailed investigation and ordered the defendant to provide evidence that the plaintiff had prior knowledge of the matter for further verification.

### Wu Zhou Abuses Maid; Sentenced and Suspended

Wu Zhou (28 years old), a woman from Hunan, lives at No. 20 Kangle Lane, Kangnaide Road. Four years ago, she paid eight yuan to buy Wu Hongmei, a fellow villager who is now 16 years old, as a maid. Recently, because the maid was careless in her work, she was beaten by her with a bamboo ruler, leaving her with injuries all over her body. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, she was beaten severely with a bamboo ruler again for not washing clothes cleanly, causing serious injuries to her left leg, kidney, and head. Her anger was still not appeased, so she went out and wandered on the road. At about 6:00 PM, she was accompanied by someone to report to the Geding Road Police Station. Detective Li Huaguo was dispatched to investigate at the address and found the report to be true. Wu Zhou was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for the crime of abuse under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. According to the maid Wu Hongmei's testimony, she did not want to go home with her again. Judge Huang Risheng interrogated Wu Zhou and sentenced her to six months in prison, suspended for two years. Wu Hongmei was temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.

### Explosion of Bomb in Xiyuansi Branch Temple Kills Incense Keeper; Drug Use at Midnight Leads to Disaster, Loud Explosion Injures Two Monks

Zhou Huichang (44 years old), an incense keeper from Yancheng, who lived upstairs in the Xiyuansi Branch Temple at No. 476 Avenue Edward VII, had been employed for seven years. The abbot, Yi Yingzeng, provided him with a monthly allowance of ten yuan in addition to a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Zhou was addicted to drugs and only went to bed after midnight every day. At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhou, as usual, smoked opium and lay on the bed, adding strong tea and cigarettes to his enjoyment. After a while, he got up and played with a small hand grenade (during the Shanghai war, the temple set up a refugee shelter, housing more than 400 male and female refugees for half a year. The hand grenade may have been picked up by a refugee in the war zone and left in the temple, eventually falling into Zhou's hands, who treasured it like a jewel). Unexpectedly, he accidentally touched the firing pin, and it exploded with a loud bang, injuring Zhou's head, left cheek, and both hands. His brains splattered, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. He immediately fainted on the floor. A room was also blown up. At the same time, it was raining heavily. Two monks, Ping Jing and Zhi An, who lived in the next room, were awakened from their sleep by the shock. Mistaking it for a thunderous explosion, they desperately jumped out of the window and fell on the roof of a low building in the alley, injuring their hands and feet. They were later discovered and reported to the police station, who summoned an ambulance to rush them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Zhou died shortly after due to his severe injuries. The injuries of the two monks were minor, and they were later declared unharmed.

Moreover, the public concession of Avenue Edward VII, Chengdu Road, west side of 476 Suzhou Xiyuansi Branch Temple, yesterday morning (28th) at 1:30 AM, a bomb exploded and killed a person. Here are the details of the investigation:

The History of the Xiyuansi Branch Temple

Xiyuansi is originally a famous ancient temple in Suzhou. The abbot's name is Long An. In 1921, he rented a large building at No. 476 Avenue Edward VII in the public concession (three bays, two wings, and three courtyards, totaling ten buildings) and established the Shanghai Branch Temple of Suzhou Xiyuansi. He sent monk Yin Zhen as the abbot. There were thirty to forty guest monks. The incense keeper was Ji Weizhang (44 years old, from Yancheng), who was an old incense keeper of Suzhou Xiyuansi and was transferred to Shanghai by monk Yin Zhen. Ji's two sons, the eldest named Guisheng and the younger named Liansheng, both worked as tea boys in the branch temple. Usually, there were many sutra recitations. After the 813 Shanghai War, the abbot Yi Yin's income sharply decreased and he was unable to maintain it. Therefore, he rented all the houses of the branch temple to refugees who came to Shanghai from the mainland to take refuge, renting to more than 40 families, and the monthly rent income was considerable, which he used to support the temple. Later, because the city became safe, the population of the concession increased sharply, and commerce developed abnormally, and Buddhist affairs gradually improved. The abbot then issued an order to evict the guests. However, most of the tenants had difficulty finding houses and delayed moving. After the abbot tried every means, he only moved out two-thirds of the tenants, and more than a dozen tenants have not moved out to this day.

Bomb Explodes, Killing Incense Keeper

The bedroom of Ji Weizhang, the incense keeper of the branch temple, was in the rear room of the west wing of the second courtyard. He lived there alone. Ji's two sons lived downstairs. Last night (27th), Ji entered the room to sleep at about 10:00 PM. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a loud noise occurred in Ji's room. All the monks and laymen in the temple were awakened from their sleep. At that time, it was raining heavily. They rushed to Ji's bedroom to check and saw that both of Ji's hands had been blown off, and his body had been blown up. The flesh on his head and face had been blown off. Blood and flesh were blurred, a tragic scene. He had already died. The walls were also blown down. Ji's body was pressed under the bricks and tiles.

Report to Police Station, Body Dug Out

Abbot Yin Zhen checked and realized that it was a bomb explosion, and immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief immediately led a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene and dug out Ji's body from the rubble and sent it to the morgue for autopsy. They also found pieces of foreign silver skin that looked like cigarette cans in the house. In addition to checking the front and back houses of the branch temple, they also sent one Chinese and one Indian policeman each to guard the temple. Unexpectedly, at 11:15 AM yesterday (28th), another loud noise occurred in the front half of the west wing of the second courtyard of the branch temple (which was an empty house and no one lived in). The lime on the walls was scattered all over the ground. Because no one lived there, no one was injured, only the tables, chairs, and decorations were damaged.

Detectives Search and Detain Several People

The stationed police officer went to the police station to report again. The police chief immediately dispatched more than 30 detectives at 3:15 PM and rushed to the scene. They monitored the actions of all the monks and laymen in the branch temple, searched the tenants and monks' houses upstairs and downstairs, and after detailed interrogation, they saw that the Qiao couple, tenants who lived in the west wing of the front courtyard, and several monks were suspicious and brought them all to the police station for verification.

### Maid, Unable to Endure Abuse, Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Claims Master Swallowed Up Accumulated Wages of 600 Yuan; Unable to Endure Oppression, Hope Society Will Act Righteously to Redress Grievance

Xu Wu, a woman from Ganpu, Zhejiang, also known as A'yu, 31 years old this year, her husband has passed away, and she has been widowed for eight years. After her husband's death, she came to Shanghai to work as a maid at the home of Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhaotai Foreign Goods Store at No. 63 Dongqipan Street, Henan Road, British Concession, for seven years. Suddenly, on the morning of the 23rd, she went to the Asia Hotel at No. 135 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, to rent Room 311. She suddenly had a pessimistic view and, on the night of the 24th, in the hotel,

Committed suicide by poisoning

At 6:30 AM the next morning, the tea boy discovered it, entered the room to check, and found that she had committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. He immediately informed the accountant, who reported it to the French Police Station. A detective was dispatched to investigate and found two pieces of paper on her body: a suicide note and a complaint. One paper stated that she had worked as a maid at Wang Shenfu's house for seven years and had accumulated wages of 600 yuan, which were stored with the master and not allowed to be withdrawn.

Has Been Swallowed

The master was picky about her daily work and often abused her. It also said that the master was selling inferior goods and, after closing the doors tightly at night, he changed the inferior goods for domestic brands and sold them mixed together, making profits of hundreds of thousands, regardless of the hardship of the servants, and swallowing their hard-earned money. Unable to endure the oppression, she committed suicide, hoping that benevolent gentlemen would act righteously to redress her grievance. The other paper stated that the master's nephew, Song Renqing, borrowed 20 yuan from her,

Repeatedly Asked but Not Returned

Instead, she was insulted and scolded. Helpless, she spent eight yuan to entrust Zhang Fushun, a colleague in the store, to buy sleeping pills to commit suicide, which had nothing to do with the pharmacy. The detective took this complaint back to the police station for record. However, after Wu entered the hospital, she was deeply poisoned and the treatment was ineffective. She died at 9:00 AM on the 27th. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. Yesterday, Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court and a forensic doctor were reported to have visited the hall,

Verified the Deceased

It was confirmed that she died from poisoning. Because there were no relatives, the detective reported the investigation situation and submitted the suicide note. The official ordered the body to be taken by the Charity Hall for burial, awaiting family recognition. The two suicide notes were taken back to the police station by the detective for investigation.

### Lawyer Gong Hongzhao Convicted in Adultery Case Dies of Kidney Disease

Gong Hongzhao, a native of Chongming, 29 years old, former principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, chairman of Boji Pawnshop, and member of the Shanghai Bar Association, already had a wife, Gu, and children. In July of last year, he became entangled with Shen Yaoying, the eldest daughter of Shen Zhujiu, a wealthy merchant from Chongming (27 years old this year, having studied at Guanghua University). The two lived together at No. 6 Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road. Shen Zhujiu then engaged two lawyers, Ge Zhijun and Yu Chengxiu, to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of inciting Shen Yaoying to steal 40 gold pounds, 300 yuan in cash, and gold bracelets, and accusing Gong of defamation. Gong was sentenced to three months in prison in the first instance. Gong refused to accept the sentence and engaged lawyer Xue Dubi to appeal to the High Court Third Branch, but the appeal was rejected. The sentence was allowed to be commuted to a fine, which Gong paid. Recently, he suddenly fell ill with kidney disease and died a few days ago due to ineffective treatment.

### The Latest on Vitamin E

— Ming Chu

Doctors and chemists from around the world recently gathered in London to discuss the latest vitamin - Vitamin E. This vitamin can be extracted from wheat germ and cottonseed, and it can now be manufactured in the laboratory by combining various ingredients.

According to Dr. MacDonald of Jessop Women's Hospital in the UK, eighteen women, before being treated with Vitamin E, had a total of fifty-three pregnancies, but only five of the babies were born alive. Since taking Vitamin E, they have given birth to seventeen live babies.

Other scientists also expressed their belief that in normal pregnancies, it is absolutely essential for the mother's diet to contain sufficient Vitamin E. They also cited examples of women who had been unhappy because their babies had never been born alive, and many had become mothers after taking Vitamin E.

Dr. Moller of Copenhagen said that Vitamin E treatment for habitual abortion is successful in 75 to 80 out of 100 cases. Dr. Moller also said that this new vitamin is also beneficial to farmers, as 75 percent of cows that previously did not produce calves had satisfactory results with Vitamin E treatment.

In addition, new discoveries have been announced that Vitamin E seems to not only affect fertility but also promote development.

### Talking About Clothes in the Plum Rain Season

— Lu Lishi

The cries of "Sugar Plum" in every yamen seem to have gradually subsided. Indeed, time passes quickly. The green plums that were not picked and mixed with sugar have already taken on a reddish-brown coat. The plums are yellow, and the plum rain season is here again!

Speaking of the plum rain, it's really a headache. It rains all day, and the sky is full of water vapor. Other things don't matter, but I'm worried that some clothes will be ruined in this plum rain season. The plum rain is a good opportunity for pests and bacteria to breed. The winter before last, there were holes in my clothes without me even knowing it. Last year, I had to buy new clothes again. I hate these pests that invade my clothes, these pests that hurt my finances. If I don't catch them, kill them, and get rid of them, it's terrible. Money flows out, and my clothes are always a mess. They're broken here and patched there. How can I talk about neatness?

Clothes are mostly made of fiber. Wool clothing is made of protein, which is exactly what pests like to eat. The rest, like velvet clothing, are also weak and have no resistance, so they are inevitably eaten by pests. Although many clothes are specially processed to prevent pests, they are too expensive to meet the needs of the general public.

Clothes made of cotton, linen, and rayon are not as susceptible to pests as wool. Silk is also better than wool, but it is still susceptible to damage during the plum rain season.

Wool clothing pests hatch into larvae in the summer. These larvae damage clothes in the winter, and then turn into pupae or moths in the spring and summer. Moths and beetles lay eggs again. Therefore, our wool clothes are a good place for these pests to breed endlessly. We must completely eliminate them. This plum rain season is the best time to do it. We can't delay any longer!

Washing, ironing, and drying are three ways to kill most of the larvae. The best method is refrigeration. Some people use mothballs or volatile oils to prevent pests, or even try to kill them, but this is impossible.

The plum rain season is the most active time for microbes. Scientists have tested that in the Jiangnan region, when the plum blossoms are in bloom, the humidity is 75% and the temperature is 20-30 degrees, which is ideal for mold growth. To prevent mold, we must pay attention to: remove stains from clothes; store clothes in a low-temperature place, but keep it dry; seal the clothes. The easiest way is to clean the clothes and store them in a dry place.

### A Week's Worth of Economical Recipes

— Hua Ying Nv Shi

Eels have been on the market for a while, and the price has not been too expensive lately. My economical recipes should include them too. Eels look like snakes, so timid people don't dare to eat them, but there are still many people who love to eat them. There are many ways to cook eels. The most common is stir-fried eel noodles. The whole eel is sliced into shreds, boned, and stir-fried with sliced broad beans. Add a little lotus root powder, and when eating, add sesame oil and pepper powder, which is very delicious. If you can't buy broad beans, you can use sliced lettuce as a substitute. It's also acceptable. Under the name of stir-fried eel paste, there are two types: stir-fried eel back, which uses only the back of the eel, sliced into shreds, and the meat is harder; and stir-fried eel slices, which is simply sliced into pieces instead of shreds. The cooking method for these two is the same as for stir-fried eel paste. In addition, the whole eel can be cut into sections and braised with pork, adding some garlic cloves. Those who like strong flavors will definitely welcome the use of sugar and soy sauce. There is also a cooking method where the eel shreds are quickly fried in hot oil and then made into soup, a great dish to eat with braised pork.

### Chauffeurs and Road Safety Campaign

— Ying Dai

It is said that recently, there have been more intersections in the concession, and pedestrians are crowded on every road. As a result, the number of car accidents causing death and injury has reached an unprecedented record in the past year. Therefore, those concerned about traffic issues have united with various sectors to hold a safety campaign. The busier the city, the more congested the traffic, and the more people killed or injured under cars, which is an unavoidable theorem. Even though European and American countries pay close attention to this issue, they cannot actually reduce the number of car accidents. In fact, in order to reduce the number of people killed or injured under cars, in addition to pedestrians being careful themselves, chauffeurs should be responsible for more than half of the safety issues.

After a car accident causes injury or death to pedestrians, the court has various penalties, but these are only temporary solutions and are passive in nature. In reality, they will not reduce accidents. Moreover, many chauffeurs who cause accidents have their fines paid by the car owner, so the chauffeur does not suffer any loss. As a result, the chauffeur may develop a feeling that if an accident occurs and a pedestrian is injured or killed, the most that will happen is that the owner will have to pay some money to compensate for the loss or comfort the dead. Therefore, in addition to hoping that the court will impose severe penalties on vehicles that cause accidents, the fundamental solution is to make every chauffeur understand their responsibility for road safety. As far as possible, pedestrians should not be injured or killed.

According to those who study safety issues, a chauffeur who wants to prevent accidents while driving should pay attention to the following ten commandments: (1) When driving a car on the road, you should always maintain control. If you suddenly see vehicles or pedestrians in front and cannot brake in time, an accident may occur. (2) You should always check whether your car has any damage or defects. (3) When the car is driving on the road, your line of sight must always be focused on the road surface. A moment of negligence can lead to a major disaster. (4) When driving a car, you should not drive onto the right-hand sidewalk unless there is a danger or it is absolutely necessary. (5) When the vehicle is moving forward, you should not drive too slowly or linger arbitrarily to block the progress of other vehicles. (6) Driving a car is like living at home. You should have a sense of humility. When there are cars driving in front of you, do not boast of your skills and try to overtake them. (7) You should know all the traffic rules in the city one by one. (8) When driving a car, if there is a problem with the parts or gasoline, you should handle it carefully and not be impatient. (9) Do not drive after drinking alcohol. (10) You should also study the local map to save driving time or avoid overly busy roads. The Shanghai Safety Campaign has begun. I dare to offer the above ten commandments to all chauffeurs in the city. Car owners who drive themselves and do not hire chauffeurs may also use these ten commandments as a reference!

Wanted: I would like to request a copy of my novel "Turning Point," which was published in this newspaper (during the Rotary Club period in the Republic of China's twentieth year). If anyone has a clipped copy and is willing to part with it, I am willing to exchange it for one of my books, or I can pay in cash. I am also looking for a single-volume edition of "Notes on the Japanese Sword." The method is the same as above. Correspondence address: Cheng Xiaoqing, Dongwu Affiliated High School, Muir Hall, Yu Qiaqing Road.

### Difficult to Eat

— Fang Zhi

### The Kitchen Area

— Chen Liang

In Shanghai, whether it's a "one-up-one-down" or "two-up-two-down" house, there's always this kitchen area located inside the back door, next to the lower floor, behind the staircase wall. In terms of area, it can't fit two tables. As the name suggests, the kitchen area is undoubtedly where the kitchen is located. However, Shanghai is a famous "inch of gold" land, and it was difficult to find a detached house even before the war, let alone after the war when the two concessions had a population of over five million! A "one-up-one-down" house must have at least three households, usually four or five, and as many as seven or eight. A "two-up-two-down" house has twice as many. The kitchen area, like the terrace and tap water, is declared in advance by the landlord as a special public area.

Thus, the small kitchen area becomes a "public concession," which is very lively. There's a Cantonese stove, a coal stove, and a stove made from a kerosene tank, all lined up in a row like an "exhibition." Iron nails are hammered into the walls, with various pots of different sizes hanging on them. There are steel pots, cast iron pots, copper pots... and earthenware pots that can't hang, so they're placed on the ground, perhaps with some soup left inside. Each household's cabinet also occupies "airspace." A five-bulb electric lamp is blackened by grease and grime, like a naughty child's face. The landlord washes it once a year on "spring cleaning" day, but otherwise its "true colors" are never seen. The same is true for the glass window facing the street hall.

So when you walk into the kitchen area, you have to be careful with your head and feet. It's very painful to bump your forehead against the wooden leg of the cabinet. As for your feet, there are many things on the ground: coal baskets, wooden boxes, lead buckets, copper buckets, fire tongs, vegetable baskets... almost making you walk through thorns. It's not just a matter of tripping and falling; if you step on someone's old things, you'll have to pay for new ones at the original price. What's more, the kitchen floor is muddy all year round and easy to slip on. Honestly, who, except for the landlord, bothers to pay attention to whether the tap is turned off? It's a matter of public morality.

From 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, it is the heyday of the kitchen area. The landlord's wife or nanny, the sister-in-law from the front building, the grandma from the back building, the nanny from the small room, the older sister from the attic... all return from the vegetable market one after another and gather in the kitchen area. Then the meeting begins. Each person first reports the price of goods, then checks the items in the basket, and then evaluates them. The sister-in-law from the front building bought the yellow croaker cheaply, and the grandma from the back building bought the fresh prawns... If you want to hear an accurate report on the price fluctuations of fish, meat, and vegetables, the kitchen area will give it to you.

Because the kitchen area is a "public concession," some small disputes are inevitable. For example, if there's less salt in someone's salt cellar, or only the head of the ribbonfish is left in the cabinet... then there will be implied scolding, although it is baseless, just to vent the anger in their hearts. As long as everyone doesn't overthink, it's easy for things to turn into nothing. A virtuous housewife in the kitchen area will say: "Only cook the food in your own pot, don't worry about whether other people's is bland or salty," which will avoid a lot of trouble. Don't underestimate this small kitchen area. It is the source of three meals a day and also a prototype of a complex society.

### More on "Strategy" in the Literary World

— Tu Lao

I still want to say a few words about "strategy" in the literary world.

In fact, comparing writers to lawyers is not very appropriate. Some of our writers have already surpassed lawyers in their abilities. Lawyers' "strategy" is ultimately for others, not for themselves, and the purpose is very simple, just to make a living. Writers are different. It's a personal matter, and if the "strategy" is successful, they gain both fame and fortune. This is called "the times make heroes."

So, judging from the "strategy" that has appeared in the literary world, not only are there many kinds, but also the patterns are constantly renewed and progressing very rapidly, even running fast with the times.

Self-promotion or hiring people to cheer has become too outdated. A notice or a few anonymous letters are no longer surprising. Even putting out a special issue scolding a certain celebrity in a self-run publication and then sending the publication to the scolded person to elicit a retaliatory response is something that people are tired of seeing. Thus, there are more artistic and more "spirited" "strategies" being born.

That "strategy" is the real strategy that surpasses the lawyer-style "strategy." It's not about giving others nicknames, but about giving oneself nicknames. The method is: to beat the drum and yell it out oneself, saying, "Look! I am an inferiority complex sufferer." Or saying, "Look! I am the nth kind of person." But just saying it is not enough. Then you must perform a little. If you are an "inferiority complex sufferer," you must pretend to be pitiful and create some materials about being bullied, preferably materials about being bullied by women. You can even write one or two articles yourself for women to scold you. If you are the "nth kind of person," you must put on a detached face, indicating that you are only loyal to your own art. And it is best to venerate a figure from foreign writers who "ignores politics," and find a document from classical literature that says the masses are useless, which will be even more sensational for a time.

However, this is not the most advanced "strategy," because the personal brand is too obvious. There is another category of the most advanced strategies.

For example, when popular literature rises, it is very inconvenient to publicly oppose it, so you start from another aspect, saying that the vocabulary in the articles of young writers is too small and that they should find a new one. But the books designated to find vocabulary are very ancient antiques and are very far removed from the masses. This achieves your own purpose secretly. For example, when anti-Japanese literature becomes the common effort of everyone, it is even more inconvenient to publicly oppose it, so you come up with another way, saying that all the current works are "stereotyped anti-Japanese," which naturally seems to hope for good anti-Japanese literature on the surface, but in fact, as soon as you deviate from the theme of anti-Japanese, you can only attach to the theme of "peace," which again secretly achieves your own purpose.

I ask, how can lawyers compare to such "strategy"?

Alas, lawyers are in the past. It is truly amazing to see writers complete the art of "strategy" to such an extent! But one thing I am anxious about is that after all, energy is limited. If writers only devote themselves to studying strategies, they will inevitably not be able to engage in writing. Although lawyers are not ambitious, they still write many complaints in their lives. I am just afraid that our writers will end up not even being as good as lawyers!

### Song of Parting

— Gu Sifan

In Yuqian

One day, at my friend Qi's Wenbi residence in Yuqian, two girls moved in. The older one was gentle and dignified, while the younger one had bangs and was lively and interesting. They made beds out of door panels, surrounded by mosquito nets made of bedsheets, and the floor was covered with straw, serving as a bed for their friend, a very elegant and handsome young man. They were all students from the Zhejiang Youth Wartime Work Corps. The two girls were sent from the provincial capital to Yuqian County on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, and the man accompanied them there. After staying for a day or two, he prepared to go to the Suzhou-Changzhou area, as he was an intelligence officer for the New Fourth Army in the occupied territories.

They loved to laugh, make noise, and sing, hardly ever stopping. They made a fuss all night, but the next morning, they had sneaked off to play somewhere. When we got up, it was eerily quiet outside. Passing by their room, we saw straw scraps and peanut shells all over the floor, with a few books scattered around: "Popular Philosophy," "Field of Life and Death," "Literary Front." Qi's wife smiled and said:

"What does this look like?"

"A dog's kennel," I replied jokingly.

Qi remembered something and said:

"The younger one is like Lulu, with the same bangs and liveliness. Just hearing her Hangzhou accent makes me think of Lulu when she was little."

"Why don't I think so?" I said.

"Because you met her in Shanghai when she was already grown up."

Yes, at that time, she had already been a teacher for many children, and we parted after only a few meetings. It has been almost three years since then. Last autumn, when I went to Changsha from Shanghai, I passed through Jinhua and learned that she had gotten married. I unexpectedly saw in her wedding photo that her husband was also my friend. Five years ago, when I was studying at a middle school on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, he was the school's registrar. Later, his love affair with a female teacher in the elementary school department ended, and he left the school. No one knew where he had wandered off to.

This spring, passing through Jinhua again, friends told me that they had separated not long after they got married. Lulu joined the New Fourth Army's training camp, and her husband joined the guerrilla forces in Jiangnan. But now, Lulu is about to graduate, and he has died in an enemy encirclement. She wrote a letter to her friends in Jinhua:

"I don't believe this is real. Is this really real?... Give me the courage to live on..."

I told Qi about this, and Qi also wrote a letter to comfort her:

"I heard that you are saddened by your misfortune, and I felt the need to write to you because I am one of your old friends. I guess your sorrow will soon be overcome, just like others who have experienced the same changes. People originally have emotions and reason, they can be excited and calm. Moreover, there is still great work laid out before you!"

But I believe Lulu will become stronger through suffering. Just like those insignificant neighbors of ours, like Lulu, such spoiled young ladies are also able to leave their fallen hometowns, wear military cotton coats, and run around in unfamiliar places.

I soon left Yuqian.

On the eve of leaving Yuqian, we drank too much wine and turned off the lights, but no one could sleep. Qi was very excited, reciting Du Fu's poem, "Tomorrow, separated by mountains, worldly affairs are vast and uncertain."

"When will you come again?" Qi's wife asked.

"If the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not cut off, I will come in half a year," I replied.

"Don't believe him!" Qi shouted wildly, "Guangxi is three thousand miles away from here! And even if he comes, will we still be in Yuqian? By then, we will have already wandered off somewhere else!"

No one spoke anymore. Outside the window, the moonlight slept in the melancholy valley.

Outside, they started making noise again. The two girls were laughing, and the man shouted loudly:

"My eldest daughter! My youngest daughter!"

Qi's wife couldn't help but laugh and said:

"Listen! What a doting father!"

As the laughter subsided, they began to sing the tragic "Song of Parting," the last two lines of which are:

Farewell, farewell, classmates!

We will meet again on the front lines! It is very easy to bring tears to people's eyes.

The next morning, it was eerily quiet outside again, but when we passed by that room, the situation was completely different: the floor was swept very clean, and the straw mat was gone. He had already left.

### Classroom Professor of Flight (Part 2)

— Translated by Sha Hong

Normally, to train someone to fly solo, it inevitably requires eight to ten hours of training in the air. Using the Link Trainer, the time for sky practice can be reduced by half, and it only takes one hour in the sky to succeed - or even less than one hour. George was the first person trained by this trainer in 1928, and he only practiced in the air for forty-two minutes.

Today, pilots need to be able to recognize their routes in the fog using wireless signals and be able to land through ceiling circles. Learning blind flying with the aid of wireless light requires completely rigorous training. This trainer can best prove its value on this point. Usually, a pilot can only perform blind flying after flying in the air for fifty hours, but now, it only takes twenty hours of training in this trainer, followed by five hours of flying in the air.

A trainer completely designed for teaching blind flying has more attachments - a table for the instructor and tools for communicating with the fake aircraft. Telephone guidance and wireless direction signals from the hypothetical airport where the student is landing are emitted from this table. The table is equipped with an ink indicator that automatically shows the aircraft's heading.

The pilot in the cockpit must trust the instruments and listen to the machine. Assuming he wants to fly to Pittsburgh, he must raise the aircraft to an altitude of four thousand feet, set his flight speed, and then fly forward smoothly, paying attention to the signals in his ears. His wireless aeronautical chart is placed in front of him.

When he leaves the cockpit, the ink indicator has already drawn his flight path. This is a record for leisure study and a basis for future guidance.

Link can quickly turn a beginner into an instrument expert, which is of great military value. Great Britain, having lost two hundred and fifty poorly trained pilots in the last war, purchased two hundred and fifty Link Trainers, distributed throughout the empire. Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan also adopted Link trainers to train pilots. The pilots of the aircraft that Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden and Munich in Germany, and the pilots of the escorting German aircraft, were all successfully trained by Link trainers. During the Sino-Japanese War on the Yangtze River and the Spanish Civil War, many combatants in the air battles on both sides were also trained using Link trainers.

Link has successfully created the person needed by the new world, and this is his everlasting contribution. Now that this trainer has shown some military value, it is expected that its great effectiveness will gradually be revealed in the future development of air transport and the expansion of aerial armaments.

### How Can We Catch Up!

### A Bundle of Wild Grass

— Liu Lan

Overture

Loneliness teaches people to think, solitude makes people imagine more. Deep in the night, listening to the ticking of the clock, I jot down these fragmented thoughts.

Time

First, I thought of time. What a difficult problem to grasp! (Where does it come from, and where does it go?) An aestheticist said: "Time deprives you of the roses of youth." Others say: "Don't go to clock shops and listen to your youth being devoured." Thus, people tremble in fear before time, worrying about rosy cheeks turning into white hair.

"How many possibilities are there in one second?" Who knows? I am not asking for a mysterious answer, saying that there is a dark hand pulling the net of fate. Friends, be careful, you will be amazed at the changes that time brings to people. There are too many.

The child in our memory has learned about love; the lively person has walked into the grave. Look at our motherland! How has it surpassed time in the race against it and progressed rapidly?

That's right. This is exactly what I want to race. Don't be afraid, and don't tremble. Grab it and complete the work we should do.

Happiness

"Happiness is sometimes very close to people, even within reach, but people still lose it." I can't forget this sentence for a long time. Happiness often wanders in the wilderness, unable to find a patron.

I often remember the embarrassed faces of those who are teased in uproarious laughter. People are accustomed to building their own happiness on the suffering of others, saying that they have gained happiness. But alas, the answer is uncertain.

Happiness is not selfish. In this turbulent era, there is no personal happiness. Everything is attached to the nation. Abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial, striving for one's own benefit will not succeed.

Happiness will fall on the good sons and daughters of the motherland.

### Has Stalin Seen Our Play?

— Li Feishu

—Fourth of Random Memories of Meibian—

"Has Stalin seen Chinese plays?" This is a question that has lingered in our minds (the members of the Mei Opera Troupe) since returning from performing in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union! This emerging and great Soviet Union! Every book and every action seemed too mysterious! If we hadn't experienced it ourselves, we would never have believed the eight words in "Travels in the Russian Capital" (by Cai Yunchen): "The network of prohibitions is dense, and the investigations are strict."

Regarding the political "clear and muddy distinction," please forgive me for being a coward. I do not have the courage, nor the knowledge and qualifications, to arbitrarily comment. As someone who has always regarded myself as an "actor" or "performer" (I am a graduate of the Nantong Opera School and a "short foot" of Mr. Mei Wanhua - the inverse proportion of "high foot"), I will speak about the industry I am in. I will briefly write down the impressions of the secret police that we gained during our travels to the Soviet Union and the performances, as well as the "mysterious and interesting" memories of whether Stalin actually saw our performance, and provide them to the readers.

When the special ship "Northern," sent by the Soviet Union, arrived in Vladivostok, the first thing that caught our eye was the Red Star fighters, armed and standing upright, wearing long robes. The magnificence of their bearing! I unconsciously felt infected and straightened my hunched back.

The inspection by the tax officials was very kind and casual. This was our special treatment. (This was the case when traveling to Japan and the United States in previous years. There was also a French artist who returned to his country from Beijing via Manchuria and Siberia, and was subjected to harsh treatment by the tax officials. Later, in his luggage, I found a photograph given to him by Mei Lanfang, and he was immediately released. This artist deeply lamented the greatness of the "magic power of Chinese artists" in his travelogue! His writing was thorough and meticulous. I and Mr. Xu translated it into Chinese, and I will find it and make it public to the readers.)

The Soviet Union has very strict restrictions on the import and export of valuable items! I remember when Ms. Hu Die landed, the diamonds and jewelry she carried were too rich and dazzling! The calloused and rough hands of the big men couldn't help but be surprised and cause twists and turns. However, she eventually got away with it and still carried her "alluring neon lights" (a nickname I gave to women's accessories) ashore with a flourish. What was the reason? It turned out that this clever "butterfly" had anticipated this before she went abroad. Although her jewelry box was full, nine-tenths of it was "fake."

In the dining room of the Chelnskin Hotel, the magnificent and mournful "Volga Boatmen" tune was playing on the stage. We tasted the flavor of "real Russian cuisine" for the first time. The manager and even the waiters of this hotel could speak fluent Shandong dialect. Especially the waiter who was specially sent to receive us spoke pure Beijing dialect. If it weren't for the racial characteristics of his face, I would have thought he was a "Jing Youzi" (a Beijing person who is good at rhetoric).

Starlight is brilliant, and Hollywood stars are so fit!

### Tan Xinpei's First Visit to Shanghai

— Old Supporting Role

Tan Xinpei came to Shanghai during the era of Ten Shops and Nine Mu of Fields. I have already heard about it. I am unable to detail it. As for between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, I was studying in Shanghai and heard and saw things that I can talk about. So I wrote it down to provide information for those who love to talk about the anecdotes of opera.

Tan Xinpei's first visit to Shanghai was with the Guixian Teahouse on Daxin Street. It seems it was during the Xinchou year of Guangxu, which is the twenty-first year of Guangxu. Guixian was created by Ying Guizhi of Ningbo. Before Tan Xinpei arrived in Shanghai, the various newspapers often reported on it, saying that Little Jiaotian was coming to Shanghai to perform. Small newspapers such as Li Boyuan's Youxi Bao (Game News), Li Yuxian's Yuyan Bao (Fable News), and Sun Yusheng's Xiaolin Bao (Joke Forest News) introduced his art, but never mentioned which theater he would join. However, because Tan had a familial relationship with Xia Yuerun, a martial artist at the Danggui Teahouse, everyone suspected that he would definitely join Danggui. At that time, there were four theaters in Shanghai: Tianfu, Tianxian, Danggui. Guixian was newly established and had not been around for long. (Tianyi was already closed.) When the Shanghai newspapers revealed that he was joining Guixian, it was said to be beyond everyone's expectations. In fact, actors perform for a guaranteed fee, which has nothing to do with familial ties. However, it can be seen that at that time, opera enthusiasts had a poor understanding of the customs of opera troupes. Tan Xinpei was using the stage name Little Jiaotian at this time, and his guaranteed fee was only 800 yuan per month, which was already three times that of Zhu Guifen's guaranteed fee. One martial artist, Tan Junpei, came with him. He flopped on his first day singing "Hua Hu Die" (The Flowery Butterfly). After that, he never appeared on stage again. Later, when I asked actors who came from Beijing, they all said that they didn't know anyone by that name in Beijing. So it is possible that the actor was deliberately being mysterious, thinking of attaching himself to a famous person to make a name for himself. On Tan Xinpei's first day, he sang "Kongcheng Ji" (The Empty City Stratagem) and "Daizhan Zilong" (Replacing Zilong for Execution). The seat prices in the main hall and the octagonal corners were as high as five corners. Therefore, business was not prosperous. He was with Guixian for about half a month. I saw him perform three plays: "Kongcheng Ji," "Hongyang Dong" (Hongyang Cave), and "Biemu Luanjian" (Farewell Mother, Chaotic Arrows). It was around the time when osmanthus was fragrant. Several years later, he came again and joined Danggui on Zhengfeng Street. At that time, in addition to the original cast of Danggui, there were Beijing actors such as Zhu Suyun and Sun Yiyun. But I can barely remember them. Also, since I came to Shanghai in the Gui Si year, the old male actors I have seen from Beijing, except for Zhu Zhongfen who was with Tianfu, Tan Xinpei's visit was definitely the first. (Sun Juxian's first visit to Shanghai was before I arrived. His second visit was after Tan's.) As for those before what I have seen, I do not know. However, based on what was said at the time and what was revealed in the Shanghai newspapers, he was definitely a famous actor from Beijing when he first came to Shanghai.

### The Success of Nan Shan Kelly, the Female Lead in "Bandits"

— Chen Jie

Genius and Cultivation Combined

To be a movie star is actually not an easy thing. Not only must you have talent, but you must also have very good cultivation. We won't talk about the exquisite and moving acting skills of Nan Shan Kelly, the female lead in "Bandits"; now I will introduce a short history of her own account. She was requested by the editor of an American film magazine. The original can be found in Morie Mirool's country.

"I will never forget my mom and dad.

My mom taught me how to act, and my dad taught me how to dance. Before my mother got married, she was already a pillar actress in the New Orstre Theater. Now she not only teaches me how to move, but also how to cry. She said that an actor should know how to cry. I often do this and practiced a kind of expression that can cry actively anytime, anywhere.

When I was four years old, my mother took me to a filming studio, which belonged to Paramount. The movie being filmed at that time was Gloria Swanson. At this time, a child who was good at expressing crying emotions was needed. The several temporary child actors in the studio did not do well. The director came to us and asked my mother. My mother said that I could cry, and she asked me to cry. I really cried, and it was very real.

Since then, I have acted with Li Quedix, Qin Hexu, Warner Pester, and others. Especially Warner, he was so kind, amiable, and heroic. He often took me to the garden and the zoo. He often introduced me to his friends, saying, "This is the future big star!"

In the beginning, I did not go to school. I always listened to my mother's teachings at home. When I was eight years old, I was already acting on stage. My mother often corrected my pronunciation, expressions, etc. I often performed actions alone or with my mother at home. Later, I also studied French and read many French scripts...

Later, I went on the radio to broadcast. When I was acting in New York, I was discovered by a Hollywood director and signed a contract with him. I moved to Hollywood with my mom and dad.

I am only eighteen years old now. However, no matter how small an achievement, I will not forget my dearest mom and dad."

I have translated these paragraphs here. It can be seen that an actor's success is by no means accidental. Indeed, genius and cultivation must be combined, and "upward mobility" must be maintained at all times in order to seek further development. Here, I send this hope to Chinese female stars!

### Where Is Lan Ping, the Progressive Filmmaker?

— (Huicun)

The progressive filmmaker Lan Ping has had several extraordinary performances in the circle of love. It is remembered that several years ago, at the group wedding of three pairs of artists under the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou, Lan Ping and Tang Na were one of the couples. However, not long after, Tang Na was abandoned, and Lan Ping went to live with Zhang Min, who already had a wife. However, Tang Na was still reluctant for Lan Ping's sake, and there were several suicide attempts.

After the August 13th Incident, Tang Na, Lan Ping, and Zhang Min, these three happy enemies, all had a new understanding and went their separate ways to do sacred anti-Japanese work.

After the war broke out, Lan Ping first left Zhang Min, with whom she had been living, and went to the interior to join the Salvation Drama Troupe. It was not until the summer of last year that she and Ouyang Hongying arrived in Yan'an together. Because the journey was long and the traffic was obstructed, it has been a year and a half since then, and news of her has been cut off.

Now, the author has received a letter from a friend in Yan'an. It is said that after graduating from "Kangda" (Anti-Japanese Military and Political University), Lan Ping is now employed at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, serving as a teacher and life instructor. There is even more good news to report. Lan Ping currently has a home. Not long ago, she officially married a local celebrity, and the wedding was held under the principle of simplicity.

### Yu Qiaqing and Others Launch a Grand Concert of Famous Actors and Amateur Performers

— Du Bing

—To Raise Funds for the Epidemic Hospital—

Don't forget those dates—July 1st and July 2nd—when Shanghai's amateur performers and famous actors will jointly hold a concert to raise funds for the epidemic hospital's medical expenses. The location is the Guohua Radio Station, and the time is from 2:00 p.m. every day. It's getting hot. But what are they busy with?

According to Yu Qiaqing, the initiator of the concert, the epidemic hospital has been diagnosing and treating the sick and saving millions of poor and sick civilians every year. However, now prices are soaring, and drug and material costs are also rising. If a sum of money is not planned in advance, won't we be watching the living civilians die of epidemics during a long summer?

Jin Tingsun, Wu Limen, Yuan Ludeng, Dou Yaoting and others also expressed some opinions on caring for the poor and sick. So it was decided to invite Bao Xiaodie and others to be responsible for preparing the concert of amateur performers, while the participation of famous actors would be presided over by Chen Yuelou, the chairman of the Actors' Association. Of course, what readers need to be told is the lineup of their concert. However, every famous actor in Shanghai is enthusiastically willing to shed a few drops of sweat for the poor and sick, so on the newspaper, everyone's name is already familiar to you, and your favorite popular characters will all meet you in the air. Due to space constraints, it is not necessary to write their names. Please don't forget those dates—July 1st and July 2nd.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Master Hongdou of Hongdou Hall is capable of everything from civil to military, Kunqu to miscellaneous operas

Mr. Xiyuan has extensive knowledge. Because he loved drama since he was a child and formed a group, almost more than half of his life's energy has been spent on studying drama. He is over sixty years old this year, but he is still very energetic, and he has not lost any of his waist and leg skills. A few months ago, I saw him casually performing a "Qunying Hui" (Gathering of Heroes) xiaosheng (young male) posture somewhere. His body bent down in a bowing gesture, and one leg could still be stretched straight, which was very beautiful and elegant. It is said that he obtained the true teachings of Lengxian. If this kind of posture is used on stage, a pair of pheasant feathers, rising and falling, plus this extremely stylish posture, it is truly indescribable. Lengxian was a top student of the living Zhou Yu, Xu Xiaoxiang. After Xiaoxiang went into seclusion, Lengxian won the title of first xiaosheng. Although Mr. Xiyuan only slightly tried his skills, it was enough to show the scholarly general style of Zhou Yu. At the same time, I have also seen him perform "Qi Shuang Hui" (The Strange Couple) with Lanfang. All kinds of skills, such as writing the complaint, three pulls (Zhao only has one pull), breaking into the courtyard gate, the god of pulling the sleeve, throwing the boot bottom, swaying the gauze wings, etc., show that his work in learning Wang's art is very profound.

In addition to the male role, the old gentleman also learned "Zhan Wancheng" (Fighting Wancheng) Cao Cao from the living Cao Cao, Huang Runfu. The posture of stepping on the green seedlings on horseback is not right in today's circle of experts. Sir Ruishui is quite proud of this, but I heard people say that he is still imitating the old Pu. (Some people also say that it was taught by Mr. Bo.) In addition, Mr. Xiyuan also performed the ugly maid of "Fēngzheng Wù" (The Kite's Mistake). Whether he was taught by Da Liqi, I don't know. In short, Mr. Pu's knowledge is broad and versatile. He is capable of everything from civil to military, Kunqu to miscellaneous operas. He is even slightly better than Chen and Wang. Moreover, during the late Qing Dynasty, his status and value were very respected. No matter what famous actors there were in the circle, as long as he wanted to learn any difficult famous play from them, as long as he gave an order, who would dare not pass on all his abilities to him? Therefore, even the most difficult Kunqu opera, "Quanben Ning Wuguan" (The Complete Ning Wuguan), is now only fully available from this gentleman. Although Shu Yan, Ju Peng, and De Bao all cherish this play very much, they are not as good as Pu. It is feared that one or two of the three are still learning from Mr. Pu, so they will of course not be able to surpass their predecessors. (48)

### Continued Records of the Yang Yuelou Abduction Case

Regarding the Yang Yuelou affair, after a few days, the local magistrate brought the case up again for re-examination. According to Zhang Wangshi's testimony, "Abao was promised to Yuelou, and when the Wei family was in Shanghai, they also agreed to it," and so on. The magistrate did not inquire further into the details. At the time, the three boxes belonging to Wei Wangshi were given for her to collect. Those belonging to Yuelou were also sought and collected by a guarantor. Wei Wangshi was released, but soon fell ill and died from worry. Yuelou was imprisoned outside the jail, and Abao was confined to the official matchmaker's office. On the thirteenth day, the case was re-examined. Wei, the head of the family, was summoned to clarify the matter. It was confirmed that there was no such thing as arranging a marriage or betrothing Abao to Yang Yuelou. Because the head of the family was unwilling to take her back, Abao was flogged again and sent to a charity hall to be matched with someone. After Yang Yuelou was sold again, the local magistrate charged him with the crime of abduction, intending to sentence him to military exile and transfer him to the prefectural court. After the prefect of Songjiang Prefecture brought him up for interrogation, Yang Yuelou kowtowed and pleaded his innocence, saying that his confession in Shanghai, "deceiving Abao's parents in order to abduct their daughter," was obtained through torture. The prefect, seeing this, felt pity and said, "I know that you have been wronged!" Upon hearing this, Yang Yuelou felt as if he had been freed from shackles and ascended to a nuptial bed. He kowtowed deeply and said, "I have hope for life again! I am grateful for your clear judgement. You truly have the power of life and death over me!" However, the prefect still commissioned Lou County to re-examine the case and ordered him to be severely beaten two hundred times, warning him not to retract his confession. Therefore, Yang Yuelou did not dare to retract his confession. The prefect made a determination and, according to procedure, transferred him to the provincial court. Now it is heard that Censor Wei has also brought up the case for questioning. The judicial commissioner is fair and just and unwilling to increase the sentence. When Yang Yuelou arrived in Songjiang Prefecture, he retracted his confession as before, not changing his words at all. The commissioner thought that it was normal for criminals to cry out for injustice. If someone had been tortured to the point of disability, they might falsely confess out of fear of torture. But since there was no sign of injury from torture, how could he allow him to be cunning and deceitful? Thus, he followed procedure and sent the case back to Songjiang Prefecture for re-examination. So, he admitted to adultery and abduction. Yesterday, the state and county yamen were notified step by step from the province to return him. He has already been imprisoned again by order of the local magistrate, as he had already made a confession in the court of the investigating commissioner, and a detailed report has been submitted to the governor for verification of the crime. He will soon be able to request a decision and be sent into exile! Alas! The dust and wind of the four thousand li beyond the Great Wall, even though Yang Yuelou has wandered the world and experienced hardship, I fear he will find it hard to bear! Looking back at the flowery days and wine-soaked nights, the dark green and red lights, I wonder what regrets he will have!
