### Broadcast Address by Chairman Chiang: Implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization; The Greatness of Spiritual Strength Surpasses All Material Strengths; Completing the Two Major Responsibilities of Resistance and Nation-Building Together; Sincerely Examining Shortcomings; Rising Up United to Seek Self-Transformation; Shattering Attempts at Surrender and Humiliation; In Order to Enrich the National Spirit

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang held a solemn and serious National Covenant Oath Ceremony on the morning of the 17th, and delivered a broadcast address at 7 p.m. The original text is recorded as follows:

Fellow countrymen, we are now implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. From the first of next month, all parts of our country must fully implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures promulgated by the Central Government on March 12th. We must hold National Monthly Meetings to swear the National Covenant, and we must also encourage and supervise each other according to the various regulations stipulated in the Outline, and put them into practice. Everyone must know that this is the most important thing related to the survival of the country, the vitality of the nation, and the success or failure of the War of Resistance. I ask all our countrymen, especially leaders from all walks of life, to pay special attention to this important matter and sincerely promote it. Why should we implement spiritual mobilization? This has been made very clear in the Outline. I want to reiterate in particular that, first, we must recognize the greatness of spiritual strength, which surpasses all material strength and all military force. Second, we must reflect on the shortcomings in our spiritual aspects in the past. What is spirit? Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen put it most succinctly, saying, "All that is non-material is spirit." However, the Founding Father did not say that spirit and matter are absolutely separated, but that the two are united and complement each other. The Founding Father also said, "If mankind loses its spirit, it will not be a completely independent person." Think about it, what a shocking lesson this is! If an individual loses their spirit, they are not a completely independent person. Then, if a nation loses its spirit, wouldn't it be a nation unworthy of independent survival? Military strategy says, "Attacking the mind is the best strategy." The so-called attacking the mind is to strike at the opponent's spirit. Therefore, the success or failure of all struggles in the world depends entirely on the strength and weakness of the spirit. Tangible material or military force cannot determine victory or defeat. The Founding Father said that the use of weapons depends entirely on the spirit of the people, once said, "Compared with the two, spiritual power accounts for nine, and material power only accounts for one." All comrades who have participated in battles can cite countless examples to prove the accuracy and irrefutability of this posthumous teaching. We only need to look at our front lines since the War of Resistance, where there are often less than a few soldiers who can resist a large number of enemies for several days, and even repel enemies more than ten times their number. There are also old and weak women who can resist violence and kill enemies in self-defense with their bare hands. Many things that are usually considered unimaginable or impossible can become facts beyond expectation in times of difficulty and crisis. Therefore, only those who have lost their spirit will only see matter and not spirit, only estimate tangible power and ignore intangible power. In fact, to win this war of resistance, to defeat the enemy, and to build a successful nation, a large part depends on the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to seek final success. Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, our compatriots must recognize the greatness of spiritual strength. This is the first point I want to make clear. Secondly, we must ask whether we have had any effect, development, and progress in spirit since the War of Resistance, and whether there are still many shortcomings. Speaking of this, I want to remind our compatriots of an old saying from more than a year ago. It was when our War of Resistance had just begun for less than two or three months. At that time, foreign public opinion had various criticisms of our country. Among them, there was an extremely shocking comment, saying that "China is not strong enough to resist external forces, either in spirit or in material." I don't know if our compatriots still remember this sentence. I personally keep this sentence in my heart every day, warning and encouraging myself, and never forgetting it for a moment. Is this sentence an insult to us? We must wait for the future to prove it with facts. Of course, we have already shown many heroic and struggling deeds in the War of Resistance. But compatriots must remember that the war is not over, the enemy has not been defeated, and final victory has not been achieved. We must honestly and sincerely examine ourselves. Has our national spirit really made solid progress with the progress of the war? Have our past shortcomings been washed away in the War of Resistance? Have we, the people with responsibilities, fulfilled our responsibilities? Have the capable people done their best? Has everyone's life been consistently serious and tense? Have our front and rear areas truly achieved a unified response and shared weal and woe? Have our thoughts, words, and actions been completely gathered under the goal of "the nation above all, the nation above all, military first, and victory first"? Have we achieved consistency between what we say and what we do? Can we all consistently carry out our generous and enthusiastic anti-Japanese spirit from beginning to end, consistently through thick and thin? Can we absolutely not waver, not seize, not deceive, and not be false? Furthermore, can our confidence in the War of Resistance and nation-building be accepted and understood by every citizen? Can we make the enemy and the general puppet traitors recognize that our national spirit is inviolable? Has the general social way of life practically met the conditions of wartime life? I know that if compatriots think about themselves and look at the society around them, they will inevitably feel that it is necessary for us to be extra vigilant, extra invigorated, and extra mutual encouragement and supervision. If a country has material defects, there is no way to fill them in a short time, and it cannot be regarded as the shame of this country, because the production of materials requires manpower, material resources, especially time, and various conditions, which cannot be supplemented in a moment. As for spiritual defects, it is different. With spirit, one share of material can be used as ten shares of material, and it can also create a large amount of material. Without spirit, as the Founding Father said, "The human body becomes a dead thing." No matter how many weapons and materials you have, it will all be useless. Moreover, spirit is not comparable to material. Spirit is inherent in every citizen. It is not external. It can be improved and improved through methods of enlightenment and induction, in the transfer of a single thought. If a country suffers foreign aggression due to the decline of its spirit, it is already the incomparable shame of this generation of citizens. If, in times of crisis and survival, we still cannot concentrate our spirit, household by household, father exhorting brother, to defend our country and nation, overcome the current difficulties, and open up the future destiny, then it is not only the shame of this generation of citizens, but simply a sin, because this is the so-called "not that we cannot do it, but that we do not do it." There is no reason to forgive ourselves. We must know that if we win the War of Resistance and build a successful nation, the destiny of the Chinese nation for thousands of years will not be broken, and we will certainly have the confidence to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. On the contrary, if the country loses its independent survival because our generation does not have a vigorous, strong, and unyielding spirit, then later historians will not know how severely they will criticize us when recording the history of this period. The general public will of course suffer from being贬百世, and leaders and intellectuals from all walks of life with higher knowledge, ability, and status will not be able to escape the blame of historians. Now the War of Resistance has entered the second stage. This is our last chance for victory, and it is also our citizens' last chance to serve the country and redeem themselves. That is why, in the midst of extremely busy military and political affairs, I advocate the National Spiritual Mobilization, which is to give our compatriots, especially leaders from all walks of life, a final opportunity to repay the country. The items and key points included in the spiritual mobilization have been listed in several points, and there are also points that are not listed in the Outline. Everyone can draw inferences from one instance. In order to promote this movement universally, the first step is to hold monthly meetings and swear the National Covenant. When everyone holds the meeting, they must not do it in the manner of following the old rules. You must know that these simple twelve articles are our weapons for resisting and defeating the enemy. We must have the spirit of not being afraid of death, not being afraid of hardship, and not being afraid of difficulty to implement them. For example, we say that we will not do anything for the enemy and traitors. If there is any force to coerce us, we will only refuse to break our oath even if we die. Also, if we say that we will not violate the Three Principles of the People and the interests of the country and the nation, if there is any external coercion or temptation to make us violate the Three Principles of the People, or do something that violates the interests of the country and the nation, we should also grit our teeth and refuse to break our oath even if we die, and we will not break our oath even if we suffer any pain. Our situation today can be said that the entire nation has stepped onto the glorious line of turning over, and every citizen must consider themselves standing on the line of certain death, just as the ancients said, "Keep in mind that you can die at any time, and seek survival in every step you take." Every move we make, every drop of sweat, every drop of blood, must be used at any time and anywhere to seek the glorious and independent survival of the country and the nation. But what do we rely on to fight? We need the determination to die for ourselves. If everyone has the determination to die at any time, there is no doubt that the enemy will collapse in front of us, and the noble spirit of the Chinese nation can be universally developed and achieve the certain victory of the War of Resistance and the certain success of nation-building. Regarding the essence of spiritual mobilization, what I want to say is really endless for a while. The oath-taking section mentioned above is a basic starting point. I earnestly ask every one of our compatriots to stick to the common goal of "the nation above all, the nation above all, military first, and victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," and earnestly restore our nation's inherent morality, and strengthen our spiritual fortress. A person must be loyal to the country, filial to the nation, benevolent to suffering compatriots, faithful to all mankind, and do everything in his power to strive for true and lasting peace in this turbulent and dim world. I also ask our compatriots to understand that the War of Resistance is for nation-building, and the two major responsibilities must be completed together. Therefore, we must deeply repent of the past mistakes of not sincerely believing in the Three Principles of the People, and from now on, we must establish our national faith in the Three Principles of the People and sincerely seek its realization. The most basic point is that our compatriots, from old age to youth, must have ardent confidence in the bright future of the nation. We must confirm that the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People established after the victory of the War of Resistance must be a new country that comes from behind, a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, and the most thoroughly progressive country that can contribute to the well-being of the world and mankind. Now is the period of fierce resistance, a moment of great importance, and we cannot allow ourselves to make any more empty theories or empty thoughts, nor can we waste a single moment of time and energy. We should aim at the current strong enemy, face the country's difficulties, seriously reflect on our responsibilities, and sincerely examine all our shortcomings and weaknesses. On the one hand, we must quickly and surely transform ourselves, set an example, and at the same time inspire our compatriots across the country, help our compatriots who have not yet awakened, awaken our compatriots who generally have lower levels of knowledge, rise up together, correct the life of drunkenness and self-abandonment, develop a vigorous and enterprising spirit, eliminate the habit of苟且偷生 and陽奉陰達, break the attempts of selfishness and submission, correct the divergent and mixed thoughts that mislead the country and oneself, tighten our emotions, and unify our actions, so that the spirit of our Chinese nation can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve the spiritual mobilization of the whole country, and exert this (至大至剛) spiritual strength to complete our generation's mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, our dear compatriots, I hope everyone will fight for the country and cherish the country. Goodbye. (17th dispatch)

### Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Airfield in Jianqiao

Also Reconnoiters over Hangzhou; No Japanese Aircraft Take Off to Engage

(Chongqing) Military circles here claim that the Chinese Air Force is becoming increasingly active. Chinese bombers have recently attacked the Hangzhou airfield twice. A Chinese military spokesman said today that the two key points east and north of Guangzhou have been regained by the Chinese side, as the Chinese army has recaptured Zengcheng and Huaxian. From a military point of view, the recapture of Zengcheng is particularly important. To the south, it can control Shilong on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road, and to the west, it can control the southern section of the Yuehan Road, thus exerting pressure on Guangzhou. According to war news from the front line, the Chinese Air Force is currently active in assisting the offensive launched by the Chinese Army. It was heard that at the beginning of last month, Chinese planes raided the Hangzhou airfield at night. It is now heard that at noon on April 13th, Chinese bombers attacked the airfield near Jianqiao again. After dropping bombs and bombing, they reconnoitered the sky over Hangzhou. It was heard that the Japanese side's anti-aircraft artillery fire was very dense, but no Japanese aircraft took off to engage. Chinese aircraft also bombed the Jinan Japanese positions south of Zhongtiao Mountain. (17th Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Spiritual Mobilization and Shanghai Citizens

From yesterday until the 23rd of this month, all provinces and cities in China are holding a National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and today also happens to be Citizens' Propaganda Day. At the present time when China's War of Resistance is gradually entering a new stage, and when the Japanese army is feeling increasingly difficult in its military operations against China and is attempting to use various conspiratorial methods to shake China's War of Resistance, this great National Spiritual Movement has profound and significant meaning.

The National Spiritual Mobilization Outline was passed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Third Session of the National Political Consultative Conference, and promulgated by the Central Government. It stipulates the National Covenant, which all citizens of the country must swear to abide by; and it stipulates that from the first day of next month, all organizations and institutions across the country should hold National Monthly Meetings every month to review whether everyone can strictly abide by the National Covenant, and whether they can faithfully fulfill the Outline of Spiritual Mobilization. This movement is by no means only of negative significance, but of positive effect; this movement is by no means just a "boilerplate" that is only in form, but has substantial content, and is a major task that every patriotic citizen must perform. We must know that today, as the War of Resistance enters a new stage, although the prospect of China's victory is getting closer day by day, the difficulties encountered by China will inevitably deepen and expand day by day. Because the Japanese warlords, seeing the hopelessness of their military operations against China, will certainly use all the most vicious conspiracies to shake the will of the Chinese people, threaten the spirit of the Chinese people, and divide the unity of the Chinese people, in order to fundamentally destroy China's War of Resistance. To achieve victory, China must first overcome all these difficulties, and must work together to build a strong spiritual fortress, temper its struggle, and crush all kinds of conspiracies by Japanese imperialism to destroy China's War of Resistance. Chairman Chiang said it well: "Recently, the enemy has been focusing on political maneuvers, fabricating facts, and alienating the Chinese people, all in order to first subdue our spirit and decompose our spirit... To break this conspiracy,... we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance, and not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit and will of the whole country, and not only launch the spirit of the whole country, but also organize the spirit that has been launched, use organized spirit to exert organized manpower, and use organized materials, so that we can sweep away the invading strong enemy and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war."

Although Shanghai has become an "isolated island," none of the four million Shanghai citizens who do not want to be slaves do not think about the future of the motherland day and night, and none do not want to do their part for the country and the nation. On this day of holding the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, the citizens of Shanghai will certainly temper themselves and strive even harder, and enthusiastically shoulder the responsibilities in their own positions. Now, taking this opportunity, we especially point out the two most urgent and important tasks at this time and place, hoping that the citizens of Shanghai will earnestly and actively carry them out:

The first task that Shanghai citizens should undertake is to completely eradicate the activities of traitorous and rebellious elements. As the Shanghai Spiritual Mobilization Association said in its "Letter to Compatriots": "Because the enemy's military invasion has failed, it has turned to developing political conspiracies, using a small number of national scum to attempt to shake our overall War of Resistance. Wang Jingwei... has colluded with the enemy country and openly sought surrender... and secretly sent his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble." Yes, today's Shanghai has indeed become the center of the Japanese military intelligence agencies and the conspiratorial activities of pro-Japanese traitors. In any case, their evil hands are almost always lurking. For example, the pro-Japanese lackeys Zhou Fohai and others are already active in Shanghai's educational circles, and the dissemination of insulting leaders and alienating unity by the pro-Japanese organ "Protest" and other traitorous arguments deserve close attention. Every patriotic Shanghai citizen must work together to eliminate this traitorous theory and eradicate the activities of this group of national scum!

Secondly, from today onwards, Shanghai citizens must also thoroughly strive to improve their own lives. It is undeniable that since Shanghai became an isolated island, some people, due to inner烦闷, or due to the temptation of external evil forces, often indulge in the pursuit of 声色犬馬, so that their will becomes increasingly decadent and their lives become increasingly corrupt. This is indeed a serious crisis. To be honest, the reason why China cannot be conquered is that the hearts of the Chinese people cannot be conquered. If the Chinese people indulge in corrupt lives day and night, and their spirit becomes increasingly decadent, wouldn't that be falling into the trap of others? It must be known that gambling dens are no different from devil's dens, and opium pipes are equivalent to handguns, which are the most vicious weapons used by the Japanese army and traitors to harm and kill the Chinese people. The citizens of Shanghai, if they are addicted to this aspect, must thoroughly correct it from today onwards, or widely persuade others to correct it, which is the second most urgent task.

A telegram from the front yesterday stated that on the 13th, the Japanese army attacked Xia County. The Chinese artillery exerted great power, killing or wounding five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. The head of the puppet maintenance association of Xia County was also wounded.

More than a thousand Japanese soldiers from Quwo tried to relieve Yicheng at dawn on the 15th. They encountered the Chinese army in Nanfantun and Fengjiaojiao (south of Yicheng). After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and mostly fled back to Quwo in disarray. A portion retreated to Yicheng. Currently, the Chinese army has advanced to the line of Xixuan Village (near Yicheng) west of Xiafutu, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese.

The fierce fighting in the Yanzhang and Xieguo areas continues. A certain unit of the Chinese army has been besieging Zhangdian (southeast of Anyi) and Ershililing (south of Jiexian), launching fierce attacks for days. The Japanese army is exhausted.

### Japanese Troops Invading South along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Make No Progress

Dongxiang - The Chinese army units that crossed the Fu River southeast of Nanchang are making very smooth progress. Currently, a unit has advanced to the vicinity of Yaotouwan (three kilometers southeast of Liantang) and is pressing towards Liantang. (Dispatch from the 17th)

(Hong Kong) Xiangdian: Xue Yue discussed the future of the Hunan-Jiangxi war situation yesterday, saying that the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi has been continuously attacked from the front and rear near Gao'an and Wuning, so they cannot advance beyond Xiushui. In recent days, the Japanese troops on all routes have stopped attacking, reduced the battlefield, and built fortifications in various strongholds to hold on. A portion of their main force is moving north. According to my observation, this temporary lull is actually a time for the Japanese army to reconsider a major invasion. We must pay close attention to its changes and strike at the Japanese in any situation. (Special dispatch from the 17th)

Dongxiang - The Japanese troops invading south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang have been fiercely blocked by the Chinese army.

### Japanese Claim to Have Occupied Jiaji

(Tokyo) Officials here claim that the Japanese army's Hedo Detachment completely occupied Jiaji, the second largest commercial city on Hainan Island, at 5:30 PM on Saturday. It is reported that the city is a Chinese military base of operations and is strategically important. According to a telegram from the Haikou battlefield, the Chinese army set fire to the houses in Jiaji before the Japanese army advanced, and retreated south. According to Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, one-third of Jiaji was burned down after the Chinese army set the fire. The Hedo Detachment pursued the retreating Chinese army and occupied Lehui, twenty kilometers southeast of Jiaji, at 11:40 AM yesterday. At the same time, the Japanese Navy's Ota Detachment landed at a point on the northeastern coast of the island on Sunday morning and advanced towards Lehui. It is reported that they have made contact with the Hedo Detachment in Lehui. Lehui has a population of 2,600. According to the Japanese side, the city is a base of operations for Chinese communists.

### Japanese Warships in the Min River Estuary Bomb Xiaocheng

(Fuzhou) Three Japanese warships in the Min River Estuary sailed to Xiaocheng, Lianjiang (120 li east of Yunjiang) at 12:00 AM and bombarded the Chinese army's positions.

### Central Government Reorganizes Xikang's Monetary System

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Xikang is now being built as a Chinese province, and its politics are gradually getting on track. However, its monetary system seems to be still chaotic and has not been affected by the 1935 Chinese legal tender reform. This is because China's land is too vast, and the implementation of new policies cannot but take some time. It is said that within Xikang Province, legal tender seems to be still a new arrival from outside, and the people are generally curious about it. At present, the currencies in general circulation in Xikang Province include legal tender, silver coins, Tibetan coins, Tibetan banknotes, nickel coins, and also copper coins. However, in open areas, the implementation of legal tender is very widespread, and the central government has also absorbed a lot of silver coins and Tibetan coins here, in accordance with the principle of state ownership of silver. The current difficulty in Xikang's monetary system lies in the large number of Tibetan banknotes, and it is difficult to find a way to absorb them in a short time. It is said that some of these Tibetan banknotes were issued by the Tibetan government, and some were issued by the Sichuan government. The forms are inconsistent and the reserves are lacking. As for Tibetan coins, they are silver coins, with a percentage of 70% silver and 30% copper. The central government is gradually absorbing them with legal tender as consideration.

### US Fleet Concentrates in the Pacific, Said to Prevent Japan from Coveting Hong Kong. Pittman Reissues Powerful Remarks to Boycott Japanese Goods and Make Them Respect Treaties.

(Washington) U.S. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman praised President Roosevelt's plan for world peace yesterday and predicted that "any dictator or any dictatorial government" would inevitably perish. In addition, Pittman asked the United States to take strict measures against Japan to force it to respect U.S. interests in the Far East. Pittman's remarks last night were broadcast nationwide by radio. Pittman argued that the "cash and carry" clause stipulated in the current Neutrality Act must be strictly observed so as not to be involved in the whirlpool of a second world war. "But in the current environment, authorize the president to impose restrictions on trade with Japan, in order to force Japan to stop its destruction of international treaties, or at least require Japan to provide guarantees to end its destruction of treaties in a reasonable period of time." It is noteworthy that Pittman has made remarks advocating sanctions against Japan in order to make it respect U.S. interests in the Far East twice within a week. Secondly, Pittman is often a spokesman for the U.S. government's foreign policy. Thirdly, Pittman's remarks this time were made at the same time as the U.S. Navy's recall to the Pacific. According to Pittman yesterday, "Since the beginning of history, dictators have appeared repeatedly, but they have all perished quickly." Therefore, according to Pittman's prediction, the fate of the current dictators will not be long. (Associated Press dispatch from the 17th)

(Washington) According to Democratic Senator William King today, the sudden return of the U.S. Navy to the Pacific is aimed at preventing Japan from coveting the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies when the European situation is tense. The meaning of the U.S. fleet's move is "to warn Japan that the U.S. is still a powerful country in the Pacific. If Japan takes any further action, it will inevitably clash with us." "Informed sources here cannot say whether Japan has plans to expand the war zone, but they all regard the Sino-Japanese War as a "political volcano." The majority of authorities believe that Japan's second target of attack is Hong Kong, but the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific can make Japan restrain its ambitions and dare not launch lightly. (Associated Press dispatch from the 17th)

(London) The Times' Washington dispatch, discussing the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific, said that the U.S. naval authorities, when planning, considered the impact of this move on the strategically important distribution in the history of the world's fleets, and the transportation of important military supplies, such as rubber and tin, to the United States. This decision has prevented the U.S. fleet from realizing its plan to participate in the official opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair. In the future, after the ships that are transferred pass through the Panama Canal, 270 of the 357 U.S. battleships will be distributed in the Pacific. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)

(Tokyo) President Roosevelt's telegram to the two dictators in Europe and U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson's order to transfer 64 warships from the Atlantic back to the Pacific have greatly surprised the naval circles here. They believe that Japan-U.S. relations have recently improved and there is no need for this move. The general public also believes that at a time when the European situation is tense, the U.S. fleet needs to be stationed entirely in the Atlantic. It is not known why it is being transferred back to the Pacific. Japanese newspapers have not criticized the recent actions of the United States. The Navy Ministry is currently unwilling to make any comments hastily. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)

### China and Germany Sign Trade Agreement

### Hitler to Respond to Roosevelt's Proposal on the 28th; Summons Parliament to Issue Declaration on That Day After Extensive Consideration with Mussolini

(Berlin) The government has just released a bulletin stating, "Fuehrer Hitler has received a telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt, requesting a clear stance on certain matters. The Fuehrer is taking this very seriously and has decided to summon the Reichstag to convene on the 28th of this month and issue a declaration on behalf of the German nation in response to President Roosevelt." (Havas, 17th)

(Berlin) According to impressions from political circles, Hitler may offer some answers to President Roosevelt, not ending the matter with an absolute "no." Instead, he might attribute the responsibility for the current international situation to the Soviet Union and various democracies. (Reuters, 17th)

(Berlin) Diplomatic circles here recently announced that, prior to deciding to convene the Reichstag on the 28th of this month, Fuehrer Hitler had informed the Italian government. When the Reichstag convenes, the attitude expressed by Fuehrer Hitler will undoubtedly be fully endorsed by Italy. Generally speaking, the nature of the Fuehrer's declaration in response to President Roosevelt's telegram, while negative, may not be as extreme as generally anticipated. In other words, on issues such as colonies, raw material supply, and the development of German overseas trade, the door to negotiations may not be completely shut. However, Roosevelt's accusation that the totalitarian states intend to invade other countries will be denied. Hitler will declare that he has proposed arms limitations and will ultimately criticize the encirclement policy of Western European countries. He will also deny President Roosevelt's right to interfere in European affairs. The content of the declaration is complex and significant, and the speech is expected to last three hours. At that time, it will be broadcast nationwide by various radio stations. (Havas, 17th)

Munich Fuehrer Hitler met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for one and a half hours this afternoon to discuss U.S. President Roosevelt's telegram and Hitler's reply. After exchanging views with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the reply will be sent. The content of the reply is said to be clear and understandable. It is not yet known whether it will be sent before the Fuehrer's 50th birthday on the 20th of this month. (Havas, 16th)

(Berlin) Hitler is not in a hurry to reply to President Roosevelt's appeal for peace. This afternoon, he held a discussion with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich for about two hours and maintained close contact with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini throughout the day. It is reported that Hitler also spoke with General Goering, who is currently in Rome, on the phone for a long time. (Reuters, 16th)

(Rome) German Aviation Minister General Goering visited Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia this afternoon for a lengthy discussion. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. It is reported that the discussion focused on President Roosevelt's telegram. Another report states that General Goering discussed important issues directly related to Italy and Germany with the Prime Minister and is scheduled to return to Berlin tomorrow afternoon. (Havas, 16th)

(London) The Daily Telegraph's Washington dispatch states that President Roosevelt's appeal to the German and Italian authorities is supported by people across the United States. A small number of American writers, who have long believed that negotiations with dictators are futile, are now denouncing the President's "appeasement policy." Others accuse the President of interfering in matters unrelated to the United States. However, the general response from newspapers and Congress, as well as letters and telegrams received by the White House, all express agreement with the President. Therefore, the authorities are greatly pleased to see this expression of national support for abandoning isolationism. Senator Nye, who participated in the original draft of the U.S. Neutrality Act, recently stated, "It is refreshing to see this effort made at this time." Although news from Rome and Berlin is not very promising, the U.S. authorities are not discouraged because they know that a positive response is unlikely in the short term. However, they hope that after repeated consideration, the dictators will not completely close the door. The U.S. authorities also believe that even if this action is ineffective, it is still a necessary move so that there can be no doubt as to who is responsible if a global catastrophe occurs.

### Roosevelt's Appeal for Peace Receives Endorsement from Various Countries; Will Germany and Italy Willingly Be the Leaders of War? The President's Telegram Is a Touchstone.

(Moscow) Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, stating, "I have read your lofty counsel to the governments of Germany and Italy with great admiration and sympathy. The people of the Soviet Socialist Federation, who faithfully and sincerely desire to safeguard peace, wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support your initiative." (TASS, 16th)

(Washington) Regarding President Roosevelt's telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the State Department has received many replies from various countries. All Latin American countries, except Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, and Paraguay, have sent replies expressing their support. The Canadian government has also sent a telegram expressing admiration. Brazilian President Vargas telegraphed President Roosevelt, stating, "Your actions are worthy of the leader of the American continent. Your words have resonated in our country. I hereby send this telegram on behalf of my government to offer congratulations." At the same time, Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha told U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Scott, "President Roosevelt's telegram completely matches the views and desires of the Brazilian government and people. Therefore, the entire nation expresses its support." Cuban President Bru sent a telegram stating, "After reading it, our government is filled with admiration. Your Excellency, the President, is indeed worthy of being a renowned statesman. I hereby represent the people of the nation to publicly express the solidarity between our two countries." Mexican Foreign Minister Hay told U.S. Ambassador Daniels, "This telegram is worthy of being written by a great man. Our President Cárdenas has unlimited sympathy for President Roosevelt's outstanding sentiments." Peruvian President Benavides telegraphed, stating, "Your Excellency's aspirations are in complete agreement with our country." Uruguayan Foreign Minister Espalter telegraphed, stating, "I have been ordered by our President Terra to send this telegram to offer congratulations. In these days of extreme international crisis, Your Excellency's call will undoubtedly win the sympathy of the world." Chilean Foreign Minister Ortega telegraphed, stating, "On behalf of President Aguirre, I respectfully extend my congratulations to Your Excellency. Your telegram has made a deep impression in our country." (Havas, 17th)

### Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin Arrive in Canada and Highly Praise Roosevelt

St. John, Canada Former British Prime Minister Lord Baldwin and his wife arrived here yesterday aboard the "Duchess of York" mail ship. They immediately made a statement to the press, saying that U.S. President Roosevelt's recent telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was a courageous move by a great statesman, and I sincerely hope for its success. "It takes great courage to do something that is known to be impossible, even at the risk of failure. Because of its superior geographical and historical position, the United States is uniquely able to deal with European political affairs in an objective manner without bias. The only country that can launch a large-scale peace movement at this time is Italy alone." When a reporter asked whether Canada would participate in a world war if one were to occur in the future, Baldwin immediately replied, "There is no doubt that each part of the British Empire will fulfill its responsibilities." (Havas, 17th)

### Hitler Reviews Troops in Austria

(Vienna) Fuehrer Hitler arrived in St. Pölten, southern Austria, from Munich this morning. After being welcomed by Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch, he accompanied him to inspect the stationed troops and observe exercises. Responsible officials here stated that Fuehrer Hitler's trip had been planned long ago and was intended to inspect the extent to which the troops stationed in Austria were prepared. (Havas, 17th)

### Insightful Views from British and American Newspapers on the Value of Roosevelt's Telegram

(London) The majority opinion of British newspaper commentators is that President Roosevelt's gesture towards Germany and Italy, even if it does not elicit a satisfactory response from them, still has great value. Judging from the uneasy news from Munich, it is clear that Germany may not rudely reject the U.S. President's peace proposal. At the same time, negotiations to bring various countries into the European defense system are making significant progress and will become increasingly developed in the new atmosphere created by the U.S. President. The Daily Telegraph stated that the U.S. President's appeal, whether it receives a satisfactory response or not, will definitely have a significant effect on the course of events. President Roosevelt, seeing the impending catastrophe, made this appeal. Even if it fails to avert the global catastrophe, it has made an invaluable contribution to world civilization by focusing world opinion on the sordid realities of the current crisis. The News Chronicle stated that the United States has immediately changed the situation with its legitimate action of intervening in international affairs. After this telegram is sent, the situation will either improve or rapidly deteriorate; it cannot remain as it was. The Daily Herald stated that every British family, upon seeing this appeal, is filled with admiration for President Roosevelt, regarding him as one of their own leaders. What did not exist a month ago is now gradually emerging, namely, a grand alliance against aggression. If the dictators underestimate the force of the united defense that they have created, they will make a grave mistake that they will regret because this force is sufficient to extinguish the dictators. The U.S. President's telegram is tantamount to saying that if Germany and Italy insist on waging war against the world, then dozens of countries around the world, including the United States, will rise up to resist them. The Manchester Guardian stated that the U.S. President may not expect Germany and Italy to accept his appeal and added that the obstacles that Britain is currently creating, if assisted by all parties, can definitely prevent dictators from lightly starting a war. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) The Times stated that the biggest question for the German and Italian people is whether they have the power to move their leaders with their urgent aspirations, which are no less than those of other nations. British policy has never precluded peaceful discussion, but it is determined to cultivate its strength to achieve the goal of peaceful discussion, which is gradually becoming easier and moving forward. Today, it has reached the stage where Britain and President Roosevelt have jointly declared that their advocacy of peace does not stem from fear or cowardice. In the past few weeks, Britain has undertaken arduous obligations in Europe and is aware of the heavy responsibilities it bears, but it has never complained. Today, the tension in the situation has temporarily eased as a result, giving President Roosevelt the opportunity to appeal for peace, and this statement is not entirely unreasonable. In fact, the British character often resonates with American public opinion, namely, strength and courage. Both Britain and the United States possess this character. After President Roosevelt's telegram was issued, the British government quickly welcomed it, and almost everyone here is in sympathy with the government. The Daily Mail stated that if we relax our defenses because we believe that the German and Italian responses will be satisfactory, then nothing could be more destructive to President Roosevelt's purpose. The U.S. President's appeal may cause the dictators to pause, but it may not cause them to abandon the politics of force. If this goal is to be achieved, there is no other way than through the armed forces of the democracies. (Reuters, 17th)

(New York) President Roosevelt's telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is being praised by newspapers here. It is generally said that Hitler and Mussolini may not give satisfactory replies, but the resistance policies of Britain and France can thus be strengthened. The New York Times wrote, "Even if the President's actions do not achieve the desired results, they should not be regarded as a failure, because the President's intention is to point out who the aggressor is before the outbreak of war so that world public opinion will sympathize with the victim." President’s actions, kill two birds with one stone. The New York Post stated that the President's telegram has three effects: one, it points out the policies pursued by the recipients of the telegram; two, it provides diplomatic support for the alliance between Britain and France; and three, it warns the Rome-Berlin axis. (Havas, 17th)

### Turmoil in the Mediterranean; Thirteen French Warships Arrive at the Gibraltar Naval Base; British Troops Reinforce Egypt and Other Places; Spanish Troops Scheduled to Enter Madrid

(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent states that Britain is closely monitoring developments in the Mediterranean and Spain in conjunction with France. The transfer of British troops from Palestine to Egypt and the dispatch of the Welsh Guards to Gibraltar are all signs of Britain's preparations for contingencies. There is confirmed evidence that a large number of German weapons have recently been transported to naval bases and airfields on the northwestern coast of Spain, and reports of Italian troop movements in Spain are also being closely studied by the British authorities. It is particularly questionable when the Italian troops will hold their triumphal march into Madrid. It was initially heard that it would be held on April 20, then changed to May 2, and now postponed to May 15. The repeated postponements are clearly viewed with great dissatisfaction by the British government. (Reuters, 17th)

Gibraltar After two French battleships arrived in the port yesterday, three more cruisers, namely the Marseillaise, the La Galissonnière, and the Jean de Vienne, and six destroyers, namely the Volta, the Mogador, the Audacieux, the Ouragan, the Le Hardi, and the Simoun, under the respective command of French Vice-Admiral Marquis and Rear-Admiral Lacroix, arrived one after another today.

Gibraltar Among the two French destroyers, one called Le Terrible is the fastest destroyer in the world, having reached a speed of 45.25 knots during sea trials. (Reuters, 16th)

Gibraltar The number of French warships, large and small, that arrived at this port yesterday and today totaled thirteen.

The two destroyers Volta and Mogador each have a tonnage of 2,880 tons and a range of 5,000 kilometers. All of these destroyers are very fast, especially the Foudroyant, which has an average speed of 45 knots per hour. (Havas, 17th)

(London) According to news from the international neutral zone of Tangier this morning, approximately 12,000 Spanish troops are concentrated in the vicinity of the border, reportedly preparing to proceed to Spanish Morocco. Residents of Tangier are uneasy about the concentration of a large number of Spanish troops. (Haitong, 17th)

Madrid Official sources here have announced that the Nationalist Army is scheduled to triumphantly enter the city on May 15. The participating units include approximately 150,000 soldiers from the domestic army and air force, as well as foreign troops. Generalissimo Franco will deliver an important speech at that time. Afterwards, the foreign troops will be evacuated through the ports of Cadiz and Almeria, while the domestic troops will be demobilized gradually starting in the second half of May. (Havas, 17th)

Seville General Franco, accompanied by his staff, arrived here yesterday from Burgos. Security was very tight along the way, and the visit was not announced in advance. Today, the first victory parade after the end of the Spanish Civil War will be held, with the participation of 50,000 troops. Yesterday's agricultural celebrations included special religious processions and a grand bullfight. (Reuters, 17th)

Vatican City Today, the Pope delivered a broadcast speech in Spanish, praising the noble courage of the Spanish people and congratulating their leaders on their steadfast defense of Christian civilization and their victory over communism and atheism. He also appealed to the leaders to be magnanimous in the reconstruction of the nation and not to engage in recriminations, as many members of the Republican government were misled by propaganda.

### Expanded British-Soviet Negotiations; Soviet Ambassador to Return Home for Instructions; French Negotiations with Russia and Turkey Also Active

(Paris) After U.S. President Roosevelt telegraphed German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the general public is closely watching the consequences. The efforts of the British and French governments to organize a collective security system are not being relaxed as a result, and they are still actively negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey today, hoping that these countries will join. It is reported that this goal can be achieved within a short period of time. Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Turkish Ambassador Menemencioglu this afternoon, and it is reported that the talks have made good progress. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also met with British Ambassador Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires Payart this afternoon. It is reported that the negotiations have entered the decisive stage. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to hold important talks with Soviet Ambassador Suritz tomorrow. The frequency of contacts between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey is evident from this. (Havas, 16th)

(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with Foreign Office Undersecretary Sir Alexander Cadogan this morning and is scheduled to return to Moscow this afternoon or tomorrow to inform his government of the British authorities' views in detail so that British Ambassador Seeds' contacts with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will be further enhanced. According to informed sources in political circles here, the two countries originally intended to conclude a Sky Agreement, but now they will expand its scope. There are three reasons for this: (1) Britain has provided guarantees to Poland and Romania and will provide a guarantee to Turkey in the near future. All of these actions directly benefit the security of the Soviet Union's western border, so it is difficult to ask the Soviet Union to provide guarantees to Romania. It is reported that the Soviet government has verbally agreed to do so. (2) Britain and the Soviet Union have agreed on a general mutual assistance agreement, the nature of which is similar to a military alliance treaty, which may be announced this week. (3) Efforts should be made to concretize the existing Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. The two sides are currently holding technical talks, and the British government has been informed of the progress at all times. (Havas, 17th)

(Moscow) Foreign Minister Litvinov met with British Ambassador Seeds this afternoon for half an hour. British and Soviet officials have refused to disclose the content of the talks. (Havas, 16th)

### Multiple German Aircraft Invade Polish Airspace; Polish Authorities Prepare to Shoot Them Down

(London) According to reliable sources, for several days, multiple German aircraft have flown into Polish airspace along the border of the country, especially the border of Pomerania Province. In addition to protesting to Germany, the Polish government has instructed the border defense authorities to open fire with anti-aircraft guns if similar incidents occur. So far, no incidents have occurred. (Havas, 16th)

(Berlin) Regarding the proposals made by the German government to Poland, Polish Ambassador Lipski returned to his country on the 14th of this month for instructions and has since returned to his post but has not yet held talks with German diplomatic authorities. Political circles here are surprised by this. The Polish Embassy states that Poland's views were communicated to the German government more than a month ago, before Polish Foreign Minister Beck consulted with Britain, so there is no need to explain them again. German Ambassador to Poland Moltke is currently on vacation in Silesia Province and may return home on the 20th of this month, the birthday of Fuehrer Hitler, to offer congratulations and discuss relations between Germany and Poland. (Havas, 17th)

### Polish Foreign Minister Meets with Romanian Foreign Minister; Talks in Car for One and a Half Hours

Kraków, Poland Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who is on his way to consult with Germany, passed through here at 11:00 this morning. Foreign Minister Beck specially rushed over from Warsaw to meet him and accompanied him to the city of Katowice. The important talks took place during this one-and-a-half-hour journey. It is reported that the discussion focused on what attitude Poland and Romania should take towards the Soviet Union when Britain, France, and the Soviet Union establish a mutual assistance pact (note that France and the Soviet Union have already signed a mutual assistance agreement). Polish officials originally opposed the idea of Soviet troops passing through Polish territory, but now they are relatively flexible. That is, if a war breaks out in Europe in the future, and Poland and the Soviet Union are on the same side against Germany, and if the Soviet Union provides assistance to Western European countries, then Poland will allow Soviet aircraft to fly into its airspace.

Warsaw Foreign Minister Beck held talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu on the train between Kraków and Katowice for an hour and a half. After arriving in Katowice, he said goodbye to Foreign Minister Gafencu. This matter is highly valued by political circles here, who believe that these talks must have a major relationship with Poland and Romania conducting negotiations with Hungary in the future. In addition, Foreign Minister Beck met with Governor Grażyński of Upper Silesia in Katowice to hear a report on the issues between Germans and Poles in the province. This is also valued by political circles because Germany regards Grażyński as the mortal enemy of the Third Reich. His policies towards the German population in Upper Silesia often conflict with the policies of the Polish government. (Havas, 17th)

### US Warship Returns Saito's Ashes, Japanese Overwhelmed with Gratitude

(Tokyo) The American warship USS Astoria, carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, arrived in Yokohama at 8:10 AM today. A squadron of Japanese destroyers escorted it into port, all ships flying flags at half-mast. The USS Astoria and a Japanese destroyer exchanged a 21-gun salute. 15,000 people welcomed the ship. A special train transported the ashes to Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to bury the ashes tomorrow according to Buddhist rites. The Emperor today sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, expressing gratitude for the American warship's gesture. (Reuters, 17th)

(Tokyo) The Japanese newspapers have paid far more attention to the USS Astoria's return of Ambassador Saito's ashes than to President Roosevelt's appeal or the dispatch of 64 American warships to the Pacific. Many newspapers' editorials welcomed the American warship's arrival this morning. The Jiji Shinpo newspaper group praised the warship's carrying of the ashes as the "posthumous diplomatic achievement" of the late ambassador in promoting Japanese-American friendship. The newspapers also emphasized the special honor given to the late ambassador by President Roosevelt and expressed hope that the officers and crew of the USS Astoria would carry back with them the Japanese people's respect and memory of America. The Jiji Shinpo editorial earnestly hoped that the Pacific would live up to its name and achieve lasting peace, with the national fortunes of Japan and the United States thriving day by day, each shouldering a part of the responsibility for maintaining world peace. The Kokumin Shimbun editorial stated that President Roosevelt's appeal to Hitler and Mussolini was at best only a "telegram war" and would not greatly affect the overall world situation. The newspaper observed that President Roosevelt's involvement in the Chinese situation contradicted his own policies if he refused to recognize the already established facts in East Asia.

### Ireland Desires to Maintain Neutrality

Dublin: The President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic, Eamon de Valera, delivered a speech in Ennis this afternoon, expressing agreement with the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt yesterday. However, he stated that in the current situation, it seemed that only the power of God could prevent war in Europe. Under such circumstances, the Republican government should strive to maintain a neutral position to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Finally, he advocated that the issue of the unification and independence of Northern and Southern Ireland should be resolved in a friendly manner. He said, "Today, all countries are actively preparing for war, and all concepts of international law and justice have been put aside. 'The era of international agreements, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, has passed. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide do not want to kill each other and firmly believe that they should not. Is it too late to ask all the countries concerned, namely those that will inevitably participate in the war in the future, to hold a meeting before the outbreak of war in order to turn swords into ploughshares? President Roosevelt spoke out of righteousness and asked all countries to provide guarantees of non-aggression. Would the world refuse him? Once war breaks out, even neutral countries will inevitably suffer as collateral damage. The experiences of the Netherlands and Switzerland during the European War are clear evidence of this. Thinking of this, how can we not be filled with sorrow? As far as the purpose of the Irish Republic is concerned, as solemnly declared in our constitution, what we seek is that all rights be recognized by others through peaceful means, that our good intentions be understood by others, so that our country will not suffer aggression. In a nutshell." (Havas, 16th)

### Africa's Only Independent Black Nation Requests British and French Protection

(London) Responsible figures here have announced that Liberia, West Africa, the only surviving black republic in Africa, has proposed to the British and French representatives during the past week the signing of military alliance treaties with their respective countries to guarantee its independence. This would mean that in the event of an invasion by any great power, especially Germany, Britain and France would send naval and air forces to provide assistance. British figures believe that, with such an arrangement, Liberia would in effect become a joint protectorate of Britain and France. Regarding this matter, French Ambassador Corbin reportedly met with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, this morning to discuss a proposed response. Diplomatic circles here believe that Liberia's strategic position is extremely important, and that Britain and France should accept the country's request, but only on the condition that the United States agrees. Liberia has a population of approximately 1.5 million, all descendants of African Americans from the state of Maryland. It was formerly under American protection. Therefore, Britain and France have already notified the US government of Liberia's proposal. (Havas, 17th)

### Chinese Officials Deny British Ambassador Carries Peace Terms; Kong Xiangxi Says Japan is in a Difficult Position, China Has Gained a Stable and Strong Position

(Chongqing) Chinese officials here are strenuously denying the possibility of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese war. It is said that the British Ambassador's trip to Chongqing is purely routine. An official spokesperson stated, "We are completely unaware of rumors that the British Ambassador is carrying Japanese peace terms." At the same time, Dr. Kong Xiangxi reiterated the failure of British, German, and Italian mediation after the fall of Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Hankou. He said, "We are currently not interested in any terms from the Japanese side. Our determination to resist to the end has put the Japanese in a difficult position. The Japanese army spent four months reorganizing four divisions for the attack on Nanchang. Currently, the Japanese army is clearly exhausted and unable to continue advancing. Because the Japanese army is bogged down, they have had to request British mediation. In fact, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has informed Sir Frederick Maze of Japan's desire for peace, asking him to convey it to the Chinese authorities to gauge China's opinion. Since we were unwilling to make peace after the fall of Nanjing and Wuhan, we are even less willing to seek peace with the Japanese now. We have gained a stable and stronger 'position', both politically and militarily." Zhang Qun declared, "China's strength to resist the war has become increasingly strong. We have now begun a counter-offensive. As of yet, we have not launched a large-scale attack, but we have recovered many important points. During this counter-offensive, we have learned the true strength of the Japanese army. Therefore, we are about to launch a full-scale counter-offensive. The Japanese army deeply understands the above points, which is why they have become panicked and ultimately asked a third party to mediate. Although we do not yet know the content of the Japanese terms, they must be more lenient than before. In any case, we are fighting for independence and liberation. We vow to resist to the end."

### Certain Party Intends to Undermine Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation, Distributes Absurd and Fallacious Leaflets

(Chongqing) A Reuters reporter here recently inquired about a leaflet found in Shanghai, falsely issued in the name of the Communist Party, stating that Britain and France are enemies of the Chinese people, urging Chinese merchants to boycott British and French businesses, and stating that if the Kuomintang does not adopt an anti-British and French stance, the Chinese Communist Party will sever relations with the Kuomintang. According to the Chinese Communist Party in Chongqing, they have not done any such thing. The spokesperson of the party stated that the leaflets were clearly issued by a certain party with the intention of undermining the united relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

### Chinese Troops Increase Offensive on Kaifeng, Japanese Garrison Extremely Panicked, Chinese Morale and Popular Sentiment are High

The Continental News reported that, according to a foreign observer who had just arrived from Kaifeng, the capital of Henan province, yesterday (the 16th), the Japanese troops are constantly sending reinforcements to Kaifeng by train. In the coming weeks, the Chinese army's offensive strategy against the Kaifeng area will definitely be greatly strengthened. The 20th Division of the Chinese Third Army, with light military equipment, light machine guns, and light artillery units, has attacked Kaifeng, causing extreme panic among the Japanese garrison. When the Chinese army approached closer, the Japanese army closed the gates of Kaifeng. The observer expressed doubt about the Chinese army's attempt to completely recapture Kaifeng, as they believed that the Chinese army's policy was mostly to harass the Japanese army in various areas as much as possible. The observer also stated that the Chinese morale and popular sentiment are high, and everyone is talking about continuing the war until the Japanese army is defeated. Regarding the report that six senior puppets were killed in Kaifeng on Easter Sunday, the observer could not report much. Although they were in Kaifeng at the time, they had not heard direct news about this matter. They learned of it several days later from a wireless telegram issued by London. However, there were rumors that certain people who worked with the Japanese had been assassinated. When these foreigners left the Kaifeng area last week, the Longhai Railway had not been cut off. Although the Chinese army threatened to cut off this road, the observer believed that since the Japanese army had heavily defended it, it would not be easy to dismantle the rails on a large scale in that section.

### Guerrilla Unit Attacks Huai'an in Northern Jiangsu; Men and Women of Funing Massacred and Raped

Taixian Correspondence: A guerrilla unit of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu ambushed the Japanese near the west gate of Huai'an on the 10th. Each member produced a handgun, killing all four Japanese guards. The Japanese army inside the city was panicked, often keeping the city gates tightly closed, preventing the Chinese army from entering. As such, they returned to their defenses. When the Japanese army first arrived in Funing, they implemented a appeasement policy, hoping to lure the civilians back to the city. However, the civilians remained watching from the villages. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army went to the villages near the outer walls of the city, conducting large-scale searches. Their beastly nature erupted, looting, raping, and burning. In Yang Zhai Kou, west of Funing, sixty to seventy women were raped, and forty to fifty strong men were shot. In the six settlements east of the city, they set fires and killed, and drove hundreds of women. Once [blank] [blank], they even used machine guns to sweep behind them, forcing women and children to jump into the sea of fire. For a time, the cries were tragic.

The Jiangsu Provincial Government commended County Magistrate Wang of Pixian for leading his troops in a continuous counter-offensive, resulting in frequent fierce battles, and having recovered Picheng twice. A special telegram was sent to County Magistrate Wang yesterday to commend and reward the troops with one thousand yuan to show encouragement.

### General Overview of China's Film Education Conducted by the Ministry of Education in Recent Years (Part 2)

In 1936, the Ministry of Education stipulated a plan to equip educational films. In the "Types of Films to be Produced," they were divided into seven types: (1) Dramatic films related to national consciousness, revolutionary history, and the New Life Movement. (2) Teaching materials and teaching methods for primary and secondary schools. (3) Common science knowledge films. (4) Special national crisis education films. (5) Hygiene films (divided into children, adults, and public). (6) Chinese new and old industries that have special characteristics and are related to daily life. (7) Rural life. "A quantity distribution was made." In 1936, it was stipulated that 60 films be produced, allocated as follows: 10 for the first type, 15 each for the second and third types, and 5 each for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh types.

In 1937, the Ministry of Education's plan to equip educational films decided to produce and purchase 200 films, and formulated production goals and classification quantities: (A) "Production Goals": (1) Promote national consciousness. (2) Promote the New Life Movement. (3) Instill national defense knowledge (including physical education, military training, and scientific knowledge). (4) Promote national economic construction. (5) Impart knowledge of life. (6) Assist school education. (B) "Film Classification": (1) Teaching films (for school use), a total of 100 films: (a) Early childhood education and early childhood students, 10 films. (b) Primary schools, 10 films. (c) Secondary schools, 40 films. (d) Teaching methods, 10 films. (2) Cultural films (for general use), a total of 100 films: (a) Language and writing education, 5 films. (b) Political and civic education, 25 films. (c) Livelihood education, 25 films. (d) Health education, 25 films. (e) Family education, 5 films. (f) Art education, 10 films. (g) Teaching implementation institutions and methods, 10 films. (3) The Ministry of Education is now more actively utilizing existing educational films to mobilize the national population and strengthen the power to resist the war. In addition to producing them independently, more than a dozen types have been purchased, totaling 140 films, which can be divided into six categories: 38 types of promoting national consciousness (films related to the war of resistance are all included in this category), 16 types of increasing knowledge of life, 11 types of instilling scientific knowledge, 34 types of imparting production skills, 16 types of assisting school education, and 25 other types related to geography, scenery, and entertainment. Recently, when formulating the 1939 film education administrative plan, the Ministry of Education stipulated that in addition to continuing to shorten and print anti-war films this year, it plans to entrust well-equipped academic institutions to produce educational films related to the geography, history, customs, and recent construction of the southwest and northwest provinces, and plans to start producing lantern slides related to history, geography, civics, and biographies of modern Chinese figures from this year.

As for the Ministry of Education's implementation of the Six-Year Plan to train such technical personnel, it was stipulated that a training class would be opened every year from 1936, and the number of students would increase year by year. It was stipulated that there would be 92 students in 1936, 160 students in 1937, 400 students in 1938, 450 students each in 1939 and 1940, and 460 students in 1941. It is estimated that more than 2,000 students can be trained in six years, which is sufficient for the addition of educational districts in each province every year. In September 1936, the Ministry of Education opened the first training class for electro-optical education personnel in Nanjing (divided into film education and broadcasting education groups). A total of 92 students were sent by 25 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Beijing, Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai to receive training. Currently, most of the people in charge of electro-optical education in various provinces and cities are graduates of this program. The Ministry of Education subsequently continued to run this class in Nanjing in July 1937, with a special electro-optical group and 110 students from various provinces and cities. After the Ministry of Education moved west, it continued to run the third training class in Chongqing in July 1938, with 66 students from various provinces and cities, of which 37 belonged to the electro-optical group. Although the number of institutions sending students for this session was less than before due to the war, the number of students sent by Yunnan, Guizhou, Kang, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces was particularly high. Therefore, the development of the electro-optical education industry in these provinces in the future will not be inferior to that of the southeastern provinces. (End)

### Miscellaneous Hankou's Recent Commodity Prices After the fall of Wuhan, commodity prices in the concessions soared. Recently, they have fallen slightly. Now, we select the highest and latest prices of several daily necessities and list them below to understand the general level of life: Commodity Name Highest Price Recent Price Coal ball per load Sixteen yuan Four yuan plus Rice Per Load Twenty-six yuan Fourteen yuan and fifty cents Oil Per catty One yuan and thirty cents Ninety-six cents Salt Per catty More than one yuan Between seventy and eighty cents Matches Per box Five cents One and a half to two cents The exchange rate between Hankou and Shanghai is eleven or twelve yuan for every hundred yuan (that is, if Shanghai receives 100 yuan in legal tender, Hankou should pay 111 or 112 yuan in legal tender). North-South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Sells Actively in the North Sichuan pickled mustard tuber has recently been in short supply, and the market is quite stable. Recently, sales have been more active in the northern market, with 100 to 200 jars of Fuling mustard tuber being sold at 85 yuan, followed by 83 to 84 yuan. High-end Leqi mustard tuber sells for 90 yuan. As the weather gradually gets hotter, demand will inevitably increase, and there may be a possibility of further tightening. Yarn Flower European Situation is Critical The Yarn Market is Booming —20 Count Double Horse Breaks Through 400 Yuan Barrier— The yarn market is trending strong, and the price increase is particularly fierce. This is because the demand for 20-count Double Horse yarn is strong in South China, and purchases are very active. At the same time, there is a rumor that the situation in Europe is tense, which is greatly beneficial to yarn prices. Once something happens, foreign cotton will be difficult to arrive in Shanghai, so a buying frenzy has been set off, and the market is trending higher and higher. Therefore, since the straight drop began from the red board, 20-count Double Horse yarn jumped 8 yuan yesterday, breaking through the 400 yuan barrier. The afternoon price was 403 yuan, the highest price since February 25th. In terms of this battle line, it is deeply feared that it will rise above the red board. The underground market has reached 407 yuan. If it rises above this price, there may be a new attitude, with the possibility of reaching beyond 410 yuan. However, the 20-count yarn in the middle rises with the market, but the speed is slower. In fact, there are fewer speculators, and the public tends to favor popular goods. Double Horse yarn goes in and out suddenly, and it is regarded as a standard because its rise and fall are sensitive. Current yarn situation: The market opened vigorously in the early morning, and the situation was tight, partly because a certain firm from Guangdong was collecting in the market, and partly because the situation in Europe was pressing. Generally wealthy people came to absorb it again, so both sides advanced side by side, and the market price became more and more expensive. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was full of vigor, and it was made to 400 yuan, mostly because business was booming. When the market opened in the afternoon, buyers gathered and suddenly jumped 3 yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 403 yuan. Business from the Yunnan firm was relatively strong, and colleagues pushed and raised it particularly fiercely, so the price increase was recognized again. It was found that the total purchase of each firm throughout the day was 2,720 bales. The market price of 20-count Tiannv Double Horse yarn alone rose 7 to 8 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose 5 to 6 yuan. Yesterday, 620 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou. The amount purchased by each firm is listed on the left: Shantou 505 Mainland 115 Colleagues 840 Wenzhou 10 (Tianjin) 85 (Hong Kong) 580 Yunnan 520 Fuzhou 20 The Japanese yarn market was relatively calm, and the price increase had been fought. This is because business in the guerrilla areas has recently decreased slightly, and shipments in the north have decreased, so the buying price is average. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month is 361 yuan, but the spot price is still holding up. Yarn Prices Soar Foreign Cotton Trading is Particularly Strong Domestic Cotton Selling Prices are Relaxed The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was affected by the speech of US President Roosevelt, so the situation in Europe turned into a moderate stage, and people's hearts also greatly improved. The cotton market was still excited by the impact, and the result was a slight increase of one or two pounds. However, the general opinion is that the selling price of new US cotton will become the world cotton price, so the general industry expects the price to fall. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market was average, with the forecast slightly increasing by 25 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 40 pounds, converting to legal tender, it is estimated that US cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 2 jiao, Indian cotton rose by 1 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 3 yuan. Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, because the Japanese army launched a counterattack and captured key areas, people's hearts turned firm, and sales of spot yarn in various places gradually loosened. As a result, yarn prices soared, exceeding the 400 yuan barrier, and cotton trading benefited a lot. Yesterday, the total import of US cotton was 400 bales, Hongzhang imported 500 bales of Indian cotton Bai Luoqu, and Laofeng imported 500 bales of Indian cotton Guo'er. On the Japanese factory side, Shanghai imported 1,000 bales, Rihua imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, and Neiwai imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton. Here are the converted prices of foreign cotton yesterday: Raw Material Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax 60 count Egyptian cotton Premium 104.20 Again Again Medium 101.80 80 count Again Premium 128.60 Again Again Medium 118.40 20 count US Metlin 81.70 Again Again Substandard 68.55 32 count Again 90.40 Again Again Substandard 97.50 42 count Again 91.20 Again Again Substandard 80.45 South American Brazilian cotton Premium 85.00 Again Again Medium 82.70 Again Again Substandard 76.90 10 count Indian Pingguo'er 61.45 16 count Indian Aomula 64.15 20 count Indian Bai Luoqu 79.35 Ancient 12 count US Xinte 84.45 32/42 count US Pengjiapu 88.95 The business of domestic cotton has become more active, but the factory side is still sluggish and inactive. Market trading is all done by colleagues, half of which is speculative trading and half is for supporting business. Moreover, rumors are rampant in the market, saying that Europe is uneasy and that unexpected events may occur, and foreign cotton cannot be transported to the Far East. Therefore, the outlook is optimistic. Another saying is that foreign firms have increased the insurance premium by 2 yuan per load. However, today the selling price of domestic cotton is actually loosening, 5 jiao weaker than the previous day. The source of Subei is declining. Tongzhou flower reached 222 bales. Here is a record of the current cotton situation: Tongzhou flower 77.80 Colleagues enter 64 bales Telegraphic Transfer Stock Exchange Fire Machine Flower 70.50 Again 500 bales Cash Again Again 70.50 69.20 500 bales Again Again Hede Flower 87.30 Again 300 bales Telegraphic Transfer Again Xiasha Flower 76.00 Again 200 bales Again Again Pitou Sichuan-Yunnan Parcel Post is Open Cotton Cloth Business Suddenly Becomes Strong Domestic Cloth In the morning market, British firm Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth opened with an increase of 1.5 to 2.5 jiao per piece for various weights. Coarse cloth from this factory also rose in unison. Nine-pound underwear rose by 1.5 jiao. Dasheng, Xinyu, and Zhenzhong 14 and 16 pound brands also followed with an increase of about 1 jiao. Hand goods are 5 fen to 1 jiao cheaper than the new price. More than 300 bales were collected by this street and the Wenzhou firm. Fine cloth and fine twill were affected by the sharp rise in Dongpi, and also saw an increase of 1 jiao to 3 jiao. 200 bales of dyed grey cloth were sold. Speculators purchased and stored 100 bales. The Guangdong firm purchased more than 100 pieces. The Subei firm had already started to expand, purchasing nearly 50 bales of fine cloth from Peacock and Artillery brands. There is still a strong demand for bleached and dyed cloth on this street. The southwest Guangdong firm continues to purchase, adding more than 300 boxes of colored twill, colored cloth strips, plain pongee, and other goods. Yesterday, the Sichuan-Yunnan firm restored postal delivery of large parcels through the post office, and the backlog of goods is expected to be cleared, and the speculation is even stronger, with nearly 400 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, and thread flannel being sold, and the selling price rising by 1 jiao to 3 or 4 jiao. Dongbu The dyeing and sales business on this street is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the appetite of the northern customers is also strong, so the selling price of fine cloth and fine twill rose sharply again yesterday (per piece) by 2 jiao to 3 jiao. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has risen to 13 yuan and 3.5 jiao. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine twill are out of stock. The bidding price of Yanghe fine twill must be 12 yuan and 9 jiao, while the price opened by foreign firms is 1 jiao higher than the market price. The upper grades of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill are extremely scarce. The middle and lower grades of fine cloth are all priced at 13 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 jiao. It is said that fine cloth in Hankou costs 18 to 19 yuan per piece, and is controlled by Japanese merchants for sales, so the Shanghai market is even tighter, and speculation among colleagues is also high. Yesterday, more than 35 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were ordered from various foreign firms. Dong Mianyi's family sold more than 1,000 pieces, and in terms of actual sales, 2,000 pieces were purchased on this street, more than 700 pieces were purchased by the Tianjin firm, and 300 to 400 pieces were purchased by the Qingdao and Yantai firms. Also, it was found that 118 pieces of cloth were imported yesterday, from Tianjin to Shanghai, and 40 pieces were exported, to Shantou. Thin Plain Serge Has the Smallest Price Increase Yesterday, the transaction of woolen goods was prosperous, and the price was firm. Light-colored thin flannel summer goods, etc., which are in short supply, have slightly increased in price. In short, since the 813 incident, the market changes of woolen fabrics and wool fabrics have been more frequent than in previous years, and the market price of every kind has been rising sharply. However, the price increase of Wan Chang camel gray plain thin serge has been the smallest from beginning to end. For example, the domestic Zhanghua 918 is currently sold at a wholesale price of 3 yuan and 3 jiao per yard, while before the war, it was sold at 3 yuan and 5 fen. Ordinary Western thin serge, which was sold at 3 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 jiao before the war, is now only sold at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 jiao. The reason for this is nothing more than the influence of Dong's serge, and the fact that the Yongxing Hongkang factory, which was recently established by Japanese merchants in Hongkou, produces a large number of goods. The price increase of all kinds of thin plain serge is uniformly slight, less than one-third of other woolen fabrics. Grain The International Situation is Treacherous Local Foreign Flour Factory Flour Yesterday, the spot flour price turned upward. The market opened in the morning, and the new transactions felt lively because it was the beginning of the week. Both the North-South firms and the Mainland firms inquired about it. The international situation has been tense recently, and orders for foreign flour and wheat have often been delayed in arriving at the port. Local wheat is in short supply and prices are high, and people's hearts are gradually improving. Therefore, the price of the No. 2 Flour Factory was immediately raised by 5 fen. This has been recorded in this newspaper. It is heard that the sales volume of various firms in Fujian, Shantou, Hebei, and Shandong yesterday was about 50,000 bags, and the retail sales on this street were also nearly 10,000 bags. The price of the No. 2 Flour Factory is uniformly 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao, and the price of the second-grade No. 3 and No. 4 is 4 yuan and 2.3 jiao. Flour exports: 14,000 bags were shipped to Shantou on the 17th, 41,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin on the 18th, and 2,200 bags were shipped to Yantai. Also, 3,000 bags of skins were shipped to Shantou on the 17th. On the same day, 677 bags of wheat came from Xin'gang. Foreign Flour The trend is also upward. According to foreign telegrams, prices have been reported to have risen in the United States and Australia. The reason is that the international situation is treacherous, and various foreign firms have uniformly called for higher prices. It is temporarily difficult to approach futures, and the cheap spot foreign flour that has been floated is gradually becoming scarce. The big players who hold the goods insist on not selling, so the supply in the market is scarce. Only the Beiyang firm has traded a batch of Fox and other brands, and the retail of miscellaneous brands on this street is just a decoration. It is heard that the price of medium-grade brands has risen to 4 yuan and 4 jiao for telegraphic transfers, and 4 yuan and 4 jiao, 45 fen. However, due to different miscellaneous brands and trademarks, there are also spot transactions of 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 and 3 fen. The market environment is quite firm. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice have not changed. Yesterday, various firms came to Shanghai. Heshui had a total of 4 and 5 numbers, and the Cheshu baozi from the Jiangsu-Tong firm had more than 2,000 bags, the Kunshan firm had 500 to 600 bags, and the Changzhou firm had 250 bags, for a total of more than 3,000 bags. After the market was slightly tight the day before, yesterday, the appetite of this street showed slack after the opening. Speculators have also turned dull, but the selling side's speculation is still firm, so the prices of thick and thin japonica rice have not changed. Du Yangjian and Pujian are also similar, and it is difficult to find rare stocks, but the demand is not wide, so there is no change. Oil Cake Raw Soybean Oil Rises Endlessly Yesterday, the price of raw oil exceeded the latest record of last Saturday. However, under the high price, transactions were reduced. Yesterday, only 200 cans of Tianjin Hall bottled oil were traded, at a price of 46 yuan and 9 jiao, and 10 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, at a price of 39 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Soybean oil was affected by the delivery of Dalian soybeans. Yesterday, the clients who operated Dalian goods said that 30% of the large and small baskets of Lianqi oil that had been thrown out earlier would be delivered to clear the procedures for both parties. Therefore, people's hearts immediately turned from soft to hard. The early oil Hengshan, which was loaded from Kobe at the end of April and the beginning of May, was helpless. Only the Yinghua-style old head ticket price of 33 yuan was hawked. However, people in the industry have not dared to touch the Yinghua Company's orders, because the cost of telegraphic transfers also requires about 40 yuan, which makes the market atmosphere even more tense, and the highest prices have been repeatedly set. According to statistics, more than 300 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, with prices opening at 41 yuan and 5 jiao, and rising to 44 yuan. Other Yantai-Qiqi traded 120 pieces, Lianqi large and small baskets 130 pieces, Fengnian oil 50 barrels, bleached oil 50 barrels, Dayou Factory oil 200 loads, and Suifeng Factory canned oil 800 cans. On the 17th, 1,221 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Dalian. Soybean Cake Plummets The near term falls below the 3 yuan mark, and the forward market is slightly more stable. Recently, soybean cake trading has only involved Dalian cake. The market situation has not been encouraging because it has not yet reached the peak sales season. Market prices have been hovering for many days. Yesterday, it suddenly rebounded due to the strong arrival of sources, plummeting 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li. The decline in the forward market in June was slightly slower, because it is expected that it will be in the peak sales season at that time, so the general aircraft companies are still absorbing it. However, the market price once fell to the 3 yuan mark, and the closing price rebounded by 2 fen. Yesterday, a total of 3,000 pieces of spot Lian cake were traded, with prices ranging from 2 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen, to 9 jiao, 5 fen. 2,000 pieces in May, priced at 2 yuan and 9 jiao, 7 fen, and more than 10,000 pieces in June, with prices ranging from 3 yuan to 3 yuan and 2 fen. On the 17th, 4,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped from Dalian. Sugar Market Futures Crystalline White Sugar is Traded in Large Quantities Foreign Sugar is Soaring Yesterday, the futures for Taikoo crystalline white sugar in June were replied, and it was found that the telegram requested a purchase amount of 17,000 bags. Yesterday, 15,000 bags were approved for exchange, at a price of HK$10.05. The insurance cost for Dutch coarse white sugar has also increased, rising to 75%, and the situation in Europe is uneasy, and the water feet may need to be increased at any time, so people's hearts are extremely high now, and the performance is rising endlessly. The association's quotation for 24 coarse white sugar is 26 yuan for spot goods outside the warehouse, 26 yuan and 2 jiao for the native warehouse, and 26 yuan and 3 jiao for Da Jinyuan mark. The initial quotation for Dutch coarse white sugar for transshipment was 17 yuan and 9 jiao, and then rose to 9 jiao, 5 fen, to 18 yuan and 5 fen, and 400 to 500 bags were traded. Later, the quotation was 18 yuan and 2 jiao, but it was not completed. Taikoo crystalline white B mark West Warehouse is 26 yuan, and very few were sold, so it is tight. OW mark is 25 yuan and 8 jiao, 5 fen, HX mark is 25 yuan and 4 jiao, and domestic sugar Sanshengbai rose by 2 jiao and 3 jiao, opening at 24 yuan and 6 jiao, followed by 24 yuan and 3 jiao to 24 yuan. Mian Chih rose by 2 jiao, opening at 15 yuan and 2 jiao, and a total of 100 bags were traded. Dry and elegant Tiao Qing goods were idle at 13 yuan and 4 jiao, and 150 to 160 bags were traded. Silk Tea White Factory Warp Rose by 10 Yuan Yokohama Raw Silk Near Term Up, Far Term Down Yesterday, the silk market was closed in New York, and Yokohama was firm and stable. Spot goods were 1,135 yuan, the same as the previous market, and the far term was 1,058 yuan, 1 yuan less than the previous car. At the close in the afternoon, spot goods rose by 10 yuan, and the far term fell by 12 yuan. It seems that the silk price has indeed reached its peak, and since yesterday, the far-term raw silk has declined. Only spot goods and near-term goods still have the remaining momentum of the price increase. Looking at the situation in Europe, there is a sense of imminent storm. Therefore, if this port can take advantage of this peak to launch silk sales to the United States as much as possible, it should be the most opportune move. Yesterday, foreign firms continued to trade silk, and the silk price was stable and the transaction was small. 7/8 warp was sold at 1,690 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the previous weekend. Renji, Dachang, and other firms each entered nearly 50 loads, all of which were May futures. Yifei Zhuangkou was quiet again yesterday. Although there were occasional inquiries from overseas, the price limit of foreign firms was very harsh, so it was not accepted by general crude silk customers. On the 17th, there were also 106 umbrellas and 11,000 pieces of native paper shipped from Wenzhou. Coal Bituminous Coal is Firm High-grade bituminous coal: Because local customers continue to purchase, the inventory is decreasing day by day, and there are not many sources, so the market is firm and persistent. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm also arranged for Yuepu coal to be purchased from Hokkaido, totaling 1,000 tons, which was unloaded at a warehouse in Pudong, and entrusted to a certain firm to manage the sale. The ex-factory price of the same industry was 34 yuan per ton for unified coal, 36 yuan per ton for sectional coal, and 30 yuan per ton for coal chips. Another disassembly of the concession warehouse, a discretionary addition of two yuan,

Taxpaying Chinese Association Held Representatives’ General Meeting Yesterday The Chinese Directors, Including Yu Qiaqing, Were Reelected and Agreed to Request the Municipal Council to Reconsider the Increased Donation The Shanghai Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association held its first representatives’ general meeting for the 28th year at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. The meeting elected directors and members to attend the Municipal Council and the Executive Committee of the Association, and listened to the report of the previous directors and members on their participation in government. All five Chinese directors in this session, including Yu Qiaqing, were reelected, and all seven Chinese committee members except for Xu Guanqun were also reelected. The general meeting resolved to request the Municipal Council to reconsider the increase of 2% in the municipal general donation by the Municipal Council. The details are as follows: Chairman's Address After the ceremony, Chairman Xu Jiguang gave the opening speech, saying, "Representatives, under this special situation, all municipal affairs in the Public Concession can still proceed step by step, which is gratifying. However, due to the abnormal development of the market, it seems to present a booming atmosphere on the surface, but in reality, all prosperity belongs to the consumer side, and the prosperity of the production side is still difficult to achieve. The most reassuring thing is the maintenance of public security, the emphasis on education, and the relief of refugees. The efforts of the Standing Bureau have achieved considerable results. Moreover, in times of emergency, everything is expensive, and public and private expenditures are not what they used to be. Balancing surpluses and deficits must take into account both aspects. Cutting the long to make up for the short is a way to increase revenue, but cutting feet to fit shoes is not a way to reduce expenditure. I hope that the wise authorities will pay attention to this in terms of donations and taxes. In short, this year's achievements are not easy. The taxpayers should pay tribute to the painstaking measures of the authorities. I will not go into details. I hope that the representatives will understand." Elected Directors The election of directors and members (1) The election of two Chinese directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council for the 28th to 29th years.

Recent Photo of Newly Appointed Committee Member Xu Guanqun Mr. The Public Concession Municipal Council resolved to increase the municipal general donation by 2% from October 1st of the 28th year. This Association should send a letter to the Bureau again to reconsider the resolution. Send a letter to the Municipal Council regarding the increase of the municipal general donation by 2% from October 1st, and request a reconsideration. In case there are indeed financial difficulties and it is unavoidable to implement it, it should be reduced when the market situation is better and the exchange rate is restored to alleviate the people's difficulties. (2) The Vice Chairman of the Public Concession Municipal Council, McNotten, has made outstanding achievements in maintaining security within the Concession and assisting in the relief of refugees.

The Association should send a letter to the Bureau to express its gratitude and request that it adhere to its original intention and implement the spirit of the rule of law to protect legal rights and interests. Agreed and passed. Resolutions in Various Cases Special Environment Private Goods Abound Customs Encourages Secret Reports To Award 40% of the Proceeds from Private Goods, and Earnestly Hope That Outsiders Will Report According to the Information The Jianghai Customs has previously stipulated the measures for rewarding informants who report and seize tax-evading private goods, "Awarding 40% of the proceeds from the private goods (up to a maximum of 40%), but it must be reviewed by the Customs to see if the reported situation is suitable before it can be accepted. Otherwise, it can be rejected. After the Customs receives the report, it should still send personnel to investigate and prove that the report is true, and the Customs staff must seize the private goods before the reward can be given according to the regulations. No excuses should be made that the Customs has received a secret report, regardless of whether the report is true or not, and whether the private goods have been seized, to索取發獎金。」 The reporter has recently learned from relevant sources that after the implementation of this regulation, it has achieved remarkable results. However, in the current special environment, tax-evading private goods are flooding the market. In order to further combat smuggling, the Customs has not only informed all the police to work hard to combat smuggling, but also hopes that outsiders will report according to the information in order to avoid tax evasion. The reward measures are still the same as before. A Japanese Boat Sunk Near Yejidun The Japanese Naval Command sent three gasoline boats yesterday morning (16th) to patrol the inland river and sailed to the vicinity of Yejidun above Beixinjing when they were suddenly attacked by guerrillas lurking along the coast. The Japanese army was caught off guard and immediately opened fire on the boat to resist. The guerrillas often used dense machine guns to sweep. A Japanese gasoline boat was sunk and more than 20 Japanese sailors drowned. Pudong Imposed Martial Law Twice From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, special martial law was imposed twice along the Pudong River, and the Dongchang Road ferry traffic was blocked twice. The urgent reason was that the Fourth Battalion Headquarters of the Naval Landing Force received a secret order from the Hongkou Headquarters, saying that three Chinese people, wearing naval uniforms and carrying weapons, had infiltrated Pudong, hoping to attack the puppet members. The Japanese Marine Corps battalion was dispatched in a panic. After the martial law was lifted in the morning, the same emergency search was conducted again in the afternoon, but no results were found. The civilians were deeply afraid of accidents after being startled several times in one night, and some temporarily took refuge in Puxi yesterday. Chongqing Telegram Wang Jingwei Has Arrived in Shanghai It is Said That Wang is Now Living in Hongkou Reuters Chongqing, 17th: It is rumored here that Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai on April 9 and is now living in Hongkou. Wang's colleagues have set up their headquarters in a house on Seymour Road. Today's National Spiritual Mobilization Citizen World Propaganda Day Tomorrow is the Propaganda Day for the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors, and the Whole City Should Enthusiastically Hang Flags. The Citizens' World Mobilization Association Issues a Declaration. Today is the Citizen World Propaganda Day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' World National Spiritual Mobilization Association has issued a declaration, elaborating on the importance of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and the urgency of its promotion. The Association is now enthusiastically promoting the branch organization of the Citizen World, and it is expected that at least 200 or more branches can be established during this Propaganda Week, and the number of people who formally participate in the National Covenant Oath will be around 50,000. Tomorrow is the Propaganda Day for the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors. The persons in charge of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of the three sectors held a joint meeting and resolved to not only publish a letter to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial compatriots, pointing out the work that should be done at present, but also to mobilize all sectors of the city to enthusiastically hang flags in unison. Tomorrow morning, the national flags will fly over all shops, factories, and residences in the city, which will be a concrete manifestation of the efforts of all the citizens to mobilize spiritually. The declaration of the Citizens' World is recorded as follows: Jointly Strive for Freedom Our country's resistance against Japan has lasted for nearly two years. Thanks to the leadership and measures of the supreme leader of the National Government, Jiang, the loyal sacrifice of the frontline soldiers, and the firm unity of the people of the whole country, we have been able to thwart the arrogant flames of the enemy and amaze the world. Now the War of Resistance has reached the second stage. The importance of this stage lies in changing the defensive posture to an offensive posture, changing the passive to the active, so that the war can quickly turn into a general counter-offensive decisive battle, in order to achieve the purpose of recovering lost territories and establishing a new China with freedom and equality. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to rely solely on the army, military equipment, and strategies and tactics. We must implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, so that all the people of the country are under a unified organization, have a common belief, embrace common goals, and sacrifice and struggle for national salvation and nation-building. In the past, some people thought that China was a weak country, whether in terms of weapons or tactics, it was far inferior to the enemy. Taking a weak country to fight against a strong country, even if the war of resistance is prolonged, it is difficult to have the power to win. Therefore, they first had a psychological fear of the enemy, and some people were overjoyed when they heard of the victory in the front, and felt disappointed when they heard of the loss of a famous city, and embarked on a path of negativity and depression. There are even some people who only know the immediate safety, forget the imminent danger, and let the war of resistance take its course, and do not care how to save the country. These kinds of people, because there is no center in consciousness and lose their dominance in spirit, are confused and mixed in performance, and cannot be examined. As a result, it will inevitably directly or indirectly affect the future of the War of Resistance. Now China has reached a critical moment of survival, and every citizen should be a fighter in the War of Resistance, using the strength of 450 million people to defend the country and drive out the powerful enemy, and then there will be a definite guarantee of final victory. The War of Resistance certainly depends on the superiority of economy and weapons, but economy is to be dominated by people, and weapons are also to be used by people. Only a great spirit can control everything. Simultaneous Advancement of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Although Shanghai is under the threat of enemy encirclement, we believe that most citizens have not forgotten the country or neglected the War of Resistance. For example, the work of献金救难锄奸文化 has shown an indomitable and positive spirit, and countless young people want to rise up to save the country, but feel that there is no way to save the country in the isolated island. In addition, we see the life of drunkenness and death, the habit of苟且偷生, the attempt of selfishness and self-interest, and even the divergent and unreasonable thoughts, everywhere. Since the ranks have been disordered and the belief is not concentrated, how can we save the country and strive for final victory if we do this? Therefore, the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization is to unify and expand the organization of the people, correct all the unreasonable and even hindering habits, life, and thoughts of the past, and take the country first, the nation first, military first, and victory first as the goal of common efforts. At the same time, do not forget that China's War of Resistance is a national revolutionary War of Resistance, in other words, the premise of implementing nationalism, democracy, and even the people's livelihood. We must not only strive to resist Japan and achieve final victory, but also build a new China with equal national status, equal political status, and equal economic status. Therefore, during the war, we must advance the revolutionary and constructive nature of the Three People's Principles in both aspects, striving to resist Japan on one hand in order to achieve final victory, and building the country on the other hand in order to establish a new country with freedom and equality. Seriously Implement the Stipulated Outline The foundation of the War of Resistance and the outline of nation-building determined by the Central Government are the fundamental plan for the integration of theory and practice. If the people of the whole country follow it unanimously, the wartime life, actions, and spiritual cause can have combat and constructive properties, and can be coordinated with the national policy of the War of Resistance and nation-building. If everyone has this belief, that is, everyone has this spirit and activity, from mutual trust to mutual trust, from unity to struggle, with the great strength of 450 million people to save China and build China, then the final victory will be like a shadow, expected to arrive. This Association has now been established following the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal

Free Talk on Oaths Mao Lie
Formalism is inherently undesirable because it merely pursues external appearances and does not emphasize practicality. The result is nothing more than deceiving oneself and others, and engaging in empty displays. For example, extravagant weddings are nothing more than showing off wealth, and lavish funerals are nothing more than pleasing the mourners. Neither is worthy of emulation.

However, this refers to personal matters. If it is a mass movement or public behavior, it must have some appropriate form to openly declare it to the world. In the propaganda methods of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association this week, there is an item for holding oaths to the National Covenant, which I believe is the kind of form that is necessary, and we should all abide by it.

During the oath-taking, if a large-scale gathering is not possible due to environmental conditions, there should at least be a small-scale meeting. A solemn ceremony and the presence of responsible leaders to supervise are even more essential conditions. I think that holding the ceremony separately like this will definitely achieve both positive and negative benefits.

Positive: Under public gathering, regardless of age or status, or strength, everyone takes the oath as a citizen, vowing to unite and engage in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. At that time, it will surely leave a deep impression on everyone who participates, and in the future, it will surely enable them to practice it physically and achieve concrete results.

Negative: If he is an unknown traitor, he must find ways to avoid it and refuse to come to take the oath. In this way, we can find out his true colors and leave him nowhere to hide. If he has become a traitor and still dares to participate, then once he is exposed, we can impose severe sanctions on him, so that he has no room for complaint and other traitors know what to fear.

The positive effect is to encourage ourselves, and the negative effect is to prevent traitors. To go a step further, preventing traitors means preventing them from hindering our great plan of resisting the war and building the country, allowing us to achieve our goals as soon as possible. Therefore, the negative is also positive.

I hope that when each branch, or rather, each organization, holds this kind of oath-taking, everyone who belongs to it can be present, no matter how busy he is. Even if he is sick, he will come even if supported by illness, or even carried on a bed, not acting as a traitor who deliberately evades the oath. At the time of the oath, everyone will show sincerity and determination to abide by the National Covenant, and there will be no suspicion of being a traitor either in fact or in theory!

Finally, I hope that after the oath, we will all supervise and urge each other, and always abide by the National Covenant!

### Pearl Buck's New Book "The Patriot" Chen Donglin
Pearl S. Buck is the recipient of this year's Nobel Prize in Literature. She is world-renowned as a writer who is a "China expert." At a time when China's war of resistance is proceeding fiercely, the Nobel Prize has precisely chosen this writer who has always used China as her subject. International attention is, in this literary aspect, also focusing on this struggling China. At this time, Pearl Buck produced a work with the theme of China in the War of Resistance - "The Patriot". This will undoubtedly cause a sensation in various countries around the world.

"The Patriot" has differences in subject matter from her previous novels with China as the background: its scene extends to Japan, with extremely detailed analyses of Japanese customs and sentiments. General readers will definitely find her understanding of Japan interesting. What is of particular interest to us Chinese readers is that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will also become a character in the work and appear before the readers.

The protagonist of "The Patriot," Wu Yiwan, is the son of a Shanghai banker. This rebellious son hates everything about his family - he hates his father's wealth, hates the shackles of various rituals in the family, and he holds a deeply critical attitude towards his surroundings. Under this suffering, he is finally led by his poor female classmate Enlan and joins the Communist Party at school, doing the work of organizing and leading the masses, and he feels inner comfort. But as an idealist, he believes that there are only "good" and "evil" in this world, and as long as the "evil" is simply removed, an ideal world will surely appear. It was when the flames of the Northern Expedition were burning all over China that he placed great hope in the revolution, believing that as long as the revolution succeeded, the world he idealized would appear. However, the revolution was not yet completed, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party suddenly split. The ensuing purge left our Yiwan with nowhere to stay in China. Therefore, with the help of his powerful banker father, he escaped from the tiger's mouth and fled to neighboring Japan.

His hopes shattered, he felt despair over everything. In Japan, he lived in the home of his father's friend, Muraki. Here, he saw that Japan seemed very peaceful on the surface, but the freedom of some people was being completely deprived. Everything was brutally controlled, while maintaining so-called extreme peace and order. Later, Yiwan gradually fell in love with Kimura's daughter, "Zhuichi." In the vortex of love, the shadow of turbulent China gradually faded in his heart. The September 18th Incident, which happened suddenly and ended quickly, did not move him much. When the newspaper talked about peace, Yiwan married Zhuichi. Their marriage was very happy, and soon Yiwan became the father of two children. A sweet family life made him give up all hope, and he had melted into this other environment. But soon, the sound of cannons at the Marco Polo Bridge resounded throughout North China, awakening the people of the whole country, and finally making our protagonist rise up. The ensuing cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party gave Yiwan an opportunity to return home that he never dreamed of. He gave up everything and resolutely returned to China alone. He had already decided to sacrifice everything and dedicate himself to the cause of saving the Chinese nation. After returning to China, he was sent by Generalissimo Chiang to the northwest corner of China, where he reunited with his former Enlan - now an officer in the Eighth Route Army. He joined their ranks and launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army on the vast plains. In his work, Yiwan regained his original revolutionary ideals.

Slave's Dream Liu You
The golden color is tinged with the scenery of spring, red lights, green wine, and clear songs, this scene that is most endearing is the slave's dream!

Slaves cannot escape the whip of the oppressor. They lament their fate, let themselves be bound and trampled upon, what they gain is that sweet, mesmerizing dream!

The slave's dream is dyed with intoxicating colors, stirring people's sad mood. In the dream, everything seen is exceptionally beautiful, everything heard is very pleasant, everything obtained is incomparably precious, in the dream, they all seem to have ascended to immortality!

But this slave's dream, in order to make this gorgeous dream, forgets the sorrow of being a slave, forgets the terrible fate of the future!

Sweet and extravagant dreams, tied to the hearts of thousands of slaves, for the sake of this moment's pleasure, forgetting endless pain!

Dreams, the dreams of slaves, are like an incomparably sharp knife, pushing these poor people onto the guillotine, executing them with the death penalty of beheading.

The slave's dream is like strands of thin silk, cocooning people as if in a prison!

One day, this intoxicating slave's dream will be shattered, leaving only the cries of thousands of slaves!

Give up this endearing dream, it is better for the slaves to take out their perseverance and break this dream themselves!

China's Spring Luo Hua
In the cold and lonely embrace, a gentle warm breeze blows; look around lightly and quickly, open our eyes of the heart. On the quiet land, a green patch of small grass; it is the season of new life, spread our smiling faces. Under the ancient stone bridge, the gurgling river flows; there is hidden vitality, stand up our bodies. In the bright red flower industry, a row of green hills; this solemn composure, raises our chests. On the verdant branches and twigs, a cluster of tender sprouts; it is a sign of development, extend our arms. In the silent wilderness, a rumble of new thunder; listen to the roaring cries, grip our guns tightly. In the dark and gloomy night, a faint line of dawn; this light of hope, aligns our steps. In the azure sky, a white sun shines; it is the mountains and rivers of the motherland, sing our triumphant songs.

Another Page, A Kind of Inspiration Qiming
It's raining, how annoying! But I know the rain will stop, as long as the wind changes direction, the sun will come out.

I am sick, how painful! But I know the disease will heal, as long as I pay attention to hygiene, I will soon be able to regain my health and live happily.

The country has been bullied, how difficult! But I know the bullying will pass, as long as we resist in unity and strive to build the country, we will soon have a bright and splendid Republic of China.

Everything in the world, all things in the universe, have certain principles and certain tracks. Loss of principle is chaos, and deviation from the track is disaster. It cannot be said that there will absolutely be no chaos and disaster, but this is only temporary after all. Principles and tracks will eventually exist forever, never extinguished. What does temporary count for compared to eternal!

We see, we look far away, behind the dense clouds that cause the rain, isn't the sun still shining? In the hidden places of the groaning and twisting body, isn't there still a healthy physique supporting it? In the depths of the disintegrating country, isn't there still a magnificent and vast national soul inspiring it? Our hope is not in vain, and the time to realize it is not far away!

Let us work hard, neither be disappointed nor anxious. All misfortunes will be like nightmares, and will soon disappear without a trace when the light of dawn arrives!

On Leadership Worship Bai Ying
It seems that someone once said that every young person should have a central figure of worship in their mind. We usually hear that someone is a thoughtful person. In fact, all people have thought activities, so pointing out that someone is a thoughtful person actually means that this person's thought is organized, not the scattered thought that is common to ordinary people.

For a person's thought to develop to be organized and systematized, it must go through various evolutions in thought - gradual filling of experience and knowledge. But there must be an indispensable element here: the worship of a figure. However, it is not the idol-like worship of a figure, but the rational, scientific worship of a figure.

If a person's thought tends towards organization, no matter how curvilinear the process of his thought development is, it must have a certain degree of stereotype. What determines this stereotype is someone who leads his thought to develop in a certain direction. Although this someone does not exist in our thought at the beginning, when the thought develops to a certain degree, such a figure will appear in our minds, progressing with the progress of thought. Our belief in this someone gradually deepens, and eventually we develop a worshipful psychology towards him. Only when the evolution of thought reaches such a stage does our belief have a certain destination; and only the worship of a figure that is gained in the process of thought can be called scientific worship of a figure.

Some people are very opposed to the concept of hero worship. This kind of person's point of view emphasizes the saying that the times create heroes, and ignores the role of individuals in history. A person's becoming a great man and a worship object of some masses is certainly determined by the person's various environments, but the main thing is that the person's character can synthesize the essence of his era's environment and embody it in his way of life and thought. That is why a great man and a hero become the center of public admiration. What distinguishes a leader from ordinary people is that he can actively grasp the environment and use it. Although he still has to do this due to the impetus of the masses, the determining point of this impetus still has to be concentrated in his person. The leader and the power of the masses are an organic structure and cannot be separated from each other.

Perhaps some people think that the hero worship of the general masses is an idol-like worship, and they have not gone through the cognitive process of thought. But we believe that the general masses directly recognize their leaders from real life. They recognize from real life who is really seeking their welfare and who is really guiding their lives. Therefore, although the form of their hero worship is close to being idol-like, it is actually based on real life. Sometimes a false leader can also be blindly supported by the masses for a time - as in the case of fascist countries - but soon they can recognize the true face of the leader in real life and overthrow him.

Recently, after reading Dong Xianguang's "Chiang Kai-shek" and a biography of Lenin, I couldn't help but think of the fanatical emotions of the masses before and after the Xi'an Incident, and at the same time imagine the Soviet people who constantly came to pay their respects at Lenin's tomb. The fact that the Soviet Union has today's strength and China has been able to complete today's great unification and work together to resist the war cannot be underestimated the significance of hero worship - leader worship.

In order to enrich our own thought and to stereotype our own personality, we should all have a central figure of admiration in our minds. This can not only enrich our righteous belief, but also give us a lot of spiritual comfort at all times.

Spring and Autumn Aspirations Wen Zongshan
This is not a vague and ethereal fantasy; I am often touched by subtle things to evoke all kinds of aspirations and create countless thoughts.

"Heroism" is enough to make the general public worship, and I am no exception. I want to see many soldiers setting off in unison, encouraging that untouched heart. The clear streets are crowded with people, waiting to see what attractive things will come. Sure enough, tall horses, sharp bayonets, and orderly steps, a column of multinational merchant regiments march past in review. "The China Team" is here, a burst of applause and cheers. I love to see such valiant figures, to exhale the turbid breath of the past two years. But when I think of other situations, the applause and cheers have to be expressed in my heart!

My aspirations arise from the cheers of the masses. The asphalt road is changed to a rugged highway, and tall buildings become towering mountains. The bayonets are still brightly shining, and the steps are still serious and uniform, but these young people setting off in unison are all fighting for freedom and justice. So, I am not afraid of my throat being hoarse and shout wildly! I don't care if my palms are red from clapping. In the end, I might pick up a shotgun for hunting birds and follow along.

However, in the place where I am standing now, there was once a hideous "victory parade." This other aspiration made me rekindle the fire of anger that was accumulated in my heart.

A Wonderful Use of a School Building by a Certain School Jin Ge
At about six o'clock in the morning, the tea boy A Ling, with a broken bell with a missing corner in his hand, went to each classroom to ring the bell. His mouth scolded like reciting a book, "You bunch of lazybones! What time is it, and you still don't want to get up?" Those single men were awakened by the ringing, hurriedly climbed out of their quilts, quickly rolled the bedding into a bundle, and shouldered the bedding to the sun deck to put it down.

A Ling shook the bell from room to room, and those single guests were driven out one by one. If there was a man who wanted to pretend not to be awake so that he could lazily sleep in the quilt for a while, hum! A Ling was not easy to provoke! He pulled your quilt open, and shook the broken bell hard next to your ear, and his mouth was full of "Ma ya, niang de" curses. If you wanted to say "no," hum! Report to Principal Wang, do you still want to sleep here tonight?

A Ling saw that all the classrooms were cleared, so he put down the bell, changed to a broom, swept each house, and casually rearranged the tables and chairs piled in the corner. Just now it was a communal floor bed room, but now it is a sacred and solemn classroom.

From six thirty to eight thirty, two classrooms were rented to a commercial cram school to open a special accounting course. At this time, that group of prospective accountants also came one after another. They came with sleepy eyes, and some were still yawning.

Before eight thirty, those elementary school students were not allowed to enter the school, and were only allowed to play in the alley outside the school. Because Principal Li of the commercial cram school had an agreement with Principal Wang in advance, "We are not a small school, we need to be quieter." As for the children in the alley, Principal Wang didn't care at all if they dug gutters or touched mud.

At half past eight, A Ling opened the school gate. On one side were those prospective accountants rushing out anxiously. Many of them were real staff members of the shop, and they had to rush to work at this moment; on the other side were many grinning children squeezing in. With the squeezing on both sides, many children were knocked to the ground and began to cry loudly.

The classrooms were extremely dark. This was decided by Principal Wang: without his order, no one was allowed to turn on the lights privately. Once, Mr. Chen, who taught arithmetic in the fourth grade, saw that the children in the back seats really couldn't see the words on the blackboard, so Mr. Chen ordered A Ling to turn on the lights. Later, when Principal Wang found out about it, he called Mr. Chen in and scolded him, saying that he didn't know how to save materials in extraordinary times, deducted two yuan from his salary, and warned him that if he turned on the lights privately again next time, he would be fired!

Gymnastics was in the courtyard, singing was in the kitchen, the hall was divided into two, the front half was for reading English in the room; the pavilion room was the residence of Principal Wang and Mrs. Wang... there is no need to write about all of this in detail.

As soon as school was dismissed at four o'clock in the afternoon, the children were not allowed to stay in the school for a moment. They had to leave the school with their schoolbags within ten minutes, because from four thirty to six thirty, Principal Wang had already lent the classroom to the typing class of the commercial cram school that I mentioned earlier. They are not a small school, they need to be quieter.

There is an English cram night school in the evening, which was founded by Principal Wang himself. It is divided into first, second, third, and fourth grades. Mr. Wang also concurrently serves as the teacher of the fourth grade.

At nine o'clock, before the English class was over, those single lodging guests had already shouldered their bedding and waited at the door.

Mulan Joins the Army Chen He made
Khan asks what you desire,
Mulan does not need the title of Senior Secretary,
Willing to borrow the thousand-mile feet of a bright camel,
To send my son back to his hometown. (The End)

Life Report We are Car Drivers Xu Yinghui
The two words "driver," when readers see them, will definitely bring a thought to their minds - that is a humble profession! No, absolutely not. This profession is sacred labor, it is noble and holy. Thousands and thousands of cars are driven by us - the drivers - day in and day out, making them serve our humanity faithfully and exerting their unique effect. Therefore, our profession is to increase the welfare of the entire society, the entire country, and even the entire world.

The cars we drive are divided into two types: one is a truck, that is, what is generally called a truck. The other is a passenger car.

Since our government has been making efforts to engage in highway construction, trucks have become important in transportation. Driving this kind of car is more difficult. Every morning, we drive clumsy and inferior trucks to our destination. The rich are having sweet dreams, while we have to get up early and work hard because of the pressure of life. The coolies on the car are responsible for carrying the goods to the car, and we just watch them work. All around are working comrades; there is no luxury or hypocrisy here, everything is pure and honest. After working for five or six hours, it is time for lunch. We feel hungry in our stomachs, so we go into a commoner's restaurant and eat a random meal to fill our stomachs, without paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. In the evening, we drag our wooden legs home. Our faces are covered with dust from the road, and our clothes are full of mud. When we went out in the morning, we were a neat person, but when we come back, we are covered in mud and dust, and full of foul odors. After working like this for thirty days, the wages we get are only more than thirty yuan. After deducting the cost of food, there is less than thirty yuan left. A family of young and old lives on this. In this Shanghai where the cost of living is rising, frugality is naturally to be expected.

Driving passenger cars is completely different from the situation of driving trucks. The owners are young masters or big merchants and wealthy businessmen - generally members of the bourgeoisie. They can do nothing all day long, look for pleasure all day long, have no sorrow and no worries. When night comes to the earth, it is their time to be active. They walk into places of extravagant singing and dancing, everything is joyful and gorgeous, making people linger. We stay outside, guarding the empty car, lonely waiting for the owner. Intoxicating jazz music leaks out from inside. There is no pure honesty of labor here, it is completely a world of paper drunkenness and gold fascination. On this quiet and boring night, only drowsiness is used to pass the precious time. Late at night, the owner comes out with a joyful heart, and we reluctantly open our sleepy eyes and drive the car back. Driving passenger cars, yes, life is much more comfortable. Although the wages are only about twenty-five or thirty yuan, there are still extra gifts. At meal times, we don't have to go to the restaurant, and there is more delicious food to fill our stomachs. Indeed, life is more comfortable than driving a truck, but being immersed in extravagance and luxury all day long, this life is too decadent!

Since the August 13th Incident, many fellow friends have gone to the rear to serve the country, driving military vehicles. They often boast proudly in their letters of their greatness and glory. How ashamed we are! We are still stranded on this solitary island full of twilight, and the flames of shame often burn in our hearts.

After the Rain, a Clear Sky Bao Tianxiao
Chapter Eight: Illusion or Reality, Acting on the Stage; To Proceed or to Stop, Making Home Everywhere

At that time, it was not easy to find out the whereabouts of Chen Jun because Chen Jun served in a certain military agency, and this military agency was constantly changing. Moreover, in military affairs, many things are secret, and it is also not easy to find a person of important relationship. Xiangzi took this little child and searched everywhere from south to north, from the eastern district to the western district, but could not get his whereabouts. After searching for about half a day, Chen Jun had not been met, but he met Mr. Li, who had studied abroad in Japan with Chen Jun. Mr. Li saw that Xiangzi's face was haggard and no longer like it was in the past, and he also sighed deeply. When asked about her life, Xiangzi told him everything: her brother had died in battle, her old father had died in prison, and she was left alone with only this child, who was Chen Jun's flesh and blood. She was looking for her husband thousands of miles away, just to give this child a father. As for herself, since she was the daughter of the enemy, she did not expect to recover what was lost. After hearing this, Mr. Li was very concerned about Xiangzi, and he naturally knew Chen Jun's whereabouts because at that time this military agency was stationed in that place in Xiang Province. Mr. Li was in another military agency, and now he had some important military affairs to go to Hunan. Mr. Li said to Xiangzi: You can come with me to Hunan, and I can explain everything to Chen Jun. Although you are Japanese, you can be considered to have nothing to miss in Japan. After the war stops, you can still be husband and wife. And I know for sure that since you returned to China, Chen Jun has not remarried. It can be seen that he has not forgotten you in his heart, and this matter is enough to make you feel at ease. A few days later, Xiangzi followed Mr. Li to Hunan. Her intention: first, to return the child to Chen Jun; second, to persuade Chen Jun to remarry and not to hinder his future because of me. But when she arrived in Hunan, Chen Jun had gone away on a business trip, saying that he would be back in three or four days. Who knew that on the way back, Chen Jun was not far from where he was stationed, but he was bombed by enemy planes and seriously injured in the car. He was sent to the hospital, but it was already incurable. By the time Xiangzi brought the child and rushed to the hospital, Chen Jun had already closed his eyes and sacrificed for the country. Xiangzi thought that she had finally found Chen Jun after thousands of mountains and rivers, thinking that she could meet him once, but who knew that she was still empty-handed. After Xiangzi had Chen Jun taken care of, she entrusted the child to Chen Jun's good friend Mr. Li, and jumped into the Xiang River to die. This is the story in the play "Tear Stains of the Xiang River." According to the playwright, this is not entirely a castle in the air, there really was such a thing, and Chen Jun in the play was an old friend of the playwright. (Eight Nine)

The Wonderful Uses of Radio in the Performing Arts World Lu Degang
In addition to providing entertainment, radio has many other wonderful uses:

In England, people care for animals very much. In order to enable cows, horses, cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, etc. to enjoy happiness, a radio station specially hired experts to broadcast to these birds and animals. What is broadcast is all kinds of sounds. When these sounds are transmitted into the ears of animals, it will make them wag their tails and show happy and joyful appearances, which is very effective. According to multiple experiments and research results, it has been proven that cattle have the highest degree of hearing and can even understand and appreciate jazz music.

Norwegian fishermen have recently invented the use of radio to help with whaling. The previous method of whaling was that when fishermen discovered a whale, they immediately shot a harpoon into the whale's body, but after the whale was injured, it would often slip away without knowing where it went. Therefore, some people have now invented a harpoon with a clever radio, and no matter where the whale escapes after being harpooned, it cannot escape the ears and eyes of the fishermen, because the radio on the whale's body continuously broadcasts the whale's sound waves, and the fishermen only need to follow the sound to find it, without exception.

Radio has another wonderful use, which is that it can attract many marine fish. After people who fish install a radio on a fishing boat, there will often be many sharks and sponges (note: sponges are animals) following the boat to eavesdrop. Fishermen only need to make a little effort to catch a large number of fish.

Old Star Xiao Ying Returns to the Screen Jin Qiu Bao
He wishes for the dark earth
To soon repeat the bright blue sky
So that people who love movies
Can breathe the air of freedom and liberation

Xiao Ying, an old star who has been in the Chinese film circle for more than ten years, has been out of the film circle since leaving the Star Company and changed his profession. He opened a Jianye Department Store on Fulu Li Road in the French Concession. Time flies, and four years have passed in the blink of an eye. Movie fans have gradually forgotten Ah Xiao, who is handsome and lively, and is accustomed to playing soldiers, fathers, and villainous young men on the screen.

The reasons why Ah Xiao left the film industry that year once aroused speculation among many friends and movie fans at the time, but according to what this reporter knows, it was entirely due to family reasons. He has a total of nine people in his family in Shanghai (two wives, who are sisters and married him, six children, and himself). He also has a first wife and a young and beautiful daughter in his hometown of Changsha, Hunan. He used to be a basic actor in the Star Company, and his salary was one hundred and eighty yuan. Because of the monthly salary arrears, he was in a dilemma, and the family burden was so heavy. Therefore, in the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic of China, he resigned to the Star Company and looked for his own way to make a living to maintain his family's life.

Ah Xiao is fifty years old this year, and he is still as lively and innocent as a child, and is very pleasing. His view of life is "happiness and struggle," and his private life is so serious, he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink alcohol, doesn't gamble, doesn't go to dance halls, and doesn't have any hobbies.

Recently, I met him on Fulu Li Road, which is full of exotic flavors. He invited me to his Jianye Department Store to talk for more than an hour. He talked about the vicissitudes of the Chinese film industry and the different lives of everyone in the Chinese film circle in this great era. He said, "I have recently returned to my old profession. This time, I have accepted the invitation of Yihua Company to participate in the new film "Chronicle of Film City." I have long been unfamiliar with acting skills, and the results cannot be perfect. I want to ask everyone to forgive me. I am old and outdated! I hope movie fans forget Xiao Ying. However, I have been very excited recently. Although I am no longer good, I have recently seen that our Chinese film industry is progressing day by day, and new people are also increasing day by day. Whether it is from the director, music, scenery, sound recording, photography, acting, etc., all aspects have progressed greatly compared to the past. Thinking of my debut work more than ten years ago, I can't help but laugh. Chinese movies more than ten years ago were so childish! Obviously, our Chinese film industry is advancing with the giant wheel of this era, just like our country, society, and life."

Ah Xiao said when I was about to leave, "He is wishing for that year, that day, when the current dark earth will return to the bright blue sky, so that our film industry can also breathe the air of freedom and liberation, and be able to put all the pain, darkness, and displaced lives that people are suffering in this era on the screen for our descendants to see. This glorious, tragic, and good movie will definitely be welcomed and praised by people."

After Watching the Three-Act Tragedy "First and Last" Tie Liu
This is the second time I have watched a performance of "Shanghai Drama Art Society's" One Week Theater. To be honest, these two public performances have given us a very good impression. When we look at the efforts of all the personnel and the success of the performance, we cannot but see the efforts of the Shanghai Drama Art Society in standing on the position of drama and the undeniable merits.

As for the audience, perhaps they have further demands on the Shanghai Drama Art Society, that is, they hope that the Drama Art Society can take a step further and stage some more advanced works. Although this may be a kind of excessive demand, we believe that being able to look forward will always be beneficial to a fact, although we do not want "blind action" or "impulse."

When I finished watching the play, I immediately felt that although it contained anger, it did not contain resistance. Although there was a struggle between sin and conscience, it did not negate and fight against "brother's world."

To be honest, I feel that this play is too pessimistic. Should the ruled class just groan, howl, and die at the hands of brutality and torture!

Therefore, in terms of objective effects, we must negate this kind of escape, acceptance of pain, and weak and incompetent attitude.

In the performance part, we must admit the success of Mr. Wu Renzhi, the director of this play, in handling the techniques.

Because in this three-act tragedy, there are only three characters in the whole play, and the director is able to express its emotions and atmosphere among the few characters. This is indeed not easy. In particular, the director used film techniques in many parts, which is very dramatic. Even silence and contemplation express a special mood.

For example, in the first act, the lighting is very good. It uses the red reflection from under the fireplace to shoot on the actor's face, making it produce a gloomy and terrifying feeling; however, for this act, I think that in addition to the two light areas of the writing desk and the fireplace, the light in the remaining parts is a bit too dim. At least, we should not make the actor's face black, and here, we see Zhang Jie walking to the edge of the stage once and approaching the fireplace to pour wine once, and his face is completely in darkness. Because there are only two people in this act, although the director uses the movement of position, it still cannot reduce its heavy feeling.

Second Act: The air is more tense than in the first act, and the actor's position is also lively, but I think that after the lights are turned on, they seem to be too strong.

Third Act: The effects are very good. Before the man and woman commit suicide, the relative silence is very excellent. After the lights go out, because the lights were not adjusted well, Zhang Jie lost the effect of the lights when he burned the letter under the strong lights. This must be corrected.

Actors: I feel that they are all good; Xu Li's crying should be reduced slowly in the first act; Zhang Jie is very calm: his style and posture can express the arrogance of this character; Zhang Wanjun transforms pain, she is a good actor.

When Xu Li writes the letter, the music with intense tones represents the confusion in his heart, which is well matched.

Zhang Dagong's Funeral Yesterday

Zhang Dagong, a giant in the drama world who was good at playing comic roles and was the father of Zhang Huicong, a female impersonator currently affiliated with the Carlton Grand Theater, suffered a major shock after leaving the Empress two years ago, resulting in mental disorder, which became an incurable disease. He lingered until yesterday at the hour of Yin, and died. Huicong was filial to her parents. Her throat disease had just recovered, and she was devastated by this accident. She wanted to die.

So later, after Song Shijie reported him, he was sentenced to death and cut into three pieces. Although it is said that he was harmed by the master, and he had the suffering that a dumb person eats Coptis chinensis and cannot tell, how could he have received this evil reward if he hadn't been muddled in his work? So he was named Gu Du, mainly to blame him for being muddled.

Business News

### Securities Have No Other Outlet, Domestic Bonds Become a Focus; Prices May Gradually Approach Those of January 10th.

The over-the-counter securities market was very strong yesterday, with a very good trend. The buying interest was rare since the informal market began. Rumors are rampant that the domestic and international situation has turned in a favorable direction. The concentration of a large number of U.S. warships in the Pacific is clearly a show of force. The situation in Europe should be kept in check. International loans are coming in a steady stream, showing that the debtors are reliable. The Sino-Japanese war is becoming increasingly smooth. There are rumors in the market that banks are buying, and some well-known big players are also buying in large quantities. The good market atmosphere has its reasons. It is faintly heard that various bonds can be pledged to banks at very favorable discounts. The many rumors are to be confirmed by facts. However, one point is the biggest driver of the upward trend. Since this year, various speculative businesses have been unprofitable. Cotton yarn prices have risen too high. Foreign exchange is controlled by the authorities and there is no fluctuation. There is no profit to be made from arbitrage. Bid gold and foreign currencies are also too expensive and very risky. All other things that can be speculated are at their peak and cannot be handled. Therefore, there is now too much excess. This can be seen from the recent fatigue of discount rates. They have all shifted from the gold market to the securities market, and their prices are still in the middle. The arrival of the British ambassador in Yunnan has made the air of peace even stronger. Big long positions continue to add positions. Retail short positions, although falling one after another, are ultimately unable to resist due to the disparity in strength. After this round of purchases, the chips on the table are becoming increasingly scarce. Class A has reached 62 yuan, and the market estimates that there is a hope of 65 yuan. Nine Six has also exceeded the 7 yuan mark. It is heard that the Northern Gang is buying, so there are still many good prospects. The high prices of January 10 are listed below for reference.

Yesterday's process: After Xinfeng Yong took the lead in buying, Defu Dafeng Tiansheng Yongkang and No. 4 successively absorbed. The sellers were all small numbers. Numbers 20, 38, and 41 all sold. Runli Lianhe and Yongkang also had some floating cuts. However, the supply and demand still felt very different. In the morning, it rose another four or five corners. In the afternoon, there were many who switched from short to long. Numbers 4 and 5 were particularly in demand. Tongshun Lianhe and Mao Tai all bought. Runli and No. 41 sold a little. Class A rose to 62 yuan, not far from the previous high price. The Nine Six public bond also broke through 7 yuan. The price is high, but the goods are scarce, which is a sign of continued upward movement. Market prices continued to rise by four to eight corners. The total number of transactions was at least 2.5 million yuan. Here is a simple table:

Category Maximum Minimum Closing Change from Previous Day January 10 Market Price Amount Higher than Yesterday's Closing

Unified Class A 62.00 61.00 61.90 Up 0.80 63.60 Higher 1.70

Unified Class B 54.70 53.60 54.50 Also 0.70 56.80 Higher 2.30

Unified Class C 53.50 52.25 53.00 Also 0.45 55.25 Higher 2.25

Unified Class D 53.10 52.30 52.90 Also 0.50 54.35 Higher 2.35

Unified Class E 53.05 52.10 52.75 Also 0.40 54.35 Higher 1.60

Nine Six 7.10 6.85 7.05 Also 0.25 7.40 Higher 0.35

This time, the interest rate will be 8%, and the dividend will be 2%, so each share will receive 2 yuan. The official interest from last year will also be paid at the same time.

According to the Zhongye Public Guild's report, the foreign stock market was better after U.S. President Roosevelt announced his call for peace. However, people are still not enthusiastic, because they have learned from the past few times that their wishes have not been fulfilled. Jardine Matheson shares traded actively, due to rising yarn prices, and the transaction price rose to 20 yuan and 1 corner. Public transportation traded at 27 yuan. Ruirong ordinary shares traded at 6 yuan and 7 corners and 5 cents. Yeguang shares were weak and traded at 8 yuan and 5 corners. Telephone 6% bonds traded in large quantities at 95 yuan.

U.S. statistics show that consumer rubber consumption in March was more than 50,000 tons, exceeding the hopes of rubber bulls. Inventories decreased by 12,000 tons. Under these circumstances, rubber raw materials and stocks should have a good impact and rise in normal times. People also expected the poor performance of local rubber companies in 1938 and will ignore future business. However, the Dutch rubber export tax in 1938 was one penny per pound, but this year it has been reduced to about 0.25 pennies.

### Finance: Tianjin Gang is Still Buying, Cash Prices Still Lack Change

Yesterday's cash "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) over-the-counter market remained sluggish and unchanged, with prices hovering between 2,075 yuan and 78 yuan all day. All parties are focusing on the content of the replies from the US and German presidents. Although the securities gang (代理 Tianjin gang) and cash accounts are buying, a certain gold shop and money exchange business are still selling a lot, so there is no impact. As a result, there is no honor or disgrace compared to last weekend. Not many transactions were made in one day, with only more than 400 taels in the morning and no trades in the afternoon. The silver shop's jewelry gold has not changed, and the customs gold and China-UK pure gold have not risen or fallen either.

烚赤" Not Traded in the Afternoon

In the morning, each bar of ten taels was first bid by the securities gang at 2,075 yuan, but the sellers were willing to supply only at 80 yuan. The two sides held on to each other until 9:50 before a deal was made. For the first time, the securities gang entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the opening price was 2,078 yuan, one yuan higher than the last weekend. After the opening, although the selling intention of a certain gold shop was strong, the absorption power of the cash account and the silver shop gang was still good, so the situation was quite stable. The gold shop sold a total of 100 taels to the silver shop gang and 50 taels to the cash account, and the prices were the same as the morning opening. Then, a money exchange business absorbed 50 taels from a certain silver shop, and the price was also 78 yuan. The cash account then entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the price was still 78 yuan. After this, a certain money exchange business suddenly sold, and at that time the buying intention was weak, so the situation was slightly weak. A certain money exchange business sold a total of 100 taels to the industry, and the prices were all 75 yuan. Later, the securities gang came back to absorb, and the potential situation stabilized. The securities gang entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the price was 77 yuan. It was already past 11 o'clock, and after that the supply and demand were scarce, and the price was also fixed. It was delayed until noon and no opening was seen, so the noon closing was still 77 yuan. In the afternoon, the supply and demand were even scarcer, and the market was sluggish. Although a certain money exchange business shouted 77 yuan to sell, the buyer offered 76 yuan to absorb, and the two sides held on to each other until the late closing and no single order was heard. It is said that the business of the money exchange industry is also quite quiet. According to the noon closing price of 2,077 yuan, the result is that there is no honor or disgrace compared to the closing price on Saturday night. The selling price of the cash account's own brand gold is 2,085 yuan, and the receiving price is 2,075 yuan. The current bid gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no opening.

Jewelry Gold Stands Still

Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael, has not changed because the "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) situation is very stable. Datong Bank is 211 yuan, Xin Tonghang is 209 yuan, and the receiving price is 203 yuan.

Customs Pure Gold Also Unchanged

The central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash is still 1,220 yuan and 3 corners, and the listed customs gold is also 2 yuan, 3 corners, and 9.6%. The Shanghai standard gold price has not changed either, at 1,207 yuan and 6 corners, which is due to the fact that the price of British pure gold per ounce in London on the 15th has not changed, still at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Has Not Decreased, Result is Flat

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no decrease in settlements by foreign firms. In addition, the Tianjin gang continued to buy. However, foreign banks such as HSBC supplied quite a bit, and Chinese banks once sold off US dollars, causing the US dollar to slightly weaken in the middle. However, it soon returned to flat. As a result, there was no honor or disgrace. Trading was still strong in the morning, but very quiet in the afternoon. The Hong Kong dollar was quite stable due to the balance of supply and demand.

At the beginning of the morning, the London large bar, near and far, was still flat. The New York silver price was still fixed. The London gold price had not risen or fallen. The exchange rates were flat for British pounds against US dollars, against Shanghai dollars, and against French francs. The US dollar suddenly rose to 4,375 (possibly a typo), not moving against Shanghai dollars, and rising 3,125 against French francs. The central listing of each exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening selling price was 8 cents and 25 for British pounds and 16 yuan and 0625 for US dollars, with no honor or disgrace compared to the noon closing on the weekend. After the opening, although foreign firms were buying, British Bank HSBC still supplied a good intention, so there was a lack of change. Foreign firm settlement at HSBC British pound 8 cents and 25, HSBC listing was announced without movement, and the silver balance tax announcement was also without ups and downs, still taxed at 5%. After this, the Chinese banks suddenly sold off US dollars, so the situation was slightly relaxed. The Chinese bank sold to Youli (代理 Tianjin gang) US dollars 16 yuan and 09375. Afterwards, foreign firm settlements gradually increased, so the potential situation turned flat. Foreign firms settled into Holland and a certain Hua Bi Bank US dollars 16 yuan and 0621. Near noon, the transaction turned clear, with only slight Hong Kong dollar trading, but the situation was also flat. Foreign firms absorbed Hong Kong dollars 56 yuan at Anda Bank, and by noon, the bank's selling price was no different from the morning opening.

The closing situation was quite quiet, and the price was also stable. It was only heard that foreign firms slightly settled foreign firms British pounds 8 cents and 25, but no transactions were heard for US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. By the late closing, the bank's selling price was British pounds 8 cents and 25, US dollars 16 yuan and 0625, and Hong Kong dollars 56 yuan. As a result, the British, US, and Hong Kong dollar exchanges had no ups and downs compared to the noon closing on the weekend.

### Australian Gold Notes Drop by 3.5 Corners Alone

Last Saturday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, local foreign exchange, foreign firms' needs were very strong, and foreign banks supplied smoothly. The US dollar position was also relatively ample, and it once loosened. Later, bank absorption was quite strong, and it gradually stabilized. As a result, British-American exchange rates had no honor or disgrace. The "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) opening was firm, but the buyers saw that the market price was already high, and the buying intention was weak. The sellers were afraid of the power of the guest gang, and it was difficult to recover their losses. The two sides insisted on not lowering, and the transaction suddenly felt scarce. There was no opening in the afternoon, and the market situation was stable and sluggish. However, the money exchange industry's "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) transactions were quite active, and it was more colorful than the exchange.

### Counterfeit Dingtu: To Know That the Virtue of Zhou Has Not Declined, How Can Jing Ask About the Ding?

"Stamp duty," Since the war, the post office has stopped selling it and there has been a temporary shortage. Later, market merchants jointly set up a method to transport it and distribute it to various industry guilds for sale, so that the business community can purchase it. In this extraordinary time, the government's income cannot be reduced, and the few points of "stamp duty" are also the obligations that the people should fulfill. Recently, it was heard that the "pseudo-Finance Bureau" also issued "pseudo-stamps" to collect people's wealth, forcing merchants in the occupied areas to purchase and affix them. Otherwise, for violating the "pseudo-rules," they would be fined heavily and their business would be stopped. The merchants in the occupied area, under special circumstances, endured humiliation and reluctantly found two, a brown one corner and a yellow one cent, with the title "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Stamp Tax Tickets" and the words "Republic of China Jiangsu Shangmai Area" stamped on them. The pattern has a "ding" (a kind of ancient Chinese cauldron) next to the pagoda, which is meant to indicate that it is a "counterfeit ding." To know that the virtue of Zhou has not declined, how can Jing ask about the Ding! (This newspaper)
