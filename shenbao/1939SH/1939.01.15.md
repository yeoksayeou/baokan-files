### Japanese Troops in Hejin Moving North - Fierce Fighting Breaks Out in the Eastern Suburbs of Yumen Ferry - Indications of Another Major Battle in Hunan Province - Situation North of Changsha Gradually Becoming Tense - Chinese Troops Control Key Areas East of Shiluo Islet

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops concentrated north of the confluence of the Yellow and Fen Rivers in southwestern Shanxi Province, near Hejin, have moved north in an attempt to seize the Yumen Ferry on the Yellow River. Fierce fighting has already broken out in the eastern suburbs of Yumen Ferry. (Reuters, 14th)

(Chongqing) Hunan Province appears to be showing signs of another major battle. Chinese military authorities were quite tight-lipped to a Reuters reporter who visited today, only admitting that the situation north of Changsha is gradually becoming tense. It is reported that the Japanese side has recently been making large-scale preparations in Hunan Province, such as building an airfield in Tongcheng and constructing a military road between Tongcheng and Yuezhou.

### Japanese Troops in Western Shanxi Completely Collapsing - Casualties No Less Than 15,000

(Beiping) According to reliable sources, the Japanese army's attempt to invade the Northwest has already failed. The Japanese troops in western Shanxi decided to advance west in five routes from places like Linfen and Fenyang, attempting to break through the main force of the Chinese army in one fell swoop, then cross the river and realize their pipe dream of invading Shaanxi and cutting off the Sino-Soviet communication line. However, the result was completely contrary to their expectations. Because the Chinese army had long understood the Japanese army's trick, when the Japanese army launched a fierce attack, they temporarily abandoned their strongholds, and at the same time sent large forces deep into the rear of the Japanese army, cutting off the Japanese army's communication lines. Then they concentrated their forces and launched a vigorous counterattack. Because the Japanese army could not take care of both ends, and was attacked from both front and rear, they could not help but retreat. According to general estimates, from the 27th of last month to the 12th of this month, the number of Japanese casualties in the western Shanxi area was no less than 15,000.

### Japanese Army Frequently Moving Troops on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Line - Intentions to Invade Guangxi Becoming Increasingly Aggressive

(Hong Kong) The Japanese army's intention to invade Guangxi is becoming increasingly aggressive. In recent days, the Japanese army has been frequently moving troops on the line from Guangzhou to Sanshui. Yesterday, more Japanese troops continued to arrive in places like Southwest Sanshui. Judging from their actions, they seem to be planning to advance into Wuzhou on a large scale along the Xijiang River, or detour along the Xiaobeijiang River, advancing deep into eastern Guangxi to threaten the rear of the Chinese army in Wuzhou. Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Theater Command, has returned to Guilin from the front line. The continuous bombing of the city by Japanese planes in recent days is due to this reason. According to the observations of foreign military experts, if the Japanese army invades Guangxi Province, it will inevitably suffer a severe blow and be trapped in a quagmire. Because Guangxi Province has continuous mountain ranges, making it easy to defend and difficult to attack. At the same time, military training in the province is the best in the country, and the number of young men who have been trained in the province has reached 5 million. Therefore, if the Japanese army dares to invade rashly, it will inevitably suffer a major setback. (Express News Agency, 14th)

Editorial

### On Wartime Food Control

Japan's invasion of China for more than a year, the sharp increase in war debts, and the economic collapse have long been revealed. In addition, this year's typhoons and earthquakes have greatly reduced harvests, and grain prices have risen sharply, reaching more than 37 yuan per stone, breaking the highest record in recent years. Losing the effectiveness of control and monopoly, the whole country is worried about military pay and people's food at all times. Therefore, in the rice-producing areas of China, large-scale purchases are made, control is carried out by cooperative organizations, and exploitation is carried out in the name of warehousing. In addition to being used as military pay for combat in China and exclusive trade, it is also transported back to the country in large quantities to make up for the shortage of people's food. According to yesterday's newspaper, recently, the Japanese side has directly searched for rice and grain from the producing areas and transported them to Shanghai. The amount of rice and grain transported to Dalian every week is quite large. Furthermore, unscrupulous merchants have been helping the Japanese. They raised funds to purchase rice and grain from Wuhu, Jiujiang, and other places, and handed them over to the Yangtze River Line of the Nisshin Company to transport to Shanghai. After arriving in Wusong, they were directly exported. The National Government, in view of the fact that food is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and is an essential item in the war, has recently issued a clear order restricting exports. However, it is still not enough to prevent the cunning schemes of the Japanese and unscrupulous merchants. To achieve results, only strict control can be implemented.

The strategy of food control is to regulate surpluses and deficits. Europe and the United States have implemented it with remarkable results. For example, food production control, food trade control, and food storage control all have specialized agencies in charge of their affairs. Japan also implemented control over food early on. China also focused on food adjustment at the beginning of the war of resistance. However, there was no organization, and the sudden implementation was ineffective. Although the food adjustment measures for the extraordinary period that it promulgated were essential, it seems that the full effect of control has not been achieved since its implementation. Now, in accordance with laws and regulations, and with reference to actual conditions, several points are listed for the authorities' reference:

(1) Finance and military go hand in hand: Food is an agricultural product. Food control cannot be separated from agricultural finance. In all areas affected by military affairs, agricultural financial institutions should double their efforts in a timely manner to build an economic defense line, such as handling agricultural loans and circulating agricultural products. Only when farmers in the war zone have a way out can military operations and the guerrilla forces in the rear be strengthened and consolidated, and the country can be protected. Therefore, agricultural financial institutions such as the Farmers Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China should develop the interior and should penetrate into the war zone to assist the military.

(2) Control of food trade: The government shall publicly set the highest and lowest prices of food according to actual needs. The market can freely buy and sell within the publicly set prices. When it is necessary to adjust the supply and demand of food, the government shall purchase or monopolize it. The import and export of food should be strictly controlled to maintain the balance of grain prices.

(3) Strengthen the food organization: Throughout the country, wherever administrative control reaches, the registration of food merchants and warehouses should be carried out urgently, and strict supervision should be carried out to avoid manipulation and private transportation. They should also be ordered to report the quantity of food purchased, sold, and stored on a regular basis. Alternatively, food adjustment agencies should be established in the county governments and chambers of commerce to be responsible for transportation, sales, adjustment, and supervision.

(4) Facilitate transportation and prohibit speculation: Between provinces and counties, according to their own food self-sufficiency and storage capacity, if there is a surplus or a shortage, the adjustment agency shall make as much mutual adjustment as possible. For legitimate transportation of food, the transportation authorities should give special convenience, and strictly investigate entrances and exits to prevent private transportation or leakage.

(5) Universally set up warehouse networks: Warehouses are places for food collection and distribution. They should be universally established in accordance with the Agricultural Warehouse Law. Financial institutions should provide funds to promote business to avoid food stagnation and other abnormal phenomena. Consumer warehouses should be set up in cities with concentrated populations, with government funds for large-scale purchases and storage for consumption. Transit warehouses (distribution warehouses) should be set up in places with convenient transportation to be responsible for centralization and distribution, in preparation for the purchase or sale of large quantities of food. Storage warehouses should be set up in safe production areas in the rear to store large quantities of food for military use and to prevent famine. In suitable locations in various villages, cooperative organizations, agricultural associations, or public welfare legal entities should be used to establish agricultural warehouses or simple agricultural warehouses to handle food storage, mortgage, processing, transportation, sales, and other businesses, or transfer and handle them to the above-mentioned major warehouses according to their nature. However, warehouses at all levels shall not aim at profit.

(6) Food monetization: After farmers harvest food, they should not keep it in their own hands for too long to prevent it from being absorbed by the enemy. If farmers need capital turnover, they can store it in warehouses. If they need processing, transportation, or storage, warehouses can handle it on their behalf. If they need to eat, they can redeem it from the warehouse or buy it from the market. The price is publicly set, so there will be no major losses. However, the price paid by the agricultural warehouse to the farmer for the food is generally paid in agricultural notes (warehouse warrants). This agricultural note is modeled after the interbank remittance notes used by the silver and money industry in Shanghai. It is only a chip for market transactions and restricts cash redemption (cash redemption can be done in stages and in quantities, because farmers' expenses are smaller, and bulk cash redemption can easily lead to waste) to prevent the enemy from occupying the farmers' legal tender in the war zone.

The above six are the main items of food control. The current Trade Commission, Agricultural Production Adjustment Commission, and relevant agricultural financial institutions can jointly form a central wartime food control agency to be in charge of it. The local food adjustment agencies and warehouses at all levels should be subject to their instructions and supervision. In this way, financial administration can be used to implement food control, which can not only prevent the enemy from being funded, but also facilitate adjustment, so that there can be sufficient food and soldiers, and national strength can be accumulated. The final victory can be easily achieved.

### Britain Sends Another Note to Japan - Urging Attention to Interests in China - and Demanding Explanation of the Konoe Declaration - Refusing to Recognize Unilateral Modification of Treaties

(London) The government has recently instructed Sir Robert Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, to submit a note to the Japanese government asking how the country intends to treat the interests of other countries in China. This note was delivered to the Japanese government this morning, and the original text will be published tomorrow. It is believed that the inquiry will focus on what explanation is given for the declaration issued by former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on December 22nd of last year. (Havas, 24th)

(Tokyo) The British ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, presented a note to Foreign Minister Arita at the Foreign Ministry this afternoon. It is reported that the content requires the Japanese side to provide clear and more detailed explanations of the policies mentioned in the three official declarations. The three declarations mentioned refer to Konoe's declarations on November 3rd and December 22nd last year, and Foreign Minister Arita's conversation with foreign reporters on December 19th. It is heard that the note reiterated Britain's adherence to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, expressing its refusal to accept the unilateral modification of treaties, but stating that Britain is prepared to consider constructive proposals regarding the modification of treaties. (Reuters, 14th)

(London) The Financial Times today published a letter from Sir Hubert Gough, commander of the Fifth Army from 1916 to 1918, stating that China's position threatens to destroy all of British trade in the Far East and the vast interests of the Empire, and that it is now time for the government to resolutely deal with this danger. The loss of huge investments in China will greatly reduce the income of the British nation, increase the British unemployment problem, and make British taxpayers bear heavier burdens. We greatly lament the hardline plan, but if we think of our own interests and safety, there is a limit to tolerance, and we can no longer tolerate it beyond this. Diplomatic documents and protests have no effect on the Japanese. The British government has a responsibility to take a more resolute attitude. It is important to know that in addition to the loss of trade, our territories in Asia and the Pacific, including India, may not be preserved, and the safety of Australia will also be threatened. The letter concluded, "But the "winning cards" are not all in the hands of the anti-Third International powers, we do hold some very reliable "winning cards" or perhaps the most reliable in the overall situation."

### Japanese Financial Crisis: Huge Military Spending Unmanageable, Currency Inflation Causes People to Suffer

A Havas dispatch from New York in January states that the Japanese financial difficulties are receiving much attention here. The country's mainland and its occupied territories in East Asia are on the verge of a malignant currency inflation. The detrimental impact on the economy is incalculable and widely known. Observing the country's massive budget for the next year (10,000,000,000 yen), one can only be more convinced. The amount of banknotes in circulation in the country increased significantly last year, but production did not increase accordingly. This can be considered a genuine currency inflation. The paper money issued by the country in 1932 totaled 1,000,000,000 yen. Until recent months, it has increased to 2,000,000,000 yen, more than doubling. Conversely, industry and commerce have not developed accordingly, only maintaining the status quo, and later even declining. The military industry has indeed made rapid progress, but it does not help, and even has a negative impact on ordinary industry and commerce. According to statistics in the Wall Street Journal, the total number of industrial and commercial production in Japan had already increased to 118.8 in August 1937 (compared to 85 in 1931). Up to the present, it has fallen to 104.6. At the same time, the wholesale price index was 120 in 1932. It rose to 160 by the end of the year due to the devaluation of the yen. Since then, although the government has been engaged in economic control, the price index has continued to increase. By June of last year, it had risen to 237.2, and then fell back to 230.7 in September. As for the economic controls implemented by the Japanese government, although they have had a considerable impact on the level of industrial prices, they have been of no benefit to ordinary consumers due to the increase in living standards. This can be proven by the statistics published by the Bank of Japan. The retail price index (assuming 1914 is 100) was 174 in August 1937, but it had increased to 203 by the same month last year. At the same time, the standard of living was 194 in 1937, but it had increased to 211 last year. How significant the crisis facing the country is, goes without saying. Moreover, how can the budget for the next year not aggravate this crisis? Based on this, industry and commerce in the areas occupied by Japan in China will inevitably remain depressed. The so-called "considerable stability" in some quarters is unlikely to be achieved, and the disputes between Japan and the countries involved will inevitably become more serious. This can be asserted.

Hong Kong: According to observations from foreigners in Shanghai, Japan's foreign trade in 1938 was extremely weak, and cash reserves have been exported a lot. If the foreign trade situation this year is the same as last year, Japan's cash reserves will be exhausted, and Japan will lose its economic independence. Its adventurous actions in China must be stopped, and its new military equipment must be reduced. It is too early to say that the Japanese economy is about to collapse, but if all countries take economic retaliation against Japan at this time, Japan will not be able to bear it. (14th dispatch)

### Wei Lihuang Discusses the War Situation in Shanxi and Henan: The Enemy's Strength Is Almost Exhausted; Victory Belongs to Us Without a Doubt

(Luoyang) General Wei Lihuang, who has been fighting on the western front for more than a year and has repeatedly made meritorious service, was recently promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the [omitted number] War Zone. He arrived in Luoyang yesterday afternoon to take up his new post. The reporters stationed in Luoyang visited him this afternoon, and Wei personally received them. Wei first described the war situation in Shanxi, saying, "The enemy forces in Shanxi have exhausted their strength after more than a year of continuous attacks by our forces. The points and areas they occupy have also lost contact due to our continuous destruction and attacks, forming isolated pockets. The enemy often boasts of being proactive, but now they have become passive. On the other hand, we are active across the board, attacking day and night, causing the enemy to be preoccupied and exhausted. Generally, there is concern that the enemy will cross the Yellow River and invade southward. If we can understand the enemy's exhausted situation in Shanxi and the strong strength of our army, hold fast to the north bank, and have natural barriers, the enemy's claim to cross the river is nothing more than a dream." He then talked about commanding the war in Henan, saying, "Henan is the Central Plains of our country, the intersection of the southeast and northwest, and is related to the future of the entire war situation. I feel that my position is difficult and my abilities are weak. I sincerely hope that all sectors will sincerely assist. Today, the success or failure of the war of resistance is not a matter of short-term gains or losses, but concerns the survival of the entire nation and country. The strong national spirit and local armed forces of Henan Province have long been known to the people of the country. If this latent force can be used well, it is even more effective than the military. Therefore, I am determined to come to Henan to first promote the strengths of the people and give them full expression in the great effectiveness of the war of resistance. At the same time, I hope that the people can thoroughly understand that today's war of resistance is by no means a matter for a few people. If the war of resistance fails, no one can escape the tragic fate." He then cited the suffering of the people in the occupied areas of Shanxi, saying, "In order to achieve their poisonous plan of 'destroying China and exterminating the race', the enemy forces the people to be injected with drugs, causing them to become disabled, so that they can be driven as cattle and horses. China has not perished, but the painful lessons are so clear. It can be seen that the day the war of resistance fails is the time when everyone enters hell and becomes slaves. We have to be aware of this. The enemy's weapons are indeed stronger than ours, but as long as the whole country is united to the end, we can definitely overcome them with this fearless spirit. We must have firm self-confidence, that is, 'with me here, China will not perish'. If everyone is like this, then victory belongs to us without a doubt." The reporter then asked about the future of the Henan war. Wei said that the terrain in the western Henan area is absolutely favorable to us. All the transportation lines that need to be destroyed have been destroyed, and the remaining main routes are under our surveillance. With our proper deployment and the assistance of the people, the enemy will never succeed. He instructed the reporter to comfort the people of the country. At this point, the reporter left with great interest. (13th dispatch)

### Two New Railroads Built in Yunnan Province: One Connects to Burma, One Connects to Sichuan; Important Lifelines for Military Transportation; High Mountains and Difficult Journey

Kunming: Large teams of workers are currently engaged in arduous work, building two new railroads. If the Sino-Japanese War extends to 1941, these two new railroads will become two important lifelines for importing military supplies into China. One of the new routes connects Kunming with Burma, with a length of 773 kilometers. The other route connects Kunming with Xufu [now Yibin, Sichuan], with a length of 774 kilometers. Most of the land passed through is mountainous, so the project is very difficult. Because many bridges need to be built and hundreds of tunnels need to be dug, Yunnan Chairman Long Yun told a Reuters interviewer that he expects the Kunming-Xufu route to be completed in April 1941, and the Kunming-Burma route to be completed around the same time. The government has been considering the construction of these two routes for several years. If the Sino-Japanese War had not occurred, I am afraid they would still be in the realm of ideals. The two routes will connect at Wangqiying. Chairman Long Yun held a groundbreaking ceremony there on Christmas Day, with the heads of various departments of the Yunnan Provincial Government and thousands of people participating in the ceremony. In the future, when the two routes are completed, Wangqiying will become an important location. Land prices in the area have already begun to rise. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

Kunming Communication on the 26th: Two major national defense arteries, the Yunnan-Burma and Xufu-Kunming railroads, held a joint groundbreaking ceremony on December 25 of this year at Wangqiying, the location of two stations in Kunming County. Chairman Long presided over everything on behalf of everyone. More than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests participated, which was a grand occasion. The Yunnan-Burma Road is 773 kilometers long, and the Xufu-Kunming Road is 774 kilometers long. One passes through Anning, Lufeng, Guangtong, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Yao'an, Yunnan Station, Mengding, and reaches Nanda (Burma). One passes through Malong, Qujing, Xuanwei, Weining, Yiliang, Yanjin, and reaches Xufu in Sichuan.

London: Today, The Times published an article entitled "China's Back Door" discussing the potential of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, saying that the Chinese government can be very proud of what it has achieved, because the success of this road is probably the largest engineering project in recent years. The Japanese are now quietly awaiting developments, which is undoubtedly true, but their actions cannot be predicted at present. It also said that although the Yunnan-Burma Highway is strong and wide, keen observers are hesitant to immediately draw conclusions as to whether the road can handle the heavy transport and not require major additions to the project, but the Chinese have built some large-scale stone bridges and have the determination and amazing ability to continue working on them. The transportation of government goods can start this month until May, assuming that 100 trucks are dispatched every day, carrying 100 tons of cargo, and the entire round trip will take two weeks. It is estimated that 10,000 tons of goods can be transported in the three and a half months from now until the start of the rainy season. However, it is difficult to rely on the road for commercial transportation during the period from the start of the rainy season to November or December. By then, the war situation in China may have changed. The Times also published an editorial about the railway, saying that this road is a monument to the resources and determination of the Chinese people and should be passed down forever. Its significance is extremely obvious, but it would be inappropriate to make excessive speculation about its future. The editorial went on to mention the 500,000-pound export credit loan that the British lent to China to purchase trucks for the road, saying that it would not be unreasonable for the Chinese to regard such actions by the West as bizarre. The Chinese are very grateful for the funds to help them develop trade routes that are beneficial to both parties, but if this not-so-large aid is only allocated after the road that they have built independently is completed, the Chinese may not be able to avoid feeling somewhat disappointed. The construction of this road was initiated by the Chinese, and in the future, it may enable Britain to make up for its losses in the Yangtze River and elsewhere. It is strange that the British government and Rangoon only realized this kind of possibility today. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

### America Defends Democracy: The Time Has Come

(Chongqing) The Chinese here expressed great interest in President Roosevelt's message on reorganizing the military. According to Chinese officials (including many senior officials), the United States has embarked on the right path. At the same time, some high-ranking Chinese officials compared today's America with yesterday's China. It is said that the US president's request to strengthen the air force and the current reconstruction of the Chinese air force are similar in nature, because both countries now realize that without a strong air force, it is not easy to achieve results in any attack or defense. It is also said that Roosevelt's plan has shown the increasing consolidation of the anti-aggression front of democratic countries, and the US recognizes the impossibility of acting in isolation. The time has come for independent factions to no longer ignore the activities of Japanese spies in the Panama Canal area and the expansion of German forces to South America. People here generally believe that they will defend democracy and give China greater assistance. (Associated Press dispatch on the 14th)

### China Orders Airplanes from America: Statement from the Highest Authorities

(Chongqing) Today, the highest authorities in China said that there were rumors that the Chinese side had ordered 200 new-style aircraft worth US$8,500,000 from the American Berrenca Aircraft Company. It is said that this may have been ordered by Chinese private financiers in the United States. The Chinese government has never purchased from the company. According to American pilots, their opinion is that the aircraft produced by Berrenca Company are not suitable for war. Twenty aircraft from the company were shipped from the United States last year, but none of them were good fighters. Only nine remain, and they can only be used for training. The twenty Berrenca aircraft were originally shipped to Spain for the government army to fight, but as a result, they were shipped back to the United States from France and were never used. Patriotic Chinese in New York learned of this and specially purchased them to donate to the Chinese government. Therefore, even these twenty Berrenca Company aircraft were not ordered by the Chinese government. Berrenca Company aircraft are good for long-distance flights or races, but are not suitable for combat or bombing. Therefore, even if the Chinese government wants to buy aircraft, it should order better aircraft that are suitable for combat. (Associated Press dispatch on the 14th)

### Rome Talks End: British Prime Minister Quickly Returns to London; Vague Content of the Communiqué; This Trip Yields No Concrete Results

(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain boarded a train and quickly returned to London at 12:05 noon today. Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano saw him off at the station. When the military band played the British national anthem, British expatriates who came to the station to see him off sang loudly. Before boarding the train, Prime Minister Chamberlain had a few words with Mussolini, then shook hands and parted. The atmosphere was extremely cordial. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)

(London) Foreign Minister Halifax left Rome this morning at 7:30 and went straight to Geneva to attend the Executive Council meeting of the League of Nations, and met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet to inform him of the results of the British-Italian talks, and returned here in the afternoon of the 17th in order to attend the Cabinet meeting on the 18th. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)

(Rome) The joint communiqué on the Rome British-Italian talks, which ended on Thursday afternoon, was published here last night, saying that the current major issues and British-Italian relations have been studied. The talks were extremely friendly, and the exchange of views was very frank. Both sides confirmed their intention to develop relations between the two countries in the spirit of friendship expressed in the British-Italian agreement of April 16, and decided to proceed with the establishment of the specifics stipulated in the agreement at the earliest opportunity. During the talks, the British and Italian sides reiterated their firm determination to pursue a policy aimed at maintaining peace. The two governments have been committed to this policy and will continue to do so in the future.

It is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, when meeting with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, although he proclaimed his desire for peace, did not make any special statements regarding France. Last night, the British and Italian prime ministers had a short meeting and agreed on the original text of the communiqué on their talks. The courtesies in Rome for the British side ended last night. After the British Embassy in Italy held a banquet, there was a farewell reception, and Mussolini and Ciano also attended. Chamberlain and Halifax will leave Rome this afternoon and arrive in London tomorrow night. According to the current arrangement, Chamberlain will not pass through Paris on his way back home.

The British here now believe that the trip to Rome by the British side has achieved its purpose, because the frank exchange of views between the two sides has cleared the air and allowed each other to understand each other's sincere desire for peace. One of the characteristics of this talk is the directness and clarity with which Mussolini expressed his views on the various issues discussed. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members did not yield any concrete results, nor were any issues discussed in detail. Although the port of Djibouti in French East Africa is one of the places Italy requested France to cede, Prime Minister Mussolini did not mention the port when explaining Italy's requests. The British cabinet members only listened to this and said that Italy's requests were purely related to French-Italian relations, and Britain had no reason to interfere. The Italian cabinet members also requested that the rights of belligerent groups be granted to the Spanish National Army. The British cabinet members still insisted that this could only be done after all foreign volunteers had withdrawn from Spain. In addition, the Jewish issue was also discussed. According to Mussolini, this is a matter of internal affairs related to various countries, and it is not appropriate to interfere. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)

(London) According to The Times today, during the talks in Rome, Prime Minister Chamberlain, on the one hand, strongly urged Mussolini to conduct direct negotiations with Paris to resolve French-Italian relations. At the same time, on the other hand, he solemnly stated the close connection between Britain and France, saying that this connection is even closer than a formal agreement, so Britain cannot sit idly by if France is threatened. The British and Italian governments are in complete agreement on the issue of reducing armaments, believing that a clearer understanding must be obtained before any actual restrictions are carried out. Third, regarding the refugee issue, Mussolini expressed his willingness to cooperate and put forward constructive proposals. Fourth, regarding the Spanish situation, Italy insisted on its original position without making any concessions. The diplomatic assistant of the Daily Telegraph declared that the most thorny issue that politicians could not reach an agreement on was the Spanish issue, but if the war in Spain becomes more obvious, Mussolini's attitude can be softened. Therefore, it is expected that the negotiations on this kind of stalemate will be reopened in the future. (Haitong dispatch on the 14th)

### Italy Invites Britain to Mediate in the French-Italian Dispute; Rome Newspaper Issues Statement Denying

(Rome) The Telegraph, which is known for reflecting the views of Foreign Minister Ciano, recently published an important article today, denying that Italy intends to invite Britain to mediate the dispute between France and Italy, and saying that Italy should consider direct negotiations with France. Its words read, "In January 1935, the reason why Italy agreed to sign an agreement with France was because it was preparing to use force against Abyssinia. Afterwards, France failed to keep its promise and instead participated in the sanctions against Italy, which was wrong. At this time, Italy is unwilling to reopen negotiations with France based on the above agreement. This does not mean that Italy is absolutely pro-war. Once France's attitude is calmer and no longer aggressive, we should seek other ways to solve this problem. In short, once the environment between France and Italy changes, the Italian government will not oppose reopening negotiations with France.

### Difficulty in Resolving Water Conservancy Problems in East Africa between Britain and Italy

(London) People in foreign circles here recently declared that there are still important issues between Britain and Italy that have not been resolved by the British-Italian agreement (April 16, 1938), namely, the boundaries between Egypt, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and the Abyssinian Empire have not yet been surveyed. According to the communiqué issued by the British and Italian cabinet members after the talks in Rome, this issue must be resolved as soon as possible by signing an agreement. The British, Italian, and Egyptian authorities have recently discussed it through diplomatic channels, but have not yet reached an agreement. The main difficulty lies in the water conservancy problem of Lake Tana. This lake originates in Abyssinia and is the source of the Blue Nile in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the Nile in Egypt. The British and Egyptian authorities want to build sluices on the shore of the lake to guide the lake water into the Blue Nile and the Nile. The Italian authorities want to protect the rights of the lake and have not agreed to do so. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)

### Press Commentary: French Newspapers; Italian Prime Minister's Peace Declaration is Considered Barely Satisfactory

(Paris) According to Le Matin, which usually reflects the views of the French Foreign Ministry, the results of the British-Italian Rome talks are not as negative as generally thought. Although Chamberlain refused to take a neutral stance and intervene in the French-Italian dispute, Mussolini's expression of hope for peace is already barely satisfactory. The newspaper considers it important that the Italian Prime Minister pointed out that he has the determination to advocate peace and is willing to respect the Mediterranean status quo stipulated in the British-Italian agreement of April last year, but pessimists still have doubts about it. The official report published in Rome mentioned solemnly that the two sides should promote a policy of peace. At the same time, British Prime Minister Chamberlain also stated last night that although this meeting did not establish a formal agreement, the understanding between the two governments has been established. Regarding France's position, the newspaper pointed out that French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet's response to Italy's demands has been extremely clear and there is no room for misunderstanding. When Daladier inspected Africa, he repeatedly stated the government's position. Although Mussolini was aware of this attitude, he still stated to Chamberlain that Italy could not be held responsible if it became involved in war. This is why the newspaper believes that the Italian Prime Minister's peace declaration is of great significance. (Haitong dispatch on the 14th)

### Italian Newspapers: The Results of the Rome Talks Have Established a Foundation for Understanding

Milan: The Italian newspapers expressed satisfaction with the end of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome. Il Popolo d'Italia stated that the historical and political significance of Chamberlain's visit to Rome is that the politicians of the two major empires that are about to be involved in war can meet again, thereby re-establishing the relationship between the two countries on a new foundation of friendship and equality. The newspaper continued to say that the British politicians' decision to visit Rome repeatedly determined the fate of the British-Italian agreement and started new cooperation to consider the real situation in Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa. This long Rome meeting can also be regarded as the end of the Munich Agreement. The fact is that Britain is unanimously willing to develop general peaceful relations and confirms that the Rome Agreement was also established based on the principles of the Munich Agreement. According to La Stampa, the purpose of the British politicians' visit to Rome was to establish the direct friendship of representatives of the two major empires in order to seek direct mutual understanding and to seek peace and justice. This goal has now been achieved. The establishment of the British-Italian agreement can not only be a successful test of the Spanish war, but it can also be expected to conclude a special agreement to completely solve the African problem. Il Popolo d'Italia also stated that Italy does not hope that Britain will act as a mediator in the French-Italian dispute. Once France's anger and emotions calm down, Italy can conduct direct talks with France. If France does not treat it with arrogance, the Italian fascist government is willing to negotiate with it.

### Indignant Media Scorn France with Reckless Criticism in the Vein of a Village Woman

(Rome) The Fascist Party's radical organ, "Il Tevere," recently published an article written by its chief editor, Indro Montanelli, fiercely criticizing France with an intensity rarely seen. It stated, "The entire citizenry of the French Republic is weak and incompetent. We spit in their faces and declare that the security of French territory during the European War was granted by Italy. In the initial months of the war, the French army suffered repeated defeats and was pursued by German forces. Had it not been for the rescue by Italian troops, the consequences would have been unimaginable." The French hero Napoleon I was originally Italian. At the time, France was merely "an Italian colony." The French often slander the value of Italian soldiers, ignorant of the fact that many Italian soldiers who died in the European War are buried on French soil. There is a French fable stating that the French rooster does not fear the Roman wolf, which is absurd. In reality, this rooster now suffers from arteriosclerosis and has become a cowardly and useless chicken. We now spit phlegm in the faces of the French, knowing that the value of Italian spit is greater than that of those upon whom it is spat. Italians should not waste any more saliva on the Third French Republic." (Havas, 13th)

### National Representatives Gather in Geneva; League of Nations Executive Council to Meet Tomorrow; China Eagerly Awaits Tangible Assistance from the Powers; Gu Weijun Meets with French Foreign Minister in Paris

(Paris) The 103rd session of the League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to convene on the 16th of this month. The Chinese government's appeal regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute remains on the agenda, but it may not be brought up for debate. Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun met with Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon to discuss this matter. According to the report passed by the League of Nations Executive Council on September 30th of last year, member states should individually implement sanctions against Japan, which was accepted by the Chinese representative on the condition that the Chinese government's appeal remain on the agenda for future discussion. (Havas, 13th)

(Geneva) The 103rd session of the League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to convene on the 16th of this month. The British delegation, led by Butler, arrived this morning. Foreign Secretary Halifax is expected to arrive from Berlin tonight. Upon the arrival of French Foreign Minister Bonnet tomorrow morning, discussions regarding the Anglo-Italian talks will commence. Both Foreign Minister Bonnet and Foreign Secretary Halifax are expected to return to their respective countries on the evening of the 16th and may not attend the Executive Council meeting. In addition, regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from both sides of the Spanish Civil War, the League of Nations has dispatched a commission to investigate. The commission's report will be reviewed by a committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Iran on the 16th of this month, and its full text may be released on that day. It is reported that in July of last year, the number of foreign volunteers on both sides of the Spanish Civil War was no more than 38,000, and there has been no actual increase since then. (Havas, 14th)

(Chongqing) As the League of Nations Executive Council is about to convene, the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement has telegraphed the General Assembly, requesting that Presidents Cecil and Cot, following the precedent of the declaration issued for Spain, issue a declaration outlining the League of Nations' minimum responsibility towards China and urging the League to accept China's legitimate and reasonable demands, in order to galvanize support. (Telegram, 14th)

(Chongqing) Today's *Ta Kung Pao* editorial urges the League of Nations Executive Council meeting convened in Geneva on January 16th to take concrete measures to assist China, and proposes three suggestions: 1. Provide economic and financial assistance to China; 2. Cease supplying or transporting fuel, ammunition, and other military materials to Japan; 3. Do not create obstacles to China's resistance effort regarding the transit of military supplies through member states' territories. This third point clearly refers specifically to France, as French Indochina currently restricts the passage of military supplies destined for China through its territory. The newspaper further stated that the League of Nations should require the powers with interests in China to jointly assist China in curbing Japanese aggression. (Reuters, 14th)

### British Public Eagerly Donates to Aid Chinese War Zone Refugees; Exceeds £163,000

(London) The British fund for Chinese disaster relief has now reached over £163,000. The fund's secretary, Thomson, stated that donations continue to pour in, but the need for the funds is becoming even more urgent. (Reuters, 14th)

### French Mediterranean Fleet to Regularly Patrol North Africa; Italian Troops Concentrated on Somali Border; French Authorities Take Precautionary Measures

(Paris) The French Mediterranean Fleet is scheduled to begin patrolling the North African coast on the 18th of this month. General Gamelin, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Vice Admiral Darlan, Chief of Naval Staff, are also scheduled to depart from Toulon on the 19th of this month to inspect defenses in the North African territories, including Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. (Havas, 14th)

(London) News has been received from Djibouti, French Somaliland, that Italy is concentrating troops in Modar, Jaleelo, and Sardo, areas bordering Italian and French Somaliland, and is recruiting natives in the Harar province of Abyssinia to form an army. The French Somaliland colonial authorities, upon hearing this news, have taken precautionary measures. (Havas, 13th)

(Paris) Regarding reports from London that Italy is concentrating troops on the French Somaliland border, the French Foreign Ministry and military authorities stated that they have no knowledge of this. (Havas, Reuters, 13th)

### Germany Pursuing Anti-Dutch Campaign; Disrupting European Order; Likely a Pre-Planned Step

(London) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent reports that the London political circles are not alarmed by rumors of an anti-Dutch movement in Germany. However, rumors of Hitler's future attacks are spreading everywhere, with Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Memel, Danzig, the Netherlands, and Belgium all said to be potential victims. According to reliable sources, the British view is that such alarming rumors should not be officially acknowledged, so as not to further exacerbate the current tension. The policy of keeping all of Europe on tenterhooks is being observed to determine its outcome: whether it will be secret military preparations or overt economic pressure. Although Britain does not have a formal treaty obligation to the Netherlands, the historical ties and strategic relationship between the two countries mean that their interests are intertwined. While reports of German economic pressure on the Netherlands have not been officially confirmed, official circles also believe that a German military attack on the Netherlands is unlikely. (Reuters, 14th)

### Hungary Joins Anti-Communist Bloc; Signing Scheduled Within the Coming Week; Berlin and Rome Express Satisfaction

(Budapest) The Hungarian government recently issued a communiqué stating that the German, Italian, and Japanese ambassadors jointly visited Foreign Minister Csáky this afternoon. Count Vinci, the Italian ambassador and the senior of the three, spoke on behalf of their respective governments, formally inviting Hungary to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Foreign Minister Csáky expressed his gratitude and stated that Hungary had decided to join the pact. The formal signing ceremony will be held here within the coming week. (Havas, 13th)

(Rome) Following Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, the general public here has expressed satisfaction, stating that Foreign Minister Ciano had already made recommendations during his visit to Hungary on December 19th of last year. Political circles believe that Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact is the first step, and the second step will follow. (Havas, 13th)

(Berlin) After the Berlin official circles announced that Hungary had accepted the invitation from Germany, Italy, and Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, the local newspapers expressed great pleasure at the news. One newspaper stated that those who join the Anti-Comintern Pact should not only be aware of the dangers of Bolshevism but also know how to fight it. This cannot be achieved through speeches and resolutions. What is needed is the iron will of the entire nation. The Anti-Comintern Pact does not have imperialistic goals but only the pure task of creating world peace and order for those who suffer from communist harm. (Reuters, 14th)

(Tokyo) Today, all Japanese newspapers printed the news of Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact in large characters. With the exception of *Asahi Shimbun*, none of the newspapers carried any criticism of the Anglo-Italian talks in Rome. According to *Asahi Shimbun*, it was expected that the meeting between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Mussolini would not yield concrete results. Given the overall European environment since mid-December of last year, it was not accidental that the Anglo-Italian talks failed to reach a satisfactory agreement. (Reuters, 14th)

### Hungarian Political Parties in Bitter Conflict; Opposition to Close Ties with Germany and Italy; Unprecedented Turmoil in Parliament

(Budapest) The conflict between the party led by Imrédy in the coalition government and the opposition parties led by Count Bethlen and Dr. Eckhardt is intensifying, as the opposition parties are greatly dissatisfied with the government's increasingly close ties with the Berlin-Rome axis. Unprecedented turmoil has erupted during parliamentary sessions, and there are indications that further developments will follow. (Reuters, 14th)

### Eighty-Nine American Warships Traverse Panama Canal; End-to-End Extends 45 Miles; Commercial Shipping Temporarily Suspended

(Cristobal) Last night, eighty-nine American warships, including the Navy's largest battleships, began moving 45 miles through the Panama Canal towards the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean for inspection. Naval authorities requested that journalists not publish details or distinctive features of this American naval action, but that they could openly criticize its effectiveness. American troops tightened security at all important canal entrances, prohibiting anyone from approaching, while military aircraft patrolled overhead, maintaining a tight defense. The coast of Balboa, near the Pacific entrance of the canal, was placed under complete martial law when the giant aircraft carrier "Lexington" led the entire fleet into the first lock at 4:59 AM. Other battleships, destroyers, minesweepers, submarines, and numerous auxiliary vessels were waiting on the coast. Commercial shipping was temporarily suspended and will only resume after the entire naval fleet has passed through. The final flagship to pass through the Panama Canal is expected to be the "Pennsylvania." Naval authorities stated that the canal must operate around the clock to allow the naval fleet to pass quickly, but there is no attempt to set a speed record. The Pacific Fleet will join the Atlantic Fleet for the inspection. The main components include 200 battleships, hundreds of aircraft, and 150,000 personnel. This inspection began last week when the Pacific Fleet secretly departed from the West Coast. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Roosevelt's Defense Plan; Increase Aircraft Production; Build 13,000 in Three Years; Private Factories to Cooperate with the Government

(Washington) President Roosevelt stated today that the proposed expansion of the American air force could give the United States 13,000 military aircraft. This plan can be carried out by existing private aircraft factories. Roosevelt did not discuss the exact number of aircraft to be built under his new defense program at the press briefing. In his message to Congress, he stated that at least 3,000 aircraft would be built, but he added that "it is hoped that such large-scale orders will reduce costs and increase the number of aircraft." (Associated Press, 13th)

(Washington) Today, Air Force authorities announced that Roosevelt's request for emergency defense funding would make the United States the leader in air power, with approximately 13,000 first-line aircraft within two to three years. Yesterday, Roosevelt requested $525,000,000 in a special message to Congress, of which $210,000,000 would be used for the 1940 air force budget. The remaining funds will be paid out gradually according to contracts. This sum is not included in the $1,100,000,000 budget for the army and navy in 1940. (Associated Press-Japan, 13th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt expressed his opinion that he believes the existing American aircraft factories are sufficient to build the new aircraft needed for defense, although some factories may need to operate two or three shifts around the clock. The limiting factor in production may be the inability to recruit enough skilled workers for the factories. President Roosevelt estimated that 15 percent of aircraft factory workers need to be highly skilled, while the remaining 85 percent can be quickly trained from workers in the automotive and other industries. Some factories will need to be expanded, but except for some experimental aircraft, all new aircraft will be built by private factories. Government factories, such as those that previously manufactured new cannons, have sufficient capacity to produce the required artillery. President Roosevelt also mentioned efforts to accelerate shipbuilding, stating that this effort does not face labor difficulties, but the Navy's policy of maintaining an average number of long-term employees in shipyards delays the completion of each warship. (Reuters, 14th)

### Roosevelt Suffers Setback in Congress; Request for Work Relief Funds Not Passed in Full

(Washington) President Roosevelt suffered his first setback today from the 76th Congress when the House of Representatives passed a $725,000,000 emergency relief bill by a vote of 397 to 16. In his message to Congress last week, President Roosevelt had requested a prompt appropriation of $875,000,000 for relief. The result of the clash between conservative Democrats and new Republicans in Congress was the inclusion of the following restrictions on this appropriation: (1) The funds should be allocated evenly over the remaining months of the fiscal year to avoid the reappropriation of public administrative expenses; (2) The President's attempt to include a total of 37,000 personnel from public administration in the civil service ranks is invalid; (3) The bill prohibits relief for foreigners; (4) The difference in public administration salaries between the North and South cannot exceed 25 percent. (Associated Press, 13th)

### Spanish Government Forces Continue to Win Counteroffensives; Fiercest Scene Unfolds Along the Ebro River Front

(Lleida) The entire Ebro River, from its mouth, has now fallen into the hands of the Nationalist forces after General Yagüe's Moroccan division suddenly invaded the mouth of Tortosa, 45 miles south of Tarragona. In this decisive battle, the Nationalist forces advanced 20 miles and regained 150 square miles of territory. Several units of the government forces, knowing that their retreat routes had been cut off, surrendered. The government forces have suffered heavy casualties and numerous prisoners in the current Battle of Catalonia. It is believed that this is the fiercest scene in the entire civil war. In recent days, the Nationalist forces have also captured a large amount of military supplies, including 20 million rounds of ammunition. (Reuters, 14th)

(Barcelona) According to Spanish government sources, government forces advancing southeast on the Estremadura front have reached a point less than 25 miles from the Nationalist stronghold of Cordoba. Government forces have now reached the vicinity of the town of Villsasa, a key road junction. Yesterday morning, government forces launched a second decisive offensive, aimed at relieving the pressure on Madrid. Fighting is currently taking place on the Brunete front west of Madrid, the site of the government forces' first major offensive in July 1937. The salient held by the Nationalist forces along the road from Toledo to the southwest gates of Madrid is in danger of being cut off by government forces. (Reuters, 14th)

### All Young Spanish Men Mobilized

(Barcelona) The Republican government held a Council of Ministers meeting yesterday and immediately decided on various important measures, placing the entire territory under its control under a state of war. The main points are: (1) All physically fit men under the age of 44 will be mobilized; (2) All male and female citizens aged 20 to 45 will participate in military training; (3) All retired civil servants should be recalled to service; (4) An investigation should be conducted into the reasons why mobilized soldiers are in the rear, and if necessary, they should be sent to the front lines; (5) All items that can be used for military purposes should be utilized as much as possible to avoid waste; (6) Bunkers should be constructed. The determination of the Republican government to defend its territory with maximum effort can be seen in these measures. (Havas, 13th)

According to reliable sources, government forces on the front line in Tortosa, Tarragona Province, eastern Spain, are retreating towards the hills of Llus and Falcó in order to defend Tarragona Province. The masses are taking the old and young, carrying all their possessions, and retreating with the army. The Republican government is also preparing to move from Barcelona to Valencia, with only Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister del Vayo remaining in Barcelona to command the military of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia.

### Over Sixty Japanese Warships Sail Out of the Pearl River

(Hong Kong) Foreign Dispatch: Over sixty Japanese warships left Humen at 13:00, sailing through Lingding out of the Pearl River. Their destination is unknown, but it is generally believed that they are carrying troops to Beihai. (Thirteenth Day Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to reports, over twenty Japanese warships have indeed sailed to the waters outside the Pearl River Estuary, including Sampan Chau, Soko Islands, and Da Chan Island. Large numbers of Japanese soldiers and military supplies are landing at Humen, transferring to Taiping, Dongguan City, Shilong, Shitan, Xincheng, and other places. (Fourteenth Day Telegram)

Sea Defense: According to the "Haiphong Post," a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy in Guangzhou stated that navigation on the Pearl River remains blockaded. Recently, an order was received from the Naval Ministry in Tokyo, granting the naval authorities in China full authority to decide on the opening or closing of various inland rivers in China. As for why the British ship "Kinshan" was permitted to travel from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, it was merely an expression of goodwill from Japan towards third countries. Furthermore, the "Kinshan" did not carry any Chinese passengers or cargo when it left Hong Kong, and its mission to Guangzhou was purely to transport foreigners residing in Shamian back to their former residences. Moreover, the Japanese authorities ordered the "Kinshan" to return to Hong Kong forty-eight hours after arriving in Guangzhou. According to the spokesperson, the situation regarding the opening of the Pearl River is the same as that of the Yangtze River, because both rivers are of military necessity. As long as there are Chinese guerrilla units along the banks of these two rivers, they cannot be opened. It is hoped that merchants of all countries will understand this.

### Japanese Warships Arrive in Southern Fujian, Sailors Attempt to Land in Hui'an, Continuously Strafing the Shore with Machine Guns, Aiming to Disrupt Maritime Traffic in Southern Fujian, British and Portuguese Shipping Suffer Significant Losses Again

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the Lunar New Year, Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the sea off the villages of Xia'an and Xiayang in the eastern district of Hui'an County, southern Fujian. On January 2nd, three Japanese warships sailed from Taiwan to Xiayang, anchoring more than ten miles from the shore. On the 3rd, they approached the coast and continuously fired 63 shells at the shore from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Due to insufficient firepower, only five shells landed on the shore, the rest falling into the sea. At 4:00 PM, two more Japanese warships sailed from Taiwan and anchored off Xiayang. At approximately 1:00 PM on the 4th, they launched two motorboats carrying over thirty sailors, flying the German flag. They approached the shore and strafed it with machine guns, attempting to land. The defending troops returned fire with machine guns, and after a thirty-minute standoff, they retreated. A villager named Chen from Xia'an was killed by a stray bullet while assisting the troops in defense. At approximately 2:00 PM on the 5th, over fifty Japanese sailors disguised themselves as fishermen and boarded three fishing boats, taking advantage of the high tide to approach the shore, attempting to land. They were discovered by the defending troops, who opened fire, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers on the boats, who then retreated. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, the British merchant ship "Shenfu" arrived off Xiayang from Hong Kong with cargo and was unloading when Japanese warships opened fire on the barges with machine guns. The foreign ships "Sheng Guang", "Sheng You", "Chongqing", and "Fujian" anchored off Xiayang have also been boarded and inspected by Japanese soldiers for several consecutive days, with extensive searches. On the 7th, Japanese warships seized two barges unloading for foreign ships off Xiayang. It is investigated that the aim of the Japanese warships' disturbance in the waters of Hui'an is entirely to disrupt maritime traffic in southern Fujian. Since the fall of Xiamen in May last year, foreign ships have mostly unloaded goods at the ports of Jinjiang and Hui'an counties in southern Fujian, and foreign trade has been quite developed. Therefore, Japanese warships are trying to prevent this. Currently, the ships of British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Portuguese Hailer companies have suffered heavy losses due to the inability to unload cargo. Some have returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai with the original cargo, while others have telegraphed their Shanghai companies to report to their national consulates to negotiate with the Japanese naval authorities and send warships to Fujian for protection. At 2:00 PM on the 8th, Britain dispatched a cruiser from Hong Kong to protect its merchant ships unloading. Furthermore, the seaplanes carried on Japanese warships have been repeatedly flying to the sea near Chongwu in Hui'an, Xiutu in Jinjiang, Jiangyin in Putian, Gaoshan in Fuqing, and Meihua in Changle to scout, so Fuzhou has repeatedly issued air raid alerts in recent days. The elderly, weak, women, and children in the Xiayang and Xia'an areas of Hui'an have been evacuated to the interior, while the able-bodied men are all assisting the troops in defense and transportation. The atmosphere of resistance is extremely tense.

### Impression and Conversation with Xiang Ying, Mr. Xiang's Participation in the Workers' Movement is Notably Successful, He Vigorously Endorses the United Front with Extremely Firm Will

Continued Communication from Belden, Special Correspondent of the English-language "Great American Evening Post": Today I will talk about Xiang Ying. Mr. Xiang is five feet five inches tall and speaks eloquently, observing everything from a materialistic historical perspective. He often visits hospitals to see wounded soldiers, encouraging them. Although he is currently guiding the New Fourth Army's combat strategy, he still takes time to initiate frugal movements, visit farmers, listen to every new plan, and formulate a detailed plan for the future development of the New Fourth Army, soliciting criticism from others on himself and the army. Xiang Ying is the leading spirit of the New Fourth Army. Ye Ting is the commander-in-chief of the army, but Mr. Ye is currently away from the army. In fact, the New Fourth Army is under Mr. Xiang. Mr. Xiang's comrades have shared hardships in Jiangxi for many years. Therefore, Mr. Xiang was the leader of the army in the past, and he is still so now. His current position is Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army. Soldiers all call him "comrade." Mr. Xiang is strong, open-minded, and sincere, with a copper-colored face, a typical worker's face. He often smiles, but his forehead is covered with wrinkles. In his youth, after graduating from elementary school, Mr. Xiang went to work in a factory in Wuchang to support his family. In 1921, at the age of twenty-four, he joined the newly founded Chinese Communist Party and began the workers' movement, organizing workers on the Pinghan Railway. He organized several strikes and established workers' associations for ironworkers, dockworkers, and rickshaw pullers, serving as the secretary of the workers' associations. He then engaged in large-scale organization of workers, establishing the Pinghan Railway Workers' General Association. At that time, the warlord Wu Peifu was extremely opposed to the association, which led to a clash between Wu's troops and railway workers in Zhengzhou. Mr. Xiang led a general strike of workers along the entire Pinghan Railway in Hankou, causing transportation to come to a standstill. Wu ordered his troops to arrest and execute workers, and many were killed. Workers in Hankou all stopped work in protest. This was the famous "February 7th" strike of workers and communists. Although the strike was suppressed, the status of workers improved, as they had discovered the strike as a new weapon. Mr. Xiang was ordered to be arrested and fled, still working to organize workers. Later, the Communist Party sent Xiang Ying to Shanghai to organize workers in the cotton mills in Huxi. In January 1925, he led 20,000 workers to start a strike, which was successful. Soon after, the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Wuhan, and Xiang Ying was transferred back to lead the workers, serving as the leader of the 6,000-member constabulary. Later, due to the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Mr. Xiang returned to Shanghai to work in secret. In 1930, when Zhu De and Peng Dehuai attacked Changsha, they asked Xiang Ying to go to Jiangxi. His main task was to recruit dispersed soldiers. Mr. Xiang served as Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Soviet government and Deputy Chairman of the Soviet government. When Mao Zedong or Zhu De went to the front, Mr. Xiang handled their affairs. In 1934, when Zhu Mao led the army out of Jiangxi, the Communist troops left in Jiangxi were commanded by Xiang Ying, who also directed combat operations. How could a person like Xiang Ying, who had not received military training, lead troops against a formidable enemy like the Japanese army? According to Mr. Xiang, he learned military strategy through work and research. The strategies and tactics that revolutionaries learn in their work are similar to those used in combat. Therefore, an excellent strategist can become an excellent tactician, but in terms of technical aspects, one must humbly learn from technical experts. Because they are revolutionary armies, their leaders are all aware of their responsibilities and eager to complete them, so they all do their best to complete the work. I believe that Mr. Xiang does not seek personal glory and has pure and sincere goals in whatever work he does. The night before I left the headquarters, I talked with Mr. Xiang for at least twelve hours without rest. He answered each of the thirty-six questions I raised in detail, and his speaking style was very vigorous, drawing inferences from one instance to others. Mr. Xiang is a faithful follower of Stalin and vigorously supports the united front. He asked me to criticize the New Fourth Army three times. I believe that he is genuinely concerned about any advice and constantly seeks to improve himself and his army. Without Mr. Xiang's assistance, the medical and medical services in the army would not be as effective as they are now. Any suggestions that Mr. Xiang considers appropriate are immediately put into practice. He answers all questions frankly. If he believes that a question should not be answered, he openly tells the questioner, "I am sorry, I cannot answer this question." Smedley called Xiang Ying an "Iron Man." I also believe this statement, because no difficulties or setbacks can subdue him.

### The Japanese Army Invading Guangdong is Conspiring to Break Through the Xijiang Defense Line, Still Attempting to Invade Guangxi Province, Chinese Troops Have Already Taken Strict Precautions

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army invading Guangdong has been repulsed by Chinese troops in the Dongjiang area and has shortened its defense line to the suburbs of Guangzhou. In the Xijiang area, the Japanese army is actively deploying to attack westward. The reason why they are so eager to invade Xijiang is that they are conspiring to break through the Chinese army's defense line in Xijiang with a blitzkrieg, remove the barrier to Guangxi, and invade the interior of Guangxi Province. Therefore, the military situation in the western area of Guangdong Province, from Sanshui Koubu northward and southward, is somewhat tense in recent days. The number of Japanese troops from Foshan to Sanshui has also increased. There are a total of five divisions of Japanese troops in Guangzhou and the surrounding counties of Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Shunde, most of which are distributed in Koubu, Baini, Langgang, Jiujiang, Longjiang, and other areas. The Japanese troops that have increased in Sanshui have been constantly harassing the opposite bank of Sanshui and the Suijiang line of Kunlian Qingyuan County, and shelling Makou Huangtang. Their spying on Suijiang is actually to break through Qingyuan County, hoping to cut off the connection line between the Northwest and North River Chinese troops, because if they reach Qingyuan, they can attack Yingde along the Lianjiangkou to the right, threaten Wengyuan, and can attack Sihui along the Shuikou to the left, bypass the back of Zhaoqing, break out of Huaiji on the border of Guangxi, and threaten Wuzhou. At the same time, they divided their troops in Jiujiang and directly attacked Gaoming to contain the Zhaoqing Chinese army. Their plan to advance troops is extremely cunning. Therefore, the Chinese army cannot but take strict precautions against the increase of Japanese troops in Sanshui and Jiujiang in terms of the war situation, because if Qingyuan and Sihui are not defended, the war can be extended to Guangxi Province in an instant, and the important part of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway will also be lost. In all past Japanese military operations, they have always made detours and encirclements to Chinese fortresses. It is vaguely heard that Xu Jingtang has convened a Xijiang military conference to discuss the major plan to fight the war. Xijiang generals such as Zhang Da, Chen Zhang, Cai Tingkai, Tan Qixiu, and Zhang Yan all participated. The scope of discussion, in addition to strategy, also includes how the self-defense teams can coordinate with the regular army in action, and the issue of contact between the Xijiang and Beijiang defense forces in combat. There are already meticulous arrangements for offense and defense. The Japanese army attaches great importance to Jiujiang. When they occupied Jiujiang, they sent troops to the Guqiao area on the opposite river. Later, because the guerrillas in the area were active and frequently launched night attacks on the Japanese army, the Japanese army was forced to withdraw from Guqiao and return to Jiujiang. Recently, the Japanese army has increased its troops in Jiujiang, and it seems that it intends to harass Zhaoqing by land. At the end of last month, the Japanese army fired artillery shells at Gulao Guqiao and other places on the opposite river in Jiujiang. A certain unit of the Chinese army took Gulao as the only way for the Japanese army to attack Gaoming and Zhaoqing. In addition to destroying the roadway, they also set up heavy artillery in a dangerous place on a certain hillside, taking offensive defense. On the morning of the second of this month, the two sides had a fierce artillery battle across the river. Chinese artillery shells destroyed the Japanese barracks in Jiujiang, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. Late at night on the third, a certain unit of guerrillas raided the Japanese army in Jiujiang Bridge Heqing, and both times they had gains. It is said that a small team of Japanese troops in Heqing was almost wiped out by the guerrillas by more than half. After these few battles, the Japanese army urgently increased its troops to defend Jiujiang. They have transferred two or three hundred civilian ships in the provincial river, preparing to transport troops to Guqiao and Gulao on the opposite river to intercept guerrillas in order to facilitate the progress of spying on Zhaoqing.

### Various Armies in Guangdong Province are Assigned to Three Routes to Counterattack Guangzhou, the Fourth Route Army is Being Reorganized

Shiqi Correspondence: The Chinese army's counterattack against Guangzhou, after more than a month of deployment, has now completed meticulous preparation. The military officers in charge held a meeting in Shaoguan and decided to advance in three routes. Roughly, the northern route is in charge of the Fourth Route Army Yu Hanmou. One route goes from Conghua through Taipingchang straight to Zengcheng, attacking Zhengguo to meet the Eastern Route Army. The other goes from Qingyuan County, southward along the North River, to meet with the Western Route Army. Currently, Li Zhen, Huang Zhinan, and other elite divisions have successively opened south. The eastern route is in charge of the × Army Group Wu Qiwu. All the troops originally stationed in the Dongjiang River to Shilong Dongguan are under Wu's command. The main force of Wu's troops has been opened from Meixian. Longchuan. Lianping. The counties have been recovered by the Chinese army successively. Poluo. Zengcheng. The counties have been recovered by the Chinese army one after another. Shilong and Dongguan are directly thin. Therefore, the power of the army is greatly enhanced. The western route is in charge of the × Army Group Xia Wei. Sihui. Gaoming. Gao Yao. The counties and both sides of the river are densely covered with large troops. Cai Tingkai's troops are in Luoding. Yunfu. Xinxing. For the sake of coordination, the three-way army has been in contact with each other, aiming to recover Guangzhou. At present, the war situation on the three routes is tight and loose. The Chinese army on the northern route is holding back the Japanese army in the south of Conghua and the north of Panyu. Taipingchang Shangang and other places are in a tug-of-war. The Japanese side's purpose is to protect Guangzhou, occupying Conghua in the north. Huaxian. Qingyuan. The three counties are the periphery to prevent the Chinese army from going south. The western picture occupies Zhaoqing as the periphery to prevent the Gui army from going east. Therefore, the Japanese army on the northern route has repeatedly decided to increase its reinforcements and has not made an inch forward. They have also transferred troops from the Dongjiang to support them, but they have been surrounded and flanked by the Chinese army with odd soldiers. The Japanese army was injured and killed three or four thousand people. Now they have to concentrate their defenses on the southern border of Conghua and change to defensive postures. Qingyuan. Conghua. Huaxian. The cities and towns have been bombed by Japanese aircraft, and seven or eight out of ten have been reduced to rubble. The residents have all moved to safe areas such as Yingde. The situation is very miserable. The Fourth Route Army Yu Hanmou's troops, including Liang Shiji, Chen Gongxia, Wang Dequan, Tan Sui, and four divisions, were ordered to be transferred to the north and south banks of the Yangtze River before the Japanese army invaded Guangdong. Therefore, the troops left in Guangdong only have Mo Xide. Chen Zhang. Zhang Ruigui. Huang Tao. Zeng Youren. Huang Zhinan. Li Zhen and other seven divisions, and Chen Mianwu. Li Rufeng. Two brigades. However, after the Japanese army invaded the south and Guanghui fell, except for Huang Tao. Zeng Youren. Chen Zhang. Huang Zhinan and the four divisions preserved their strength and remained as before. The rest, Mo Xide. Zhang Ruigui. Li Zhen. The three divisions and Chen Mianwu. Li Rufeng. The strength of the two brigades has been slightly damaged due to the war, so they have been actively reorganized in the past two months. It has been completed and has been approved by the commander of the × district to add two supplementary regiments to each division in order to supplement the war vacancies at any time. After receiving the order, the divisions immediately established supplementary regiments and engaged in recruiting new soldiers. After Mo Xide, the commander of the 151st Division, was dismissed, Yu Hanmou originally intended to appoint Chen Mianwu, the commander of the 20th Brigade, to fill the vacancy. Later, he changed his mind and sent Chen to gather the old troops and form a new division. Therefore, the vacancy of the commander of the 151st Division is temporarily held by Yu Hanmou himself, and Wen Shuhai, the commander of the 453rd Brigade of the division, is acting as the commander of the division on defense. After He Lianfang, the commander of the 451st Brigade of the division, left his post, it is now determined that Liang Cailin, the commander of the 904th Regiment of the 453rd Brigade, will be promoted to fill the vacancy. The Ming Decree has been issued yesterday. As for the self-defense groups and guerrillas in various counties in the province, due to the expansion of the guerrilla Shouji War, the command teams of each district and the district committees of each county have been ordered to end all their activities before the tenth day of last month. The Provincial Steering Committee of the Self-Defense Corps was also abolished at the same time, and all matters related to the reception of the Self-Defense Corps are handled by the Management Office of the Self-Defense Corps in the × War Zone. As for the self-defense corps in the Xijiang Nanlu counties, they have been transferred to the county command in accordance with the instructions, and the counties have established guerrilla detachments one after another in view of the current needs, belonging to the guerrilla district command and setting up detachment departments to manage everything. Now, in order to save expenses, the counties have specially abolished the detachment headquarters, which are still commanded by the guerrilla district command county command. In short, the Guangdong army and self-defense corps guerrillas have been reorganized in this way, which has greatly enhanced their combat effectiveness.

### Detailed Account of the Dinghai Incident: A Misunderstanding Between the County Magistrate and the Loyal and Righteous Army, with the Magistrate Fleeing and Xu's Troops Retreating After Obtaining Funds

Dinghai Correspondence: Xu Chengde's troops, the Fifth Battalion of the Fourth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee, arrived in Dinghai on December 26th of last year and were stationed in areas around the Daotou Baoding Guild Hall, the Bamin Guild Hall, and the Dongguan Temple and Shangrong Temple in the city. It was said that they had retreated from Nanhui and would soon return to the front line to fight the enemy. People from all walks of life, recognizing their heroic and courageous resistance on the front line, often went to comfort them with items such as pigs, sheep, and yellow wine. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 2nd of this month, a misunderstanding with County Magistrate Lin Shize led to an incident. The circumstances were briefly reported in the previous newspaper. Now, after further investigation with relevant parties, the details of the incident are recorded as follows:

Suppressing Bandits in Xiazhi

Xiazhi Island in Linghe Township, Dinghai County, is a small island of Zhoushan, located southeast of Dinghai and close to Xiangshan, about fifty or sixty li from Dinghai County, reachable by boat in six hours. The people all make a living by fishing, and their temperament is strong. Last month, residents of the township, Zhang Azhi, Mr. Wang, and others, gathered more than a hundred people, collected over a hundred miscellaneous guns, destroyed the township office, occupied Xiazhi Elementary School, and established a pseudo-guerrilla force. They constantly demanded provisions from wealthy merchants and businesses on nearby islands, causing great disturbance to the people and merchants, who requested the county to send troops to suppress them. The newly appointed County Magistrate Lin Shize, after receiving the report, immediately ordered the county police bureau, water police team, and self-defense corps to join forces with Xu Chengde's troops. On the 27th, they took the Tianbao, Tianma, and Majiali steamships to Xiazhi Zhapeng to suppress the bandits. More than a dozen bandits were killed on the spot, and sixty-nine bandits, including the ringleader Zhang Yizhi (also known as Zhang Kezhi), were captured alive. A light machine gun, a heavy machine gun, and more than twenty Mauser rifles were seized. The remaining bandits fled into the sea to Jinbo Island (about five or six li from Shenjiamen, with a circumference of only about one li). The military and police then brought the sixty-nine captured bandits back to the county and detained them in the county prison for interrogation.

Cause of the Incident

Unexpectedly, on December 31st of last year, a conflict arose between Xu's Loyal and Righteous Army and the water police team over the distribution of seized weapons. However, it was quickly resolved. County Magistrate Lin Shize, fearing that Xu's troops might incite an incident and that the military and police forces in Dinghai were too weak to suppress it, telegraphed the Second Special Task Force of the Haimen Water Police and the Ningbo Garrison Command to send troops to Dinghai to maintain order. However, the secret of the troop request was leaked, and Xu's troops learned of the secret telegram, causing them to resent it. On January 1st of this year, the county government received telegrams from the headquarters of the ×th Group Army and the provincial government, ordering Xu's National Salvation Army to proceed to Xinchang for reorganization. After receiving the telegrams, the county government informed Xu's troops to set off on the one hand, and ordered the water police team and self-defense corps to prepare on the other. Xu's troops saw Lin County Magistrate's actions as a deliberate provocation, which further angered them and made them want to create a disturbance. At dawn on the 2nd, when the Meida ship arrived at the port, they learned that the ship carried the Haimen Water Police Special Task Force. The incident was triggered instantly. Xu's troops immediately used machine guns to strafe the ship, refusing them to disembark. The Water Police Special Task Force, not having received orders, did not retaliate. The Meida ship had no choice but to turn its bow and head to Zhushanmen to take temporary refuge. Xu's four hundred plus troops immediately set out and occupied the strategic high ground of Zhenshan, awaiting in full battle array. They also cut telephone lines and destroyed the wireless radio station, cutting off all communication. County Magistrate Lin, upon receiving the report, immediately fled to the northern suburbs to take temporary refuge. The Dinghai Police Bureau, voluntary defense corps, and self-defense corps went out in all directions to defend and enforce martial law in order to stop the riot. However, they were unable to stand up to Xu's troops and retreated without a fight. Subsequently, Xu's troops charged into the county government, police bureau, water police team, self-defense corps, and other institutions, using machine gun fire to demonstrate their power. They confiscated most of the weapons of the Dinghai military and police. They then broke into the courthouse and forced Warden Song to unlock the county prison, releasing the sixty-nine bandits captured from Xiazhi, and all two hundred and eighty-seven prisoners took the opportunity to escape. It was said that the sixty-nine bandits were part of Xu's troops, so they immediately removed their shackles, obtained firearms, and joined the action, all wearing white bands around their necks as a sign. Only three prisoners who were physically ill and weak and unable to escape remained in the prison. The escaped prisoners broke their own shackles and fled to various towns and villages to hide. Xu's troops also attacked the water police team, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle for several hours. The situation was urgent, and businesses and residents all closed their doors to hide. The whole city was in a state of chaos. There were few pedestrians on the streets, and the sound of machine guns and rifles continued incessantly.

Gentry Mediation

Fearing a counterattack by reinforcements, Xu's troops heavily fortified the four city gates and Zhujianong. They also searched the North Street area and destroyed items at the county government and other places. The police bureau suffered the most severe damage. However, the tax police team, being under the Ministry of Finance, remained neutral and was not destroyed. The political work team, being composed of knowledgeable young people engaged in anti-Japanese work, was also not destroyed. The county defense independent squadron, adjacent to the political work team, was severely damaged. It was heard that Bao Zhikeng, the intelligence chief of the defense corps, was able to escape by pretending to be a member of the political work team. Local gentry Ding Songsheng, Chen Ji'an, Huang Junrong, and former County Magistrate Chen, fearing that the stalemate would last too long and devastate the local area, held a secret meeting at the Dongmen County Chamber of Commerce at 3 p.m. to mediate this major incident.

Retreat and Awaiting Reorganization

In the evening, the residents became even more terrified. Xu's troops, lacking provisions, demanded provisions from the County Chamber of Commerce. The County Chamber of Commerce borrowed 8,000 yuan from Furen, Jinchangzhan, and Fengtailong and handed it over to Xu's troops. Fearing an ambush by reinforcements and with sufficient provisions, Xu's troops took four sailing ships towed by the Tianma steamship at around 2 a.m. on the 3rd. A small number of local youth also went with them. Former County Magistrate Chen Yingxin, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Huang Junrong, Ding Songsheng, Shen Kunquan, Yang Fulin, and others were held back from disembarking. The ship towed Xu's troops to the Hengliang area of Putuo waters, awaiting reorganization. Chen Yingxin and the others returned to Dinghai on the Tianma steamship that afternoon.

Stray Bullets Flying

By the afternoon of the 3rd, the storm had finally subsided, and order in Dinghai began to be restored. The Ningbo-Dinghai telegraph lines had also been repaired. The Tianbao and Libao ships, which had sailed to Shenjiamen to avoid the trouble, returned to Dinghai that evening. It was heard that during the chaos, due to stray bullets flying, one victim was the daughter-in-law of a Mr. Gao from the Caihuaxiang Clothing Store in front of the North Gate Academy, who was in her thirties. She was cooking in the kitchen when a bullet pierced her waist and abdomen, killing her. Another victim was a sedan chair carrier from the West City, who was killed by a bullet piercing his head. Two water police officers were also killed, and three soldiers from Xu's troops were injured and treated at the public hospital.

### New Trends in National Vocational Education After the War: Establishing Elementary Practical Vocational Schools, Holding Training Classes for Mechanical Workers, Promoting Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education in the Northwest and Southwest, Subsidizing Excellent Schools to Send Personnel to Supervise Various Provinces, Registering Technical Personnel, and Expanding Medical Education

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) Since the Ministry of Education added a Vocational Education Section to the Department of General Education and appointed Inspector Zhong Daozan as the concurrent section chief before the war, it has been actively promoting vocational education. There are many emerging industries after the war. The following are the important matters handled by the Ministry of Education in vocational education in recent years:

(1) Establishing Elementary Practical Vocational Schools: During the War of Resistance, efforts should be made to achieve self-sufficiency in the daily necessities of the people. The Ministry of Education specially ordered various provinces to establish elementary practical vocational schools to train practical technical personnel and manage production enterprises. The method should be that before establishing the schools, the Provincial Education and Construction Departments, based on the most urgent and lacking occupations needed in local life, decide on the subjects to be set up. When handling it, it is necessary to cooperate closely with production organizations. In 1938, in addition to the separate preparations by various provinces, the Ministry of Education has allocated funds to prepare for the establishment of a school in each of the three provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Gansu as a model. It is planned to promote it to Yunnan, Sichuan, and Kang provinces in 1939.

(2) Holding Mechanical Worker and Other Training Classes

In recent years, national defense, military, and production and construction organizations need a large number of mid- and lower-level mechanical workers. In August of this year, the Ministry of Education designated the National Central Industrial Vocational School, the Chongqing Senior Industrial Vocational School of Sichuan Province, the Private China Vocational School, the Private Dagong Vocational School, and the Guizhou Provincial Elementary Practical Vocational School to use their existing equipment and personnel to hold mechanical worker training classes to train excellent technical workers and students in turning, fitting, casting, forging, modeling, automobile driving and repair, and telecommunications, totaling 130 people. This year, the Ministry of Education ordered the National Pharmaceutical College to hold pharmacy student training classes.

(3) Promoting Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education in the Southwest and Northwest Provinces

In order to promote agricultural and industrial vocational education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, the Ministry of Education has formulated an implementation plan. The principles are as follows: (1) Divide the area into three regions: Northwest, Sichuan-Kang, and Southwest, and establish one or several national agricultural and industrial colleges in each region to cooperate with the Central Agricultural Research Institute and the Central Industrial Experiment Institute to be responsible for promoting and guiding agricultural and industrial education technology in the region. (2) Each province in each region should, with reference to the distribution of agricultural and industrial occupations and raw materials in the province, stipulate the locations for setting up senior and elementary vocational schools for agriculture and industry, and set up subjects. (3) When necessary, factories or farms may be established before the establishment of vocational schools, and a small number of apprentices may be trained according to their needs, and gradually expanded into schools or training institutes. (4) All matters concerning the teaching practice improvement of senior and elementary vocational schools shall be planned and guided by the Provincial Education Department in conjunction with the agricultural and industrial colleges, the agricultural and industrial experiment institutes, and the improvement organizations in the region. (5) Economic and construction organizations in each region should, within the possible scope, plan and manage various small factories or farms according to local needs, cooperate closely with vocational schools in the area, and recruit apprentices for training in factories and farms. (6) Agricultural and industrial construction cooperation matters in each region shall be approved and promoted by the president of the agricultural and industrial college in conjunction with the directors of the Provincial Education and Construction Departments and the directors of the agricultural and industrial experiment and improvement organizations. (7) The implementation plan for each region is limited to three years. In addition, the Ministry of Education stipulates the outlines for the addition and adjustment of agricultural and industrial vocational schools that should be carried out by each province in each region, and orders the Provincial Education Departments and universities and colleges to formulate implementation measures separately with reference to local conditions according to the principles of facilities, and report them within a time limit for approval to facilitate implementation. (Two or three provinces have already submitted them to the Ministry for approval.) (To be continued)

### Taixian Education Fees: Temporarily Received at 90%

(Taixian Correspondence) The Taixian Education Bureau’s estimated education fees for 1938 were compiled based on the actual receipts of various schools from the 1937 budget. Due to the low qualifications of teachers, after qualified personnel were used, the originally budgeted amount was far from sufficient. It is now specifically stipulated that when issuing funds to various education agencies starting from January 15th of this year, except for social education agencies and the county middle school, other expenses will be temporarily received at 90%. After approval, they will be re-issued. The tuition fees to be transferred from the previous year have been reported for filing, and will be deducted from the regular expenses of each school in 1938. If they are not reported, the funds for December will be suspended. (January 10th)

### Unemployed Cultural Talents: Zhejiang Province Sends Them to the Southwest; 500 Have Gone So Far

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, under orders to accommodate unemployed cultural and various other talents, has been registering since last year. More than a thousand staff members of various groups who previously served in Zhejiang have gone to register from various places. In addition to providing subsidies, many people have been sent to work in various war zones. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government received a clear order from the central government. In order to develop the undertakings of the southwestern provinces, the central government urgently needs such talents. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has been ordered to select talents familiar with education, agriculture, forestry, sericulture, fisheries, animal husbandry, and mineral products, provide funds for their travel, and assign them to work. It is understood that in the most recent month, the government has provided funds to send more than 500 people to the southwest in succession. Therefore, current registrants are becoming more enthusiastic, and there is no shortage of people transferring from Shanghai.

### Refugee Relief Association: Calls for Free Middle School Students

The Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been actively reorganizing various refugee education programs since taking over the Education Committee of the Red Cross Society. In order to understand the living conditions and academic performance of the free middle school students sent to various public and private schools in the first semester of 1939, the association convened a free middle school student fellowship at the YMCA meeting room on Sichuan Road on the 8th of this month. Chen Heqin, Zhao Chuanjia, Pang Rengong, Xiang Tongkui, and more than 80 free students attended. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Director Chen of the group led the meeting. Deputy Director General Pang Rengong reported on the significance of the meeting. Chen Luwei presented 60 yuan in cash on behalf of the Women's Thrift Association to subsidize the free students for breakfast and other needs. At the same time, the draft fellowship constitution was passed, and preparations were made for the inaugural meeting. Finally, the students raised difficult problems to Director Chen, such as the accommodation problems raised by Zhang Zhiming of Patriotic Girls' Middle School and others, the food problems raised by Da'e, and the book problems raised by Dong Jinheng of Culture Middle School. The chairman recorded each problem and promised to find ways to provide relief.

### International Cup Football Semifinals Today: China United vs. Portugal for a Spot in the Finals; Meeting at Yiyuan at 10:30 AM; The Winner Will Face Scotland in the Finals

The second act of the International Cup Football Semifinals, China United vs. Portugal, will meet this morning at 10:30 AM at the Yiyuan Stadium on Albert Road. The referee is Pan Tuo. China United, after adjusting its lineup, defeated England 3-1 in the preliminary round. The five tigers on the front line have a sharp offensive, and the defense and midfield lines are also passable. Goalkeeper Zhou Dayun has made progress in his skills recently, so his strength is very strong. The Portuguese team has veterans Ma Shaner, Costan, and lucky general Fafanxiao. Because winger A Dig left Shanghai, the lineup has been slightly adjusted. Fafanxiao has been changed to center forward and the lineup is still very neat. The strength of both sides can be said to be equal, and there will definitely be a very tense performance today. The winner of today's match will compete with Scotland for this year's championship. Also, the Shanghai United Football League A League begins its second round today. Dong Sailai will meet French Commercial at the Racecourse, and B League's China Team Shengguang will play Victoria at 9:00 AM at Jiaozhou Park.

### Another International Cup Football Semifinal: Scotland Defeats Jewish Team by a Large Margin; 4-0: 1-0 in the First Half

In another International Cup Football Semifinal match, Scotland played against the Jewish team yesterday afternoon at the Racecourse. Scotland led 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, Scotland's luck was prosperous, and they scored three more goals. The overall result was a 4-0 victory for Scotland, which secured their place in the finals. The Jewish team performed poorly yesterday, and the absence of strong players was also a major cause of their failure. The Scottish team's lineup yesterday was missing Max Gan and center forward Fleisser, and their strength was somewhat inferior. Therefore, the first half was not very exciting and resembled a B league performance. Although the ball was often in front of the Jewish goal, the Scottish army did not bring their shooting shoes. McKeegan also missed opportunities frequently. On the other hand, the Jewish team also made the same mistake. The forwards' shots were all sent into Sinclair's hands.

### Resolving B League Football Dispute: Qinghua and French Army to Replay; Audience Enters the Venue to Support; Qinghua Fined

In the Western Union Football League B Championship, Qinghua and the French Army competed at Jiaozhou Park the previous week. The score was tied when there were only ten minutes remaining. The French Army took the opportunity to score a goal due to the left and right wings and left forward being offside. Qinghua captain Wang Boyong immediately protested to referee Pan Tuo, but he was too biased, so the audience, in anger, swarmed into the venue to question him, making the game impossible to continue. It is now known that the Shanghai Westerners Association convened a meeting the other day and resolved to cancel the previous game and select another day to replay it. However, the Qinghua Association was fined because the audience entered the venue to support them and did not stop them. This was considered inappropriate, so they were fined as a slight punishment.

### School Overview: Sze Sheng Elementary and Middle School

Sze Sheng Elementary and Middle School originated from Guangming Elementary School, founded by Yang Sze Sheng, a respected gentleman from Chuansha County during the late Qing Dynasty. Guangming Elementary School was, in fact, the predecessor of Pudong Middle School, which is how Sze Sheng Elementary and Middle School evolved. After the Pudong Middle School building was completed, Guangming Elementary School was renamed Pudong Middle School Affiliated Elementary School and was attached to the eastern part of Pudong Middle School. In 1915, it moved to the right of the Pudong area, selecting the original site of the Jiangsu Maritime Bureau on Duojia Road in the South City, where it built its own school buildings. In 1928, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau approved its establishment. In the spring of 1933, additional school buildings were constructed, and in August, a junior high school was added. To commemorate the school founder, Yang Sze Sheng, the school applied to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to change its name to Sze Sheng Junior High School and Sze Sheng Elementary School. In the spring of 1935, the Ministry of Education approved its registration, and the Education Bureau approved its establishment. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident and the westward movement of the National Revolutionary Army, the school, with its history of over 30 years, had to relocate to a safe location to continue classes. Initially, it borrowed part of the classrooms of Tongyi Middle School in the French Concession as a temporary location, and later borrowed part of the classrooms of Shui Mu Ye Tong Hui Elementary School and the fifth floor of Pudong Mansion as temporary school buildings. From 1939, it rented the premises at 477 Rue Paul Beau (Pu Bai Road) in the French Concession as its school site in order to expand.

The school's administrative facilities, teaching, and moral education, in addition to adhering to the educational principles of the Republic of China, are all based on the school motto of "Diligence and Simplicity" personally instructed by Yang Sze Sheng. The faculty and staff are all full-time, diligent in their duties, and regard education as a lifelong career. From the principal, Cao Yuanjun, to the director of instruction, Shi Zanren, and the rest of the faculty and staff, many have been employed for over 20 years, and at least three to five years, so they can dedicate all their efforts to the school. For the training of lifelong character, the school adopts a tutor system. Tutors lead by example, live with the students, and supervise the students' practice of the student code of conduct to cultivate diligence and simplicity. The student self-government organization adopts a service team system to train students to serve the public, striving to correct the past shortcomings of student self-government organizations that only paid lip service and failed to practice. Regarding teaching implementation, the school emphasizes practical science. Supplementary teaching materials, review of homework, strict examinations, and academic competitions are all means to encourage and motivate students to study diligently. Therefore, graduates have been deeply trusted by the industry, and those who continue their education each have their own strengths. In recent years, the school has repeatedly received commendations from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, and is recognized as one of the best private schools in Shanghai.

Since the school moved to the French Concession, the middle school has temporarily set up three grades, with 170 students, and the elementary school has temporarily set up four grades, with 186 students, all starting in the autumn. For the next semester, in order to provide relief to youth who have lost their schooling during the war, the school plans to add a spring semester class for first-year junior high school students.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Settlement Remains Busy; British and American Exchange Rates Retract, Making the US Dollar Softer Than the Pound

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw large settlements from companies such as Asia Petroleum and Mobil Oil, as well as active buying from Japanese banks behind the scenes. Additionally, foreign banks had little desire to sell, and the Hong Kong Electric Company was not actively selling either, causing the situation to suddenly tighten. Later, the Hong Kong Electric Company became slightly more eager to sell, causing the situation to loosen slightly. However, the US dollar was soft because the British pound's exchange rate had retracted. Trading was quite lively in the first half of the day.

In the morning, London's large and small spreads both narrowed, New York spot prices remained unchanged, and London gold rose by one and a half shillings. The exchange rate of the pound against the dollar decreased by six pence, against the franc increased by twenty-two centimes, and remained the same against Shanghai. The dollar against the pound also fell by 0.1875, against the franc decreased by 0.375, and against Shanghai decreased by 0.02. The central exchange rates were fixed as usual. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 8 shillings 4.12875 pence for the British pound and 16.375 yuan for the US dollar, which were higher by 0.01525 for the pound and lower by 0.0625 for the dollar compared to the previous day's closing prices. After opening, the situation briefly loosened slightly due to a sudden dump by Hong Kong Electric, with the pound at 8 shillings 4.4375 pence and the dollar at 16.40625 yuan. When HSBC announced its exchange rates, they remained unchanged, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, it decreased by 0.075. Subsequently, Asia Petroleum, Mobil Oil, and other major foreign firms engaged in frequent settlements, and Japanese banks were also actively buying, while banks were not readily supplying, causing the underlying trend to tighten. The pound was softest at 8 shillings 3.125 pence, and the dollar was most expensive at 16.12875 yuan. Hong Kong Electric sold again, causing the situation to loosen slightly. Trading was sparse at noon, with only money changers repeatedly selling Hong Kong dollars without stopping, but foreign banks had a strong appetite for buying, so the situation softened slightly. The tightest rate was 56.25 yuan. At the noon close, the bank selling price was 8 shillings 3.375 pence for the pound, 16.28125 yuan for the dollar, and 56.375 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, compared to the previous close, the pound was up by 0.0625, the dollar was down by 0.15625, and the Hong Kong dollar was also up by 0.125. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The half-day trading records are listed below:

(British Pound) (Calculated in National Currency of 1 Yuan)

### Foreign Currencies Slightly Increased; Only the US Dollar and Pound Decreased by Ten Cents

Yesterday, British gold rose by one and a half shillings, and the exchange rates for the British pound and US dollar decreased by 0.1875. The supply of foreign exchange was not strong, while demand was very high. Mobil and other foreign companies made very large settlements. Banks were unable to supply enough, causing the market prices to gradually tighten and become very weak. Spot silver supply and demand was relatively balanced. Foreign currency trading was still strong. Banks and money changers made some transactions in US dollar drafts. Due to the weak close of exchange bills, market prices slightly increased. Only the US dollar and pound decreased by ten cents. Due to the direct conversion between the British pound and US dollar, public transactions for the flat price were not made. Yesterday's market prices: British pound bills rose by six cents, US dollar and pound decreased by ten cents, US dollar bills rose by four cents, Hong Kong dollar bills rose by seven cents, French franc bills rose by 0.015, and Singapore and Dutch guilder bills each rose by one cent. The others remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises and Then Levels Out

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts fluctuated extremely quickly, generally rising first and then leveling out. Initially, it rose to 35 yuan per thousand, then rose further to 37.5 yuan. At noon, it fell back by two yuan to 35.5 yuan, and in the afternoon it continued to fall to the final price of 34.75 yuan, which was no different from the previous day.

### Tightening Foreign Exchange Induces Buying Frenzy; Spot Silver Re-emerges Above the 2,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's spot silver market saw a sudden decrease in price fluctuations, with a range of only six yuan throughout the day. This was because all parties were awaiting changes in the European situation. However, the price gradually rose due to foreign exchange tightening caused by aggressive buying from foreign firms, and a certain gold firm also took advantage of the low price to buy. It repeated and broke through the 2,000 yuan mark. Later, buying interest waned as the foreign exchange slightly recovered after Hong Kong Electric's dumping, and the price also slightly declined. As a result, the final increase was five yuan. Most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in scattered and sparse transactions that day. There were no changes in jewelry gold. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also rose again.

Spot Silver Rises by Five Yuan

From the morning, initially there were no transactions due to a wait-and-see attitude. It was not until 9:45 that a certain money changer bought 50 taels of silver from a spot silver firm at the opening price of 1,996 yuan. Soon, a certain gold firm suddenly came to buy, purchasing a total of 100 taels from fellow firms and over 100 taels from silver shops, all at the same price. After that, supply and demand became increasingly scarce, and the price also stabilized. After 11:00, foreign exchange tightened due to aggressive buying from foreign firms, causing the market to be excited and the buying frenzy to surge. However, sellers were extremely scarce, so transactions were few and far between. Gold firms mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 1,999 yuan. Afterwards, the lack of sellers became even more pronounced, causing the price to immediately break through the 2,000 yuan mark. At 11:45, a money changer bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,002 yuan, which was the noon close price. It was reported that many transactions occurred at around 2,000 yuan at money changer shops. Later, buying interest waned because the foreign exchange slightly recovered after a dump from Hong Kong Electric near noon, resulting in no transactions for a long time. It was not until 3:15 that money changers mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 2,001 yuan. Later, at 4:15, money changers mutually traded 20 taels at 2,000 yuan, which was the evening close price, up five yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The spot silver firm's base silver selling price was 2,010 yuan, and the buying price was 1,995 yuan. The current premium was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Remains at the Original Price

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datonghang Lao Qingyun and others still set the original price at 203 yuan, while new shops set it at 201 yuan, and the buying price was 195 yuan.

Buying Frenzy for Pure Gold Resumes

London, 13th: British pure gold suddenly rebounded because it was heard that the British-Italian negotiations had resulted in disappointment, and there were unfounded rumors of troops moving near the Dutch border and Italian troops concentrating in Africa, causing the market to panic and the buying frenzy to resume, resulting in a rise of 1.5 pence per ounce, nearing 7 pounds 8 shillings 11 pence. The central bank's buying price for Chinese spot pure gold also rose by 1,215.7 yuan, and the listed customs gold also rose by 0.02, totaling 2.403 yuan. The Shanghai standard premium gold price also followed the rise by 1.1 yuan, totaling 1,211 yuan.

### Securities: Interest Payment Issue Unresolved; Government Bonds Continue to Fall; British Gold Rehabilitation Bonds Highly Sought After

Yesterday's security market saw completely uncertain fluctuations. It was suddenly announced a few days ago that the seventh-period coupon of the unified public sale of bonds, which was supposed to be paid at the end of this month, would instead be paid in Chongqing, causing market prices to gradually become uneasy. The favorable market conditions of Monday and Tuesday were suddenly hit, which is a pity. According to financial news, the Ministry of Finance did send a telegram to Shanghai stating that the principal and interest of this period's unified public bonds would be paid at the Chongqing headquarters. However, the telegram also contained a request for agreement, so the Shanghai financial community is discussing as a group whether they can reverse this decision, which is still uncertain. There is also a rumor in the market that the interest will be paid in six monthly installments, with five cents paid each month. The method is that the managing bank will collect the coupons and exchange them for six checks payable in equal installments over six months. This method would be cumbersome and difficult to implement. In short, although this method is intended by the government to protect legal tender and prevent its escape, its impact on market prices is undeniable. Looking back to the first interest payment after August 13th, it was paid by exchange draft. From the second time onwards, it was changed to legal tender. It would be better to continue paying by exchange draft as in the first time, rather than changing the rules every day. Judging from yesterday's government bond market, it is clear that investor sentiment has changed. The prosperous atmosphere of Monday and Tuesday has become a thing of the past. Number 8, which had not been traded for a long time, suddenly saw spot sales. The long positions of Tian Sheng Hao are also constantly being released. Although there is short covering from retail investors, the market still feels that there are more sellers than buyers. The price dropped by 0.06 to 0.08 in the morning. The situation was slightly better in the afternoon, with retail long positions being released. Although Dafeng Hao's selling pressure surged, Tong Kang Hao suddenly covered its short positions. Numbers 6 and 52 also bought in large quantities, so the price rebounded slightly. Only Category A remained unchanged because there were few inquiries. The others have rebounded by 0.03 to 0.04. The overall situation is not serious, but the issue of the payment date is a factor. The market is expected to be more volatile than before. As a result, prices fell by 0.025 to 0.08, with a total turnover of approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

There is still much discussion about buying and selling stocks, but few successful transactions. After all-day price negotiations, only 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 6.45 yuan. There were no other agreements.

London's China foreign debt listed prices on the 13th of this month (Friday) were stable and unchanged. Previous day's transactions included a British gold rehabilitation bond and a French-issued imprinted bond, with a transaction price of 48 pounds. Today, Hong Kong's supply is still lacking. However, London is very keen on British gold rehabilitation bonds, with a demand for 5,000 pounds for French-issued imprinted bonds, with bids at 47 pounds 15 shillings, which is 15 shillings higher than the previous day. It is said that there is a demand for 50,000 pounds for bonds that are not designated by type, regardless of the country of issue or whether they are stamped or not, and they are being sought out. As long as the seller's price is reasonable, negotiations can be held. Market prices are the same as the previous day, with no changes and omitted.

### Cotton Yarn: Large Quantities of Yao Yifu Arrive and are Sold Out Immediately; Shenxin Factory Purchases Indian Cotton, Reaching 6,000 Bales in Several Days

The cotton business is still lively, with white cotton still dominating. However, the selling price is not much different from the previous day. The New Yu factory's purchase of 8,800 bales of Yao Yifu for ten-count coarse yarn raw materials is particularly strong, while the Shenxin factory's purchase of 350 bales of white cotton is only a slight touch. Other factories have hardly taken any action. However, the acceptance of goods by fellow traders is quite good, so the momentum of white cotton remains strong. Fine velvet cotton is unusually dull. Chinese factories are extremely unwilling to purchase foreign cotton, which causes capital outflow. However, looking back at the situation of cotton collection in domestic producing areas, the conditions are harsh and transportation is difficult. In this environment, there is no adequate way to remedy the situation other than purchasing foreign cotton. Based on the above situation, factory purchases are just beginning to boom. Yesterday, Shenxin imported American cotton with 32-count fine yarn raw material, totaling 2,500 pieces, at a price of only 89.5 yuan, and paid cash to be delivered to the factory immediately. It is said that other factories also bought a lot. The position of Chinese cotton has been completely eroded. The source of Tongzhou cotton is still considerable, totaling 1,160 bales. It is also reported that 8,800 bales of Yao cotton have arrived and been completely sold out. The transaction volume and market prices of spot cotton are listed below:

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: American cotton prices are not strong due to the failure of the Anglo-American-Roman conference and concerns about European peace. Southern cotton farmers are selling on the market, and overseas cotton merchants are also selling off in New York. Domestic manufacturers' purchasing appetite remains strong. The total demand for cotton from domestic factories this week is 211,000 bales. The export volume of American cotton has not improved, totaling 78,000 bales this week. Yesterday, American cotton fell by 0.035 pounds, Indian cotton (including forecasts) fell by 0.02 rupees, and Egyptian cotton also fell by over 20 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rates were higher, and the converted legal tender cotton prices were: American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 0.06 yuan per dan, Indian cotton fell by 1.25 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose and fell sharply, falling by over 3 yuan.

The trading of foreign cotton in this city is still active. Chinese factories have been purchasing Indian cotton for days, with Shenxin being the largest buyer. Shenxin ordered 1,500 bales of Indian cotton Pingle the day before yesterday, with a factory-delivered price limit of 61.5 yuan. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by 0.02 rupees, so Bombay has already completed transactions at the price limit. Yesterday, Shenxin also ordered 1,000 bales of American cotton from Maoxin Foreign Company, with a factory-delivered price of 89.25 yuan, shipped this month. The factory has imported 6,000 bales of Indian cotton in recent days, with a total weight of 18,900 dan. Other Chinese factories did not have much trading yesterday. The transaction volume and spot prices are listed below:

(1) Transaction Volume Yesterday

Shenxin Imported Indian Cotton 2,500 Bales
Tongxing Imported Indian Cotton 500 Bales
Neiwai Imported Indian Cotton 500 Bales
Gongda Imported Indian Cotton 500 Bales
Gongda Imported Brazilian Cotton 500 Bales
Yufeng Imported American Cotton 300 Bales

American Cotton Weekend Statistics

New York, 14th: American cotton weekly statistics from August 1st to January 13th are as follows:

(Unit: Bales, each bale 500 pounds)

### Cotton Yarn: Long Positions Take Profits; Selling Offers Fall Another 2-3 Yuan

The yarn market is flat and weak, with highs and lows. This is due to the profit-taking of old long positions and the lack of buyers taking long positions, so the market situation is uneven. The overall trend is still fluctuating, but real demand is becoming more developed. Yunnan traders' demand for coarse and fine yarn is improving, totaling 690 bales. Most of this cotton yarn is purchased directly from the factory. Sichuan traders have a appetite for fine yarn because transportation lines in the southwest are not as difficult as in the past, but the amount is very small. There is no significant business from other traders. The market situation yesterday: In the morning, money-making long positions flooded in, and the opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan. Fuzhou traders purchased 120 bales. Although buyers were still strong, the market remained weak and declined step by step, falling to a low of 386.5 yuan. Later, the price rebounded by 0.5 yuan as fellow traders came back to purchase in large quantities. Fellow traders traded over 500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn. At closing, it was heard that demand from Yunnan traders was not bad, and market sentiment improved slightly. Statistics show that 1,670 bales were traded in the morning. The market prices were: 20-count Double Horse down 3 yuan from the previous day, Samsung down 1 yuan, Double Globe down 2 yuan, Heavenly Maiden down 2 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn down 1 yuan. The Chongxin factory opened sales of 100 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at 195 yuan. The Tongyi factory opened sales of 100 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster yarn at 300 yuan and 100 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn at 390 yuan. The Hongzhang factory opened sales of 200 bales of 10-count Bao Yi yarn at 284 yuan. 270 pieces will be shipped to Shantou today, 25 pieces to Hong Kong, and over 600 pieces to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each trader is listed below:

Fellow Traders 690 Yunnan 690 Sichuan 40
Fuzhou 30 Jiangxi 60 Wenzhou 70
Total 1,670

The Japanese yarn market is unusually quiet. There is no demand from any parties, and market sentiment is deteriorating. The market price is unstable. The current price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 311 yuan, and the price for this month is 307.75 yuan. The current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 307.8 yuan, and the price for next month is 305 yuan, both down 1-2 yuan from the previous day.

### Metals: East White Iron Market Weak

The East White Iron market has been very sluggish recently. Demand from factories is weak, and traders' handling is also limited. The market situation is very depressed. Market prices are affected by oversupply, and are generally declining. For example, 3'7" sheets are sold for 3.1 yuan each, and 3'6" sheets are sold for 2.6 yuan each. For large transactions, prices are negotiable. The recent market trading has been limited to small amounts handled by a few scattered retailers. There have been no bulk transactions worth mentioning. It is heard that factories have been shipping goods very actively recently, and there is also a large amount of inventory in the market, so the market is very sluggish and the situation is getting worse. Yesterday, 600 pieces of steel strip were shipped from Italy.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Western Transactions Slightly Active; Sesame Seeds Increasingly Popular; Net Goods Have Reached Around 20 Yuan

The sesame seed market is not well understood by outsiders because transactions of noble goods are generally not made public. Therefore, sesame seed trading in the miscellaneous grains market has become a mysterious commodity. Yesterday, it was heard from traders who do not deal in sesame seeds that the market price of net sesame seed goods has reached around 20 yuan, so it is certain that the market situation is quite lively. It is heard that export sales and transactions from Western firms are slightly active, and domestic routes are also not weak. However, transportation is difficult, and inventory is running out. It is feared that there will be little inventory within the lunar new year.

Yesterday, 320 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Shantou, and another 200 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Soybeans Rise with Oil Prices

Soybean market prices have risen by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan with the increase in oil prices. The market was also quite lively yesterday, with South traders being the most active, and domestic traders following. The overall trend has broken the dull situation, and the future outlook is optimistic. Yesterday, one carload of Dalian soybeans was traded at a price of 7.55 yuan, over 200 bags of Bengbu soybeans were traded at 6.86 yuan (tax-free), 300 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at 7.3 yuan, 1,200-1,300 bags of Chongming sandy yellow soybeans were traded at prices from 7.37 yuan to 7.2 yuan, and over 100 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans were traded at 9 yuan. Yesterday, 100 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha, and over 4,700 bags of tea beans arrived from Tianjin. Today, 800 bags of soybeans will be exported to Shantou, and another 1,300 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Wheat Bran Selling Price Increases Daily

The wheat bran market remains active, and wheat prices have risen again, causing factories to demand higher prices, and large traders are hoarding and unwilling to sell, so inventory is sometimes scarce. Buyers have no choice but to accept the higher prices, so yesterday, the market price for Fuxin factory large bags of wheat bran was 3.4 yuan, and the price for Fufeng factory large bags of wheat bran was 3.35 yuan. It is said that 1,500 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Shantou today.

### Grains: Another Ship of American Wheat is Ordered; 7,500 Tons to be Loaded at the End of the Month; Totaling Six Ships So Far

Yesterday's wheat source saw a slight increase. Including the cartwheel arrivals, there were over 5,000 bags. 650 bags came from Xingang. Factory purchases were also stronger because flour sales have been strong recently, and the demand for raw materials has been increasing. However, sellers were demanding high prices, so purchases could not be made as desired. As a result, the total transaction volume was still 6,000 bags, with 4,000 bags purchased by the Fuxin factory and 2,000 bags purchased by the Fufeng factory. The highest price was 6.7 yuan. The market remains stable.

Also, since the dumping of cheap American flour and wheat, in addition to the local grain merchants recently ordering foreign flour, the various flour factories have also ordered five ships of foreign wheat. The first batch of two ships has already been loaded and is on the way. It is scheduled to arrive around the 20th, but may be delayed due to weather conditions. The factories, considering the late arrival of previously ordered foreign wheat and the scarcity of local wheat, often feel that the supply is insufficient. They have renewed their intention to order foreign wheat. It was heard yesterday that a factory in this city has ordered another ship of American wheat from foreign merchants, totaling 7,500 tons, which is scheduled to be loaded at the end of the month and delivered in early March. The price is 7.675 yuan per 100 catties (Sima scale) due to the recent narrowing of the exchange rate, making the price slightly more expensive. In this extraordinary period, the opportunity for dumping foreign flour and wheat has been created. It is rumored that American flour is being sold for 5 yuan, which may be the selling price of existing flour in Shanghai.

### Flour Sales Not Weak

Yesterday's spot flour continued to rise because sales to traders were gradually developing. Both northern and southern traders were active, and Ningbo traders were also adding to their orders. Although there were no bulk transactions, scattered sales were not weak. In addition to the southern traders continuing to be active, retail traders from the north and places like Qinhuangdao were showing a good appetite. However, due to the local Tianjin flour having a strong presence, Tianjin traders' demand for #2 flour was not strong. The acceptance of #3 and #4 flour was still good. The total market trading volume was 50,000-60,000 bags. Apart from the Green Hero flour, which was sold for 4.5 yuan for over 10,000 bags, the rest were Jun Chuan, Tianzhu, and Fisherman flour, all traded at the original market price of 4.9 yuan, so the market was quite firm. Today, 3,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Shantou, and another 1,300 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Rice (粳米) Scarce, Sales Strong

Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice was limited, with only nine boats arriving at the riverbank and five to six thousand packages of "carriage wheel" wrapped rice. Yesterday's sales were quite lively in this street, and the outgoing path for stockpiled wrapped rice was also smooth. Sellers were keen to consolidate, tightening the situation. The market was buoyant. The price of thick "japonica" rice rose by several cents to a dime, and thin "indica" rice also improved by three to five cents. "Goat-tip" rice was even more fragrant due to its scarcity, resulting in extraordinary firmness and a price increase of one dime. "Port-tip" rice followed suit, rising by several cents. However, "Du-tip" rice was restricted by the price of "japonica" rice, making it difficult to increase. Since domestic households rushed to sell their rice in recent days, market goods have become scarce. At the same time, alcohol shops, food vendors, etc., took advantage of the cheap prices to engage in activity. The market color shifted from fatigue to tightness, and prices rebounded by about a dime. Arrivals of "Yin-yuan" rice were intermittent, and people's hearts were rather cold, resulting in no major waves.

### "Ke-xian" Rice Rebounds

"Ke-xian" rice has been arriving continuously in recent days, with a relatively large number of "Wu-xian" rice arrivals. Except for particularly high-quality goods, which were still able to sustain their value, the general market price of rice has been falling daily. Yesterday, "Ke" stockpilers took advantage of the low prices to make arrangements, cleverly absorbing the supply. And because this street's "tip" rice rose, there was also renewed attention to "Ke-xian" rice. Therefore, the transaction volume of "Ke-xian" rice increased to two thousand five or six hundred packages. Although the particularly high-quality "Wu-xian" rice still opened at around ten yuan and five cents, the general market price and prices at various levels of "Zhong-jue" rice had rebounded by about five or six cents to a dime. The "Nanjing-xian" rice, which had been shunned for days, was also sold at ten yuan and six cents, it was said. Yesterday, one thousand packages of white rice came from Hupu.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Coarse White Rises a Dime

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm. The guild's market assessment, because it was Saturday, had relatively few transactions. Spot goods for Dutch coarse white rose again, to twenty-four yuan and forty-five cents. Transshipment goods rose one dime, to sixteen yuan and thirty-five cents. Dutch red spot goods were sixteen yuan and sixty-seven cents. Taikoo "Car White" was flat. B-mark Eastern Wharf goods were twenty-three yuan and seventy-five cents, and Western Wharf goods were twenty-three yuan and eighty-five cents. Due to gradually thinning stock, domestic Chaoqing continued to trend upward. For example, High Huanggang opened at twelve yuan and forty cents, High Bananqing at twelve yuan, and High Longqing rose one yuan and twenty cents, with three or four hundred packages transacted. Jianbang offered three hundred and several dozen packages of Xinghua special tribute flour at twenty-two yuan, ordinary red sugar at fourteen yuan, and miscellaneous foreign sugar at sixteen yuan, with a total of more than two hundred packages transacted. Guangdong Hainan red sugar continued to be offered, priced at eleven yuan and ninety cents.

### Dried Goods: Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Stock Growing Scarcer Daily

Because arrivals of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber have been interrupted for a long time, market stocks are all scarce. Market assessments are rising daily. Yesterday, the top-quality "Le" pickled mustard tuber in the market had reached ninety yuan, with ordinary ones slightly lower. This street sporadically has transactions because the stock is thin, even if there is a large outgoing appetite, there is nothing to supply.

### Piece Goods: N呢Rong (Woolen Fabric) for the Lunar New Year: Past and Present

The woolen fabric market this year is different from this time in past years. Although recently it has been the Western New Year and the end of the Lunar Year, actual sales not only have not decreased but have even increased. Except for Shen-woven single-sided floral woolen fabric and "Siro" woolen fabric, most prices are trending upward. "Overcoat woolen fabric," "long-hair woolen fabric," and "sea tiger woolen fabric," etc., are even more popular and expensive. Also, "Tada" households are making arrangements earlier than in previous years. For each good that companies are responding to in the market, Da Niu has offered them all at once. All of this differs from past years. As for the Shen-woven woolen fabric market, sales volume has increased significantly, and many in the industry have profited. Inventory is generally being hoarded. The products of the Yongxing Factory are in a state of greatly surpassing those of Jardine Matheson. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Cro-top" was selling for ten yuan per yard, and Yongxing's "Ke-za-top" was selling for seven yuan and twenty-five cents. Single-sided high-stripe floral woolen fabric was six yuan and twenty-five cents, Tibetan Qing Huater woolen fabric was four yuan, Jardine Matheson's Head No. 1 riding breeches woolen fabric was seven yuan and fifty cents, and Deputy No. 1 was six yuan and seventy-five cents. Today, fifty-two pieces of piece goods were shipped to Shantou, ten pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and four hundred and forty pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### Silk and Tea: Shaoxing Cocoons

Have Broken the 300 Yuan Barrier. Raw Silk Continues to Advance Towards High Peaks

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market continued to advance toward high peaks. Spot goods opened at 860 yuan, a sharp increase of 15 yuan. Forward contracts rose 10 yuan, opening at 850 yuan, all of which were the highest market prices in recent months. As for the ports of the United States and France, they only showed a firm trend. Therefore, foreign firms' purchase prices did not rise accordingly. On the contrary, the cocoon market in this port saw high prices again. Shaoxing cocoons yesterday broke the 300 yuan record, selling at 305 yuan. Therefore, silk transactions were only excited and not booming smoothly. Yesterday, Carlowitz and Credit Suisse, etc., continued to have factory-managed and Lu-managed transactions, with selling prices only rising by about 10 yuan. User demand has been quite active recently, due to the silk market's bullish sentiment. However, because domestic raw materials were scarce last year, silk prices were much more advantageous than before the war. But the actual benefits (such as export volume, the economy of operators and silkworm farmers, etc.) have not improved.

### Seafood: The Stock of "Ming-bu" Growing Thinner

Since Jianbang and Shantou have been continuously sourcing "Ming-bu," the stock here is decreasing daily. There are not many sources, and the market situation is firm. Recently, near-market Zhoushan "Bu" is at sixty yuan, Ningbo Pu is at thirty-one yuan and fifty cents, and brand-new Shangzhuang is at thirty-three yuan (all cash). Shandong Da Bu is at forty-six yuan. The underlying accumulation is even more depleted. If there are no arrivals, it may run out.

### Medicinal Materials: "Yizhiren" (Black Cardamom) Firm

Arrivals of "Yizhiren" are lacking, and brands are holding tight and not selling. Because the industry is still haggling, there is still a difference of three or four yuan. However, the stock in the production area is already scarce, and the outgoing appetite here is still active. A transaction can be expected soon.

### Star Anise Sees Low Prices Again

Star anise, the previous market price, fell from ninety-eight yuan to eighty-seven yuan and fifty cents. Only because arrivals were booming and sales were sluggish, the brand price fell again. Yesterday, it sold for eighty-five yuan. Checking its source, such as from Guangdong to Shanghai, it probably detoured through Hong Kong. The external expenses are extremely complicated and the cost is higher. Therefore, the future trend can be expected to bottom out.

### Coal: Wenzhou Charcoal Merchants' Transport Seized

Wenzhou large-basket hard charcoal, because the local charcoal company has a monopoly, the source has been scarce for a long time. There are no goods on the market in the local door stores. Yesterday, the Feida wheel was loaded with 1,200 "Zun" of Zhang Yuanmao's Pizi hard charcoal, entrusted to Datong and Lida companies in this city to promote sales. It was discovered by the Shanghai office of the Charcoal Company, which believed it infringed on its rights. The goods were immediately seized, so the various companies holding bills of lading could not ship the goods. It is now being telegraphed to Wenzhou to negotiate separately, it is said.

### Paper: Domestic Paper and Foreign Paper Have Inflows and Outflows

Yesterday, 988 tons of foreign paper arrived from Italy, and 14,000 pieces of local paper were shipped to Qingdao.

### Japanese Puppets Extorting and Levying Taxes: Levying Goods, Moving Out, and Taxing Them. Changshu and Other Places Have Implemented It Since the 10th. People Cannot Bear the Exploitation and Are Rising Up in Resistance.

The Japanese puppets, in the occupied areas, are extorting and levying taxes in every way. Recently, they have even added a so-called "Inland Port Goods Removal Tax" to squeeze the people, causing a reduction in freight transport in various industries and merchants to hesitate. The following are the details of the exploration of the details by the Modern News Agency reporter, such as the decision.

Inventing Harsh Taxes and Abusing Seizures

The Japanese puppets in the inland areas levy heavy taxes on the entry and exit of various goods, even collecting taxes of more than ten percent of the value of extremely small vegetables. The people are full of complaints and hate them to the core. However, the Japanese puppets' economic panic is profound, and they are struggling to maintain it. Therefore, they do not hesitate to drain the pond to catch all the fish and leave no room for anyone. In addition to the existing harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes, they have also added a goods removal tax, classifying them according to the value of the goods as the standard for taxation. The method is as follows: when merchants have goods to be transported out, they must first fill out a report to the Japanese propaganda class of each county, stating the quantity, value, and actual name of the goods. The report must be signed and sealed by the shops and responsible persons of each industry. After paying the tax, they are allowed to transport the goods. When passing through the Japanese military stationed area or the "Tax Collection Office" of the puppet "County Public Office," they must be inspected. If other goods are found to be夹带 (hidden) in the reported goods, all of them will be confiscated, and the business owner and responsible person will be punished.

Rice Tax Specially Increased, Affecting the Source

The current removal tax set by the Japanese puppets, taking rice alone as an example, requires an additional levy of forty cents per bag, and each bag must not exceed one stone and five dou. In the past, rice and grain transported from the inland areas to Shanghai included various taxes, water foot, coolies,驳力 (lighterage fee), and warehouse rent, all of which were included, costing one yuan and thirty-five cents per bag. Since the implementation of the removal tax, the cost per bag has reached between one yuan and seventy-five cents and eighty cents. Therefore,版运 (print transport) merchants are unwilling to be exploited by the Japanese puppets and have automatically stopped transporting goods one after another. Rice merchants in the inland areas have successively suspended business and closed markets, resolutely resisting. Since yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai has suddenly decreased sharply.

Freight Transport Depressed, All Ships Losing Money

Since the removal tax was levied on January 10 this year, Changshu, Hupu, Baimao, Changyinsha, and other places have been the first to implement it. Therefore, import and export goods in various industries have been exploited by the Japanese puppets and the amount of goods loaded and transported has been reduced. As a result, the business of each ship has been depressed and most of them are losing money in recent days.

### Japanese Wounded Soldiers and Damaged Aircraft Arriving in a Steady Stream. More Than a Dozen Damaged Aircraft Shipped to Japan. A Trainload of Wounded Soldiers Arrived in Shanghai.

Yesterday morning, a batch of damaged Japanese aircraft was transported by train from Nanjing and Hangzhou to Shanghai. They were then transported from the North Station to the Zhaoshang North Wharf in Pudong, where they were hoisted onto the huge ten-thousand-ton transport ship Katsuragi Maru, which was pre-docked, to be shipped back to Japan. These damaged aircraft were all heavy bombers, with damaged wings, damaged propellers, and bullet holes all over the fuselage. The total number was fourteen or fifteen.

Also, at 3:25 p.m. yesterday, the Nanjing-Shanghai train was loaded with another trainload of seriously wounded Japanese soldiers, about two hundred people. Because the Japanese side dispatched a large number of amphibious transport ships to transport wounded soldiers to South China, the wounded soldiers in the Hankou area were transferred by train in Nanjing to Shanghai. Most of the Japanese soldiers were seriously injured. After arriving at the Ningbo Station in Shanghai, they were loaded by more than a dozen trucks with red cross white cloth canopies to the newly built Japanese field wounded soldier hospital in Yangshupu.The upper reaches of the Jinsha River between Sichuan and Xikang are mostly under the jurisdiction of 土司 (chieftains). In the past, anyone who set up factories and mines often clashed with the natives, sometimes working and sometimes stopping. Now, the governments of the two provinces have been trying to coordinate so that the gold production can be increased.

Hunan's Silver

The only place in China that produces silver is the Hunan Lead Smelting Plant. The ore is galena produced in Shuikoushan and Chenxian. There are many other galena production sites, but the quality and quantity are not significant, the silver content is not high, and there is no production. The Hunan Lead Smelting Plant was established in the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the previous Qing Dynasty. The plant is located outside the South Gate of Changsha. It was originally commercially run, but after several changes, it is now managed by the Department of Construction. In addition to producing 2,000 tons of lead annually, it also produces 120,000 taels of pure silver, which is the only silver production site in China. As for the total silver production in the country, which is 121,504 taels, it is all produced in Hunan. Other provinces have more silver reserves, but so far no one has mined them.

### The Government Decides to Allocate Huge Sums of Money to Form a Gold and Silver Purchasing Association. Sichuan and Kang Provinces Devise Methods to Adjust and Increase Production. Hunan Province Is the Only Silver Producing Place in China.

In view of the fact that Sichuan, Xikang, and other provinces are gold and silver producing areas, the Chinese government has specifically organized a Gold and Silver Purchasing Committee and allocated huge sums of money as an operating fund. The committee is jointly formed by the Ministries of Finance and Economy and is directly under the Executive Yuan. The amount of the fund ranges from 5 million yuan to 10 million yuan. The committee is about to be established. The details are as follows.

Sichuan and Kang Gold

Although the status of gold and silver minerals in China is not very high in the world, the production is not weak. Gold ore in China is widely distributed, but most of the mining is done by people in a scattered manner, without organization or equipment, and the work is irregular. It is difficult to statistically estimate. According to recent estimates, the annual amount is 125,000 taels, of which 31,000 taels are produced in the southwestern provinces, accounting for 25% of the total. The main production areas are in the

### Mistakenly Closing the Barbed Wire, Causing a Small Disturbance. After the British Army Discovered It, They Apologized to the Japanese Side.

The Mainland News reported that last night (the 13th), because the British army mistakenly closed the barbed wire in front of the General Post Office on North Suzhou Road, a small disturbance occurred between the command headquarters of the British and Japanese armies. However, the matter was resolved peacefully last night. There are two barbed wire fences on the road in front of the Green Post Office. The one on the west is managed by the British army, and the one on the east is defended by the Japanese army. According to the information obtained by the British Army Headquarters last night, the British army mistakenly closed the other barbed wire fence, blocking traffic, causing inconvenience to dozens of Japanese people, including post office inspectors. However, the British army immediately discovered this error and apologized for causing inconvenience to the Japanese.

### Zhejiang Tung Oil, Listed Price, Purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. Agreed with the Property Adjustment Office.

After the Trade Commission monopolized tung oil, it entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to purchase tung oil in Zhejiang Province. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to discuss the matter. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Property Adjustment Office has ordered each office to notify them, and has sent a copy of the listed price of tung oil in various places and a list of the purchase price of tung oil in various places. The following is a transcript of the information.

Tung Oil Listed Price

Lanxi Price: 36 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 fen, 9 li, based on the Central Trust Bureau's purchase price of 43 yuan, deducting a profit of 1 yuan and various expenses of 5 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, 1 li. Yongkang Price: 38 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, 5 li, based on the Central Trust Bureau's purchase price of 43 yuan, deducting a profit of 1 yuan and various expenses of 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 fen, 5 li. Lishui Price: 40 yuan, 0 jiao, 7 fen, 4 li, based on the Central Trust Bureau's purchase price of 43 yuan, deducting a profit of 1 yuan and various expenses of 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 2 fen, 6 li. Wenzhou Price: 40 yuan, 4 jiao, 4 fen, 2 li, based on the Central Trust Bureau's purchase price of 43 yuan, deducting a profit of 1 yuan and various expenses of 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen, 8 li.

Tung White Purchase Price

Lishui Price: 19 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen, 5 li per 100 market catties. Lanxi Price: 17 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen per 100 market catties. Ningbo Price: 19 yuan, 2 jiao, 2 fen per 100 market catties. Wenzhou Price: 19 yuan, 5 jiao, 1 fen per 100 market catties. The above prices are based on the tung oil price, so each 100 market catties of tung white can be pressed into 48 market catties of oil, and the tung cake is used as the wage for pressing.

### The Ministry of Finance Exerts All Efforts to Prevent Legal Tender from Flowing into the Occupied Areas. Those Carrying It to Shanghai Should Deposit It in the Bank of China. Transportation Must Be Approved and Licensed in Various Places.

Since the implementation of our country's new monetary policy, although it has been more than a year of the War of Resistance, the currency value is still stable and deeply trusted by Chinese and foreign people. The cash reserve of legal tender has always been above 60%. Although the issuance has increased, the cash reserve has been raised. The Japanese side and the puppet organization have repeatedly designed to destroy it, trying to disrupt our country's finances. The facts have proved that it has completely failed. In order to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas and abroad, the Ministry of Finance requires that all kinds of universal banknotes transported to various ports in the country and abroad from the borders of China must be reported to the ministry for approval and issuance of passports. All ships passing through the ports to Shanghai, such as those with difficulties in remitting money, carrying legal tender, and confirmed by the customs to be the revenue from passenger ticket fares, must, in addition to 500 yuan, find a reliable guarantee for the remaining amount and transfer all of it to the Central Bank upon arrival in Shanghai. Passengers carrying money from Chinese ports to Hong Kong are limited to 200 yuan. Foreign ports other than Hong Kong are limited to 500 yuan. However, those carrying it from Guangzhou to Macau or Guangzhou Bay are also limited to 200 yuan. Foreign currency carried to other border ports or overseas, English currency is limited to 30 pounds and US currency is limited to 150 yuan. The rest can be inferred by analogy. Regarding the issuance of legal tender in the occupied areas, taking North China as an example, by the end of last year, it was 33,566,0805 yuan. The Bank of China had the most, followed by the Bank of Communications, and then the Central Bank.

### The New Anna Wheel Changed to this Morning. First Voyage. Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Route Achieved. Passenger Tickets will also be Reduced.

The New Anna Wheel of the American company Wei Li Han has been approved to sail to Ningbo, and has changed its schedule to depart for its first voyage at 4:00 AM this morning. The Deping Wheel of the China-Italy Company returned to Shanghai from Ou last morning and is scheduled to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route tomorrow. The New Xiangtai Wheel of the Huimin Company has sailed to Taiwan yesterday to transfer to Ningbo. The resumption of direct Shanghai-Ningbo route is expected to be achieved in the short term. The prices of passenger tickets on each ship will also be reduced. The details of each situation are recorded separately below.

New Anna Changed to First Voyage This Morning

The American company Wei Li Han has recently been approved by the Zhejiang authorities to send wheels to sail on the Zhejiang East routes. The first wheel, the Anna Wheel, which has been leased to Tailai Foreign Company, has been renamed the New Anna. It was originally scheduled to depart on its first voyage on the 13th, but because some procedures were not completed in time, it was announced that it would be postponed to depart at 4:00 PM on the 14th. However, according to inquiries, the wheel still did not depart yesterday afternoon. It is said that it has been decided to postpone it to start anchoring at 4:00 AM this morning, first sailing to Haimen, and then transferring to Ningbo. After the resignation of Shen Yougeng, the business agent of the wheel, another Chen has been appointed to replace him. As for the other three wheels of the company, although there have been rumors that they have been leased to Yongzhen and Yongfeng, etc., it is said that they have not been decided yet. Yongzhen is still being leased by Yongli Company and is sailing to Ningbo and Qian Tang.

De Gu Returned to Shanghai, Opening to Ningbo Tomorrow

After the Ende and Deping Wheels of the China-Italy Company were approved by the Zhejiang military authorities to sail to Ningbo to load goods, the Ende Wheel set sail to Ou yesterday afternoon to transfer to Ningbo. In order to reduce the burden on passengers, all freight charges were calculated at half price. The Degu Wheel also returned to Shanghai from Ou yesterday morning and officially joined the Shanghai-Ningbo line to load goods. The wheel is scheduled to start anchoring tomorrow (the 16th) afternoon, but if loading is not completed in time, it will be postponed to leave Shanghai on the morning of the 17th. All freight charges are collected at half price according to the Ende Wheel's method. Also, the New Xiangtai of the Huimin Company has also been approved to sail to Ningbo and set sail to Taiwan yesterday afternoon to transfer to Ningbo.

Ningbo Wheel Passenger Tickets will also be Reduced

The cargo-loading special wheels on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, including the Moufu Wheel of the Zilihe Foreign Company, the Kaibo Wheel of the Ningshao Company, and the Ende and Deping Wheels of the China-Italy Company, etc., have successively implemented freight reductions in order to compete for business. According to the shipping industry, if the direct Shanghai-Ningbo route is actually restored, the prices of passenger tickets on each wheel will also be reduced uniformly. It is generally expected that the steerage will be three yuan per person, but will be reduced to two yuan or one yuan and five jiao. The prices of official cabin tickets will also be proportionally reduced to lighten the burden on passengers.

### Public Debt Principal and Interest Paid by Yu. The Bank of China Telegraphed Yu to Inquire. It will be Clear After the Reply Telegram Arrives in Shanghai. But It has Nothing to do with the Overall Credit.

The Ministry of Finance has never been overdue in paying the principal and interest of public debt since the War of Resistance, which has gained the trust of bondholders. Therefore, the informal market's dark market trading in Shanghai, various bonds such as Unified, have risen sharply, setting a new record since the war. Now the five types of Unified public bonds, Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, and Wu, have been selected to repay the principal and pay interest on the drawn bonds. The sixth decision to repay the principal and draw lots for the Renaissance Public Debt was held on the 10th of this month and is scheduled to be paid at the end of February. Regarding the Chongqing payment issue, the Silver and Money Industry Association's National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central, China, and Communications Banks have not yet received orders from the Ministry. However, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank telegraphed its head office in Yu yesterday to inquire. It is certain that it will be clear after the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai. But if Chongqing's payment becomes a reality, it is not a delay in repaying the principal and paying interest, and it has nothing to do with the overall credit. A reporter from the New Voice Agency inquired in the financial circles yesterday that the rumored installment payment may not be the truth. Or because the money received in Yu for payment is subject to restrictions on remittance, it has to be remitted from Yu to Shanghai in installments. The main reason for paying in Chongqing is said to be to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, so as to avoid creating improper transactions for speculators. Moreover, the recent increase in legal tender in Shanghai has exceeded the legitimate needs of the market.

### Stallholders at the Fuzhou Road Vegetable Market Sponsor Refugees. Companies and Firms Offer Sales Commissions. A Considerable Amount has been Collected and Remitted.

The stallholders at the Fuzhou Road Vegetable Market in this city, Ma Dongfa, Li Deming, Ren Yongsheng, Wu Ating, Jin Zhiliang, Lin Dafeng, Le Bingtao, Yan Aliang, Wu Aliang, Liu Afang, Qiu Sibao, Qian Xinren, etc., in view of the fact that helping refugees is the duty of everyone, initiated a stallholder participation in the refugee sponsorship movement to share the good deeds. Due to economic reasons, it is best if a stallholder can independently sponsor a refugee. Otherwise, several stallholders can jointly sponsor one or several refugees. Yesterday, they went to the Civil Group of the Refugee Association at 414 Xingye Building, Beijing Road, to collect refugee sponsorship certificates and began to solicit donations.

Sales Commissions Sponsor Refugees

Hengyi Sheng Department Store on Wuma Road and the Sino-American Dry Cleaning Company at 544 Sichuan Road held sales commission sponsorships for refugees during the broadcast solicitation period of the Civil Group of the Refugee Association. Now it has ended. Hengyi Sheng has collected 112 yuan and 1 jiao of domestic currency, and the Sino-American Company has collected 52 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen. Yesterday, they were sent to the solicitation meeting of the Civil Group to serve as refugee sponsorship donations. Also, Yitai Rice Shop also offered commission sponsorships for refugees.

All Parties Enthusiastically Sponsored

The Civil Group's solicitation meeting advocated the refugee sponsorship movement, and all parties enthusiastically participated. Yesterday, the association continued to receive 200 refugees sponsored monthly by the中華黃卍字會 (Chinese Yellow Swastika Society), totaling 400 yuan of domestic currency per month, for a period of six months. Qu Huang donated 40 yuan, Yu Guipi transferred 40 yuan from his birthday banquet, Zhang Songshan 72 yuan, Dong Hefu 10 yuan, Zhu Shide Tang Chengji 300 yuan, Yang Xiutang Xiyu 13 yuan, Gu Shide 120 yuan, Wang Xianting 100 yuan, Wang Xianting Jing Mu Zai Huaigu and others 12 yuan, Mrs. Zhuang 12 yuan, Yu Xizhang 18 yuan.

### Italian Soldier Shot Chen Peiqing Case. Request for Punishment. It is Heard that the Municipal Council will Have a Considerable Response.

The case of the Italian soldier shooting Yixing native Chen Peiqing has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Shanghai Yixing Native Place Association believes that the innocent victim was shot by an Italian soldier at will, which is unreasonable. They have formally sent a letter to the Italian Consulate requesting punishment of the shooting soldier and compensation for all damages. They have also sent a letter to the Municipal Council, asking them to consult with the Italian Consulate on this matter. The original letter is as follows: "Respectfully, Chen Peiqing, a worker and member of our association, was passing by the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Yaoshui Alley at 6:00 AM on the 11th of this month when he was seen by a soldier stationed in the Italian army camp. The soldier ordered him to stop. Due to language barriers, a misunderstanding occurred. The soldier suddenly fired several shots, hitting Chen Peiqing in both legs, causing him to fall to the ground. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by a岗警 (gongjing - police on patrol). His injuries are quite serious and may lead to disability. After investigation, Chen Peiqing was walking on the side of the road and was unarmed. Even if there was a misunderstanding, the circumstances were very minor. There was no need to shoot him. Moreover, Chen Peiqing has a wife and child to support. Now he needs medical treatment and it requires a huge expense. In addition to sending a letter to the Italian Consulate to lodge a protest, we specially send a letter to your general office, asking you to consult with the Italian Consulate to punish the soldier who fired the shot in accordance with the law and compensate all the damages and expenses, so as to maintain humanitarianism and sympathize with the innocent. We deeply pray for this and wait for your reply." It is heard that the Municipal Council will have a considerable response in the coming days and that the association has sent letters to various public organizations to request unanimous support to uphold justice.

### Religious Leader Comments on Prince of Yemen
### Xi'an Mosque Destroyed by Japanese Aircraft, Mr. Herr's so-called opening-up is not sincere

According to the Continental News, regarding the statements made by Prince To'hsein of Yemen during his stay in Shanghai last week, yesterday (the 13th), a well-known religious leader in this city told reporters that Mr. Herr's sympathy should be judged by the sincerity of his remarks. According to Mr. Herr's remarks to reporters last Sunday (the 8th), the people of Yemen are deeply concerned about the development of China, especially "the impact of this development on Chinese Muslims." After Mr. Herr flew to Guangzhou by plane from Shanghai on Monday morning, news spread from the Allied Society that Prince Herr expressed surprise at the number of Chinese people returning to Guangdong, etc. The religious leader recalled that Mr. Herr arrived in Tokyo in May last year for the opening of a new mosque there, and said that Chinese Muslims should observe Mr. Herr's long stay in Japan with great suspicion. The opening of a mosque should not take eight months. It only took the Japanese eight minutes to destroy four mosques in Xi'an. Mr. Herr's statement that he had no time to investigate the situation of Chinese Muslims is completely accurate. If he had time to investigate, he would not only express concern for Chinese Muslims. I have news from Xi'an that when Japanese planes bombed the four mosques there, the number of Muslims killed reached three to four hundred, and the number of injured has not yet been counted. Mr. Herr must have been very busy during his stay in Shanghai, but if he was very concerned about Chinese Muslims, he would have wanted to stay in Shanghai for a short time after his eight months in Japan to obtain direct information. We certainly welcome overseas sympathy for Chinese Muslims, but if we want to get any benefit from it, we cannot just give verbal sympathy. Mr. Herr's tour of the Far East should be based on sincerity, but we seem to feel that he does not have this sincerity. It is hoped that Mr. Herr, before being a politician, can remember that he is a Muslim.

### Use of Customs Duties, the Japanese are Extremely Secretive
### They Only Say They Will Know After Investigation

According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, at a reception for newspaper reporters held by the Japanese yesterday (the 13th), a reporter asked about the surplus of the Jianghai Customs tax revenue, such as whether it was all deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank if it was not deposited in the HSBC Bank, and whether there were any payments made for loans secured by customs duties, and if so, how much. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy replied that he did not know, but promised to investigate. He was also asked whether the "Renovation Government" had ever withdrawn or borrowed funds from customs duties with customs duties as collateral. The spokesman also said that he would only know after investigation.

### Special Shanghai Edition
### The Textile Industry in Shanghai
— Diler

The Cutting Pain of Skin and Flesh That Cannot Be Ignored

Japan, which started its business with the textile industry, will never forget Shanghai, the textile center of China. Before August 13th, they often complained to their ancestors for abandoning the plan to establish the Donghua Textile Company in Shanghai in 1895. Otherwise, British merchants and others would not have taken the lead, and Shanghai might have been划划within their sphere of influence long ago, like "North China." Now, Japanese textile conglomerates will naturally not miss the opportunity, because not only have Chinese-owned factories stopped or been destroyed, but even British-owned factories and others are unable to move. This is the perfect opportunity to undo past mistakes. The textile industry in Shanghai, like others, must rewrite its history. But what was the past like? What is the present like? And what will the future be like? We are not outsiders, and we have cutting pain of skin and flesh in everything, so we cannot but ask!

The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" of the Shanghai Textile Industry

In 1890, Li Hongzhang founded the "Machine Weaving Bureau" in Shanghai, which was truly unprecedented in China. Who knew that as soon as the factory was equipped, it was burned down. Fortunately, in the same year, a joint government-private textile bureau was established in Shanghai, which can be regarded as the first chapter of Chinese textile history written by the Chinese themselves. This textile bureau has been reorganized repeatedly and has become today's Hengfeng, maintaining its position as the elder brother. However, it is said that it has now been adopted as a son-in-law by the "Dai Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd."

Following the Textile New Bureau, the Yuyuan Yarn Factory "which was acquired by the Japanese Naigaiwata Co. in 1918 and became the company's Ninth Factory," and the rebuilt Machine Weaving Bureau (which has been reorganized repeatedly and is now part of the Shenxin system, listed as the Ninth Factory) were established one after another in Shanghai. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, and the Japanese were the first to obtain the right to build factories in China. Therefore, in that year, there was a plan to establish the Donghua Textile Factory in Shanghai, but some conglomerates thought it would be more profitable to do it in their own country, so they gave up. Although the Japanese did not succeed, British, American, German and other textile capitals quickly cited the principle of "equal opportunity" and quickly bought land and built houses in Shanghai to conduct large-scale operations. Later, Japanese merchants quickly caught up, and Chinese merchants also competed bravely. As a result, although German and American yarn factories were squeezed out, the foundation of British merchants was already deep, and the development of Chinese merchants was even faster. In the end, the situation of Chinese, British, and Japanese yarn factories standing on three legs was created. The Japanese ancestors who were scolded in the ground would probably have to admit their mistakes.

Who Wants to "Lose Both the Lady and the Troops"?

On the eve of August 13th, there were a total of 65 textile factories in Shanghai. Among them, 31 were Chinese-owned, 30 were Japanese-owned, and 4 were British-owned. Most of them were distributed in Pudong, Puxi, and Zhabei; a few were in the concession areas. When the August 13th war broke out, except for the concession area, all were in the war zone. According to the investigation, the factories that suffered losses in the war are as follows.

Pudong District Hengfeng (54,916 spindles) Zhenhua (13,548 spindles)

Shenxin Fifth Factory (66,928 spindles) Shenxin Sixth Factory (79,378 spindles)

Shenxin Seventh Factory (67,898 spindles) Weitong (31,024 spindles)

Yong'an First Factory (28,160 spindles) Sulun (17,088 spindles)

(Note) Shen Bao, November 9, 1938

Shanghai (15,200 spindles)

Puxi District Shenxin First Factory (72,476 spindles) Shenxin Eighth Factory (50,400 spindles)

Dafeng (29,950 spindles) Zhentai (30,540 spindles)

Dingxin (28,590 spindles)

Pudong District Hengda (20,160 spindles)

Wusong District Yong'an Second Factory (50,000 spindles) Yong'an Fourth Factory (89,500 spindles)

Total 17 Factories (757,760 spindles)

Before the war, Chinese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai had a total of 1,226,000 spindles. According to this calculation, those that were destroyed accounted for 62 percent. If we had completely implemented the scorched earth resistance policy at that time, then some factories would not have been implicated, and now they are suspected of being "traitors." According to Japanese propaganda, in addition to restoring its original textile industry in Shanghai, it has also obtained "trust" and "cooperation" from many Chinese-owned yarn factories. Therefore, combined with its textile plunder in other occupied areas, it has formed the following prestige

(Note) Printed indicates that there was a saying that the acquisition was successful before the war.

(Note) Printed indicates that there was a saying that the acquisition was successful before the war.

(Note) Chinese National Economic Research Institute, "Selected Readings from China and Abroad," Volume 2, Issue 12, "Economy of the Occupied Areas."

Of course, this can only prove that his ambition to monopolize the Chinese textile market is great, it can only prove that he is brazenly occupying Chinese property, and it can only illustrate that the safety of national capital cannot be guaranteed without the protection of the state! We believe that the factory owners who have suffered will never be willing to lose their property, ruin their reputation, and even ruin the interests of their descendants. The foolishness of "losing both the lady and the troops" will of course make the ambitious Zhou Gongjin angry!

### Postmaster of Peiping Kidnapped
### Ransom Paid in Legal Tender
### Because Kidnappers Refused to Accept Counterfeit Money
### Incident Occurred Near Japanese Military

According to the Continental News, it was learned last night (the 13th) that Mr. Plati, the postmaster of Peiping, was kidnapped near the Ming Tombs in Peiping on Sunday. Although the ransom has been paid to the kidnappers, Mr. Plati is still being held in the Western Hills. The amount of the ransom has not been announced. Because the bandits refused to accept the counterfeit money of the "Joint Reserve Bank," it was paid in legal tender. A White Russian woman and three Chinese servants who were kidnapped at the same time as Mr. Plati have been released and returned to Peiping. According to them, Mr. Plati is in good health. The kidnapping occurred 25 miles from Peiping, only a stone's throw away from the Japanese garrison.

### Japanese Warships Block Yanglin

According to a person from Taicang yesterday, a small Japanese gunboat was anchored between Yanglin and Qiya on the south bank of the Yangtze River the day before yesterday (the 12th). In addition, there were four or five wooden-hulled steamers, fully loaded with Japanese troops patrolling back and forth on the river, prohibiting all kinds of ships from docking and searching foreign merchant ships and civilian ships passing through the blockade line. Moreover, a small team of Japanese troops, about forty or fifty people, had sneaked into the mouth of the island on the night of the 13th. The Wang Shilai troops, now stationed south of Yiqiao and north of Fubridge, have moved to the Jiangkou area to prepare for a painful blow and annihilation. Liuh River, Qiya, Dangqi, and other ports are still open to navigation.

### Jianghai Customs Actually Yielded to Japanese Merchants
### Actually Filling Out Japanese Bills of Lading
### And Plan to Set Up Customs Branch Offices

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, according to Japanese sources today (the 14th), the negotiations between the Jianghai Customs and the personnel of the Japanese Yusen Shipping Company have harmoniously resolved the issue of using Japanese in the import declaration forms. Because Japanese goods account for the largest share of Shanghai's imports, the Japanese Yusen Shipping Company believes that Japanese importers should enjoy the same convenience in customs procedures as people from other countries. After negotiations, the company has filled out Japanese bills of lading and plans to immediately fill out Japanese lists of goods, and encourages other Japanese merchants and import companies to follow the example of the Japanese Yusen Shipping Company and use Japanese bills of lading. In order to further simplify the import procedures for Japanese people, personnel from the Japanese Consulate General have negotiated with the customs authorities to station a large number of Japanese personnel in the senior parts of the customs. This has come to an end, and it is planned to set up a customs branch office in a certain undetermined location, and the Japanese personnel to be added to the customs have also been selected by the Japanese Consulate.

### Price of the Nanyang-Singapore Route
### Price Hikes Sharply
### Compatriot Families Crowding to Go
### Prices Have More Than Doubled Compared to Before

According to transportation industry sources, most of the compatriots from South China who go abroad gather in Hong Kong. Therefore, the prices of ship tickets from Hong Kong to Singapore and other ports have suddenly skyrocketed. After the general refugee women and children arrive in Hong Kong, they all feel that the cost of living is too high to maintain, and their husbands and children mostly make a living in Nanyang. Therefore, there are many women and children going abroad. The price of ship tickets to Singapore for female passengers has soared from 80 yuan to 190 yuan, and the price of ship tickets for male passengers has risen from 110 yuan to 200 yuan. It is also heard that the Singapore government will implement new regulations, and all new passengers entering the country must pay a 7.5 yuan examination fee.

### Gunshots Heard in Beixinjing Yesterday
### Dock Prepared
### Boats Escaped Into the Suzhou River
### Some Shuttle Sedan Stopped

Rumors have been rampant in Puxi in recent days, the situation has become tense, and precautions have been strengthened. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 14th, clear gunshots were heard from the Beixinjing area, and the residents were awakened from their sleep. The boats parked in the Beixinjing area were panicked and sailed into the new garbage bridge of the Suzhou River. Now the Beixinjing pier is heavily guarded, and the ships and passengers entering and leaving the inland river must disembark and be strictly inspected. Therefore, some shuttle ferries have stopped running due to the trouble of inspection and few passengers.

### The Government Issues an Order to Handle Drafts Carefully
### Conscription
### Must Follow the Three Principles of Fairness
### Must Not Have Any Favoritism or Corruption

The authorities ordered the provinces to instruct the counties to handle the draft carefully, saying, "It has been secretly reported that the heads of villages, towns, baojia, etc. have repeatedly reported that for the drafting of soldiers, they either buy people with money, impersonate others, or take advantage of their power for personal gain, taking the opportunity to blackmail. There are even ruffians and hooligans who take advantage of the draft to sell money. All kinds of malpractices are emerging one after another. If they are not strictly corrected, the future of the draft will be affected, which is not a small matter. It is hoped that the counties, towns, and baojia heads, etc., must follow the three principles of fairness in the Conscription Law, be impartial, selfless, fair, and upright, and handle the draft carefully. There must be no favoritism or corruption. If anyone dares to re-offend and not repent, they will be severely punished."

### Belgian Ambassador
### Gillou Returns to Shanghai

According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Gillou, has recently returned to Shanghai and resides at 160 Tairas Road.

### Japanese Ambassador to France
### Resigned Due to Illness and Returned Home

According to the Continental News yesterday (the 13th), the Japanese Continental New News reported that a certain Japanese ship arrived in Shanghai at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, carrying the resigned Japanese Ambassador to France, Yangtaro Sugimura, who passed through Shanghai to return to Japan. According to reports, Sugimura suffered from intestinal disease and underwent surgery twice in Paris last year. This time he returned to Japan for further treatment.

### The French Concession has not yet considered
### Dispersing Refugees
### According to the Public Works Department, this statement is premature

According to the Continental News, there are rumors that 10,000 Chinese refugees currently living in various shelters in the French Concession will be disbanded by the French authorities before April 1. According to a senior official of the Public Works Department of the French Concession, this statement is premature, but he refused to deny this statement. Later, he said that the Public Works Department does not intend to criticize the rumored disbandment of refugees. At the same time, news related to the Shanghai Relief Program told reporters from all walks of life that there is no plan to disband the refugees in the French Concession. They also believe that it is too early to even consider this matter. According to Chinese sources, the Public Works Department not only decided to disband the refugees in the shelters, but also considered allocating 300,000 yuan to assist this move.

### China Book Bureau
### Establishes Printing Plant in Yunnan
### Works Simultaneously with Haiphong Branch
### Employees are Assigned from Hong Kong and Shanghai

The China Book Bureau, in view of Yunnan Kunming being an important location for the War of Resistance and national construction, and at the request of the provincial government, established a large-scale printing plant in Kunming Province to facilitate the printing of various documents. The bureau, after sending personnel to the local area to survey the factory site, immediately raised funds and actively proceeded. It is learned that the factory is named Dazhong Printing Company, and the capital is borne by both labor and management. The preparations have been completed recently. It is said that Liu Xuhuai has been hired as the general manager, and work began this month. The business is very prosperous, and all employees have been transferred from Shanghai and Hong Kong. The wages are similar to those of the factories in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In addition, the Haiphong China Book Bureau branch printing plant also began operations this month, but its scope is smaller.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's 1938
### Library Report
### The New Library Site Has Many Advantages
### Four New Library Rooms Added

According to the report of the director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library, in the past year, there were a total of 714 readers who paid subscription fees to the library (80 Chinese, 438 foreigners, 179 Chinese students, 17 foreign students), an increase of 139 people compared with the previous year. A total of 59,004 books were borrowed (12,193 non-fiction books, 44,435 fiction books, 962 children's books, 1,414 Chinese books), an increase of 4,342 books circulated compared with the previous year. Most of the books borrowed in previous years were recently published books, but in the past year, due to the large number of students subscribing to books, all kinds of science and literature books were borrowed. The expenditure for purchasing new books was budgeted at 4,000 yuan, of which 800 yuan was allocated for the purchase of Chinese books. Due to the high price of books, only 623 books were purchased (129 non-fiction books, 222 fiction books, 15 children's books, 257 Chinese books). For several of the most popular books, another copy should have been purchased due to the needs of readers, but it was not possible due to the high price of books. Only 39 kinds of books were added. A total of 98 books were donated by various circles, and a total of 370 books were rebound.

Since July 1st of last year, the library has been located at the new site on the second floor of the Qatai Building. Compared with the old site, the new site has many advantages. Its location is central, and because it is adjacent to the British Consulate's open space on both sides, it is not connected to the bustling city, which reduces the disadvantages of noise. It is very suitable for readers to read with peace of mind. Moreover, because the houses are spacious, a reference room, a public reading room, a reading room for readers who pay subscription fees, and a children's reading room can be set up. The arrangement of English books is suitable and easy to check. Chinese books are stored in another place.

### Japanese Puppets in Guerrilla Areas
### Forcibly Conscripting Young Men into the Army
### The Purpose is to Control Chinese with Chinese
### Falsely Claiming Self-Defense and Anti-Communism

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, according to Japanese sources, the puppet "Central Maintenance of Peace Committee" organized by the puppet regime in Nanjing and the Japanese army and navy authorities will establish the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth League," forcibly conscripting Chinese people from 17 to 30 years old in the Central China guerrilla areas to serve in the puppet "League" for seven years. It is estimated that 1.35 million people will be forcibly conscripted this year, falsely claiming that the purpose of organizing the puppet "League" is for self-defense and anti-communism, and the local puppet security forces and puppet police will assist. The puppet "Committee" will command the "League" to assist the Japanese army in military operations behind the front line. The daily expenditure is 1 million yuan. However, according to various Chinese circles in this city, how can the puppet "Renovation Government" afford the daily expenditure of 1 million yuan? The Japanese national treasury is already heavily burdened and in danger. Moreover, it is still doubtful whether the Japanese army is willing to arm these Chinese.

### Sir Sassoon
### Donates 150,000
### Jewish Refugees All Get Their Due
### Two More Batches of Jews Continue to Arrive

According to the Shanghai Times, according to news received in this city yesterday (the 13th), Sir Sassoon, a Shanghai giant merchant now living in London, has donated 150,000 yuan to the committee responsible for the European Jewish Immigrant Rehabilitation Fund in this city. This huge sum of money is designated to be allocated to the special rehabilitation fund, which aims to assist European Jewish refugees in engaging in various businesses in this city. The committee has already assisted refugees in establishing medical rooms, clothing stores, and even taverns, so the fund is becoming increasingly short. Sir Sassoon's telegram to Shanghai, donating a huge sum of money, is a timely aid to the purpose of the committee. According to news obtained in this city yesterday, 50 immigrants who had boarded a certain European ship and transferred to Hong Kong took the Japanese coastal freighter Sanyo (transliteration) and departed from Hong Kong yesterday morning, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 15th) afternoon.

### Fire Severed the Escalator, Nine Men and Women Burned to Death: Unable to Escape, Crying in Agony; Four or Five Others Injured by Burns

Yongxinglong Copper and Iron Bed Shop at 334 Edward Road, founded by Fan Delong of Ningbo, used the upper floors not only as living quarters for his family but also as a workshop and rented out to several households. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon around 1:30 PM, the lacquer workshop on the upper floor caught fire due to the carelessness of the workers who knocked over a can of shellac. The thick smoke quickly spread, and the fire rapidly intensified. Within moments, the escalator was severed by the flames, and the upper floors simultaneously caught fire, leaving thirteen or fourteen men and women trapped with no means of escape. Their cries of agony resonated far and wide. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade received the alarm early and immediately dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the blaze, preventing a greater disaster. The fire was quickly put out. However, of the men and women on the upper floors, only Cai Gu and his one-year-old child escaped. The others were nowhere to be found. Firefighters searched and found nine charred bodies of men and women, their faces unrecognizable, a truly gruesome sight. The bodies were immediately sent to the coroner's office for examination and family identification. Additionally, around 2:00 PM, four or five men and women, including Cai Fengxi and Xu Mao, were rescued from the fire with burns and were sent to Renji and Tongren Hospitals for emergency treatment. However, their injuries were severe, and their conditions are critical. Among the dead and injured were the owner of the bed shop's two wives and four children. It is truly a tragic case.

### Brothers in a Property Dispute: Contesting Over Four Million; Defendant Fails to Appear After Repeated Summons; Defense Lawyer Willing to Settle

Guo Zhuqiao, a Chaozhou native residing at 535 Xiafei Road and engaged in the opium trade, accumulated considerable wealth. In August of the 26th year, his half-brother Guo Taixiang (28 years old, residing at 20, Lane 179 Kangnao Road) retained lawyer Li Mo to file a private prosecution in the criminal division of the Second Special Court, accusing him of embezzling shared property worth more than four million yuan, requesting an investigation. According to the prosecution's allegations, the late Mr. Ruiting, the father of the prosecutor and six sons, including the eldest Runqing, the second elder brother Zhuqiao (the defendant), the third Taigong, the fourth Weiyi, the fifth Tai Zhong (deceased), and the sixth being the prosecutor. Their father passed away in the second year of the Republic when the prosecutor was three years old. During his father's lifetime, he jointly operated the Guodeshun Business with his uncle, Bai Xiang. The defendant managed the business single-handedly without ever providing any accounting reports. The prosecutor repeatedly demanded that the defendant provide an analysis, but he ignored it. It was not until April of this year that the prosecutor discovered an accounting report by accountant Jiang Wanping of the Guodeshun Company at his nephew Yi Cao's residence, showing that the company had assets of 1.3 million yuan in the eighth year of the Republic, which, with interest, has now grown to over four million. The prosecutor requested the defendant to provide an analysis, but he consistently refused. Therefore, the prosecutor photographed the accountant's report and legally filed a lawsuit requesting an investigation by the court. The court issued several summons, but the defendant failed to appear, leading to the case being shelved.

Yesterday afternoon, presiding Judge Liao continued the hearing. The prosecutor, accompanied by lawyer Li, appeared and stated that the defendant was indeed in Shanghai and had not left, deliberately failing to appear. They requested a warrant for his arrest and interrogation. The defendant still did not appear. Lawyers Shen Zhaojiu and Wu Guangding appeared on his behalf, stating that the defendant originally resided in Suzhou, but after the war, he moved to Guangfu and then to another location. According to his family, the defendant is currently in Hong Kong marrying off his daughter and will come to Shanghai soon. The defendant has a sincere desire to settle the case. Previously, Mr. Du, Xia Zhujun, Chen Nianpeng, and others mediated, and 200,000 yuan has been deposited. They requested a postponement so that their lawyers could meet with the defendant and negotiate a settlement. The court ordered a postponement to February 11 for further hearing, warning that if the defendant fails to appear again, he will be arrested without fail.

### Former Metropolitan Dance Hall Ceases Operations and is Recalled; Manager Accused of Embezzlement: Omissions in Accounting Lead to Discrepancies; Settlement Expected After Defendant Recovers

Chuan Xuelin, a wealthy young businessman from Ningbo currently residing at 21 Baoyu Fang, Chengdu Road (formerly the son-in-law of coal magnate Xie Hengxuan, recently involved in a divorce lawsuit), and Zhang Shaozong jointly invested in opening the Metropolitan Dance Hall at 14 Malong Road in the French Concession in September of last year. The business was thriving, but after only two months, it ran aground and ceased operations. During the recall and liquidation, it was discovered that shareholder and manager Zhang Shaozong had continuously embezzled business assets. Therefore, Chuan Xuelin retained lawyer Xu Wufang to file a criminal private prosecution against Zhang Shaozong in the criminal division of the Second Special Court for embezzlement, requesting an investigation under Article 366 of the law. The court, based on the complaint, conducted a trial yesterday afternoon in the Second Criminal Court presided over by Criminal Judge Liao. The defendant Zhang Shaozong claimed illness and sent a lawyer to appear on his behalf. The prosecutor Chuan Xuelin, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared and presented the indictment. According to the prosecutor's lawyer, Xu, after receiving the court summons, the defendant sent someone to say that there were omissions in the accounting, leading to discrepancies during the accountant's audit. They requested a postponement, hoping for a settlement after the defendant recovers and both parties meet to verify the accounts. The defendant's defense lawyer also agreed to a postponement. The court then ordered a postponement to the 24th for further hearing.

### Woman Conceals Opium: Intercepted by Detectives; Also Arrested One Opium Trafficker

Ye Yushan, chief detective of the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Xu Zhengting learned that someone was smuggling opium and would pass through the intersection of Parker Road and Qingdao Road. They went to wait at the designated time. Soon, Feng Wang, a woman from Zhejiang (31 years old, residing at 103 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road), approached. The detectives stopped her and found a package of opium weighing ten taels. They took her to the police station, where she confessed that she had bought the opium from Chen Guangzhong, a Cantonese man at 304 Parker Road, for 85 yuan. The detectives then arrested Chen. Chen confessed that he had obtained the opium from Chen Yunshan, the owner of Yuanfeng Pawnshop at 356 Aierjin Road. The detectives went there, but Chen Yunshan had already fled. Only Chen's wife, Liu, was arrested and detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed charges according to Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Offenses and presented the case, stating that because the main culprit, Chen Yunshan, was on the run, they requested a postponement. After the presiding judge briefly questioned the three defendants, he ordered them to be detained pending further review in seven days.

### Chang Yuqing Secretly Comes to Shanghai: Convenes Secret Meeting of Gang Members; Someone from a Certain Party Attends

A fast mail from this city reports that Chang Yuqing, the leader of the Huangdao Society, who previously fled to Nanjing to hide after being wanted by the concession police, has secretly come to Shanghai again and is conducting secret activities. He convened a terrorist party congress the day before yesterday in the Japanese-occupied area of the Shanghai West outer road, and someone from a certain party also attended, which is quite noteworthy. The Huangdao Society terrorist party has been repeatedly involved in incidents disrupting public order within the concession. Since Chang's arrest warrant and escape, their influence has diminished. This time, his return to Shanghai clearly indicates further action.

### Landlord and His Three Sons Arbitrarily Detained by Japanese Troops: Still Not Released After Nine Days; Numerous Possessions Confiscated During the Search

The North China Daily News reports: "According to information obtained from responsible sources, the wealthy Chinese landlord and his two sons, who have been 'detained' by the Japanese side for nine days, were still being held by the Japanese military police at 94 Jessfield Road (Jixifei Road) yesterday (the 13th). The reason for their arrest is said to be because they had two handguns, some ammunition, and an old military uniform that his youngest son wore while at military school."

"Late at night on the 4th of this month, a team of armed Japanese, some in military uniform, broke into 155, Lane 361, the corner of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road. The homeowner, Zeng Zuo'nan (60 years old), and his two sons, Zeng Lianghe (25 years old) and Zeng Liangying (23 years old) (all names translated), were arrested by the Japanese military police." Zeng's house faces the concession road and is actually in the Chinese area. When the Japanese troops arrived in front of his house, Zeng's family was already asleep. Although they were awakened by the knocking, they hesitated to open the door. The Japanese troops then broke in and searched the house. It is said that the Japanese troops found two handguns with licenses issued by the Municipal Council, some bullets, and a military uniform worn by Zeng's youngest son when he was at a military school in Suzhou. In addition to the above items, the 'searchers' also found 10,000 yuan in cash and many bank passbooks and contracts, which were all packed into three suitcases and taken to the military police headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. According to the latest news, Zeng and his two sons are still being held at the headquarters. Negotiations for their release are currently underway."

### Monk Xu Shot Dead: Thugs Broke in and Opened Fire; Rumor That the Deceased Had Collaborated with the Puppets

Xu Hesang, a native of Jiangbei, 30 years old, residing in the front building of 24 Renxian Lane, Roberts Road, Shanghai West, was said to have been a detective for the Public Security Bureau before the war. However, he had been unemployed since the Chinese troops withdrew from Shanghai. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, while he was still asleep at home, three or four young men suddenly broke into his bedroom. They seemed to know each other, so Xu got up and greeted them. However, after a brief conversation, a dispute suddenly arose. The men pulled out handguns and fired four or five shots at Xu before fleeing. Xu was shot in the back of the head and chest and died immediately due to the fatal wounds. At the same time, Xu Bao, a 40-year-old woman from Jingjiang who lived in the rear building, heard the quarrel in the front building and peeked out, resulting in her being hit by stray bullets in the forehead and wrist. Afterward, her roommate reported the incident to the police, who sent her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Xu's body was sent to the coroner's office for examination, and a manhunt was launched. The reason for the murder is unknown, but it is rumored that Xu had been associating with the puppet "Police Bureau Detective Team" recently and was said to have been working as a detective.

### Unidentified Man Died Kneeling: Found an Ivory Seal with Zhang Zhongfu's Name; Also Land Deeds from Nanhui County

At the entrance of the alleyway of 429 Youyi Lane, east of the Gongwutai Theater on Edward Road, a nameless man, aged about 30, poorly dressed, was found kneeling and squatting on the ground like a beggar. A policeman saw him and tried to move him, but he was unresponsive. Upon closer inspection, he was already dead. The incident was reported to the French Police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyu Branch coroner's office. An ivory seal with the inscription "Zhang Zhongfu" was found on the deceased, along with four land deeds from Nanhui County, three land contracts, a photograph of a land contract, a summons from the Nanhui County Government and the Judiciary issued in November of the 23rd year regarding a debt execution lawsuit filed by Yan Xiren against Qu Shuyuan, and a letter. The detective reported to the police chief to investigate and identify the body. The incident will be reported to the Second Special Court tomorrow for officials to conduct an examination.

### Accused of Stealing Money After Mistaking a Handbag

Tang Yuncheng (40 years old), a native of Funing, was sentenced to four months in prison with a three-year reprieve for stealing. This month, on the 6th, Tang Yuncheng and his friend Li Baoheng (33 years old) each brought a large sum of money by boat to Shanghai to purchase goods. They arrived on the 8th and stayed at Room 77 of the Sanpeng Hotel on Baliqiao Street in the French Concession. Both men had a handbag each, with Tang having 3,000 yuan and Li having 1,300 yuan, all placed inside. The bags were deposited with the hotel cashier. However, the bags were of the same style, making it difficult to distinguish them. On the afternoon of the 11th, when Li went out, he instructed the tea boy to retrieve a handbag from the cashier to withdraw money. The tea boy mistakenly retrieved Tang's handbag and gave it to Li. Li did not look closely and opened the bag, taking out 700 yuan in legal tender. He returned the bag to the tea boy to place it back with the cashier and took the money to the 16th Dock to order 200 yuan worth of sugar from a sugar merchant, keeping the remaining 500 yuan on his person. When he returned to the hotel at 4:00 PM, Tang had already returned and ordered his handbag to be retrieved, discovering the theft. He reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and took Li to the police station. The police attorney, Fei Xizhen, presented the case, filing a public prosecution for theft. The plaintiff then stated the events. The defendant confessed that it was indeed a mistake due to his haste and that he did not intend to steal. He retained lawyer Sun Fumin to defend him. Judge Zhu Chuzhe reviewed the confession and sentenced Li Baoheng to four months in prison, suspended for three years, releasing him in court.

### Apprentice Injured While Trying to Capture Robbers at a Rice Shop

At around 10:20 AM yesterday morning, four robbers suddenly broke into a rice shop at 186 Xinjiapo Road, Shanghai West. One robber, carrying a gun, stormed into the shop, threatening everyone and driving them into a corner, confining them. The remaining robbers then began to loot, opening the counter and stealing over 200 yuan in cash, which they pocketed before escaping. One of the shop apprentices, Lu Wuliang, 20 years old, saw the robbers' plans and, having regained his freedom, fearlessly stepped forward and hugged the last robber, the one with the gun, around the waist, trying to take his weapon. However, the robber was strong and managed to escape, turning around and striking Lu several times on the head with the butt of his gun. Lu was injured and fell to the ground unconscious. The robbers fled without a trace. The shop reported the incident to the police, who sent Lu to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and dispatched detectives to track down the robbers.

### Suspect Fire at the Mingxing Film Company Studio: Japanese Troops Prevented the French Concession Fire Brigade from Putting Out the Fire; Dozens of Japanese Soldiers Indifferent as the Building Was Completely Destroyed

The North China Daily News reports: "Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, a large fire suddenly broke out at the former Mingxing Film Company studio in the Chinese area of Zhabei, Xujiahui Beach, Shanghai. Japanese military officers prevented the French Concession Fire Brigade from extinguishing the fire. The French Concession Fire Brigade arrived at the scene at around 1:00 PM. Only after an hour did the puppet fire brigade arrive. However, due to a lack of water, they were unable to control the fire. When the French Concession Fire Brigade arrived at the scene, the brigade captain, Mr. Boso, fearing that the flying sparks would endanger flammable materials in the French Concession, ordered that water be drawn from the concession to extinguish the fire. About twenty Japanese soldiers, armed with bayoneted rifles, threatened the French Concession Fire Brigade. According to an eyewitness, some of the Japanese soldiers even raised their guns as if to fire. Mr. Boso, not wanting any unfortunate incident to occur, ordered the firefighters to stop their action. About an hour after the French Concession fire trucks left, the Japanese soldiers withdrew. The cause of the fire is still a mystery. However, the Mingxing Film Company's studio and workshop have been completely destroyed. It is said that since the Japanese troops occupied the area, the company has been storing medical supplies for nearby military hospitals. An hour and a half after the fire broke out, fire trucks from Nanshi and Zhabei arrived at the scene, but they were unable to connect to any water source and left. Dozens of Japanese soldiers from nearby barracks stood by indifferently and did not help extinguish the fire. Only about ten coolies carried buckets of water to put out the fire. As of 5:30 PM, the fire was still not extinguished, and the building had been completely burned down."

### Robbery Gang Intercepted: One Robber Died; One Gang Member Sentenced; Remaining Criminals Awaiting Judgment

Xu Fangfu, a native of Yangzhou, residing at 84 Puaifang, Zhoujiazui Road, worked as a machinist at the British-owned electricity company and had some savings. His cousin, Xu Fangqing, who had lost money gambling, suddenly had malicious intentions and colluded with fellow villagers and robbers Ju Yuhu, Liu Shunliang, Wang Asan, Chen Deliang, Yuan Jiulin, and others. On the morning of the 31st of last month, around 5:00 AM, each carrying flashlights and knives, they were led by Xu Fangqing to the location. Xu Fangqing acted as a lookout nearby while Ju Yuhu and others entered through the back door. The victim, Xu Fangfu, had not returned from work at the electricity company. The group pulled out their knives and threatened his wife, Wang, to keep silent. They obtained a trunk containing 185 yuan in legal tender, along with valuables and a leather coat worth 216 yuan, and fled. While passing through the intersection of Meizhou Road and Lan Road, they were spotted by another gang of robbers, Ge Shengming (nickname "Little Blindman," 28 years old), a native of Anhui, and Xu Derong, a native of Wuxi, and five others. They were intercepted and forced to open the trunk to see what was inside. Ju and the others took advantage of the situation and stabbed Ge Shengming in the chest and buttocks with knives, causing him to fall to the ground. Seeing the situation, the rest of the gang scattered and fled. Ju Yuhu and the others took the trunk to the house of a friend named Liu at 135 Danyang Road to divide the loot. Ge Shengming was found by the police who arrived, sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and later died from his injuries. Jin Wanrong, Ji Xiucheng, and Liu Changgen, Chinese detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested Ju Yuhu, Xu Derong from Ge's gang, Xu Fangqing, and four others, escorting them to the First Special District Court. Ge Shengming died from his injuries during the postponement. The trial for the six robbers, including Xu Fangqing, concluded, and they are awaiting sentencing. Xu Derong was sentenced by Judge Jiang Shuzi yesterday morning to one year and three months in prison as a warning.

### Special Medicine for Chilblains - Swelling Disappears the Same Day if Unbroken - Healing Achieved Soon if Broken

Chilblains are caused by the coagulation of stagnant blood. Initially, they are red and swollen, causing unbearable pain and itching. After they have ulcerated, pus flows continuously, causing even more severe pain. This condition is especially common in winter, but there are few effective treatments, causing sufferers great distress. This year, Zhengwei Pharmacy (corner of Yinghua Street, 2nd Ma Road) has invented two kinds of miraculous medicines: (1) Chilblain Ruyi Water, which specializes in treating unbroken chilblains. After one use, the pain and itching stop immediately, and the redness and swelling disappear instantly. (2) Pearl White Jade Cream, which treats ulcerated chilblains. After one use, it removes decaying tissue and promotes new growth, resulting in complete recovery in a matter of days. The price is 25 cents per bottle for Ruyi Water and 40 cents for White Jade Cream. Telephone 92525. No delivery service.

Regarding the news published in your newspaper yesterday about Liang Alin fraudulently obtaining money for car purchases, which mentioned accomplices and the pre-appointment of a lawyer for defense, there are some discrepancies with the facts. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, Cao Zailin, the uncle of Cao Er, who used to be a driver at our office, introduced Liang Alin to our office, saying that he was his brother-in-law and had been falsely accused and was entrusted with the defense. According to Liang Alin's statement, he drove a car at the Yuan Mansion and had a deep-seated grudge against a neighboring driver. The driver falsely accused him of receiving more than 3,000 yuan for a car purchase and had already spoken to others about it, and was about to report it to the police station. Our lawyer told him that if he had not actually received the money, there was no reason for him to be framed out of thin air, and advised him not to worry. Liang Alin insisted that he had heard that the other party was preparing to make a false accusation, and that the amount of money he was falsely accused of was very large. As a driver, he could not find a guarantor and would definitely be detained. He would have to sign at the police station after being detained, which would be very inconvenient. He insisted on being allowed to sign an entrustment letter in advance. Our lawyer, with Cao Zailin's strong plea on his behalf, as Cao had been working as a driver at our friend's place for seven years and had never been known to be reckless, agreed to his request. The next evening, Cao Zailin and Cao Er sent 200 yuan for legal fees, saying that nothing had happened yet. Our lawyer refused to accept it, as no case had occurred yet, and instructed them to take it back. Cao and others insisted on not taking it back, so it was agreed that 100 yuan would be designated as a consultation fee, and the remaining 100 yuan would be used to urge Liang Alin to come and take it back in person. These facts can be proven by the entrustment letter and receipt stub. According to Liang Alin and others, they never mentioned that he had defrauded others, had been arrested, or had been entrusted with the defense. Your newspaper's report was brief, and we are afraid that readers will misunderstand. We are hereby writing to clarify and request that you publish this statement according to law. Sincerely, Editor, Lawyer Xu Jiashi.

### Being a Person

— Older Child

Being a person is originally not an easy thing. One must be well-rounded and have both external flexibility and internal principles in order to be called a complete person. Childhood is the era when one begins to learn how to be a person. At this time, one must learn to the best of their ability, acquiring the knowledge and skills of being a person, so as to complete the mission and task of being a person in the future. Some say that being a person is difficult. In fact, although being a person can be challenging, as long as we identify our goals and pursue them, just like Napoleon who removed the word "difficult" from the dictionary, then even if it is difficult, it will not be too difficult. Sun Yat-sen said: "Knowing is difficult, action is easy." If we know that it is difficult, then it will be easier to do. However, since we want to be a person, we must do it even if it is difficult. Especially in this extraordinary period, we should be an extraordinary person. Therefore, we must constantly train ourselves and encourage others, so that everyone can become a brave and broad superman.

However, the first thing in being a person is to have ample knowledge, because knowledge is the foundation of one's life. To establish oneself in the world and achieve great things, one must possess rich knowledge. To make one's knowledge abundant, one only needs to read more books, more newspapers, more research, more learning, and pay attention to anything that can help one's knowledge progress. There is also common sense. Common sense and knowledge are linked and cannot be separated. However, common sense is broad and real, while knowledge is narrow and dead. If you put knowledge and common sense together, that is "learning." However, one should have different common sense to deal with each and every thing, whether it is national, social, global, scientific, philosophical, or even personal private life. But most of the common sense still depends on experience. With experience, one can have a correct understanding of anything. With a clear understanding, one can handle it with ease. As for a person with excellent knowledge and common sense, they must also have good behavior and forward-thinking ideas, because thought is a person's representative and also the pioneer of career success, while behavior is a person's personality and the foundation for gaining social trust. Therefore, we must constantly train our own thoughts and examine our own behaviors. If there are any inconsistencies, we must earnestly correct our mistakes. In addition, physical health is also the foundation of a person's success. No matter who it is, one cannot achieve great things in society without a strong physique. An East Asian weakling is likely to destroy their own distant future. Therefore, we must check our actions daily, be strict with our lives, and get rid of all bad habits that harm our body and mind.

In short, there are many ways to be a person, but as long as you do it seriously, you can be a useful person to the country and society.

### New Fables

— He Gongchao

Just Do It

Indians often like to say that there is no way. When they say there is no way, they stretch their hands forward. A foreigner who has been in India for many years said: "If I could be the emperor of India, the first thing I would do is cut off these hands that are stretched out to show that there is no way."

There is a big river in India, and the river surface is much higher than the land. In order to prevent the river from overflowing, the residents on land built a high dike long ago to block it.

Once, a bowl-sized hole was pierced in the dike, and water gurgled in from this hole. The first Indian came, saw it, and said: "There is no way!" He spread his palms and stretched them forward.

The second Indian came, saw it, and said: "There is no way!" He spread his palms and stretched them forward.

The third Indian came, saw it, and said: "There is no way!" He spread his palms and stretched them forward.

At this time, the hole became bigger and bigger, and the water flowed more and more rapidly.

The fourth Indian came, saw it, and said: "There is a way! There is a way!" He said to the first Indian, "Use both hands to cover the hole."

He said to the second Indian, "Go get a stone and plug the hole."

With this cover and plug, the water flow weakened.

The fourth Indian said again: "This is not a fundamental solution." He said to the third Indian, "Cup your hands together to make a megaphone, and shout loudly: 'The dike is leaking! The dike is leaking!'"

The nearby residents heard the shouting and rushed over in groups. After a while, they transported mud and repaired the dike. The dike was as good as new, and not a drop of water could leak in.

The terrible flood was thus eliminated.

As long as you do it, work together, there is a way to solve everything.

Will Tigers Eat Grass?

Tigers often came down from the mountains to kill livestock. The two hunters living in the mountain village dared not resist it, but agreed on peace terms with it: the villagers would offer it two cattle made of straw, and after it ate these two straw cattle, it would no longer come down the mountain to kill livestock.

The day of implementation arrived, and the hunter sent the "straw cow" to the tiger. The tiger sniffed it and said:

"Why doesn't this cow have any bloody smell? I don't want to eat it! Sorry, give me your own blood to eat!" After speaking, he pounced on the two.

One hunter escaped quickly and escaped the tiger's mouth. He returned to the village and said to the villagers:

"That beast rejected the straw cow and ate our friend! It is impossible to make peace with it! We can only eliminate it—otherwise, we will be eliminated by it!"

### Winter Games

— Chang Chunlü

The cold wind is howling outside the door, blowing the children to hide in the house, not daring to go out. The children who usually like to play the most are also hiding their heads and shrinking their hands, afraid to play. But the more you are afraid of the cold and afraid of moving, the more you feel cold. Playing can move our limbs, accelerate blood circulation, and warm our bodies.

There are many games in winter, like skipping rope. You only need to find a rope to play. On this rope, you can play many interesting tricks.

There is also kicking shuttlecock, can you do it? There are even more tricks: kick, lift, turn, bump, plate, jump, toe, skew corner, open four doors, close four doors...etc., it's extremely fun. It would be even more interesting to make an appointment with companions to compete.

Tug-of-war is also a very interesting game. However, you need more participants, divided into two equal groups, using a long rope, each holding one end, and pulling hard. Whoever is stronger and pulls the other party over is considered the winner.

Snow and ice are common things in winter, and we can use them to make all kinds of games. After it snows, you can build snowmen and have snowball fights. After the ice freezes, you can play ice skating games on the river.

Children! In winter, we must muster the spirit of not being afraid of the cold to play games. The above are all seasonal games for winter. Playing is very beneficial, let's all play!

### Winter

— Wu Yunsong, Fourth Grade Student of Xiangyao Elementary School

Time flies like a galloping horse. In the blink of an eye, it is winter again. The north wind is blowing very hard, and the clouds are about to fall. Most of the trees, flowers, and plants are withered, and various small insects are also hiding in their holes. Rich people light stoves for heating, eat big fish and big meat, wear silk and satin fur coats, and sleep in wild duck down quilts to spend this cold winter. Speaking of the frontline soldiers' bloody resistance against Japan, braving the cold, unafraid of death, fighting for victory, and sacrificing their lives on the battlefield, they have no fur coats to wear, no thick quilts to sleep in, and no white rice or cooked vegetables to fill their stomachs; but the rich people in Shanghai have everything, but they are unwilling to implement the condition that those who have money should pay, or have they not thought of it yet?

Children! I hope that everyone will save some of the money they spend on sweets, clothes, and toys every day and donate it to the country as soon as possible!

### Night View of Shanghai

— Yang Sheng, Sixth Grade Student of Shanghai Elementary School

The pale yellow sun has fallen below the horizon, and a round moon dimly illuminates this Oriental New York - Shanghai.

The god of night has descended.

On the road, trams, cars, and rickshaws are still running continuously. In the shops, the electric lights shine like daylight. On the sidewalk, one or two beggars are sleeping, calling out "Cold!" "Hungry!"

The shelters are full of cries and shouts of cold and hunger. The thin yellow faces have one or two wrinkles. The rich family lights the stove and goes to the warm bed.

In the Huangpu River, several foreign warships are quietly parked there. One or two small boats lightly pass by, and the "Yi Ya" sound breaks the silent dark world.

A fish-scale-like sunlight appeared on the horizon again, and the isolated island was in turmoil again.

### Visiting a Refugee Shelter

— Bai Yun'e, Third Grade Student of This Elementary School

One Sunday, I went to visit a refugee shelter with my father.

As soon as we entered, we felt that the air was not circulating, which was caused by the large number of people, so it was very uncomfortable.

I thought to myself; the food, clothing, and housing of these refugees were probably very safe at first, but after the "August 13th" incident occurred, terrible artillery fire and bombs destroyed their houses, so their food and clothing were robbed, and they were homeless, so they had to live in this crowded house, which is so painful!

The Spring Festival is coming soon, we should save the money we spend on buying sweets or firecrackers and donate it to them.

### Fish's Autobiography

— Lan Huang, Former Zhabei Elementary School Third Grade Student

I am a small fish. I swim around in the river every day and I am extremely happy. However, I really want to come to the surface of the river to play and see the scenery on the surface of the river.

However, when I poked my head out, I suddenly saw a fisherman, and I was so frightened that I retreated immediately.

A few days later, I forgot the panic and danger of the last time, and swam to the surface of the river again. I looked around and saw that there was no fisherman, so I played with peace of mind.

Unfortunately, just as I was having fun, a child jumped out from behind the tree. I was shocked, but it was too late to escape.

The child had been hiding behind the tree. He grabbed me and put me in a bottle. I felt very depressed and I often wanted to escape, but I never had a chance.

One day, the child took the bottle to the river to change the water, and I took the opportunity to slip away.

Now, my family and I are still living a happy and carefree life.

### Snow

— Tan Ai, Fourth Grade Student of Jiaotong Elementary School

The west wind is whistling,

The snowflakes are coming again;

Beautiful snowflakes are flying;

Flying, flying all over the ground;

Children are happy to see the snow,

Daring to use snow as a toy,

The sun shines on the snow,

Gradually melting into water;

Children can't get snow,

Tears flow in their eyes.

### The Value of Human Life

— Zhang Qinggong

Children, let me tell you an interesting thing, that is, a person is only worth 10 yuan in legal tender, isn't that an interesting thing? Children, you probably don't believe it: now let me tell you one by one:

British biologist Dr. Lawson once chemically analyzed the human body. According to him, "Taking an average person weighing 140 pounds as an example, the water in the whole body can fill a 10-gallon bucket, the fat in the whole body can make seven bars of soap, the carbon in the whole body can make more than 900 pencils, the phosphorus in the whole body can make 2,200 match heads, the lime in the whole body can whitewash a chicken coop, the magnesium in the whole body can make a dose of salt, the iron in the whole body can make a medium-sized nail, and the sulfur in the whole body can remove insects from a dog." Statistics of these materials, at that time only need five shillings, equivalent to 7.50 yuan at the current price.

According to another scientist's statistics, the materials contained in the human body are worth about 10 yuan in national currency. He said: The sugar in the whole body is about one teacup, the salt in the whole body is only enough for two bowls of soup for those who eat noodles to taste salty, the iron in the whole body can make a one-inch long nail, the lime in the whole body can only whitewash a house one zhang long and wide, the protein in the whole body is less than one hundred eggs, and the phosphorus in the whole body can make about 200 headed matches.

According to this, children's worth is only three or four yuan. Haha, that is really a strange tale!

From this, it can be seen that the material value of a person is very small. The reason why a person is great is still in their great personality and noble thoughts.

### Common Sense of Eating Sugar

— Xi Dan

The sugar we eat, in addition to using sugarcane, beets, and , is also made with malt sugar, called "malt sugar" or "yi." In fact, when all kinds of shells germinate, they must store starch and turn it into granulated sugar, so they can all make sugar, not only wheat is the limit.

According to physiologists, sugar has a great function for the body. When the body is tired or needs great strength, eating a little sugar can be very effective. Sugar is beneficial to the body, but it should not be regarded as a snack, and especially avoid it before meals.

The candies sold on the market often have excitability. Eating them often can damage the body, especially the teeth. Therefore, it is difficult to call them beneficial things, but it is not appropriate to eat them alone, but should be mixed in dishes or food.

Announcement of this publication: Last month's manuscript fee has been settled. Please submit your letter with a seal, and come to the accounting department of this museum to collect it from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day starting from the 17th (except Sundays).

Children, have you seen the movie "Snow White"? It was painted by the American painter Walt Disney. He also painted a book "Mickey Mouse Makes a Big Noise in the Circus". American children love to watch it. Now, the publishing department of Guotai Company, No. 8 Wenzhou Road in this city, has published it. Each book is 20 cents. Every child will be happy to see it. Please go to the newsstand to buy a copy.

### Scientific Game - Bottle Cannon

— San Di

This cannon allows children to gain the experience of setting off cannons at home, hearing a loud and amazing sound, seeing the cannonball fly out, as fast as lightning, and seeing the body recoil after the cannonball leaves the gun barrel.

The making of this friendly cannon is very simple. You only need a sturdy bottle (you can use a white glass bottle about three or four inches long), insert a match into the bottle stopper, and then plug it on the bottle (be careful not to plug it too tightly).

Now place the bottle horizontally in the sunlight, and use a magnifying glass to focus the sunlight on one focus point, so that the focus point burns one end of the match. At this time, because the match is burning, a large amount of heat is generated, and the air inside suddenly expands, pushing the bottle stopper outward. At this time, it is just like a cannonball, flying out of the barrel.

When , first place two pencils horizontally under the bottle, parallel to each other, and then place the bottle on the pencils as shown in the figure. Then, due to the reaction force, the bottle body rolls back on the pencils, just like a real cannon.

### Rabbit Year Made Rabbits

— Newborn

The Year of the Tiger has just passed, and the Year of the Rabbit is here! Children, aren't you very fond of these small, delicate, and fast-running little rabbits? I think you can definitely make some little rabbits on Sundays to prepare for display in the achievement exhibition held at school during the winter break! Below, I will tell you two methods for making rabbits, but you should remember that these are just two examples.

The first method uses felt. Its size can be enlarged proportionally. First, make the rabbit head according to (A), covering an oval cotton ball with felt, and tie the lower end with thread. Then, use scissors to trim the tied part. The rabbit whiskers are made by inserting brown silk into the cloth and cotton. The eyes are made of red buttons, painted with black pupils. The nose is made of a light red cloth wrapping a soybean. For the ears (B), first cut hard paper into ear shapes, then glue the felt with brown inside and white outside on both sides. The eyes, nose, ears, etc., are all sewn to the head at the places marked with X. (C) is the torso, made of felt and filled with cotton and sewn together. When cutting the cloth, keep the back connected, so you only need to sew three sides. It is best to use a heart shape for the cotton so that the rabbit shape appears. Then, cut the front and hind limbs in pairs according to (D) and (E), also filling them with cotton. Then, sew them with thread. If it is inconvenient to make them curved, you can change them to straight lines. (F) is the tail, also made of felt wrapped around cotton and sewn. After sewing each part, you can assemble them. First, sew the head to the upper end of the torso (neck). The tied part can be allowed to sink into the head. Then, sew the tail to the lower end of the torso. Use thick cotton thread or lead wire to connect the limbs by piercing the side of the torso. When sewing with thick cotton thread, the thread connecting the two limbs must be taut, otherwise the limbs will be loose and about to fall off. The two ends of the lead wire should protrude outside the limbs, and a small needle should be used to twist them into a circle to prevent the rabbit's limbs from falling off.

As for the color of the rabbit (i.e., felt), if white is easily soiled, you can change it to red, yellow, blue, gray, etc. In addition, making a small work uniform or small pants, such as H and I, for the little rabbit to wear will make it even more beautiful!

The second method uses eggshells. The head is made from a small chicken egg (with one end broken) shell, and scissors are used to trim the broken end. Then, cut two ears from drawing paper and glue them to the inside end of the shell. Then, cut two eyes from red paper and stick them in the center of the shell. Use black ink to draw the lips. The rabbit whiskers are made of cotton thread and fixed with glue. The torso is also made from a broken-ended fire duck egg (preferably a goose egg) shell, with the intact end facing up. Cut four limbs from hard paper and connect them by threading lead wire through the eggshell. Glue the tail to the lower end, so that it forms a tripod posture with the two hind limbs. It is not easy to knock over. The head and torso are connected with lead wire. To allow the head to rotate, use three strips of skin plaster to glue the lead wire and wrap it into a pen-like shape (like B). The lead wire must be long enough to reach the bottom of the egg, so that there will be no imbalance and the rotation will be flexible. Be very careful when making small holes in the eggshell! The eggshell can be dyed in various colors to represent clothes and pants. The complete shape after completion is like A.

Children, if you make a few such little rabbits in your spare time and give them to your younger siblings or friends, they will surely be very happy!

### Snow White (3)

— Celestial Grandson

When Snow White woke up from her dream the next day, the first thought that arose in her little heart was of the handsome young prince, hoping that she could see him again. What made her happiest was that she was ordered by the Queen to rest for a day today, and the huntsman would accompany her to play in the forest.

That morning, the huntsman indeed took her to the forest. They walked and walked, reaching the center of the forest. Snow White saw a small kingfisher with a wounded wing, unable to fly, struggling in the sky by itself. Instantly, her heart was filled with pity, and she hurriedly stopped and bent down to pick up the little kingfisher. Unexpectedly, at that moment, she glimpsed a terrifying black shadow covering her back. Startled, she hurriedly turned around and couldn't help but cry out in surprise. She saw the huntsman holding up a gleaming sharp knife, about to stab her. It was extremely dangerous. The huntsman caught sight of Snow White's pitiful appearance, his heart softened, and he suddenly repented. He fully revealed the Queen's evil plan to kill her. Then, he knelt down and pleaded, "Princess, please forgive me. Quickly escape to another forest to save your life, and never return to the palace again. Run! Run!"

Snow White thanked the huntsman for saving her life and used all her strength to run desperately into another forest. The owls and bats in the trees, seeing a stranger arrive, were secretly watching her from behind the leaves. She was frightened by the sparkling eyes, thinking they were demons and ghosts trying to trick her. The branches and thorns along the way also seemed to be stretching out prickly fingers, wanting to grab her. It truly frightened the delicate Snow White out of her wits.

Alas, she had never been here before, and she didn't know the way. She just stumbled and ran through the tangled trees, not knowing where to go. Eventually, she was exhausted and covered her eyes with her hand, falling to the ground. She couldn't walk anymore and simply lay there, sobbing incessantly, as if she wanted to break her heart into pieces.

Suddenly, she had a very strange feeling, feeling that someone—many people—were looking at her from all around. The feeling of terror was reduced a lot, and the air was relatively warmer. When she looked up, she saw a crowd surrounding her, but they were not people. They were many small birds and beasts in this forest, who had heard Snow White's heavenly voice and gathered to see this beautiful little guest who resembled a flower.

A white rabbit quietly tiptoed over, curiously sniffing the ribbon that held her hair. At this moment, Snow White happened to stop crying and swallowed her last sob, sitting up. The white rabbit, seeing her body move, was startled and ran away. Snow White turned her face and only saw its back, disappearing into a bush. When she looked around again, she saw those many adorable little animals still hopping and skipping, as if they were about to scatter.

She earnestly said, "Please don't run, don't run! If I have disturbed you by coming here, then I am very sorry and ask for your forgiveness. You don't yet know the terrible things I have experienced. Since we have met, can we be friends?"

Chronicle

### The Prophet's Prophecy

— Buddha

China has always had the most and the most accurate prophets. Our country has had prophets for a long time. Now, whether it is on Nanjing Road, with signs hanging high, or in large hotels, with a large room set aside, there are people who predict fortune, inquire about auspiciousness, and decide right and wrong, one after another. Even in the streets and alleys, on lonely corners, there is a table, a stool, an inkstone, a bowl, and a board, quietly waiting for the inquiries of those who doubt. Their business is quite good, which shows that our country's prophets have an unexpected effect.

Foreign prophets are even more "worldly". Foreign prophets predict national events or international situations, and their words are subtle and accurate, and the verification is obvious. Because foreign prophets mostly use scientific methods to observe the current situation and predict the future results, their predictions are more reliable. Since the undeclared war between China and Japan, prophets from various countries have predicted the outcome of this war, and there are many theories. Generally speaking, Japan's use of troops against China is like "swallowing a big bomb", "a snake swallowing an elephant", or "a clay ox entering the sea". Although each prophet has different observations, their conclusions are the same.

Although each prophet has the same conclusion, there is little clear statement as to when their words will be verified. Now the Sino-Japanese War has reached the beginning of the second stage, and our country's strength in resisting the war is increasing, and the spirit of resisting the war is becoming more and more excited. Japan has a dilemma, unable to stop, and the more it does, the worse it gets. The prophetic period of the major prophets is coming soon. As the saying goes, "One will not give up until one reaches the Yellow River". They have indeed reached the Yellow River, so give up.

### What Will You Do When You Become Unemployed?

— Zihua

In a discussion meeting, many employed and unemployed youths discussed the issue of employment, with various opinions and each expressing their own views. Later, the chairman raised an interesting question: "What will you do after you become unemployed? Assuming you are not yet so poor that you have nothing to eat!" Please answer in writing, with a time limit of fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes, the papers were collected, totaling more than fifty. Then, the chairman and the recorder spent ten minutes diligently grouping the identical answers together, resulting in eleven opinions:

(1) I will rely on my parents, siblings, or relatives for a living. One lady's answer was to rely on her husband.

(2) I will seek help from friends, asking them to help find a job or borrow some money to temporarily maintain my livelihood.

(3) I will register with the Youth Association's Employment Counseling Department or the China Vocational Guidance Society, or seek relief from charitable organizations.

(4) I will draft many self-introduction advertisements, submit them to the social service columns of various newspapers, and ask them to publish them to arrange more opportunities. I will also read the employment advertisement columns of various newspapers every day and choose the possible ones to try.

(5) I will be as frugal as possible and try to find a job based on my expertise. This is a way to increase income and reduce expenditure.

(6) I will maintain my health and quietly wait for an opportunity because there is always a way out.

(7) I will carefully choose my profession. I will absolutely refuse to participate in those lowly and despicable jobs, especially the jobs of the puppet organization, even if they have good income!

(8) I will go to the interior to develop and do some work to save the country.

(9) I will borrow some capital to do a small business.

(10) I will accept any job, as long as it is not against my conscience, and only seek to be self-sufficient.

(11) I will temporarily do any job, not afraid of hardship, and choose a better one among them to be my long-term profession.

After the chairman read them, he expressed his opinion. He said, "The answers in the first six items are less appropriate, while the answers in the last five items are much better, and only courageous people can do it! However, the number of people who answered with the last five opinions only accounts for a quarter, which is probably because Chinese youth have been too deeply harmed by the 'long gown system'! If we become unemployed, we can rely on our skills to do any job, as long as this job is not lowly and despicable. Even doing hard labor or being a servant is not a disgrace! However, modern Chinese youth, especially the majority of slightly educated youth, mostly suffer from a problem—they only want to exchange minor work for huge rewards, they are unwilling to take off their long gowns, and they only seek mental labor, not physical labor—in fact, aren't physical labor and mental labor both working? As long as your ability can cope, that's fine! American college students use their spare time to work as waiters in cafes and bars, shine shoes for others, and wash clothes, jobs that Chinese youth are unwilling to do, but they don't consider it a big deal. Society respects them very much and gives them as much compensation as possible. This spirit is admirable and worth emulating, but we must first break the concept of the 'long gown system' before we can implement it in the same way!"

### Anecdotes of Shanghai

Storytelling Magazine

"Storytelling" also had a magazine, edited by Wu E'e, titled "Storytelling Magazine", published by Dingding Translation and Publishing House in May of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), only nine years ago. It was a monthly magazine with 20,000 words per issue, 32-open format, and set in Old No. 5 font. Only the inaugural issue has been seen, and the content is quite substantial.

The content of the inaugural issue begins with "Example 1", "Preface", the editor's "Self-Preface", and illustrations. The first article is "Examination of the Origins and Development of Storytelling", which describes the historical development and evolution of storytelling since the Song Dynasty, with many aspects not known to outsiders. The second is "Organizational Structure of the Storytelling Industry", which describes the history of Guangyu Society, Runyu Society, Kuanyu Society, Changsu Society, and Tongyi Society. Guangyu Society is actually the most valuable in the history of storytelling. I have seen its "130th Anniversary Commemorative Album", which is very rich in content.

Next, there is "Immortal Honors of Famous Storytellers", which describes the "Four Vajras", "Four Pillars", and "Three Sacrifices" of the storytelling industry. There is "Biographies of Modern Masters", which introduces the short histories of Jiang Shengxiang and Zhao Xiaoxiang. The following is a publication of the "Jiaqi", "Jingbian", and "Lin Daiyu" openings from Ma Rufei's "Southern Lyrics Introduction", which are all transcriptions of published versions. After that, there are short essays on storytelling, including "Two Items of Taboo for Wang Zhoushi's Critique of Books" and "Industry Lessons in Storytelling", with Wang Wanchun's "Anti-Drug Opening" as a filler. The next is "Miscellaneous Talks on Storytelling Venues in Shanghai".

The last part is "Miscellaneous Reviews of Various Books". The reviewed books are "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin", and "An Unofficial History of the Scholars". However, the reviews are not of the original books, but of the famous commentators of these books in various dynasties. The ending is "Small Anecdotes of the Storytelling Industry". Looking at the entire book, it has a concise description of the history of storytelling, the organization of societies, the characters of storytelling, the storytelling venues, and even the business, which is a gateway book for those who study the history of storytelling. It is a pity that the second issue and beyond were not published.

(Note) I am very grateful to Mr. Zhu Xingu for his many instructions regarding the article "20th Century Dance Wrap" (see today's newspaper) and would like to express my thanks here.

### Dragon and Phoenix Candlesticks

— Yanhua

“Emperor's Candlesticks” Produced by MGM and Premiered at Cathay Theatre

Perhaps it is because of my personal fondness for Luise Rainer that I am particularly interested in her, especially her nervous, sensitive nature and demeanor, which fill me with high hopes. Therefore, in the plays she has starred in, from "The Great Ziegfeld", "The Good Earth", "The Great Waltz", to the recent "The Toy Wife", this versatile actress is truly admirable.

However, after watching "Dragon and Phoenix Candlesticks", her third collaboration with William Powell, I believe that it is impossible for an actor alone to support a play, especially in these places, the "star system" of "actor supremacy" can be shattered! We believe that the success of a play mainly lies in the correctness of the theme of the script, and then the screenwriter, director, actors, plus sensitive and excellent technology. If an actor is asked to stand alone to support the entire play, this excessive expectation and deformed development will eventually fall into an unexpected abyss.

We certainly believe that Luise Rainer can act, but will the impression she gives us in "Dragon and Phoenix Candlesticks" be as outstanding and refined as in "The Toy Wife" or "The Great Waltz"? I think this shortcoming should be attributed to the following three points:

(1) In this script, Luise Rainer did not fully display her talent. Throughout the entire play, she could not show her delicate and moving acting skills in many climaxes like in "The Toy Wife" or "The Great Waltz". On the contrary, most of the scenes where we see Luise Rainer appear are transitional scenes. For example: (1) Prince John asks her to take the candlesticks to St. Petersburg; (2) she and William Powell simultaneously track down the two pairs of candlesticks, traveling all over Paris and London; (3) in the auction, she competes with William to buy the candlesticks; (4) she and William are arrested at the same time. In these four important scenes, all Luise Rainer can do is transitional scenes, rushing around, frightened, and panicked, but these emotions cannot be more deeply and strongly conveyed to the audience. Therefore, after each scene passes, it cannot leave a deeper impression on the audience.

(2) Why can't this play allow Luise Rainer to fully act? To answer this question, we can see that the script of the entire play is too straightforward. Although the atmosphere is quite tense as the play progresses, the atmosphere of the entire play has reached saturation at this time, and it is impossible to create a more tense and powerful climax. Therefore, except for the relatively compact transitional scenes, the play falls into straightforward scenes when important key points need to be developed to a higher degree.

At the same time, we also see that the center of gravity of the actors in this script is not on Luise Rainer. William Powell has more scenes, but he, like her, cannot fully act.

(3) Finally, we cannot but blame the mediocre director George Fitzmaurice. His handling of the entire film cannot be deeply blamed for his complete failure, but in several major scenes (as mentioned above), he failed to use more provocative techniques to develop the play to its climax. For example, the rush to buy the candlesticks and the final burning of that secret letter all seemed flat and weak. The director must bear this responsibility in these places.

In my personal opinion, for this kind of play, the playwright could more strongly write the "intellectual struggle" between the male and female protagonists more strongly. Judging from the current situation, the playwright may have been too concerned that the fierce struggle in the front would damage the ending where the two reconciled, but this concern is unnecessary.

Even in terms of meaning, the playwright does not emphasize the entire movement of the Polish revolutionary party, but instead writes about the branch of another messenger, and its evaluation is certainly very low.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Guide Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality

Let's say this Miss Jin, whose name is Danyun, what is her profession now? She is an employee of the Guidance Society. This title, heard by people more than ten years ago, would have caused surprise, thinking how such a noble lady could be a guide? In fact, the Guidance Society at that time cannot be compared to the Guidance Society more than ten years ago. Originally, the two words "Guidance" are not bad words, and the profession of guidance is also very noble. Because China's society in the past was not evolved, the environment was harsh, and public morals were not strong, especially in places like Shanghai where the good and the bad are mixed together, even good nouns were defiled. The Guidance Society where Miss Jin is employed now has a significant background. It is affiliated with the China National Diplomacy Committee and is an organization for democratic countries to interact with foreign countries. Anyone who serves in this Guidance Society must be proficient in at least two foreign languages. Like Miss Jin Danyun, she understands English and French, which is considered the most common. Because English accounts for the two major countries of the United Kingdom and the United States and is popular all over the world, and it has the closest diplomatic relations with China, so there are many who study English in the major cities along the coast of China. There are relatively few who study French, but it has gradually increased since the war. In addition, many who grew up in the north study Russian, followed by German, Italian, etc. In short, in this Guidance Society, there are people who speak any language. Why? This Guidance Society is specially set up to entertain foreign guests. Speaking of foreign guests, there are people from all countries, and each country has its own language. It is necessary to prepare to be proficient in the languages of various countries in order to entertain them. Because at this time, although there are people who strongly advocate a world language, it has not yet become popular. In addition to language, there must also be some common sense, such as geography, history, agriculture, and industry, which must also be known a little. Because China is a newly emerging country, many foreigners come to visit. Some can be led to visit, and some cannot be led to visit temporarily, but it is up to the guide to consider. If they can be led to visit, and they want to visit a factory, a detailed explanation must be given, and the technicians in the factory will accompany them to point out everything. If the technician is not there, the rough technical matters in industry, which fall within the scope of common sense, must also be answered fluently if foreign guests happen to ask about them. Therefore, the people who work as guides must also have broad knowledge. (13)

### Old Records of Movie Stars (Part 1)

— Hua

Since ancient times, great men have emphasized "not changing their name when traveling and not changing their surname when sitting", which is considered a kind of heroic spirit. However, female stars who are now famous on the screen mostly like to "hide their names and surnames" and take on another stage name, just like the pen names of writers. It's almost like "changing their surname when traveling and changing their name when sitting". Here, I will list a few of them that the reporter knows:

Lu Ming - Xu Maoyi Lu Ming is the younger sister of Xu QinFang. Since the sisters are named Xu, the younger sister must also be named Xu. She was born in Changzhou. People in Changzhou often like to use the word "Guan" when naming girls. Xu QinFang's childhood name was "He Guan", and Lu Ming's childhood name was "Wei Guan". Judging from the literal meaning, Xu QinFang was probably born in the lotus season, and Lu Ming was born when "roses are blooming everywhere in April". Lu Ming attended the Zhirenyong Girls' School and Qingxin Girls' School in Shanghai. Her academic name is "Maoyi". After entering the film industry, she adopted the stage name "Lu Ming". She became famous in one fell swoop in "Elastic Daughter", and has now become one of the most popular stars in the film circle.

Yuan Meiyun - Hou Guifeng Yuan Meiyun's original surname was Hou, and her name was Guifeng. When she was young, she worshiped Yuan Shude as her adoptive father and learned opera from him. She then changed her surname to her adoptive father's surname and took the name Yuan Meiyun, appearing on stage as a child actress. At the same time, she had a fellow student, Yuan Hanyun, who sang Laosheng (old male roles) and was born to Chen Shanfu (a female actress). At that time, everyone always mentioned Yuan Meiyun and Yuan Hanyun together. Later, Meiyun joined Mingxing Film Company. Her debut work was "Little Actress". Now, she is one of the basic female actresses of Xinhua Film Company.

Fan Xuepeng - Yao Xiongfei Fan Xuepeng is from Yixing. She has a younger brother named Yao Shiquan, who is a photographer. Many people find it strange why the younger brother is surnamed Yao, but the older sister is surnamed Fan. In fact, Fan Xuepeng's original name was "Yao Xiongfei". Fan is the surname of her former "husband" Fan Baizhu. Fan Baizhu is from Changzhou and ran the "Wujin News" newspaper in Changzhou, which stopped publication after the war. Fan Xuepeng's entry into the film industry was introduced by Xu QinFang. She was very popular in the era of filming martial arts films at Youlian Film Company. She retired for many years in the middle. Not long ago, she starred in a "Treasure in the Palm", which was directed by her current husband Wen Yimin. Now, Fan Xuepeng has become a drama practitioner and is the mainstay of the Lvshi Theater. Not long ago, she suffered from severe lung disease and once stopped performing to recuperate. Since New Year's Day, due to the Lvshi Theater's firm invitation and the pressure of life, and at the same time, her health has gradually improved, so she has resumed her work.

### Candid Records of the Silver Screen

— Qiu Wen

In Hollywood, there is a very common taboo: on the first day of shooting a new film, one must never start filming from the beginning of the script. Instead, one must first shoot the final scene at the end of the script. After this scene is completed, any scene can be shot at will. Every Hollywood director believes in this superstition. They believe that if this rule is violated, the new film will definitely suffer a disastrous box office failure, or even that the production staff in the film may die prematurely before the filming is completed. This mystery is truly unpredictable. It is said that no one in Hollywood has dared to boldly resist it.

When you go to America, you will often hear people call Hollywood Cosmo politan City. (Translated as City of Many Colors) Some people may find it baffling. In fact, it can be understood from the name itself. Because Hollywood includes nationals from every country. It encompasses the five colors of the world's races. If you don't believe me, listen to me!

Ask the average movie fan, who are your ideal big stars? He will rattle off a string of names: Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Anna Sten, Claudette Colbert, and so on. Alright, let's take a look! Clark Gable is British. Charlie Chaplin is Jewish. Greta Garbo is Swedish. Anna Sten is Russian. Claudette Colbert is French. None of them are American.

In addition, there are the famous Chevalier and the new star Simone Simon, who is French. Jack La Rue is Italian. There is Uemura Musume from Japan (this publication once reported that the Japanese actress's relationship with Japan's invasion of China had aroused public anger and she was ostracized). There is Mara, the African girl who made a big splash in "Bird of Paradise." And naturally, our Chinese representative is Anna May Wong.

As for directors, cinematographers, and other consultants, Cecil B. DeMille, who is famous in the film industry, is from [blank]. Ernst Lubitsch and Josef von Sternberg are German. Among them, there is also a cinematographer whom we Chinese call Huang Hao. There is also a literary figure, Lin Yutang, serving as their senior advisor.

Recently, over a hundred movie fans in New York wrote a letter to the Hollywood film guild, requesting that the male and female stars of MGM, Fox, Paramount, United Artists, Universal, and other companies in Hollywood co-star in a life film. It is believed that this would not only guarantee a considerable box office, but also require relatively little capital. It is said that MGM executive Figher Hinson has expressed his support for this idea, and perhaps filming will begin soon. Let's wait and see!

### Silver Screen Snippets

— Yan

Meng Jiangnu Endures Hardship: The Star Film Company filmed the wedding scene of "Meng Jiangnu" the night before. Many cavalrymen charged into the wedding hall to arrest Wan Xiliang. At that time, due to the intense lights, the horses became frightened and trampled over most of the sets and props. Ms. Zhou [blank], who played Meng Jiangnu, could not escape in time and fell to the ground, suffering a rather serious back injury. However, the cinematographer has fully captured this realistic scene and plans to add it to the trailers to allow the audience to glimpse the arduousness of the film's production.

Gong and Sun Return Home: Performers Jia Nong, Sun Min, and Er arrived in Shanghai and immediately visited Zhang Shichuan and Zhou Jianyun to express their sincerity and willingness to serve their hometown. They are in high spirits, and although they have been on the move for eighteen months, they look even younger than before. Recently, they have been constantly visiting the film set to talk to their colleagues, such as Zhuge Liang, about their travel experiences, and have given them many scenic photographs and trinkets they brought back.

### Social News

### Xia Peizhen Is About to Return to Shanghai

— ·Yu Gong·

After the reorganization of the Kui De Troupe's Kunqu opera group, they invited film star Xia Peizhen from Shanghai to join them. She performed new plays such as "La Traviata," "Thunderstorm," "A Fate in Tears and Laughter," "Orchid in the Empty Valley," and "The Blood-Stained Tablet" at the Beiyang Theater in Tianjin. The people of Tianjin were shocked by Xia's reputation on the silver screen in those years and eagerly sought to catch a glimpse of her beauty, so the box office was quite strong. However, even though the Kui De Troupe has been reorganized, internal opinions are still divided. The fact that Li Guiyun and Xia Peizhen are avoiding each other is clear evidence of this. Xia did not sign a long-term contract for this trip north. Recently, the troupe also invited Qiu Huifang from Beijing. She can perform Peking opera Kunqu opera, and her stage presence is delicate and graceful, surpassing Xia Peizhen. Recently, friends visited Xia at her residence. According to her, due to the vast difference in climate between the north and south, and with the harsh winter, she is not accustomed to the water and soil, and prolonged stay may be detrimental to her health. She plans to leave the troupe after performing until the 15th of this month; after staying for a few days, she will buy a boat ticket and return to Shanghai. The new star Qiu Huifang will have to wait until Xia leaves before performing on stage. At that time, with Xia leaving and [blank] coming, it will be a new situation.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (7) (5)

— Xu Muyun

The Strange Actor Wang Fushou Always Receives Boos

Speaking of the name of the famous martial old Sheng actor Red-Eye Wang Si (insiders simply call him Red-Eye Si) in those years, most opera enthusiasts probably know his eccentric personality, which is similar to that of Wang Datou. However, Datou's odd [blank] personality is that he is usually untrustworthy, but when he is on stage performing, he still concentrates and sings and acts well, without slacking off a single word. As for Red-Eye Si's personality, it seems to be different from Wang's, because he often likes to act strangely when performing on stage, causing all kinds of jokes, and the audience often responds with boos. Therefore, people say that he has a natural temperament for being scolded. No matter what play he sings, he seems unhappy if he doesn't get a boo. Throughout history, there has probably never been anyone like Wang Si among artists. As for Red-Eye's ability, he can truly be called a good actor who can do both civil and martial [blank]. He often said proudly to people: Except for Cheng Da boss, who was from the previous generation, there is only one and a half opera singers in Beijing. One is himself, and half is Tan Xinpei. In his eyes, even Wang Guifen, Sun Juxian, Yu Juxheng, and Yang Yuelou, these good actors, were not worth looking up to; indeed, his skills are truly admirable. Lao Tan never liked to admire others, but he truly admired Red-Eye Si wholeheartedly. Moreover, he had to ask him for advice on many plays, which shows how broad his repertoire was and how refined his skills were. Once, the palace sent an order, and Empress Dowager Cixi personally selected Wang Datou's "Taking the Seal of Command," Wang Fushou to play the military advisor, and Li Xinpu to play the prince. These three were all good actors, so of course the performance was exceptionally [blank]; who knew that when Si Ye was holding the seal and walking towards the exit, the stagehand was busy with other things and forgot to take the seal. Wang Si Ye couldn't help but get angry, immediately threw the seal on the ground, and went backstage. At this time, the Empress Dowager saw this and was immediately furious, ordering him and the eunuch Wei, who was in charge of the Nanfu Palace, to be summoned before her and [blank] scolded them.

### A Critical Review of the Play "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" (Part 2)

— Ce Hai

Two. Research on the script

The old Peking opera version of "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" is adapted from the Kunqu opera "Wu Shi Hui." The Kunqu opera's chapter titles, from "Tiger Beating" to "Killing the Sister-in-law," have a thought-provoking plot that is consistent and well-knit. The close-knit structure, tight composition, and extensive use of refined techniques make it far superior in dramatic value to the Song Shi Hui and Shi Shi Hui. In terms of characters, the protagonists of Song Shi Hui are only Song Jiang and Yan Poxi, and the protagonists of Shi Shi Hui are only Shi Xiu and Pan Qiaoyun. In "Wu Shi Hui," in addition to Wu Song and Pan Jinlian, characters such as Wu Dalang, Ximen Qing, and Wang Po all have important performances. The playwright gives the actors ample opportunity to perform Wu Song's righteousness, Wu Da's [blank], Jinlian's licentiousness, and Ximen Qing's lust. In particular, the scenes "Teasing the Uncle," "Raising the Curtain," "Tailoring Clothes," and "Poisoning the Husband" are the most important. In today's new script, the "Raising the Curtain" and "Tailoring Clothes" scenes are performed hastily, and the "Poisoning the Husband" scene is omitted, which has reduced the dramatic effect. As for the added scenes such as "Zhang Da Hu's Wives and Concubines Being Jealous" and "Jinlian and Ximen Arguing," they do not have much significance besides expressing Jinlian's frustration. And in terms of dramatic principles, these trivia are all secondary to secondary. What is commendable is the scene "Wu Er Visits He Jiushu," which is truly a refined piece by Ouyang. Although it is also secondary to secondary, it does not make people feel bored. But in summary, the new script has too much of a "new drama flavor," and in any case, it is not as refined as the old script.

Three. Character Distribution

It is the actor's duty to develop their art; and the development of their duty depends on the plot as its outline. The reason why the old "Wu Shi Hui" script emphasizes scenes such as "Raising the Curtain" and "Tailoring Clothes" is simply to arrange opportunities for everyone to perform. The new script is criticized for not developing Jinlian's licentiousness and Ximen's lust enough. I once saw Wang Chuansong of the Xian [blank] Drama Society perform this, fully displaying the abilities of a lewd and debauched person. [blank] completely brought Ximen, a high-ranking official, to life. - Master Lu [blank]qing's performance was even better, but the impression has become blurred due to the long time since I saw it in my childhood. - The other day, I went to the East again to watch, and Chuansong's acting skills have become even more refined, but Chuanning's teasing of the uncle and Chuanfang's tailoring both have the feeling of an aging woman, with no substantial record. - I heard that Hua Chuan Cui's performance in tailoring is the most wonderful, but I have not seen it. - What is especially wonderful is Yao Chuanmei's Wu Dalang, who uses a seven-foot body, bends his legs, and shrinks into the posture of a "three-inch ding," with punching, kicking, showing the soles of his boots [shoes], running around the stage, and other body movements, jumping up and down on the chair, as nimble as a monkey. The above two roles are not available in the Peking opera troupe. Huang Jin and Liu Bin [blank] are good at performing the capture, also using Chuansong as a model, but they do not perform tailoring. Hou Yushan in Han Shichang's troupe is good at performing the judging of the marriage, but I have not heard of him playing Wu Da. Perhaps only Ye Shengzhang, the famous martial clown in this troupe, has this skill? As for the role of Wu Song, Li Wanchun is only good at the second half of the Wu [blank]. Zhao Ruquan is too frivolous. Zhao Songqiao is unsuitable. Zhou Xinfang is a relatively suitable talent, but what Xinfang is most skilled at is [blank] Yong, being playful, decadent, and sad, but heroic is not his specialty; but if you want to get someone who is even better than Xinfang, there is no one, which shows how difficult it is to find talent in the drama world. As for Tian Jinlian, the Four Famous Dan actresses do not perform it. Among the Shanghai Dan actresses, Wang Xichun is not [blank] dissipated, Bai Yushuang lacks refinement, Mao Jianqiu is a Qingyi character, and Jin Suqin has already been poisoned by progress. In my humble opinion, Zhou Meiyan, the Kun Dan actress who is currently cramped in a small theater, is capable of this position. The supporting roles were too bad when it was performed at Chang Le last time, so it was not worth watching. Now, based on speculation, I propose an ideal character distribution as follows:

Wu Song (Zhou Xinfang) Pan Jinlian (Zhou Meiyan) Wu Dalang (Yao Chuanmei) Ximen Qing (Wang Chuansong Front) Ximen Qing (Zhang Yipeng Back) Wang Po (Furong Cao) Yun Ge (Liu Bin [blank]) He Jiushu (Zhao Songqiao) I predict that Zhao Songqiao's He Jiushu will definitely achieve results above the old brand Bu Wenzheng.

### Skating Techniques

— Compiled by Chang Lianqi and [blank] Qizhen

Ice Skate Exercise Practice: When skating, it is often necessary to use the ankles and buttocks, so it is advisable to practice these two parts often. There are four practice methods:

One. Put on the ice skates, stand with both feet together, and gradually bend the ankles outward until the outside of the sole touches the ground, then return to the original position.

Two. Raise one foot and practice the second foot as before, that is, first bend outwards and then inwards. If you cannot stand steady, you can lean on the back of a chair until you can do it without leaning.

Three. Point both feet outwards, so that both toes form a straight line, do not bend the knees, keep the heels more than two feet apart, keep the back straight, and keep the head up.

Three. Stand steadily with one foot, raise one foot, and the knee should be level with the hips, then straighten the leg forward, so that the toes and hips form a straight line, gradually move the leg back, and do not bend the knee or get close to the ground when moving back, and the further back the better.

Four. Stand steadily with one foot, raise one foot, stretch the leg so that the toes are level with the hips, and gradually squat down, so that the raised foot is close to the ground. (Do not wear ice skates for the second, third, and fourth exercises).

When practicing figures, you don't have to go to the ice rink. Everyone can practice the same way. You can also practice without wearing ice skates, but it is best to stand in front of a full-length mirror so that you can see the posture of your body. Once you have practiced thoroughly, going to the ice rink will naturally lead to rapid progress. When practicing, it is advisable to develop both sides equally, and not focus on one foot. First practice the posture, and then practice the figures. To learn four sides and four turns, you can also practice at home without wearing shoes, just holding a book in your hand.

Roller Skate Exercise Practice

When learning to roller skate for the first time, it is best not to rely on others. If you can go to the center of the rink alone and practice diligently, you will soon learn. If you are timid and hold on to the railings or walls, your progress will be slow. When entering the rink for the first time, you must first seek to stand independently, fix your center of gravity, and then start with stepping. Like ordinary walking, lift one foot, move it forward, and land it, but do not take large steps. You must always keep both feet under your body, so that it is not easy to lose your center of gravity. If you practice like this for at most one or two sentences, you will be able to move on the ground, and you will not have to raise your feet high. From then on, you can practice in order according to the following methods. When moving at first, both feet are on the ground at the same time. The center of gravity of the body is first on both feet, and then gradually move the center of gravity to one foot. After the two feet take turns pushing, you can lift the pushing foot and let one foot walk alone. When practicing forward movement, the body should lean forward, because if you fall forward, you can support yourself with your hands.
