### Chinese Army Once Charged into Shilong City

(Chongqing) According to military news from Guangdong Province, after the Chinese army in eastern Guangdong recovered Zengcheng, it advanced in two directions: one attacking Shitan, and the other attacking Shilong on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Japanese army, due to its weak forces, was unable to hold its ground and retreated towards Guangzhou. It is widely expected that the Chinese army will soon recover both locations. The unit of the Chinese army under Zhang Ruigui once charged into Shilong on the evening of the 8th of this month, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army and killing many Japanese soldiers. However, after Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. (Express News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)

According to reports, the Japanese army near Hekou attempted to cross the Xijiang River in a surprise attack but was repelled by the Chinese army. Subsequently, 30 Japanese aircraft came out to wreak havoc, bombing Chinese army positions and causing heavy losses. (Dispatch of the 10th from Huitong News Agency)

Another guerrilla unit attacked the Japanese army in Xiaoao. The Japanese army was gathering at the time, and the Chinese army took advantage of their unpreparedness, hiding in the mountain hollows and opening fire with machine guns and throwing hand grenades. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. Just as they were about to descend the mountain to annihilate the enemy, more than 300 Japanese reinforcements suddenly arrived from Henggang and shelled the Chinese army. The Chinese army, realizing that its objective of a surprise attack had been achieved, quickly transferred.

### No Changes in the Battle Situation on the Border Between Hunan and Hubei

Pingjiang: The battle situation in the Hunan-Hubei border area is calm and unchanged. The Japanese army, fearing attacks from the Chinese guerrilla forces, has been patrolling the circular road from Wulipai in Yueyang to Taolin with several tanks every day in order to create a false impression. Currently, the Yamazaki, Ota, and Nakamura units, totaling more than a thousand soldiers, are stationed in Taolin and its southwest Tuoba Wujiang area.

Changsha: The battle situation in northern Hunan remains largely unchanged. The Chinese army is still facing off against the Japanese army along a line starting from the shore of Dongting Lake in the west, passing through the north bank of the Xinqiang River, and extending to the Jiuling Mountains. According to news received here from foreign sources in Hankou, one division of the 3rd Division of the Japanese army, which was originally stationed in Wuhan, began to move south on the 7th of this month, apparently to reinforce the Yueyang area. According to general observation, the Japanese army may soon use all its strength to invade south along the Yuehan Railway from Yueyang. On the Xiang-E Highway, due to the overlapping peaks and ridges of the Jiuling Mountains and the dangerous terrain, they will take a feint attack to contain the Chinese army's forces. A large amount of the track on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway was destroyed when the Chinese army withdrew to the south. The two bridges in Puqi and Nanjingang were even thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese army, which is a huge project and difficult to repair in the short term. Therefore, there has been no direct traffic between Wuchang and Yueyang. At present, Chinese guerrilla forces are still active behind the Japanese army, preventing the Japanese army from rushing to invade south. A certain mobile unit of the Chinese army once charged into Linxiang Station on the evening of the 8th of this month, fighting fiercely with the Japanese army until dawn the next day before withdrawing. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered at least 300 casualties, while the Chinese army only lost one company commander and 37 soldiers. (Express News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)

### Japanese Rumor: Wang Jingwei Leaves Hanoi, Fears Assassination and Escapes in Disguise; Accompanied by a Servant, His Whereabouts Are Unknown

(Tokyo) According to Japanese reports, Wang Jingwei lived near Hanoi and suddenly disappeared last night. It is said that Wang was afraid of being assassinated and disguised himself as a small merchant, escaping together with two confidante servants in disguise. His whereabouts are unknown. (Dispatch of the 10th from Huitong News Agency)

(Tokyo) Today, the newspapers here criticized Wang Jingwei's open letter to Chongqing, agreeing to pay attention to the opportunity for a ceasefire mentioned in the letter, because the aid from Britain, the United States, and France is now gradually being realized, but it can only benefit China's negotiations and is not enough to affect the results of the war, so that we can achieve the final victory by military means. The newspapers all advocated adopting a wait-and-see policy. The National News said that what kind of real influence Wang Jingwei's letter has, it will only be seen after two months. As for the peace conditions proposed by Wang, Japan cannot accept them as the basis for negotiations. With regard to respecting China's sovereignty and territory, and concluding a public economic cooperation agreement to prevent communism, an agreement can be reached, but it is absolutely impossible for the entire Japanese army to withdraw from China quickly. Japanese soldiers in China are unwilling to leave the mainland until true peace and order have been established. (Dispatch of the 10th from Reuters)

Editorial

### Chamberlain's Policy of Appeasement

British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax set off together yesterday, leaving England and passing through Paris, the French capital, for a short stay to talk with French Prime Minister Daladier, and then went quickly to Rome, the Italian capital, to have a good meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This trip is Chamberlain's planned follow-up after twice flying to Germany last year to personally negotiate with German leader Hitler and conclude the Munich Agreement. His greatest wish is to mediate between the four countries of England, France, Germany, and Italy to appease the overall situation in Europe; he will do his best to travel and toil for all the problems that hinder appeasement, seeking ways to overcome difficulties and resolve disputes; the old man's great undertaking is commendable.

When you have exhausted the mountains and rivers and suspect there is no road, the shade of willows and the brilliance of flowers reveal another village; what a joyful realm this is, we sincerely wish Chamberlain success in entering this ideal state. However, judging from the current situation, the overall situation in Europe is becoming more and more chaotic like trying to sort silk; one may suspect that there is no way to appease it. When Chamberlain scheduled his visit to Italy, Czechoslovakia had just ascended the altar of peace and made a sacred sacrifice, the flames of war were extinguished, and the situation suddenly eased; Chamberlain believed that the shock had just subsided, and after catching his breath for a while, all that was needed was to seize the opportunity to mediate the contradictions. With the great disaster over, dawn could be expected. However, in the past two or three months, although Britain feigned deafness to the Spanish affair, acknowledging the validity of the Anglo-Italian Agreement to show favor to Italy; although France dispelled old hatred with Germany, issuing a joint Franco-German declaration to show trust in Germany; the problems of Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine that followed Czechoslovakia's sacrifice became increasingly acute; Germany has always expressed its unwillingness to give up the issue of colonies; and Italy has openly coveted French territories in Africa; France has resolutely stated that it will never cede an inch of territory, and declined Chamberlain's mediation of the Franco-Italian territorial issue. In addition, new disputes and old cases are too numerous to mention, and what corresponds to the various international disputes that arise is that each country exhausts its resources to create an unprecedentedly large military budget. Swords are drawn and bows are strung, ready to be fired, it seems that either there will be a great sacrifice, or there will be a tragic war; the situation when Chamberlain scheduled his visit to Italy was not as obviously becoming more difficult as it is today.

International visits do not allow one to go back on one's word; since the plan was made two months ago, Chamberlain must go. We have no way of knowing the mood of Chamberlain on his journey; is he aware of the exhausted mountains and rivers and just trying his best? Or is he relaxed amidst the shade of willows and the brilliance of flowers, and holding the pearl of wisdom? Will he make them aware of the advantages and disadvantages of international competition to expand armaments, showing them the determination of Britain and France not to make any more concessions, hoping that the other party will change their minds and abandon their intention of seizing and plundering? Or does he have another sacred sacrifice like Czechoslovakia in his luggage, to temporarily satisfy Italy's so-called reasonable and legitimate desires? All of these things cannot be known.

World peace is indivisible, and Chamberlain's European appeasement policy is also indivisible; therefore, Chamberlain's policy will only be effective and have supreme value on the day when the entire situation is clearly understood; otherwise, it may be harmonious in Berlin and Paris but frustrated in Rome, or harmonious in Paris and Rome but stumbling in Berlin, or England, France, Germany, and Italy may each get what they want, but clash with other countries, then any spark can still start a prairie fire, and ultimately lead to complete failure. Because of this, the success or failure of Chamberlain's trip will have a serious impact on the entire world, and it is inevitable that all parts of the world will pray that this gentleman's trip will be unexpectedly successful. If unfortunately it does not meet the expectations of the world, then not only will this trip be in vain, not only will Chamberlain's policy fail, but it can also prove that there is no hope for appeasing the European situation through the four-country route. What follows the hopelessness of the four-country appeasement route will be a fundamental change in the European appeasement policy; that is, no longer applying the diplomacy of seeking complete security through compromise and living in a state of temporary peace, but waiting for facts to prove whether today's arrogance is a bluff, or whether today's drawn swords and strung bows are indeed the eve of a reversal of human civilization and a fight to the death? We deeply hope that Chamberlain's trip will not be in vain, and we fundamentally doubt that compromise is not enough to seek complete security, that the four countries are not enough to appease the European situation, and that merely appeasing the European situation is not enough to protect human civilization; the scope of appeasement must be expanded into a large circle, at least outside the four countries of England, France, Germany, and Italy, uniting with the United States in the west, uniting with Soviet Russia in the north, and paying attention to China in the east, and then there can be hope for long-term peace and stability!

### Britain and the United States Decide to Take Further Action to Provide Economic Aid to China; Maintaining the Chinese Currency Will Benefit Commerce in China; American Congressman Advocates Cutting Off Trade Relations with Japan

(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent learns that London cabinet members have been discussing the Japanese attitude toward closing the door to China for a long time, and the British and American governments have exchanged views in considerable detail. According to observers, the United Kingdom and the United States have each reached the same decision based on the same facts, so some similar actions can be expected to be taken. Although the claim of helping the Chinese currency has not been confirmed, it is undeniable that maintaining the Chinese currency does benefit foreign businessmen in China. Therefore, people here are deeply dissatisfied with the actions of the government under the wings of the Japanese to issue counterfeit money and disrupt the national currency.

### Diplomatic and Domestic Difficulties Are Numerous; Japan Is Beset with Crises; The Economy Is Exhausted and the People Are Resentful; It Is Feared That Hiranuma Will Also Be Powerless

Moscow According to Soviet public opinion, the main reason for the cabinet shake-up in Japan this time is the failure of the Konoe Cabinet's policy toward China. The prolongation of the war in China has led Japan to be isolated internationally and to have a disconnected economy domestically. In particular, the finances are on the verge of collapse, and anti-war sentiment in Japan has been growing. Serious divisions have also occurred within its ruling class. The main factor causing this situation is the continued mobilization of military spending. The formal expenditure of Japan's national budget for 1939-40 is 3.69 billion yen, while the special expenses for the war against China requested by the army and navy amount to 6 billion, which is an even larger amount. Where will this huge expenditure come from? This has now become a very serious problem. Tax revenue cannot meet the needs of the warlords. In recent years, Japanese consumption has plummeted, and most industrial sectors have greatly reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, so all national tax revenues cannot be collected as expected. Issuing national debt is also becoming increasingly difficult, because large financial capitalists are unwilling to sacrifice profits. At the same time, the industrial and commercial sectors have suffered huge losses due to being controlled by the government in accordance with the National General Mobilization Law, and they are also resentful. Thus, on the one hand, they are forced by the demands of the warlords, and on the other hand, they are opposed by the financial groups. Konoe had no choice but to leave. The current Hiranuma cabinet will naturally continue the war against China, expand general aggression in East Asia and the Pacific, further fascistize the country, and at the same time tighten the suppression of the domestic anti-war movement. However, all the unsolvable problems that caused the collapse of the Konoe cabinet still exist. Hiranuma is not a superhuman, so he is powerless to deal with them. (Dispatch of the 9th from TASS)

According to Asahi Shimbun, the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet was prompted by these two issues. (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th)

In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], the department will intensify the organization of each county and train local cadres in order to promote the program throughout the 83 counties of the province. This is expected to take some time. Some county women have enthusiastically participated in wartime work. According to Ms. Xiong Zhi, the person in charge, women's work is inherently the most difficult task, but we must overcome all kinds of difficulties and broadly mobilize the women of Jiangxi to enthusiastically participate in the war of resistance. We also hope that women across the country will mobilize together. Ms. Xiong stated that over 20,000 women in Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, have formed women's teams and have shown great performance in raising funds, providing aid, comforting the families of soldiers going to war, promoting the livelihood work of rural women, and improving sanitation.

### Xu Shiying Flies to Chongqing in Response to Summons

(Hong Kong) Xu Shiying, in response to a summons, flew to Chongqing on an Eurasia Aviation plane at dawn on the 10th. (Special Dispatch, Hong Kong, 10:00 PM)

(Chongqing) Xu Shiying, the acting chairman of the Relief Commission, arrived in Chongqing by plane at 1:00 PM today. He landed at the airport immediately after the air raid alert was lifted. Despite the long flight, Mr. Xu was still in excellent spirits. After a short rest, he went to visit President Kong and attended a meeting of the Executive Yuan. After the meeting, he went to the Relief Commission to give instructions on important matters. He told a Central News Agency reporter that he had previously been sent to Guangdong to inspect the relief situation in the Guangdong area. After completing his official duties in the city, he went to Hong Kong. At that time, the war in South China broke out, and he was ordered to stay temporarily to take charge of refugee relief. He went to Macau, Zhongshan, Shenzhen, Shatoujiao, and other places to personally offer condolences and inspections, announced the Central government's kindness, and urged progress. Overseas Chinese in various places were extremely enthusiastic in their support, and the Hong Kong government and international figures showed sympathy and cooperation, which is greatly appreciated. Now that the deployment is roughly set, he is flying to Chongqing to report to Chairman Lin and the central authorities and to request instructions. He stated that our highest leader's speech refuting Konoe's statement deeply inspired Chinese and foreigners in Hong Kong, and he deeply believes that our country will continue to persevere and fight to achieve the goal of resisting aggression.

### The Soviet Union Rushes to Build Highways to Xinjiang's Huiyuan

(Moscow) The ancient "Silk Road" was the necessary route for trade between India, Persia, and China. At that time, camel caravans traveled from Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara (all in Uzbekistan, Soviet Union) to Kulja (now Huiyuan in Xinjiang Province). It was abandoned after the Soviet revolution in 1917. Now, to facilitate transportation, it has been decided to repair it. Construction of the highway within the Soviet Union began in early 1937. The section from Almaty (formerly Verny) to Bissega has been completed and will be extended to Malvono village (75 kilometers from Almaty) within this year. (Havas, Tokyo, 10th)

He arrived in Rangoon on December 29th, taking 17 days and traveling a total of 2,100 miles. There were no serious delays or tire punctures along the way. This was the first private car to travel the new highway. Johnson told visiting reporters that the entire highway was surveyed and built by local workers, without using any road construction machinery. (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th)

### The Flames of Autocratic Nations Are Raging; British Prime Minister Sets Off for Rome; Reveals that France and Britain Will Hold Talks in Paris First; The Key to European Security Hinges on Italy's Attitude

(London) Many British cabinet members gathered at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street to send off Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. In the hour before the Prime Minister left his residence, calls came from many places to wish him success in his trip to Rome. Chamberlain, carrying his world-famous umbrella in his left hand, walked to the corridor. His wife came out to say goodbye. As the Prime Minister's car passed the government offices, the crowd cheered three times and shouted, "Good luck!" Several hundred people gathered at Victoria Station to watch the Prime Minister and others depart. Before departing, the Prime Minister did not make any statements. As the crowd waved their handkerchiefs to see him off, some unemployed people carried a black empty coffin to the station, with the words "Comfort the unemployed, but not Mussolini" written on the coffin. These protesters wanted to carry the coffin onto the platform, but they were stopped by the police. (Reuters, London, 10th)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain has left England for Rome to visit Mussolini. Chamberlain's policy of trying to ease the flames of the dictators and resolve the European crisis has now entered a critical stage. Chamberlain's decision to go to Italy is his fourth visit to a dictatorial country in the last three days. If Mussolini insists on continuing to interfere in the Spanish Civil War and implementing the Anglo-Italian Agreement, Chamberlain's policy towards the dictatorial countries will inevitably become stronger. Since the Munich Conference, Chamberlain has gradually lost his patience because the dictators have shown no reward for his policy of appeasement. Chamberlain has made it clear in public speeches that it is now time for dictators to contribute to peace. Observers are convinced that if Hitler and Mussolini still show no intention of peace, Chamberlain may be forced to abandon the policy of appeasement. Therefore, Chamberlain's meeting with Mussolini is the focus of the European diplomatic situation. (Associated Press, London, 10th)

(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax passed through here on their way to Rome. This afternoon, they will hold symbolic talks with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to show that both sides have a consistent attitude towards Italy. In other words, France will not make any concessions to the territorial demands that Italy may make. After the British cabinet members arrive in Rome, they can notify Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This is what the British cabinet members can "mediate," but they must not take a step further and come forward to mediate. As for the Spanish issue, France will still adhere to the resolutions passed by the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War. It will only recognize the Nationalists as a belligerent group after all foreign volunteers have been withdrawn. All of this is well known to London. Especially since Prime Minister Daladier's tour of Corsica and Tunisia has been warmly welcomed, it is necessary to reaffirm the good understanding between Britain and France before the authorities of Britain and Italy begin talks. These talks, in practical terms, are a contact between the axis of totalitarianism and the axis of democracy. If Italy provokes a war for the demands it has made, Germany will certainly assist it when necessary, and the understanding between Britain and France must be used to deal with it. (Havas, London, 10th)

(Paris) Responsible sources here recently announced that the British government has formally notified Italy that if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini involves the dispute between France and Italy during the talks between the British and American cabinet members in the coming days, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will refuse to act as mediators and will advise the Italian Prime Minister to directly launch an initiative towards France in order to restore normal relations. It is understood that after exchanging views through diplomatic channels, the governments of Britain and France have reached a complete consensus. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will reiterate this when they come to Paris for a Foreign Ministry tea party tomorrow. In short, the British government has fully endorsed France's views on Italy's various demands. The main points of this view are as follows:

(1) Foreign Minister Bonnet stated to the Chamber of Deputies on December 19th of last year that France would never cede an inch of land to Italy. Later, when Prime Minister Daladier toured North African territories, he gave a speech stating, "We cannot tolerate any destruction of France's territorial integrity, whether by direct or indirect means." (2) The French port of Djibouti in East Africa is a major base for France's shipping lanes to the Far East. Any demand involving the territorial sovereignty of the port will be refused consideration. (3) France is prepared to cooperate with Italy in the operation of the railway line from Djibouti to the capital of Abyssinia. France previously transferred 20 percent, or 2,500 shares, of the railway's stock to the Italian government to demonstrate a spirit of compromise. (4) Regarding the management of the Suez Canal, France holds as many as 800,000 shares of the canal's stock, giving it a dominant position on the canal's board of directors. (The canal's board of directors is currently composed of 19 French directors, 10 British directors, 2 Egyptian directors, and 1 Dutch director.) Furthermore, the concession for the canal will expire in 1968, at which time the Egyptian government will take it back and manage it independently. Italy's request to participate in the canal's management is actually related to Egypt's own interests. (5) Tunisia belongs to France, which was freely decided by the unanimous decision of the local residents. Prime Minister Daladier's tour of North Africa demonstrated that the local residents unanimously expressed their loyalty to France. (6) The Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935, although unilaterally declared invalid by Italy, is still considered valid by France. (7) According to this agreement, France and Italy should continue negotiations to agree on various annexes to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries. The former French chargé d'affaires in Italy, B longtai'er, began negotiations with the Italian authorities in early last year, but they were interrupted shortly thereafter. France is now prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy in accordance with this agreement. (Havas, London, 9th)

### The Anglo-Italian Talks in Rome Are of an Exploratory Nature; The Spanish Issue and Franco-Italian Disputes Will Be the Main Topics of Discussion Between the Two Countries' Authorities

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the gist of the Rome talks is more exploratory than negotiation. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's visit to Rome is without preconceived notions, a formal agenda, or any indication from the Italian side as to what Mussolini wants to discuss. It is generally speculated that the talks will involve the Spanish War and Franco-Italian relations. Regarding Franco-Italian relations, London and Paris now have a clear understanding that there will be no British mediation, as this is purely a matter for the French and Italian governments to resolve. Although the improvement of the atmosphere between France and Italy is welcomed by Britain, it is not something that Britain can interfere with. The French government has recently stated in a very clear manner that it does not want British mediation. It is heard that Britain and France have a complete understanding on this matter. As for the situation in Spain, the British and others will explain that Britain attaches great importance to the fulfillment of Italy's promise to respect Spain's integrity. The issue of granting belligerent rights to the Spanish combatants cannot arise until the plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee has been fully implemented. In addition to the above two matters, the refugee and economic issues may also be discussed, but the general trend will depend on what issues Mussolini wants to raise. It is hoped that the British and others will not bring back a fixed solution, as this is not the original intention of the British Prime Minister's trip, but to personally find out the trend of Italy's axis policy in the coming months. (Reuters, London, 10th)

(Rome) On the eve of the visit of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax to Italy, experienced observers here stated that when Prime Minister Mussolini holds talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain, he should raise various demands regarding African issues, both legally and economically. In terms of territory, he should only demand the annexation of French Somaliland in East Africa, including the port of Djibouti, without involving Tunisia or Corsica, so that the status quo of the Mediterranean territory guaranteed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement can be maintained. He should also cite the "spirit of the Munich Agreement" and emphasize that Italy's various demands are "fair and just" and must be met before the Mediterranean can restore a stable situation. In addition, he should urge Prime Minister Chamberlain to mediate between France and Italy, link Italy's various demands on France with the Spanish issue, and make the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Army as a belligerent group a condition for the withdrawal of Italian volunteers. As for other issues purely between Britain and Italy, such as the border demarcation between the British and Italian territories in East Africa and Anglo-Italian trade issues, they should also be raised for discussion at this opportunity. Some even predict that as a result of the talks, Britain and Italy may conclude a trade agreement. (Havas, London, 9th)

(London) Well-informed sources in political circles here recently stated that during the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members in the coming days, the issue of the Spanish Civil War being mediated by the signatory countries of the Munich Agreement, namely Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, may be raised for discussion. The cessation of the Spanish Civil War is one of the prerequisites for appeasing the European situation, and it is to be expected that the British and Italian authorities will take this as the theme of the talks. In addition, both sides of the Spanish Civil War want to occupy a strong position before the talks begin, as can be seen from the Nationalists' offensive on the Catalonia front and the government forces' offensive on the Extremadura front in the west. It is rumored that both sides of the Spanish Civil War will send informal observers to Rome to monitor the progress of the talks. The Nationalist government is said to be sending the Duke of Alba, its representative in Britain, while it is not yet known who the Republican government intends to send. Prime Minister Mussolini may express to Prime Minister Chamberlain his willingness to withdraw Italian volunteers in exchange for gains in other areas. If so, then the primary condition put forward by Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín regarding the mediation of the civil war by a third country, namely the complete withdrawal of foreign volunteers, can be met. Although the attitude of the Nationalist government is unknown, it can be asserted that if mediation is to become a reality, it must be jointly carried out by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. (Havas, London, 9th)

### Germany's Eastern Advance Meets Resistance: Germany Uses Colonies as Bait to Divert Poland's Attention

(Paris) Diplomatic circles originally thought that Germany intended to resolve the Central European issue first and was unwilling to immediately and practically support Italy's "wave of anger." However, because its efforts to expand its influence to Hungary, Romania, Poland, and even Czechoslovakia have encountered difficulties, its large-scale "Eastern Advance" movement has slowed down as a result, and there is a possibility of changing its attitude. Thus, the colonial issue has once again become a current issue. Italy's "skirmishes" against France have also become an issue of common interest for Germany and Italy. German leader Hitler, in his talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck yesterday, used the acquisition of compensation for the colonial issue as bait, hoping to divert Poland's attention from the Ukrainian issue. It is directly beneficial for Germany to raise the colonial issue to alleviate the resistance it encounters in Eastern Europe. Italy's demands can be used to test the extent of future resistance, so why not take advantage of it? Conversely, it is no coincidence that Mussolini urged the meeting between Hitler and Colonel Beck, as Mussolini probably intended to link the colonial issue with Italy's territorial desires in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Berlin) After Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently came to Berchtesgaden, Germany, and held talks with German leader Hitler, well-informed sources in political circles here have confirmed that the talks focused primarily on the Mediterranean issue. Hitler reportedly reassured Foreign Minister Beck regarding the Ukrainian issue, urging him not to worry and emphasizing that Germany and Poland have common interests on the colonial issue. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Warsaw) Official circles have recently issued a statement saying that after Foreign Minister Beck's recent talks with German leader Hitler, it is now known that external reports regarding Germany's intentions towards Eastern Europe are "exaggerated." The non-aggression pact signed between Germany and Poland in 1934 has not been weakened and has been confirmed by these talks. Observers here have commented that Hitler's guarantee to Foreign Minister Beck regarding the Ukrainian issue is evident in the official statement. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Southern Offensive: Government Forces Win Major Victory, Occupying 700 Li in Four Days; Rebels Reinforce from Morocco

Spain: Government forces on the Estremadura front in southern Spain have launched an offensive for five days. After adopting a strategic encirclement of the Benalúa mining area, the Nationalist forces have withdrawn from the south of the area and are resisting in the Montemolín area. Yesterday evening, government forces attacked Nationalist positions in the Doloso Mountains, inflicting heavy casualties. The fighting continued until 10 p.m. last night. Nationalist planes strafed government reinforcements arriving by train. In total, government forces have occupied 700 kilometers in the past four days since launching their offensive on this front. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Barcelona: According to Spanish government sources, the left wing of the government forces on the Estremadura front has occupied Azuaga, which is ten miles from the highway between Seville and Burgos, and is advancing towards Villalba de los Barros and Llerena. At the same time, the right wing has occupied Mount Rubialos and the road to Castuera. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Gibraltar: According to news received here, Spanish Nationalist forces and militias have hastily withdrawn from La Línea, Algeciras, and Tarifa to Seville in order to reinforce the Estremadura front. As for the Nationalist reinforcements being transferred from Morocco to the mainland, this has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Barcelona: It has been two weeks since the Nationalist forces launched their offensive on the Catalonia front. Their only significant achievement has been the occupation of Borjas Blancas and Alzas Secas, which control key transportation routes and are crucial to the government forces' northern defenses. From a military strategy point of view, this is very important. However, the Nationalist forces were supposed to occupy these places within the first week of the offensive, but they only captured them in the second week. As a result, the government forces were able to deploy calmly in the rear, and the strategic value of the fall of these places was reduced. Government officials also said that the victories achieved by the Nationalist forces in the past week were not decisive. Although they made progress on the front, the heavy losses in personnel and ammunition offset the gains. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### France Decides to Strengthen Naval Shipbuilding to Protect Mediterranean Trade and Maintain Advantage over Germany and Italy

(Paris) Naval Minister Campinchi recently gave a speech to a right-wing hardline newspaper, stating that France must step up the construction of warships in order to maintain its current advantage over Germany and Italy. France currently has a total tonnage of 500,000 tons, Italy has 450,000 tons, and Germany has 170,000 tons. In terms of tonnage under construction, France has 120,000 tons, Italy has 150,000 tons, and Germany has 250,000 tons. If France does not intensify its efforts, it will no longer have an advantage in the Mediterranean by 1944. The enemy could seize France's North African territories with a single move, and at that time, no matter how strong France's land and air forces were, they would be unable to stop it. We have learned a lesson from the Spanish Civil War and the Far East War, and we deeply understand that if we want to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Mediterranean and the security of French Indochina, we must maintain a strong navy. Therefore, the government has decided to start construction on two battleships, one cruiser, seven submarines, and various auxiliary ships (with a total tonnage of 24,000 tons) this year. In addition, coastal defenses have been strengthened and long prepared for any eventuality. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Czech-Hungarian Incident Resolved Peacefully: Neutral Zone Established on Border, Agreement to Exchange Prisoners

Prague: The autonomous government of Carpathian Ruthenia issued a public statement today stating that the representatives of the Czech and Hungarian governments have reached an agreement on the resolution of the Mukachevo incident as follows: (1) Starting at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, a neutral zone will be established where neither side's troops are allowed to be stationed in order to avoid conflict. (2) Prisoners will be exchanged. (3) The current border will be observed. The case is thus concluded. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Warsaw: Regarding the Mukachevo incident, it is reported that the Hungarian government has demanded compensation from the Czech government for damages. The Hungarian ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Weisztertin, returned to his country yesterday to report on his duties and will not return to his post until the case is satisfactorily resolved. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Polish Consulate in Czechoslovakia Pelted with Stones; Ukrainians Responsible; Poland Protests to Czechoslovakia

Warsaw: According to the Polish Official Gazette, recently, due to the border conflict in Czechoslovakia, a group of demonstrators from the Carpathian Ruthenian military organization "Sich" threw bricks and stones at the Polish Consulate in Sughiz, destroying most of the windows. Local gendarmes did not intervene, citing the reason that the consulate had long been abandoned and no injuries would occur. The Polish chargé d'affaires has now lodged a formal protest with the Czech authorities, demanding a satisfactory response from both the Czech central government and the Ukrainian autonomous government. It is reported that the Polish chargé d'affaires reiterated that a full response must be given in order to be considered satisfactory. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

Prague: Regarding the attack on the Polish Consulate in Sughiz, the Polish chargé d'affaires has lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. People in the Carpathian Ruthenian autonomous government have declared that the case was caused by "agitators" who hoped to create an incident, trigger a diplomatic dispute, and carry out their conspiracies.

### Romanian Iron Guard Plots to Assassinate King; Conspiracy Discovered

(Paris) "Le Figaro" has recently reprinted news released by the diplomatic correspondent of the "London Daily Telegraph," claiming that London has received news proving that King Carol II of Romania was assassinated three or four days ago. Although the details are unknown, the assassin seems to be a member of the fascist Iron Guard (which has long been ordered to be disbanded). King Carol II was originally scheduled to meet with Prince Paul, the first regent of Yugoslavia, in Outer Transylvania before the 24th, but was postponed until yesterday, for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Romanian Capital: Rumors that King Carol II was assassinated three or four days ago have been solemnly denied by officials here. After the fascist Iron Guard leader Codreanu was shot and killed by military police while trying to escape in late November last year, his followers received foreign aid and attempted to incite unrest. The police authorities have taken measures to prevent this and have arrested several people. (Combined dispatch, 10th)

### Britain Deals with Pakistan Situation; War Office Announces Suppression Plan

(London) The War Office has developed details of the truth about Palestine and practical plans to deal with the current situation there, in order to put an end to the activities of hostile figures and groups who engage in deceptive propaganda and fabricate news of atrocities committed by British troops in Palestine. The document states that the total number of actively rebellious traitors in all of Palestine is only between 1,000 and 1,500, divided into several small teams, who avoid contact with the military and mix with peaceful civilians, making them indistinguishable. The main leaders are Abdul Muhammad, who calls himself Commander-in-Chief, and Raik, both of whom are causing trouble in Samaria. The two men are constantly at odds, repeatedly declaring or openly breaking off relations and fighting each other. Now, the regiments without actual main leaders, with smaller leaders, are almost independent, each with its own agenda, even hostile to each other. Therefore, there is no permanent armed force for the military to suppress, and there is no central organization that can be destroyed to disintegrate the rebellion. In addition, an Arab group that opposes the rebellion has emerged, seeking to retaliate against those who support terrorist acts, further complicating the situation. The greatest difficulty faced by the military authorities is distinguishing between good and bad and identifying individuals. Sometimes, information is obtained about the names of a large number of rebels, but it is not easy to identify them. Therefore, it is necessary to search villages. The search method is to deploy troops or aircraft to set up a cordon in the area and prohibit residents from crossing it. Since this procedure is well-known, anyone who tries to cross the cordon can be determined to be trying to avoid the military. Some who crossed the cordon were attacked during the search. Propagandists claim that British soldiers massacred prisoners, which is largely due to this. Once the cordon is set up, the men in the village are gathered to identify each person. Those who are hiding are searched by house. Weapons and other contraband are occasionally found as a result. However, the authorities have strictly prohibited the military from looting and arbitrary destruction. Propagandists claim that British troops demolished entire batches of innocent Arab homes, which is completely unfounded. British troops only demolish designated houses for urgent reasons, and each village, regardless of whether it sympathizes with terrorism, generally harbors rebels. In recent months, anyone suspected of informing the government has been killed, so each village has been coerced by a small number of residents. As for the cities, the main rebels are either more educated upper-class figures or lower-class terrorist thugs. The former are forced by the fear of being harmed and only make recommendations, not issue orders. These people are mostly bishops and groups associated with the Church. The roundup of famous rebels involves many difficult procedures, as it is unavoidable that good and bad are mixed together. However, in the current situation, there is no other way. Regarding the search for weapons and ammunition, the authorities have warned residents not to hide items in unventilated places to avoid unnecessary losses. Women are not disturbed at all, and are only searched when female police officers are present. Mosques are never searched, except at the invitation of those responsible for their safekeeping and the village head. When searching, a military officer accompanies the search and directs it. Critics strongly criticize collective punishment, but they do not know that the Arab people of Palestine fully recognize and understand the principle of collective responsibility for crimes committed in an area. Collective punishment is actually the only way to force the majority of good and threatened residents to know that if they do not assist in maintaining order, the harm they suffer will ultimately be greater than the threat of obedience. Collective punishment is currently divided into two types: collective fines, which are not a military plan but are determined by civil servants, but are currently the responsibility of the mountain military commander; and collective demolition of houses, but this method is only applied after repeated warnings and must be approved by the General Headquarters before being implemented. This method is used to punish those who severely disrupt traffic, which is often seen. This measure is intended for the village people, but it clearly establishes the responsibility of the village. The document concludes by expressing regret for the need for military plans to restore order, but states that there is no other way. It also says that anyone who knows the truth about Palestine and understands the absolute necessity of ending the terrorist movement will not be misled by hostile propaganda.

### Roosevelt to Submit Major National Defense Plan to Congress; Joint Meeting of House and Senate Armed Services Committees; Ambassadors to Britain and France Report on European Situation

(Washington) Responsible sources have declared that President Roosevelt will soon submit a national defense message to Congress, in which the air force portion proposes an appropriation of $360,000,000 to build airplanes for the army, increasing the total number of first-line airplanes to 5,600, and $41,261,000 to build 900 airplanes for the navy, thus increasing the total number of airplanes for the army and navy to 10,000. To avoid disagreements among the Democratic Party during the discussion of national defense issues, President Roosevelt has reportedly decided to shelve the discussion. The army authorities also believe that after the first-line aircraft are increased to 5,600, they will be prepared for any eventuality. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(Washington) Today, the U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France will attend a joint meeting of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to support President Roosevelt's national defense program. Kennedy and Bullitt will present their observations on the European situation and submit documents recording the political and military situation in Europe after the Munich Conference at the committee meeting. It is reported that they will agree with President Roosevelt's plan to fully arm the United States to prevent foreign erosion of the Western Hemisphere. Currently, both Campbell and Burritt are on leave. Yesterday, the two met with Roosevelt and Acting Secretary of State Welles. Their meeting with President Roosevelt is particularly significant, as it comes at a time when Roosevelt is about to complete his special message on U.S. defense. According to plan, Roosevelt will submit his national defense message to Congress this week. It is unprecedented in American diplomatic history for U.S. ambassadors to foreign countries to attend committee meetings. According to custom, they should prepare reports on foreign events and submit them to the congressional committee. It is reported that the president will detail his entire program in his national defense message to Congress and specifically point out the purpose of the "$500 million" "mysterious" national defense fund. According to him, he has requested Congress to allocate these funds. Senior government officials expect that the majority of this fund will be used to develop the air force, so that the U.S. air force can be on an equal footing with any other country in the world (except Germany). (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Washington) The great new U.S. national defense plan has prompted army and navy officers to tighten their regulations on controlling military secrets. New rules to protect forts, warships, and military aircraft have been implemented. Foreign personnel outside aircraft manufacturing plants are subject to stricter surveillance. It is expected that Congress will approve funds to prevent espionage. According to military sources, cartographers and photographers who have not been officially approved will not be allowed to approach army garrisons, naval ships, and aircraft locations. These regulations are now being finalized. Foreign personnel serving in government supply agencies who are currently being dismissed or transferred due to suspicion have been investigated in detail by those responsible for various government executive agencies since 1926, and it has been found that a small number of employees do not yet have certificates of citizenship. The case of the capture of three spies in New York has drawn criticism from President Roosevelt, who believes that the currently allocated funds are not sufficient for the army and navy intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to prevent espionage.

### American Arms Dealers Voluntarily Stop Shipping Arms to Japan; Hull Appeals for Justice; Effective Since Last Autumn

(Washington) According to news revealed here today, the "voluntary" ban on the transportation of military aircraft and bombs to Japan, encouraged by the U.S. Department of State, has been in effect since July 1, 1938. Also, according to news from the arms department, the "voluntary arms embargo exporters today issued a letter saying that Secretary of State Hull had made a strong appeal to American aircraft and arms exporters, saying that it was "the most important violation" of morality for the government to sell arms and trample on civilians. Although the Secretary of State did not specifically mention Japan, an arms embargo to Spain was already in effect. In addition, only China is currently at war with Japan, so it is not difficult to understand which country Hull was referring to. The association also said that all American companies unanimously agreed with the points stated in the Secretary of State's letter. According to Hull's letter, the State Department could only apologize for not being able to issue export licenses to exporters who transported arms to destroy civilians. According to Hull's letter, which began after Japan purchased millions of dollars worth of aircraft in the first six months of 1938, it was sent to major U.S. manufacturers. The arms department's report praised the State Department's export license system, but its shortcoming was that arms transported to third countries were still being transferred to Spain. As for the exception of shipping aircraft and bombs to Japan without the State Department's approval, the report did not specify, but said that if manufacturers could do as the State Department intended, Japan's purchase of American aircraft and bombs would be greatly hindered. Observers also said that with regard to the amendment of the Neutrality Act, the State Department may further use the experience of the past six months of private voluntary arms export bans to retaliate economically against aggressor countries.

(Washington) According to the annual report of the National Munitions Control Board, Secretary of State Hull's appeal to American aircraft manufacturers not to supply aircraft or bombs to countries whose air forces have been criticized for bombing civilians has been fully effective in preventing the U.S. from supplying Japan with aircraft and bombs. Hull issued a call for voluntary cooperation from aircraft manufacturers on July 1 last year. Since then, the number of American aircraft shipped to Japan has been very small. In the previous six months, the total value of American aircraft shipped to Japan reached nearly $9 million. According to the annual report, all aircraft manufacturers except one agreed to cooperate with government policy. In 1938, the largest purchaser of American arms was the United Kingdom, totaling $29,611,000, mostly for military and non-military aircraft. Other purchasers of American arms included the Dutch East Indies, totaling $10 million; Japan, $9,241,000; China, $9,180,000; Argentina, $7,219,000; France, $6,446,000; and Canada, $3,171,000.

### Patriotic Movement of Overseas Chinese in San Francisco: Banning War Materials from Being Shipped to Japan Receives Sympathy from the American People

A special airmail dispatch from San Francisco on December 22nd, published by the Continental Daily News, states that there are 20,000 overseas Chinese households in San Francisco's Chinatown. The effect of their firing the first shot in the Sino-Japanese War last week may extend to the entire world, namely the prohibition by various nations of shipping war materials to Japan. The beginning of this sudden incident was when the local Chinese and sympathetic Americans placed pickets around the Greek tramp steamer "Spero," loaded with 2,500 tons of scrap iron and about to sail to Japan. This decision to demonstrate would have been dismissed as a local matter and dispersed if American dockworkers had refused to cooperate with the pickets. However, in fact, they assisted the pickets on December 16th, almost leading to a crisis. California's acting Governor, Peterson, representing California Governor Olson, addressed the pickets and expressed sympathy for the Chinese people. His speech briefly stated: "Public opinion and newspapers have been criticizing the transportation of war materials to Japan. Forward-thinking individuals have expressed support for democracy and opposition to aggressor nations... You have now taken action on this matter... Congress will soon convene, and the California legislature will also convene. Pressure must be applied to the legislators, and Mr. Havana, Mr. Wheelk, Mr. Toran, and all other legislators must be told that they must demand that Congress pass a law prohibiting ships from sailing to aggressor nations and declare Japan as an aggressor." Following him, Mr. Schmidt, Vice President of the Pacific Maritime Association, spoke on behalf of the International Longshoremen's Association and the Warehouse Workers Union, briefly stating: "We cannot ask any self-respecting person to disperse these Chinese people and load scrap iron that will be used to slaughter their compatriots... I have suggested to Mr. Ross of the Waterfront Employers Association that the entire matter should be discussed in a citywide meeting. He said it would be of no use. The attitude of the dockworkers immediately transformed what was initially a local matter into a major international event. American newspapers and radio stations have paid extraordinary attention to the issue of prohibiting transportation. Telegrams praising the Sino-American pickets have been sent to San Francisco from all over the world. At the same time, hundreds of American citizens have expressed their opposition to President Roosevelt and Acting Secretary of State Welles regarding the permission to transport war materials to Japan and have urged an immediate ban on such transportation. However, the Waterfront Employers Association, representing Pacific Coast ship owners, has not cooperated with the pickets. Mr. Ross issued an ultimatum to the pickets and American dockworkers on December 19th, demanding that the pickets disband and the allied workers resume work. According to Mr. Ross, he personally sympathizes with China completely, but on commercial principles, this trade cannot be stopped." That evening, the dockworkers held a meeting. Representatives of the Chinese pickets, such as Mr. Feng, Chairman of the American Chinese War Relief Association, and Peng Leshan (transliteration), the Chinese representative to the Second World Youth Congress, appealed to the allied workers to act in unison with them. A vote was immediately held, with 100% in favor. At the same time, through the efforts of the dockworkers, the Committee of Industrial Organizations also passed a resolution to convene a coast-wide conference of all labor, industrial, civic, and religious groups to study and assist in the embargo of war materials to Japan. On December 20th, the United Chinese Association, which was in charge of the picket operation, held an emergency meeting and resolved to remove the picket line. At that time, the "Spero" and the British ship "Buckingham" were already docked in the harbor. Mr. Feng declared the end of the picket line, stating that, "Today, we are withdrawing the demonstration from the San Francisco waterfront. We believe that this decision to place the picket line will uphold a great purpose, which is to have a peaceful but extremely powerful attitude. Newspapers across the country have recorded the achievements of our efforts. We have received telegrams from nationally renowned figures, large organizations, churches, and prominent citizens, praising our aims, guaranteeing to provide assistance, and protesting to President Roosevelt and other government officials in Washington. The result of the action we initiated here is expected to prohibit the transportation of war materials from the United States to Japan and to aid the democratic ideals of China in its fight. We now know that the vast majority of true Americans genuinely sympathize with us."

### Movement to Amend the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act Gains Strong Public Support, but Opinions in Congress Remain Divided

(Washington) Regarding the issue of amending the current Chinese Exclusion Act, observers generally believe that if Congress strongly resists and is unwilling to accept the amendment, the President will declare that the United States is not in danger of being drawn into the Spanish Civil War, and the Chinese Exclusion Act is no longer applicable to Spain. According to congressional figures and domestic public opinion, the amendment of the Chinese Exclusion Act is currently being hotly debated. Several members of Congress have also introduced motions in the House of Representatives, the contents of which are mostly contradictory. For example, the motions proposed by Faditz (Democrat) and Mar (Republican) call for the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, while Ludlow (Democrat) and Constone (Republican) call for the implementation of a military embargo on belligerent countries, even prohibiting the export of military supplies in peacetime. With such divergent opinions in Congress, public opinion is also divided. Various cultural organizations, religious groups, and medical associations are holding joint meetings here, advocating for the lifting of the arms embargo on Spain and recommending representatives to visit Acting Secretary of State Welles to declare that the current arms embargo is unfair. The Catholic Committee, however, opposes the lifting of this ban. However, with the support of a large part of public opinion, the government is encouraging the amendment movement in various ways, determined to implement its original proposal. Whether this matter can be realized in practice will be revealed once the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives meet to discuss it. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)

### U.S. Senator Borah Opposes Sanctions: Would Rather Wage War Against Aggressor Nations Than Let Women and Children Freeze and Starve

(Washington) Today, Senator Borah vehemently criticized the proposal that the United States should impose sanctions on aggressor nations. He said that he would rather the United States engage in war than let its women and children freeze and starve. He also said that sanctions are the fuse of war. "I would only support sanctions in a situation where I am willing to participate in the war myself. I do not consider this kind of action to be a peace movement." (Associated Press dispatch on the 10th)

### U.S. Council Against War Attacks Government Policy Out of Cowardice, Fearing Being Drawn into War

(Washington) Today, the Council Against War attacked the government's plan to extend its naval bases in the Pacific, including expansion to Guam. In its weekly statement on foreign policy, the council stated that Herbert Bain's recent suggestion to expand the U.S. naval base to the Far East is tantamount to indicating that the United States is responsible for the defense of the Philippines, even after the Philippines has declared its independence. The council expressed attacks on President Roosevelt's new foreign policy, including increasing bases in the Pacific, amending the Chinese Exclusion Act, and plans to impose economic sanctions on aggressor nations. It also said that the most important of Rear Admiral Bain's suggestions last week was the construction of a naval base in Guam. The council specifically pointed out that Guam is 3,337 miles from Hawaii, located in the center of Japan's various dependencies, and situated on the route to the Philippines. If it is converted into a naval base, it will be sufficient to cancel the independent defense of the Philippines. The danger of this action is extremely obvious, because it has extended the area of our naval activity further away from our coast. Moreover, defending Guam carries the risk of being drawn into the vortex of war. On the other hand, it indicates that the Navy at least hopes that the United States will bear the burden of defending the Philippines at some point in the future. As for the cost of completing this new plan, it is not yet known, but naval experts estimate that it will require at least $200,000,000 to put Guam in a state of defense. According to Habun's report, fifteen of the forty-one bases urgently need to be completed immediately, including ten in the Pacific region. The more the United States focuses on the Pacific region, the more it will inevitably find itself in competition with Japan in the Far East. The council believes that we should try to avoid any action that could draw the United States into war, especially since establishing a strong base in Guam is bound to provoke strong opposition from Japan. As for the President's message to Congress, the first special proposal is the national defense plan. The government believes that American public opinion is ready to accept a large-scale expansion of the army and navy. However, if recent congressional or public opinion expresses support, the proposals for amending the Chinese Exclusion Act and imposing economic sanctions can be approached immediately. Regarding international conferences, the council believes that unless democratic countries can stop the actions of Japan, Germany, and Italy, no development is expected. Regarding the U.S. policy on the Spanish Civil War, the council said that the proposal to embargo arms is generally opposed. (Associated Press dispatch on the 9th)

### Achievements of the Pan-American Conference: Hull Returns Home and Gives a Speech

(New York) Secretary of State Hull has returned here from the capital of Peru and has now arrived here. He immediately gave a speech on the achievements of the Eighth Pan-American Conference, briefly stating, "The principles passed by the Pan-American Conference are based on justice and freedom and set a precedent for international conduct, which is an indispensable foundation for establishing peaceful and friendly relations among countries around the world. There are three main achievements of the conference: (1) The resolution of the American republics to reduce tariff barriers and promote international trade; (2) The declaration of "Continental Solidarity of the Americas"; (3) The declaration of various "American Principles". Among them, the second is considered important. I firmly believe that these achievements will retain genuine and lasting value, and their importance will become increasingly clear in the future." Secretary of State Hull then said that the trade policies promoted by various totalitarian countries "are sufficient to weaken the position of the production sector, restrict the markets of various countries in the world, and use them under certain circumstances to expand political influence and strive to achieve control." This is incompatible with the free trade system accepted by the Pan-American Conference. Some parties have accused the United States of planning to conclude political or military alliance treaties with Latin American countries, which is not true. "What the United States hopes for is that the American republics will strengthen cooperative relations within the world's standing and within the Pan-American mechanism, so as to build peace, achieve economic well-being, and promote human rights. This hope has now been fully realized." (Havas dispatch on the 9th)

### A Prisoner of War Working with the New Fourth Army (Continued from Yesterday)

—Yan Su, sent from Southern Anhui

(Question) How were you captured? (Answer) Two months later, I took a train from Shanghai to Nanjing, stayed in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for two days, and was then assigned to Zhenjiang. From Zhenjiang, I transported military supplies to Danyang. On the way, in a place called "Moling," we encountered the guerrillas of the New Fourth Army. At that time, there were more than fifty of us (Japanese soldiers). I don't know how many guerrillas there were. The battle lasted less than ten minutes. I was injured and fainted on the ground. Later, I was awakened by the sound of the horn calling for retreat. (Later, I learned that this was the sound of the New Fourth Army's horn.) Soon after, I was caught by the Chinese people and handed over to the New Fourth Army. (Question) What was your inner feeling when you were captured? (Answer) When I was captured, my eyes had been slightly injured. I thought there was no hope of survival because the officers told us that Chinese soldiers would kill Japanese prisoners. But after arriving here for three days and talking to a New Fourth Army comrade who understood Japanese, I realized that the actual situation was not like that. I have been here for three months, and I have been treated very well by the New Fourth Army. In addition to a very comfortable material life, they also give us books to read (Chinese books and progressive novels in Japanese), work to do (teaching soldiers Japanese, Japanese slogans, and making propaganda materials in Japanese), and the right to come and go freely (meaning the freedom to go out on the street to play - reporter). Therefore, my spiritual life is also very pleasant. (Question) If the New Fourth Army released you and sent you back to your country now, would you be willing? If so, what do you plan to do when you return to your country? (Answer) I am willing to return to my country. I will return to my country to unite with my friends to promote socialist and anti-war ideas. But that is probably impossible because if the Japanese military authorities know that I have returned to my country, they will definitely kill me. (Question) What is the situation in Japan now? What is the relationship between the people and the government? (Answer) Generally speaking, the Japanese people have recently become increasingly impoverished due to soaring prices and have a very unfavorable impression of the government. They have gradually begun to oppose it (mostly workers and the toiling masses). However, because of feudal traditions and superstition, most of them still inexplicably respect the Emperor. (Question) What are the most common diseases you see among Japanese soldiers in China? (Answer) Cholera, frostbite, and malaria are the most common. Cholera in summer, frostbite in winter, and malaria are year-round. (Question) What do you think is the future and outcome of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) The Sino-Japanese War will be a protracted war, that is certain. According to my estimation, it will take at least five years. The outcome of the war is that China will be able to achieve final victory, that is also certain. Because as the war drags on, Japan's manpower and material resources will increase, and at the same time, the anti-war forces of the people (including the Communist Party) will inevitably unite to overthrow the Japanese warlords. At that time, the Japanese central authorities, because they have no connection with the Japanese people in peacetime, will inevitably fall. (Question) What do you plan to do after the end of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) After the end of the Sino-Japanese War, I want to return to Japan, unite with my friends to discuss and promote the impressions and things I have learned here. (Question) How has your life been here for the past three months? (Answer) At first, I was not used to the food here, and there were some things I didn't dare to eat because I was afraid there would be problems. Now, I am not only used to it, but I also believe in it and am very satisfied with it. Therefore, I very much hope to help China defeat the Japanese warlords as a reward. (Question) Did anyone see you off when you left Japan? (Answer) Yes, the military authorities mobilized the people to send me off. (Question) Do you miss your family now? (Answer) At first, I missed them very much, but now it's a little better because the New Fourth Army has helped me communicate with my family. (Question) Do you have a lover? (Answer) Yes, she is still studying in Tokyo. (Question) How is she now? Do you miss her? (Answer) I don't know now. When she saw me off, she cried for me. Of course, I miss her very much. I am now asking the New Fourth Army authorities to find a way to communicate with her. If they can find a way to bring her to China, that is what I most hope for.

### Overseas Chinese in Singapore Eager to Register, Exceeding 160,000 People

(Singapore) Overseas Chinese in Singapore, in accordance with the Chinese Foreign Ministry's regulations on registering overseas Chinese and registering as Chinese citizens, have now reached more than 160,000 people. According to official statements, this decision to register is not a plan for the Chinese government to implement conscription among overseas Chinese. Although the British government regards Chinese born in the Straits Settlements as British citizens, the Chinese government recognizes them as Chinese citizens and is also eligible to register. As far as the Chinese government is concerned, all Chinese, regardless of where they reside, are Chinese citizens, and they are subject to Chinese law when they return to China (Reuters dispatch on the 10th).

### The New Fourth Route Army Focuses on Work Among the People, Receiving Assistance Everywhere in Combat; The Political Department Vigorously Organizes the People

Continued communication from Belden, a special correspondent for the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, from the headquarters of the New Fourth Route Army south of Wuhu: The New Fourth Route Army focuses on work among the people. The leaders of the army believe that the guarantee of victory in war depends not only on military strength but also on the masses. According to the officers of the army, the victory of guerrilla warfare is indispensable to the assistance of the people. Because guerrilla forces have inferior weapons, they must know the enemy's situation before each battle. It is not easy for soldiers unfamiliar with the area to obtain this detailed information, but it can be obtained from the people who are familiar with the local terrain and situation. If the troops want to cross the river and do not know where to cross it, the organized people can tell the troops where there are small paths or roads to pass through. The activity of guerrilla warfare is valued for its speed. The location of the army must be kept secret, and spies must be eradicated. This kind of work depends entirely on the people. The people can assist the wounded to the rear and return to their homes to recuperate them because there are no hospitals in the countryside. During the battle, the people can also shout to cheer or fire behind the enemy, making the enemy panic and unaware of how many troops there are on the other side. All of this is only from a military point of view, so the New Fourth Route Army believes that work among the people is very important. The New Fourth Route Army has five goals: (1) Mobilize the people to assist the army, guide the way, and report the enemy's situation; (2) Encourage the people to cooperate with the army and fight behind the enemy; (3) Arm the local people to fight independently; (4) Encourage the people to expose traitors and maintain local order; (5) Encourage the people not to supply the enemy with necessities, food, and information. The New Fourth Route Army aims to gain the trust of the people, conduct propaganda work among the people, establish people's organizations, organize the people, establish armed teams, and provide them with military training in order to achieve its goals. Because China has historically despised soldiers, it is not easy to gain the faith of the people at first. However, if the soldiers are instructed to care for the people, the people will gradually care for the soldiers and trust the army. According to the army, they do not force conscription, nor do they force farmers to serve, so they have won the trust of the people. According to Deputy Director of the Political Department Tang Shihui (transliteration), when the New Fourth Route Army first arrived at a town near Jinhua, the people locked their doors and some fled the town. However, the army did not disturb their order, stationed troops outside the town, and sang songs. Then, they sent several unarmed officers into the town to tell the people that they were the New Fourth Route Army and told the people the rules of the army. But the people did not believe them. Then, several old people came out of the town and saw that they were polite and gradually believed them. Finally, they invited the army into the town. When the army left the town, the people held a grand farewell party and lit firecrackers to send them off. After the New Fourth Route Army won the trust of the people, they tried to educate the people, telling them how barbaric the Japanese army was, why the New Fourth Route Army was fighting the Japanese army, and why the people should give assistance. They also told the people that we must fight against fascism and countries in the world that do not love peace. We are fighting Japan for independence and fighting fascism for world peace. This kind of work is all carried out through propaganda, such as through the people's newspapers, street speeches, tea parties, singing, acting, painting, photography, and communications. The newspaper called "Save the Nation" is published every ten days, but now it has new equipment and hopes to change it to a three-day publication. The army also holds army-people get-togethers, performing entertainment and speeches. Each part of the army also holds tea parties. For example, the officers of the general staff recently held this meeting, buying sugar, vegetables, and other things for three yuan and inviting a representative from each household in the town where the staff lived to participate. During the banquet, the guests were asked to tell the army's shortcomings. Whenever the New Fourth Route Army arrives in a town, the political department will gather the children of the people, sing loudly, and explain the meaning of the lyrics. Therefore, wherever I go, I hear children singing songs learned from the New Fourth Route Army. Before the army performs a play, it must post advertisements. The people are attracted to go to the theater, but the plays performed are slightly different from the plays watched by the soldiers. The plays watched by the soldiers all reflect the war, but the plays watched by the people focus on the people's assistance to the army, eliminating traitors, engaging in espionage, and destroying highways. This kind of play is deeply loved by the people. The New Fourth Route Army attempts to organize the people and first conducts propaganda work so that the people can know what their responsibilities are. When the propaganda work is completed, two hundred young men and women from the political department are dispatched to mobilize and organize the people to assist in organizing anti-Japanese united associations, such as the Women's Anti-Japanese United Association and the Businessmen's Anti-Japanese United Association. Organizing a united association is easy, but it is not easy to make the association provide real service during the war. The Anti-Japanese Farmers United Association near the general headquarters is an organization automatically organized by farmers. Its slogans are: (1) Assist the government and the New Fourth Route Army in fighting Japan; (2) Guarantee the lives of farmers; (3) Increase agricultural income; (4) Farmers unite and cooperate with each other; (5) If there are disputes, the association will resolve them; (6) Promote education. The New Fourth Route Army has established night schools to teach singing and reading newspapers, and has opened short-term training courses near the front lines to train the masses, explain the theory of protracted war, and the national revival program set by the National Government. Each class is one month long, but the New Fourth Route Army also wants the people to fight, not only to assist the army in combat, but also for the people to fight independently. Therefore, they urge the people to organize guerrilla forces. The teams that have been organized in the past will unanimously fight against the Japanese army. They should always be prepared to cultivate the land, and in wartime, they will fight the enemy. These armed teams are usually organized in units of one guarantee (bao), with each bao having one thousand people. On average, eighty people have hunting rifles, broadswords, or spears. If a small number of Japanese troops come, they will be united to drive them away. If the enemy comes in large numbers, each team will try its best to resist, so that the families can leave safely. It is said that before this kind of team was organized, three or four Japanese troops could come and seize women at will, but today, the Japanese army does not dare to come without forming a large team.

### Hua Army in Southern Shandong Recovers Tancheng; Remnants of Japanese Army Flee to Linyi; Setting up Fake Cannons to Create False Impression; No Trace of Japanese Troops in Rizhao and Juxian

Xuzhou Dispatch: Recently received a report from southern Shandong that the Japanese troops who invaded the southern part of Taiwei Road were the Yekan unit that fled from Linyi. It consisted of only about 500 infantry soldiers, accompanied by more than 20 armored vehicles, including more than ten cargo trucks, and equipped with a considerable number of small cannons. However, due to the small number of troops, there were not enough to distribute, so many fully armed rubber mannequins were loaded onto the armored vehicles. At night, fearing attacks from guerrillas, they would drive the armored vehicles back to Tancheng County and deflate the rubber mannequins. This back-and-forth operation shows how they were creating a false impression. Therefore, after the Japanese troops invaded east from Matou, Tancheng, to the west bank of Mao Cao River and the town of Chongxing, they feared guerrilla attacks and were unable to advance further. When the vigorous reinforcements from the Donghai detachment of the Chinese army arrived, they were met with a head-on attack. The enemy's forces were routed, and Yekan led his troops to flee to Linyi. A vigorous reinforcement unit of the Chinese army also tracked and advanced. Mao Cao River and Chongxing Town were still garrisoned by the Jiangsu-Shandong guerrillas. Furthermore, the army, well-known for its success in killing enemies, also arrived in large numbers. From then on, the defense of the Jiangsu-Shandong border area became even more secure. Currently, the guerrilla forces are continuing to track and pursue the enemy on one side, while on the other side, Chen Guan Jin, the commander of the Tancheng regular brigade, has led his troops to garrison Tancheng, issuing announcements to reassure the people. The market in Matou has returned to its former state. The Tancheng County government office was damaged in many places by Japanese artillery fire, but it has now been largely repaired. County Magistrate Liang of Tancheng led his subordinates to return to the old county seat on December 11th to resume work as usual and issued announcements to reassure the people. Residents who had sought refuge in the surrounding villages have returned to the city one after another. The streets in the city have also been completely cleaned, and order has been fully restored. It is reported that when the Japanese army occupied Tancheng, they originally planned to invade eastward, but were blocked by the Yi and Shu rivers. In addition, armed civilians in various villages took the opportunity to attack from time to time. The Japanese army had a total of no more than a thousand men, more than ten cannons, and thirty to forty armored vehicles. In addition, the Chinese army rushed to the scene and launched a head-on attack, so the Japanese army did not dare to go deep. It is also learned that there is currently no trace of Japanese troops in the territories of Rizhao and Juxian counties. However, there are four to five hundred puppet troops of Liu Guitang's unit in Zhucheng, and more than a thousand puppet troops of Zhang Buyun's unit and others north of Zhucheng, arbitrarily causing trouble in various villages. The army and the route army are deploying defenses south of Zhucheng. As for the Japanese troops in Linyi, there are only about fifty men who are holed up in the city all day long, not daring to venture out into the countryside, fearing guerrilla attacks. Not long ago, two Japanese transport vehicles, one carrying military supplies such as ammunition, and the other carrying more than twenty Japanese soldiers, intended to go to Fei County. However, as soon as they left the west gate of Linyi City about two or three miles, they were attacked by nine guerrilla heroes ambushing on both sides of the road. They first threw hand grenades, completely destroying the two vehicles and rendering them immobile. Then, they took advantage of the situation to shoot and stab more than twenty Japanese soldiers to death, annihilating them all. Upon hearing the news, the remaining Japanese troops in Linyi had to keep the city gates half-open and half-closed, unlike before when they were wide open. They also set up fake cannons and rubber mannequins (dressed in yellow military uniforms) on the city towers to create a false impression.

### Shengsi Islands: Japanese Army Considers Them in the Bag; Japanese and Korean Rogues Commit Large-Scale Arson and Robbery; Bandits Also Take the Opportunity to Harass

Chongming Dispatch: The Shengsi Islands, isolated from the sea outside Chongming, have been considered in the Japanese army's grasp since the August 13th Shanghai Battle. Large numbers of huge Japanese warships pass through here. Many of the sailors on the Japanese warships are from Dinghai. In the villages where Japanese soldiers arrive, they commit arson, murder, rape, and all sorts of evils. Pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks are all captured. There are thousands of families on the island, mainly engaged in fishing and farming. There are also commercial markets and shops, but they are not very large. There are the most fish businesses. The Japanese force the fishermen to sell their catches to New Shanghai (the Japanese call Yangshupu New Shanghai). The residents are most afraid of three-ply boats. On the boats are Japanese rogues and Koreans, dressed in rags, with beards all over their faces. They plunder people's property and will not let anything go. When they see Chinese people, they grab their necks and throw them forcefully, taking it as a joke. Recently, there have been slightly fewer Japanese, but the sea bandits Xu Baolong, Wang Yagen, and others are also extremely rampant. The bandit gang is very large. They have collected abandoned weapons from the Chinese army and are disturbing the people by rallying crowds to cause trouble. Goods in stores are often robbed, not to mention money. Gunshots are heard day and night, causing fear. Torture and coercion are unspeakable. Therefore, when fish businesses on the island sell fish to Shanghai, they generally use remittances to avoid carrying cash, lest they be robbed along the way.

### Special Shanghai Edition: Shanghai's Financial Market (Continued from Yesterday)

— Zhang Yifan

(6) Foreign Exchange Control and Black Market Activities: The foreign exchange control implemented in early March of this year should be recorded as a major event in the history of our country's monetary system, following the reform of the currency system. The author has published many articles on this topic in this newspaper's economic section and other newspapers and magazines, which can be consulted for reference. In short, all foreign exchange needs must be applied for through the Central Bank and approved by the Central Bank. For those who have been approved, the bank will supply the full amount at the legal rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. Therefore, when ordering goods from abroad, it is necessary to obtain approval first; imported foreign goods cannot be released without an approval certificate. This is not only to save foreign exchange for military use but also to protect national industries and promote thrift and frugality. As for exports, all foreign exchange generated must be sold to the Central Bank, which will issue a certificate, and then the goods can be shipped. Otherwise, the customs and railway bureaus can intercept and prohibit their export. At the same time, to protect the interests of exporters, the state will provide compensation and special treatment for transportation, insurance, and losses incurred when selling in foreign markets. This not only promotes export trade but also greatly increases domestic production. All our citizens should give it practical cooperation and comply with it. Only in this way can we protect our wealth and achieve long-term development.

Unfortunately, Shanghai is located in an occupied area, and foreign banks prioritize their own commercial interests. When our country implemented the foreign exchange declaration system, they refused to cooperate and were thus exploited, actively promoting their work to undermine the legal currency. Traitors even took the opportunity to speculate on foreign exchange and flee with their funds; they even engaged in short-selling and large-scale speculation. As a result, the legal currency experienced a sharp decline in the foreign exchange black market, creating a situation that was difficult to reverse, as shown in the following table: foreign exchange, was secretly authorized by the Central Bank, which may not be accurate. However, it is just an atmosphere created by speculators.

Moreover, since the silver agreement continued to be in effect and Sino-US and Sino-British loans were established; in addition, various circles in Japan realized that the current work of undermining the legal currency can only affect China's foreign trade and cannot shake the confidence of the Chinese people in the legal currency. Therefore, there are those who advocate using the legal currency to implement their economic activities in the occupied areas of China. In addition, China has always been cautious about the issuance of legal currency and never inflates it slightly. The people have always hoarded legal currency, treating it as cash; they refuse to accept counterfeit and inferior currencies. Even those who are forced to use it under coercion only use it with the left hand and then pass it out with the right hand. Therefore, the changes in the foreign exchange black market only cause losses to speculators and importers. Its domestic value has not changed slightly. As for the current rise in domestic prices, it is due to the imbalance between the supply and demand of the goods themselves.

(7) The Revival of the Securities Market and the Government Bonds Market: Originally, it was also a place for speculators to operate. Before the implementation of the unified government bond system, the monthly turnover often reached four to five million yuan per year. Since the exchange of old government bonds and the issuance of unified new government bonds unified the past disparate bond prices into five types: A, B, C, D, and E, and the government invisibly manipulated them, the bond market no longer experienced the sharp rises and falls as before, and speculators suddenly lost their means of stirring up trouble. Therefore, the total turnover for the entire year of 1936 fell sharply to more than two million yuan. However, since the Shanghai stock exchanges sparked a fierce speculative frenzy in the early summer of 1937, the bond market was inevitably affected. Therefore, the total turnover from January to July of that year reached more than two million yuan. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, the stock exchanges closed, but it was not long before spot trading began to take place in secret. Although this kind of trading is illegal, it still has its understandable reasons in the special organization of the Shanghai financial market.

The Shanghai banking industry regards government bonds as a variable cash reserve. It is not only regarded as a kind of securities investment, but also as a method to adjust the lending of funds. When there is a lot of floating capital, government bonds are purchased and stored, and when there is a shortage, they are sold on the market. The suspension of the stock exchange means that the banking industry suddenly lost a public market for circulating funds. Therefore, the secret implementation of spot transactions after the outbreak of the war was necessary for the deployment of funds.

However, one thing is puzzling: at that time, it was said that the black market price was more than 30 yuan lower than the price before the war. Why didn't the bondholders apply for mortgage credit from the joint reserve organization of the banking industry or even the discounting committee, and were willing to sell their bonds at a discount? It can be seen that this kind of transaction is not entirely spot, in other words: it is not purely for the purpose of circulating funds. Because of this, the initial trading volume was very small.

Since Shanghai fell, the effectiveness of national law has been reduced invisibly. Stimulated by the black market transaction of foreign exchange, government bond speculators began to show their faces publicly. In March and April of this year, there was an organization called the "Mingtan Association" (see the author's "Past and Present of the Shanghai Securities Market," which will be published in this newspaper soon) that carried out illegal transactions.

The existence of this illegal transaction directly affects the credit of government bonds; indirectly, it shakes the reserve value of various banks. Therefore, the Chinese Securities Exchange once requested to resume business. Although the government did not allow it, it seemed to understand the exchange's attempt to eliminate the illegal behavior of the aforementioned "Mingtan Association" in a semi-public market. Because the aforementioned transaction is purely organized by speculators, its actions are quite dangerous; it is easy to cause the bond credit to be severely hit. If a semi-public market appears and original securities brokers are allowed to operate trading, it will be easier to control. It is also easier to maintain bond credit. Therefore, since the market started its activities, the prices of various bond markets have begun to recover and are now Yun Lie. Although it has been repeatedly affected by changes in the war situation, it has been able to overcome each difficulty. However, it is still far from the lowest price announced before the war. Therefore, many parties are unwilling to enter the market, and only retail investors enter and exit every day.

Since the sharp fall in foreign exchange, the prices of goods imported from Europe and the United States have soared. This is tantamount to offering the market in China to Japan. Japan has free access to the occupied areas and can refuse to pay various taxes; the cost of goods from Europe and the United States is originally more expensive than Japanese goods, and it is even more expensive due to the soaring exchange rate. Although it can use the psychology of the Chinese people who vow not to buy enemy goods to be slightly active; when the exchange rate soars sharply, it is difficult to freely compete with department stores. Therefore, after the legal currency fell sharply, European and American merchants realized their mistakes and had to come forward to maintain the exchange rate of the legal currency for their own benefit. Our country can ignore the activities of the black market. Because not only can foreign trade profit from it, but the finance has foreign exchange funds available for external payments, and it is not slightly affected by the influence of the black market exchange rate. Moreover, if maintenance is implemented, it is tantamount to promoting foreign exchange speculation, so why implement foreign exchange control in the first place? Therefore, the sale of HSBC and Hong Kong transmitted by the outside world.

### Benevolent Deeds of American People: Large Quantities of Relief Goods Shipped to Shanghai; Including American Wheat, Medicines, and Baby Food; Ship Owner of the "S.S. Sachuest" Donates Free Shipping

The American people, sympathizing with China's resistance against aggression and based on human nature, were concerned about the Chinese people who were displaced due to foreign aggression. They raised relief funds and purchased American wheat, medicines, and other goods to ship to China. These American relief goods arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 9th). The details are as follows:

American Ship Loaded: Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last

These goods include 3,360,000 pounds of broken wheat, packed into 24,000 bags, entrusted to the American Red Cross for handling and shipped to China on the American ship "S.S. Sachuest." The ship departed from New York in late October last year and arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th of this month. In Hong Kong, 8,000 bags were unloaded and handed over to the Chinese Red Cross for relief to refugees in southern China. The remaining 16,000 bags were loaded and brought to Shanghai, arriving at the Huasheng Wharf in Hongkou at 5 pm on the 9th, preparing for unloading.

Christmas Gifts: Relief for Refugee Children

At the same time, in addition to this American wheat, the relief goods transported by this ship also include many "Christmas gifts" donated by major American commercial firms to relieve Chinese refugee children. Among them, there are several tons of canned beef, milk, milk powder, biscuits, etc., as well as quinine and surgical medicines, etc., which are used for relief to infants and refugees.

Ship Owner Generously: Waives Freight

As for the "S.S. Sachuest" ship, it is a new ship leased by the American Weili Han Shipping Company from the American tax. This is the first time the ship has come to Shanghai, and it will operate on the newly established route of the Weili Han Shipping Company in this port. This time, the shipowner generously waived the freight for the relief goods and voluntarily shipped them from the United States to China. All parties are grateful for the benevolent act of the shipowner. It is reported that the ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and will leave Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to open the port.

Reported in Western Newspapers: The Course of Shipping to Shanghai

The Continental Daily reported that the American cargo ship "Sachuest," carrying the first batch of wheat donated by the United States to Chinese civilians who suffered during the war, arrived in Shanghai last night (the 9th). The wheat was harvested in the United States last year and amounted to 1,600 tons. It was handed over by the US Department of Agriculture to the American Red Cross and then to the Shanghai International Red Cross Committee. It will be unloaded from the ship and transferred to barges this afternoon. According to President Roosevelt's resolution with his cabinet to donate some of the US surplus wheat to war refugees in China and Spain, the wheat was transported here. The wheat donated to Spain will be given to civilians in both the government and nationalist areas, while in China, it will be distributed to areas in need, regardless of which party's labor is in control. In addition to wheat, canned meat, milk, baby food, and essential surgical medicines were also brought by the "S.S. Sachuest" and entrusted to the Red Cross Committee in this port. It is said that these items were purchased with funds donated by American schoolchildren and charitable organizations. The "S.S. Sachuest" departed from New York, passing through the Panama Canal, Manila, and Hong Kong to reach here. It passed Yangshupu at 4:50 pm yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The Shanghai agency for the ship is the Weili Han Company. The company is responsible for the loading and unloading of the wheat in this port, and the ship was dispatched by the US Maritime Commission.

### Hua Army Secretly Crosses the Qiantang River; Troops Head to Pinghu; Highway Bridges Diligently Demolished; Japan Attempts to Reinforce Hangzhou Troops

Kuai Xun News Agency, this port dispatch: According to well-informed sources from the Haiyan compatriots in Shanghai, since Haiyan was recaptured by the regular troops of the Hua army, the Japanese army in Hangzhou and Jiaxing has been under threat. The situation in the Hangzhou, Haiyan, and Pinghu areas is very tense, and a fierce battle is about to unfold in the eastern theater. In recent days, news from Hangzhou indicates that the Hua army in Zhejiang Province is preparing a large-scale counterattack on Hangzhou. At the same time, the Japanese army on the eastern section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been decreasing day by day. A large number of troops have been transferred west along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and it is believed that they are heading to the Hangzhou area, seemingly in an attempt to strengthen their forces in that area. As for the secret river-crossing troops of the Hua army, a large number of them have also headed to the Pinghu area. All the highways in the area have been demolished by the Hua army, leading the local people, not only destroying all the bridges but also demolishing the road surface. Therefore, the Japanese army is currently only relying on railway transportation. In addition, the Jiaxing Japanese army has increased its troops by more than a thousand, and the Chang'an Japanese army has largely been transferred to Haining, in order to defend against the Hua army's pincer attack from Haiyan and Pinghu. Therefore, the Chinese side generally believes that the counterattack on the eastern front has begun, and the Hua army will definitely be able to gain an advantage.

### British and American Defense Forces Form Patrol Teams; Maintain Security in West Shanghai; Diligently Patrol Within Their Respective Garrison Areas; American Army Holds Gas Defense Drill Yesterday Morning

The Public Concession authorities, in order to rectify the security in West Shanghai, have been paying attention to prevention and defense for days, and are very vigilant. The British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai have also organized patrol teams to assist. The details are as follows:

British and American Defense Forces: Form Patrol Teams

The British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai, considering that discipline is lax and illegal cases are emerging in the area along the border of the Kunsu Concession Road, have organized several small patrol teams, each with five people, starting from the date of the decision to close the counterfeit "Police Branch" on the Daxi Road, to assist the police force in guarding the Concession. Each team is on duty in shifts within their respective garrison areas. When necessary, they also conduct strict inspections of pedestrians and vehicles coming and going. The patrol is very serious, and the residents of West Shanghai feel safe.

American Army Holds: Gas Defense Drill

The American defense forces stationed in Shanghai held a gas defense drill in the Haifang Road area of West Shanghai at 8 am yesterday. More than 400 people participated in the drill, each wearing gas masks and various application equipment. The actions were very rapid and the results were excellent. During the drill, the surrounding traffic was completely cut off, and the American army deployed defenses separately. The drill was not completed until after 10 am, and the team was withdrawn to the camp. The traffic in the area was then restored to its original state.

### Moufu Ship Returns to Shanghai Today; Sails to Ningbo to Load Goods; Anna Ship Also Specifically Approved to Sail to Ningbo; Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Release Still Under Negotiation

The German Lihe Shipping Company's Moufu ship, with the approval of the Tenth Army Group Headquarters, was allowed to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then to Ningbo to load goods. It was also allowed to return to Shanghai for direct release, but for a limited period of three times. Since the ship was approved, it quickly continued sailing to Ningbo to load silk cocoons. It returned to Shanghai yesterday from Ningbo for direct release and will arrive in port this morning. The three-time period has expired. However, the company believes that there are still many silk cocoons in Ningbo, so it applied to the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities for permission to continue sailing. It is now known that it has been approved to continue sailing once. Therefore, after the ship arrives in Shanghai to unload today, it will definitely sail to Wenzhou and then to Ningbo tomorrow. It is also learned that the Anna ship has also been approved and is scheduled to sail from Ou to Ningbo today or tomorrow.

Weili Han Ship: Opens Shanghai-Ningbo Route

The Continental Daily reported that the American Weili Han Shipping Company will send a ship to Ningbo on Saturday (the 14th) to start shipping services between Shanghai and Ningbo. The other three ships will also start sailing shortly after the first ship leaves. According to the company, it recently obtained a license from the Chinese government to send four ships to the ports of Zhejiang Province. Yesterday (the 9th), personnel from the company said that they would temporarily dispatch rented ships to sail.

Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Release: Still Under Negotiation

The Yin County Party, government, military, and police agencies held a joint meeting on January 3rd, attended by Guo Chiping, Yu Jimin, Xu Zhen, Chen Defa, Chen Baolin, Zhong Zhihan, Wu Zemin, etc., chaired by Yu Jimin. Regarding the Yin County Party Department's letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce requesting that restrictions be added to the water fees and passenger tickets of various ships, and the Ning Shao Shipping Company's telegram stating the reasons for the increase in Shanghai-Ningbo ship water fees and tickets, and requesting permission for direct Shanghai-Ningbo release to reduce expenses in both cases, they were discussed together. It was decided to hand them over to the County Government and the County Party Department to discuss detailed methods with the Chamber of Commerce and the Ship Association Report Customs Association. It is heard that the principle of direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping has been approved by the previous shipping conference.

Shanghai-Dinghai Interrupted: Dinghai-Ningbo as Usual

The Shan Tai, Hana of German Far East, Haifu of German Lihe, Gaodeng of German Lulin, and Tangbei of American Huamei, etc., five ships of the Lanshang Zhengde Company, which operate the Shanghai-Taiwan line and also serve Wan Dinghai, have been ordered to temporarily suspend serving Wan Dinghai and have not yet resumed sailing. Now the Taiwan-Ningbo line's Tangsai of Huamei Company, and the Taiwan-Ningbo line's Meida of Meili Company, have also been ordered to stop serving Wan Dinghai. Therefore, the sailing of Taiwan-Dinghai and Shanghai-Dinghai has been completely interrupted. However, the sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai, the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency obtained definite news from the shipping industry yesterday, that the German Far East Company's Tianbao and the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao still sail as usual. Therefore, the sailing between Yong Dinghai is as usual. The one that was hit by the shell was a building of the Bilian Hospital. The flames were caused by the star and affected the hospital property of the church. Although the hospital has been completely destroyed, the hospital staff were still able to rescue most of the equipment.

### Boy Scout Fiftieth Regiment Member: Cang Chengquan Sacrifices Life in the Line of Duty; Escorting Medicines to Guiyang; Dies from Malaria

Cang Chengquan, a member of the Boy Scout Fiftieth Regiment in this city, was a seventh-term member, from Minhou, Fujian, 23 years old, and worked at the Chunsheng Sporting Goods Company. He was very enthusiastic during normal regiment training. After the outbreak of the August 12th war, the Fiftieth Regiment responded to the invitation of the Chinese Red Cross to provide first aid and transportation services. Cang Jun swore to participate and never slackened. He was accustomed to entering and leaving the battlefield in Shanghai. In addition, he gave blood to the injured Chen Xingsun, a member of the same regiment, showing both bravery and righteousness, and was deeply admired and respected. When the National Army moved west, Cang Jun continued to follow the regiment to work in the war zone, traveling thousands of miles through Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, without complaining of fatigue. Previously, he learned that his mother had died, and although he was extremely saddened, he did not return home for the funeral in order to serve the country. Recently, he was ordered to escort a vehicle of medicines to Guizhou and was attacked by malaria. A swelling appeared on his chest, and after medical treatment, he died on the 31st of last month at the Central Hospital in Guiyang. In addition to sending personnel to handle the aftermath, the regiment has also reported to the General Red Cross Association for record-keeping through the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which is in charge. A telegram was sent to the regimental headquarters, expressing the extreme respect for Cang Jun, who sacrificed his life in the line of duty, and expressing the hope that the funeral matters would be handled carefully.

### Guilin American Hospital Internally Destroyed by Fire; Japanese Planes Drop Incendiary Bombs, Neighboring Houses Catch Fire and Are Affected

Continental Daily reports that the Guilin American Southern Baptist Hospital was severely damaged by fire internally on December 30th when Japanese planes flew over the city and dropped incendiary bombs. Yesterday (9th), the hospital's Shanghai office confirmed this to reporters. However, there were no inpatients in the hospital at the time because the Japanese planes had previously indiscriminately bombed Guilin, forcing patients to evacuate the city. It is uncertain whether the hospital was directly hit by bombs. When the foreign staff returned to the hospital, the sides of the buildings were completely burned, making it impossible to determine where the fire started. However, it is believed that "Today is the sixth redemption of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Reconstruction Public Bonds. The lottery method uses the last three digits of the bond number. Now, I will briefly report the details of the aforementioned public bonds to everyone. The Reconstruction Public Bonds were issued in February of the 25th year of the Republic with a fixed amount of 340 million national currency. This is the sixth redemption of principal, drawing five bonds, each worth 340,000 yuan, for a total principal redemption of 1.7 million yuan. The principal and matured interest of the winning bonds will be paid starting February 28th of the 28th year of the Republic, through the Central Bank of various regions and its designated Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau. Now, please have the supervisors inspect the drawn bonds and the register of bonds to be drawn to carry out the lottery." Immediately afterwards, the lottery will begin. The winning numbers are recorded as follows: "090," "298," "663," "787," "901." Starting today, the National Debt Fund Management Committee will issue a public announcement so that everyone is aware.

### The Fake "City Government" Levies Land Tax, Implementing a Policy of Arbitrary Taxes and Levies; Fake Tax Collection Offices Established in Various Districts, Forcing Farmers to Register and Pay

The fake "City Government," due to financial difficulties and the inability to make up for deficits, had no choice but to resort to arbitrary taxes and levies on the general impoverished and helpless people. In addition to forcibly seizing 1,000 mu of farmland in the Gaoqiao area of Pudong a few days ago, yesterday they issued a "proclamation" to collect "land tax," and have established "tax collection offices" in Zhoupu, Jiangwan, Yinhang, and Fengxian in Pudong, forcing farmers to register and pay within a time limit. The fake "Mayor" initially claimed to be working for the "welfare of the people" as a facade, but this move is completely counterproductive. His mask of harming the country and the people has been exposed, and the people are filled with resentment, which is evident in their expressions.

We sincerely hope for your public friendship."

### Thrifty Relief Association Circular, Striving to Collect Funds; Generated 40,000 in Donations in April; Develop a Style of Perseverance

The Shanghai Thrifty Relief Association sent a circular to various collection banks, firms, companies, and newspapers yesterday, requesting them to continue their efforts in collecting funds to relieve refugees and cultivate thrift. The original circular is recorded below:

Issuing a Notice

"We are writing to inform you that since our association advocated thrifty relief, we have received your assistance in collecting funds, and all sectors have responded enthusiastically. In the past four months, we have received 40,000 in donations. If we calculate that 2 yuan is needed per month to provide for a refugee, then 40,000 yuan can support 20,000 refugees. These 40,000 yuan have all come from all sectors saving on clothing, food, reducing expenses, and hobbies. From the perspective of the donors themselves, they have cultivated the virtue of thrift. From the perspective of the refugees who benefit, it is truly benevolence and mutual assistance. In summary, its significance is not only charitable but also educational. However, the reason why we have achieved this success is largely due to the hard work and support of your colleagues, which our association will never forget. However, disaster relief still requires continued efforts, and thrift must be maintained for a long time to form a trend and not be abandoned halfway. Therefore, we specially request that your office continue to assist us as before. All collections will be handled as before. All funds voluntarily paid for thrifty relief, designated for thrifty relief, will be issued with official receipts from our association and reported to the association at any time. In this way, refugees will be blessed, and society will benefit. Not only will our association be grateful."

Collecting Agencies

In addition to all newspapers in the city uniformly collecting donations, the names of other firms, companies, and banks that collect thrifty relief are as follows: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank and its branches, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Farmers Bank, China National Products Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Salt Industry Bank, China Industrial Bank, Continental Bank, China Reclamation Bank, Shanghai Bank and its branches, Guohua Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Xinhua Bank and its branches, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Juyu Cheng Bank, Siming Bank, China Commercial Savings Bank, Donglai Bank, East Asia Bank, Wing Hang Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Jiangsu Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhongxing Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Hengli Bank, China Enterprise Bank, China National Encouragement Industry Bank, Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, Yongda Bank, Pudong Bank, Zhizhong Bank, Guangdong Bank, Zhengming Commercial Bank, Zhonghe Bank, China Trust Company, Shanghai Trust Company, Tongyi Trust Company, Zhongyi Trust Company, Fukang Money Shop, Tongrun Money Shop, Fuyuan Money Shop.

### Zhang Weishan and Others Promote "One Yuan Debt Repayment"; Chinese Employees of Jardine Matheson Also Enthusiastically Contribute

Local magnates Zhang Weishan, Liu Junqing, Song Shouqing, and others believe that with the country in dire straits, all Chinese people should love their country and therefore promote the "One Yuan Contribution for Debt Repayment" to fulfill their civic duty. Currently, they have collected 2 yuan each from Zhang Weishan, Song Shouqing, Liu Junqing, and Li Yilian, and 1 yuan each from Li Hongsheng, Zhuang Ruheng, Liu Chunshu, Zhang Jinfu, Ma Anxiang, Liu Zhisheng, Jin Guanya, Yu Xianglin, Huang Yufu, Wang Yongjun, Wang Rulin, Xie Wanfang, and Mu Qinglan, totaling 21 yuan in national currency, which will be transferred by this newspaper to the Central Bank for remittance to Chongqing. Furthermore, Chinese employees of the British Jardine Matheson also enthusiastically contributed, raising a total of 281 yuan in national currency, which has been handed over by a representative of the real estate department of the company to the Central Bank for remittance to Chongqing. As this movement begins, accumulating sand into a tower and gathering fur into a robe, the number of contributions to the country will be even more impressive. Their enthusiasm and grand undertaking are truly admirable.

### Wang Yiting Memorial Service; Hometown Associations Join in Succession

Various groups in the city, such as the Hu She, are preparing for the memorial service for elder Wang Yiting, which is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month in the auditorium of the association on Guizhou Road.

Issuing a Notice

The preparatory office of the memorial service has recently printed a notice and distributed it to various fellow villagers. The notice is excerpted as follows: "We are writing to inform you that Elder Wang Yiting, whose formal name is Zhen and who is also known as Bailong Shanren, lived in Wuxing, Zhejiang. When the Taiping Rebellion broke out, Mr. Wang followed his father to seek refuge in Zhoupu Town, which belonged to Shanghai County. He loved to read from a young age and dabbled in classics and history. However, his family was poor and unable to provide for his studies. At the age of sixteen, he was admitted to the Guangfangyan Institute of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. He reviewed the old and learned the new, earning praise from the public. Soon after, he abandoned his studies and entered business, which was not his ambition. After his annual income became abundant, he devoted himself to painting. Initially, Mr. Wang's maternal grandfather, Jiang Ziweng, was famous for his paintings. His wife, Madam Zhao, once showed Mr. Wang the paintings she had collected and said, 'These are the works of your maternal grandfather.' Mr. Wang was delighted and spared no effort in studying and imitating them. He also spent time with Hu Gongshou, Pu Zuoying, Ren Bonian, Wu Cangshuo, and Reverend Xugu, and his artistic skills improved, and his reputation grew. At that time, the Qing government was corrupt, and the Shanghai gentry conspired to self-govern, recommending Mr. Wang as the Director of the Shanghai General Engineering Bureau, the President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the President of the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce. Local people were happy to associate with him, but Mr. Wang focused on industry, such as yarn, cloth, silk, matches, flour, ships, banks, water and electricity, and highways. He was regarded as a leader in all industries. When the revolutionary army rose up, Song Yufu, Chen Yingshi, Yu Youren, and others conspired to restore Shanghai, using Mr. Wang's strength to raise 910,000 gold to help with military expenses. When President Sun established the provisional government, Mr. Wang served as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and concurrently as the Minister of Transportation, but he soon resigned because of his ambitions. Mr. Wang was charitable by nature and devoted to his fellow villagers. In the late Qing Dynasty, he initiated the Huzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. The following year, he built the Huzhou Guild Hall with an affiliated convalescent villa. The year after that, he established the Huzhou Shanghai Public School. After the tenth year of the Republic, the Lang people founded the Hu She, and Mr. Wang strongly supported its establishment. Other organizations, such as the Wuxing Orphanage and the Women and Children Relief Association, all relied on Mr. Wang's planning. There was no limit to the welfare of his hometown. After the age of fifty, he lamented that the national crisis was becoming increasingly serious, and natural and man-made disasters were coming one after another. He made a grand vow to devote himself to charitable causes and convert to Buddhism to enjoy his later years. Therefore, he did good deeds regardless of size, and he rescued disasters regardless of territory. He cared for the elderly, cared for orphans, relieved poverty, and helped the suffering. He would act if he heard of it, and he would follow if he saw good. Although he was tired, he did not refuse. During the January 28th Incident, the war spread, and Mr. Wang was engaged in relief work day and night, and his physical and mental health deteriorated day by day. Mr. Wang has three sons and two daughters, all of whom persuaded him to recuperate elsewhere. Mr. Wang then lived in seclusion in another port. Unexpectedly, he passed away less than a year after leaving Shanghai and less than a day after returning to Shanghai. On the day of his death, the villagers reported the situation to the authorities, who issued a clear commendation. The memorial service for our fellow villager will be held at 2:00 PM on January 15th in the auditorium of the Hu She. All of our fellow villagers are requested to attend at that time to express our condolences together. If you would like to send a eulogy, please send it to the Hu She in advance for the memorial service preparatory office. We will be deeply grateful."

### Remittance Discount Unprecedentedly Low; Decision to Change the Issuance of Cash for the Redemption of Unified Public Bonds

Since the implementation of the remittance bill system in Shanghai after the war, it has led to the trend of remittance discounts. Because it became increasingly severe, it led to the manipulation of speculators. The Silver and Money Industry Association once gathered to strictly restrict the withdrawal of remittances to maintain the normal state of finance, and the trend of discounts naturally disappeared. Later, due to practical difficulties, it was difficult to eliminate. Between August and September of this year, the remittance discount was manipulated by speculators, and the discount rate was as high as 70 yuan. Fortunately, it was leveled by the four banks and the bill exchange, and it fell back to about 50 yuan. Recently, due to the success of the Sino-US and Sino-British loans, and the financial stability of the year-long War of Resistance, the government changed the payment of cash for the redemption of unified public bonds, and the prices of bonds in the securities market soared, creating a new record after the war. General speculative trading of public bonds can be paid by remittance. Therefore, remittances have fallen again and again, and yesterday it has fallen to 28.5 yuan. As for the redemption and payment of interest on the five types of unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E, it has been scheduled for the 31st of this month to be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau.

### German Engineer Goes to Chongming, Beaten by Japanese Thugs; Refuses to Accept the Property of the Yitai Foreign Firm; Has Reported to the German Consul General for Serious Negotiations

The Modern News Agency reports that the Fuan Yarn Factory in Chongming was originally founded by Chinese businessmen, with complete scale and business. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of Chongming Island, the factory has been shut down, and the factory site has been completely seized by the Japanese. They have repeatedly threatened and lured the factory to cooperate and restore operations, but without success. However, all the property of the factory was sold to the Yitai Foreign Firm in this port for US$140,000 before the war. Last week, in order to organize the factory's contents and prepare for startup, the Yitai Foreign Firm specially commissioned the general manager of the firm, a German engineer named Ackpoer, to take a boat to Chongming Island to take over the property. Unexpectedly, the Japanese refused and sent a large number of thugs to surround the house where Ackpoer was staying, and beat him severely. All kinds of documents, evidence, and passports that he had brought with him were looted and torn up. After Ackpoer was seriously injured, he was driven off the island. It is learned that Ackpoer has now returned to Shanghai in a mess. He has reported to the German Consulate in Shanghai, requesting serious negotiations. It is heard that the German Consulate considers this case to be serious and cannot be ignored. It is now investigating in detail in order to take effective measures.

### Consular Corps Prevents European Refugees from Coming to Shanghai; Relies on Gathering in Shanghai after Being Taken Back; Discusses Future Actions

The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that several consuls of the Shanghai Consular Corps have decided to take action to prevent European political refugees from flocking into the two concessions, so that the entire Consular Corps will thoroughly study the refugee situation in this port. The Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Nilong, is currently on vacation in Japan. It is heard that after Nilong returns to Shanghai, when the first decision meeting of the Consular Corps is held, the issue of Jewish refugees will be discussed. It is said that there are currently no passport regulations implemented for immigrants or travelers coming to Shanghai. The Public Works Department has done everything it can to notify the Consular Corps and Jewish organizations in Shanghai and overseas of the problems encountered by the extremely poor refugees in Shanghai. Therefore, the Consular Corps has received a letter from the Public Works Department on the issue of Jewish refugees and will wait for Nilong to return to Shanghai before the consuls hold a general discussion to determine their actions.

### Discovery of the Coffin of Murdered Refugee Zhang Boyuan: The Exhumation Process Was Tortuous and Bizarre; The Burial Site Reveals Major Suspicions; The Criminal's Accomplices Are Numerous and Extremely Cunning; The Autopsy Report Has Not Yet Been Delivered

Shen Zhiguang, the director of the Huazhen No. 42 Refugee Camp, which belongs to the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and the staff members Song Meixi, Cao Linsen, Cai Zuying, Zhao Weilian, etc., were arrested by Liu Shaokui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, and detective Song Bingzheng, etc., for embezzling and selling refugees' food rations and for beating refugee Zhang Boyuan to death. They were interrogated and detained at the Special No. 1 Court. Later, the court and the police authorities, in order to ascertain the truth of the facts, decided to exhume the coffin for examination. On the 6th of this month, detectives Liu and Song went to the Puan Temporary Coffin Repository on Columbia Road. During the exhumation, the suspicious case of a black coffin turning into a white coffin and a male corpse being replaced by a female corpse occurred. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhang Boyuan's coffin has been found by the Puan

Coffin Repository

and sent to the police station. The Special No. 1 Court appointed Prosecutor Song Genshan to examine it the day before yesterday. Because the external appearance could not be examined, it was specially ordered that forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan perform an autopsy. At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial of this case in the Criminal Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the

Forensic Report

had not yet been delivered, and the police could not know the details. However, regarding the change in the color of the coffin, the detectives in charge of the case reported to the court that although the defendants are still detained and cannot take any action, it proves that their accomplices are numerous and their evil influence is great. He requested the court to interrogate them. Detective Song Bingzheng then stated that according to the regulations of the Puan Coffin Repository, all coffins stored by bereaved families are buried, with a wooden sign hung on the coffin, stating the deceased's name, age, and place of origin.

After burial in the soil

another wooden sign is erected on the ground, stating who the buried coffin belongs to, so that there should be no mistakes when the family members come to claim it in the future. On the 6th of this month, I, together with representatives from the Charity Federation Branch and the Refugee Relief Association, as well as Zhang Boyuan's son Zhang Aiyi, went to exhume the coffin. Zhang Aiyi pointed out his father's burial site. The wooden sign on the ground did indeed state Zhang Boyuan, but after digging the soil, the sign on the coffin was Shen Huiyuan, 40 years old, from Shandong, and the coffin was white, not black. It was clearly

not Zhang Boyuan's

coffin without a doubt. Later, the staff of the repository pointed to a black coffin four or five coffins away from this coffin, saying that it was Zhang's coffin. However, the name on the wooden sign in front of the coffin was Xu Zhu's, and the coffin was also smaller than Zhang's coffin. Therefore, we ordered them to investigate and find it quickly. The coffin was sent to the police station the day before yesterday and identified by Zhang Aiyi as correct. Our investigation revealed that the location where the coffin was exhumed was more than ten coffins away from Zhang's original coffin location. We notified the

Director of Puan Repository

Zhang Deyu to come to the police station, but he has not yet arrived. This is the situation. Zhang Aiyi then stated that his late father's coffin was deposited at the Puan Coffin Repository on December 5th of last year. On the 8th, when I went to pay the insurance policy, the staff of the repository dug up the soil at my father's burial site and showed it to me. The coffin was correct, and the wooden signs on the coffin and outside the soil both had my father's name. However, when I went with the detectives on the 6th of this month, the wooden sign at the original location still had my father's name, but the coffin had been replaced by someone else's. Where Zhang's coffin was

found from then on

was unknown. The court then ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation of this point to clarify the truth. After questioning the defendants in detail, it was already late in the evening. The court, believing that further investigation was necessary, announced a postponement of the trial and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.

### Fourteen Local Silk Merchants Accused of Damaging Reputation by Publishing Slander Against the Zhenze Silk Industry Association; Both Lawyers Request Postponement of the Trial

Shi Wenqing, Xu Ziwei, Sun Xuchu, etc., who have been engaged in the silk industry in Zhenze, Wujiang County, recently hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cheng Xingshu of Hengmao Silk Shop on Qipu Road, Tu Junru, Gong Baixin of Zhenda Silk Shop in Qianji Lane on Tianjin Road, Lu Songshan of Zhengfeng Silk Shop, Jiang Shaoqing and Shi Yangxian of Yongxing Silk Shop at No. 105 Wufu Lane on Tianjin Road, as well as Zhang Qingshi, Zhang Heqing, Dong Shuomin, Xu Tingqi, Wen Youzhang, Wu Ruiming, Zhu Rulin, Zhou Ziqing, and others, of spreading text to

damage their reputation.

The facts of the prosecution are that the establishment of the Zhenze Silk Industry Association was formed under special circumstances and was not initiated by anyone. However, on December 25th of last year, the defendants used the names of their represented or managed Yutong, Xieji, Zhencheng, Yuxing, Yilixiang, Zhengfeng, Zhentai, Fengji, and other firms to publish a large advertisement with large-character headlines in the Shen Bao and Wen Hui Bao, slandering the plaintiffs. The facts stated therein were

completely fabricated.

The Zhenze Silk Industry Association was organized when the industry was forced to do so. The plaintiffs' firms were also subject to the environment and paid fees. They were not people who took advantage of the opportunity to initiate and preside over the association. Now, the defendants claim that it was organized by the plaintiffs, and that Sun Xuchu was appointed as the chairman, Xu Ziwei as the head of the Shanghai office, and Shi Wenqing as the leader, and that they forced the industry to pay fees, which is completely fabricated. In August of this year, the industry transported silk

to Shanghai and it was detained.

A fee of 200 yuan per bale was paid to retrieve it. The plaintiffs' firms were all victims. Now, the defendants claim that the plaintiffs forced the industry to pay 200 yuan per bale in advance, which is also fabricated. Regarding the previously robbed silk, plaintiffs Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei did not say, "Unless you redeem it from us, there is no hope." The firms of plaintiffs Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei were all victims in the unredeemed portion. Now, the defendants claim that "Shi Wenqing and Xu Ziwei bought it at the lowest price and sold it at a high price, reaping huge profits in one transfer, harming the industry in the occupied area to the tune of 200,000 yuan. They live in the concession, enjoying a peaceful life and escaping the law," etc. The facts they point out are all fabricated, and the text they spread is extremely slanderous, enough to damage the reputation of the plaintiffs. In summary, the plaintiffs are all normal businessmen and believe they have a considerable position in the business world. However, the defendants are jealous of their peers and have other intentions, so they do not hesitate to fabricate facts and

slander them wantonly.

Therefore, they filed a lawsuit, requesting that they be punished according to the law and that the judgment be published in the newspaper to warn against illegal activities, etc. Yesterday morning, the Special Court summoned them. Because it was late, the plaintiff's lawyer Chen Tingrui and the defendant's representative, lawyer Qiu Hanping, agreed to request a postponement. Judge Zhong approved the postponement to the 17th for further hearing.

### Jardine Matheson's Hanwa Steamer Attacked by Pirates; British Warship Rushes to the Rescue Upon Receiving Distress Signal; Pirates Flee; People and Ships Are Safe

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Jardine Matheson's Hanwa steamer was attacked by pirates in the Yangtze River last night (the 9th). However, the captain of the ship sailed forward bravely amidst machine gun fire. The radio operator lay in the cabin and sent out an emergency call. Within fifty minutes, the British warship HMS Gannet arrived. But the pirates, seeing the warship arrive, fled into the darkness. The details are as follows: The Hanwa steamer was sailing from the towns near Jiangyin Shuizha back to Shanghai, towing

two tugboats.

At that time, there was also a Japanese tugboat towing a barge ahead of the Hanwa steamer. While navigating against the tide, the captain of the ship saw four sampans approaching the Japanese ship. The Japanese ship immediately released the towline, abandoning the barge and sailing away on its own. But the sampans turned and sailed, apparently because the pirates thought the British ship was carrying more valuable cargo, or they intended to rob the British ship first and then the Japanese ship's tugboat, so they sailed towards the Hanwa steamer. The captain of the ship, protected by steel plates, continued to sail bravely forward and called the radio operator to send

an emergency signal.

The British warship HMS Gannet received the signal and immediately rushed to the scene. The location was forty miles upstream from the Wusongkou. The first radio signal was sent at 4:00 p.m. Soon, the pirates opened fire on the Hanwa, trying to force it to sail towards the riverbank. At 4:50 p.m., the British warship arrived near the Hanwa, but the pirate ships had already

fled into the darkness.

No one was injured on the Hanwa steamer or the tugboats. Only one passenger later pointed to a hole in his hat and demanded compensation from Jardine Matheson for the "loss." Although it could not be confirmed that the hole was caused by a bullet, the company still compensated him two yuan and stated that it would not set a precedent.

### Jing'an Bathhouse Accountant Falsely Reports Robbery to Cover Embezzled Funds; Admits to the Crime Without Hesitation During Yesterday's Trial

Yang Zhibiao, a native of Yuyao, 41 years old, was the accountant of the Jing'an Bathhouse at No. 3 Lane 71, West Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai. Recently, because he had embezzled funds from the store and could not make up for it, he came up with a strange idea. On the afternoon of the 8th, at around 9:00 p.m., he used a knife to puncture the trousers of his right leg, slightly injuring the skin and flesh. Then, he reported to the French police station that he had been stopped by robbers on West Zilaihuo Street, who had robbed him of more than 420 yuan in cash and stabbed him in the right leg. He requested an investigation and arrest. The police chief approved his request and sent a detective to investigate West Zilaihuo Street, but no robbery had occurred. The detective repeatedly questioned Yang about the circumstances of the robbery. Yang stammered and finally revealed that he had embezzled funds from the store and made up a false report of robbery to cover up the truth. The detective reported to the police chief, who detained Yang. Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The lawyer representing the police department, Lu, stated the case, saying that the defendant had embezzled funds from the accounting room due to business misappropriation and had made up a false report of robbery. He requested a postponement for further investigation and another trial. The defendant hired lawyer Xue Lisheng to defend him. Tang Yi, the owner of the Jing'an Bathhouse, also came to the court and stated the circumstances of the defendant's embezzlement of funds. Judge Miao Qingbang questioned the defendant, who admitted without hesitation that he had falsely reported the robbery. The court ordered a postponement to the 19th for further investigation and another trial. The defendant was taken into custody.

### Russian Man, Drunk, Breaks into Someone's Home; Detained at Police Station, Screams and Shouts; Sentenced to Seven Days of Detention by the Court

Russian man Amik Shiloshi, 27 years old, lives at No. 332 Pushi Road. The day before yesterday, he was drunk due to excessive drinking. At around 8:00 p.m., he suddenly broke into the home of Wu Chen, a woman at No. 9 Ciqing Lane, Jiujiang Road. Without asking why, he took off his upper garment and lay down on her bed. Wu and others ordered him to leave, but A refused. Wu had no choice but to notify the Laozha Police Station by phone. Chinese detective Yang Chengcai and Western police officer Lin rushed to the scene and detained the Russian man at the police station, temporarily detaining him in the detention room. Unexpectedly, A became highly intoxicated and screamed and shouted in the detention room at around 9:00 p.m., and broke the door of the room with his fists and feet. Chinese and Western police officers then imprisoned him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for destruction of property under Article 354 of the Criminal Code. Judge Zhong Qing questioned A, who also admitted that he was drunk. The court sentenced Amik Shiloshi to seven days of detention. If he wanted to pay a fine, he could do so at the rate of one yuan per day.

### British Army Commander General Glaysetto Visits the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council

Major General Glaysetto, Commander of the British Forces in China, formally visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 10th). At that time, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps sent a guard of honor to pay their respects.

### Freight Transport at the North Station Today: Railway Staff and Tax Officials Engage in Serious Extortion; Unequal Freight Rates Have Ulterior Motives

—Xia Qi

Since the occupied Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways allowed passengers and freight transport in addition to military transport, the North Railway Station, once a scene of broken walls and deathly silence, has become a little more lively.

In the past, the railway stations responsible for the important task of importing and exporting goods for the metropolis of Shanghai were the Mackenzie Road Station, the North Station, the Rihui Port Station, and the South Station. Now, the South Station is completely closed. Although there were rumors that the Mackenzie Road Station would be opened soon, it has not yet happened. The Rihui Port Station has some goods unloaded because of its convenient location on the Huangpu River, but nothing is being shipped out because it has not yet been permitted. Only the North Railway Station is relatively busy and lively. It has goods being shipped out and goods being shipped in.

The unloading of goods arriving at the North Station is generally not much different from the past, except that the unloaded goods have no warehouses to be stored in and must be piled up in the open air. Moreover, after the abolition of the "likin" tax, which the invaders once used as an excuse to criticize China for lacking organization and considered the most unreasonable tax, the tax collectors, who had been absent for several years, have now reappeared under the bayonets of the invaders, reaching out to demand money for every item.

The process of shipping goods out is by no means as simple and smooth as it used to be. If you want to ship goods out, you must first register several days in advance. After the person in charge of registration allows you to register, they will give you a "freight space certificate" the size of a bean curd, which specifies the date on which you are allowed to bring the goods to the North Station. You can only bring the goods there on the specified date. However, before that, you must take this "freight space certificate" to the person in charge of freight space and ask him to assign a space. At this time, if you only take a "freight space certificate," you will not get a space. You must attach five or ten yuan in legal tender to get what you want. After the person in charge of freight space allows you a space, they will write the number of the freight space on this "freight space certificate." Only then is the procedure complete, and you can take your goods to the assigned freight space to place them. If you do not get the permission of the person in charge of freight space, this "freight space certificate" issued at the time of registration is equal to waste paper. Not only will there be no space for you to pile up, but even the soldiers guarding the gate of the yard will not let you pass with the goods. - Before August 13th, the North Station often had many goods waiting to be transported piled up in the open air or on the roads outside the warehouse because there were too few warehouses. After the war, the few remaining warehouses were either destroyed or mostly unwilling to publicly store goods. Therefore, even if you spend a few dollars to buy a freight space, it is only an open space.

After the goods are piled up in the freight space, you have to request a car to load them. This also requires spending twenty or thirty yuan of inexplicable money. Otherwise, even if you leave them for a few days, no car will be assigned. The transfer companies run by Chinese people cannot directly request a car. They have to entrust it to a Japanese transportation company, or at least hire some Japanese people, which of course requires spending a lot of unjust money. Also, goods for export must have a "procurement permit," which most Chinese-run transfer companies have no way to obtain. They have to temporarily buy one from others for twenty or thirty yuan per car.

In the past, freight rates were divided into six levels in great detail. Now, they have been slightly changed to three levels. However, less-than-truckload shipments are not graded:

Silk, satin, general merchandise, etc. are first-class freight rates.

Rayon, cotton yarn, foreign cloth, native cloth, eggs, dried cocoons, flour, foreign candles, cigarettes, sugar, coal, iron... are second-class freight rates.

Cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, salt... are third-class freight rates.

According to the above classification, we can clearly see its effect. The so-called third-class goods, which have the cheapest freight rates, are entirely China's major products and the things that the invaders most urgently need.

The current freight rate from Shanghai to Hangzhou for a second-class truckload is 2.55 Japanese yen per ton, to Nanjing 3.60 yen, Wuxi 2.60 yen, Suzhou 2.20 yen, Jiaxing 2.35 yen, Songjiang 2.30 yen, plus various fees for loading and unloading, etc., at 0.16 yen per ton for each type, totaling 0.64 yen. Also, the Tongyun Kabushiki Kaisha charges an additional 0.90 yen per ton for truckload shipments, regardless of distance, and 0.50 yen per load for less-than-truckload shipments. The so-called Tongyun Kabushiki Kaisha is the freight manager for the railway. It is responsible for the appointment and expenses of all freight personnel on the entire line.

All the vehicles loading goods on both lines were taken away when the Chinese army retreated to the west. The vehicles currently in use are small cars transported from other places, each with a capacity of 15 tons, but freight is charged based on 13 tons.

Because of the shortage of vehicles, because of the small size of the vehicles, there is an insufficient allocation. Because the transfer companies opened by Chinese people cannot directly request a car, because the purpose of some people is to make a fortune, there are many situations of extortion and exploitation, just like in other places. The "staff" in the station determine the price of their special fees based on the amount of goods and the number of vehicles each day. Many transportation companies or individuals of a certain nationality, relying on their natural convenience in obtaining vehicles, do not load their own goods - or have no goods to load at all - and transfer them to unfortunate Chinese people at a high price, just like subletting a house.

Currently, goods arriving at or departing from the North Station are subject to a 5% tax on the original price, which is collected by people sent by the puppet "Shanghai Municipality" stationed there. The clowns collecting taxes know nothing but extortion. Therefore, when estimating the price, they often arbitrarily inflate it. You cannot reason with them, as reason simply does not work there. However, this does not mean that they are "loyal to their duties." The situation is often like this: for example, if you have a batch of goods, they will estimate the original price at 3,000 yuan and the tax at 150 yuan. After agreeing, they will write a donation ticket for 50 yuan, collect 50 yuan from you, and tell you to contact someone in a certain place, which is often the Great Hotel or a hotel south of the Baidu Bridge. Sometimes, it may even be a brothel. If you go there at 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening, you would originally have to pay him 100 yuan, but because the money is going into his own pocket, he may offer a discount and only ask for 50 yuan.

If you want to know where their money goes, just look around in that place and you can see that they are smoking opium, gambling, drinking, and playing with women, everything is complete. The tax-collecting clowns and the Japanese staff on the railway are exactly the same. Not only do they embezzle the money for their own indulgence, but sometimes they even pull many employees of the transfer companies along with them, making noise until dawn, causing people to pay not only extra in terms of material things but also in terms of mental things.

Because the North Station is no longer dead, the houses damaged on Zhabei Road are also being rented out. The houses in this area are now considered confiscated, so during the concession period, you have to rent them from the "Japanese Resident Corps." The rent is about ten yuan or more per day, but what they give you is just a broken house that they do not repair. You have to repair it yourself. Therefore, someone rented a house and spent four or five hundred yuan repairing it. This kind of renting situation is truly rare.

The freight transport at the North Station is now relatively busy. At the same time, the pockets of certain people, as well as hotels, restaurants, brothels, opium dens, gambling houses, and liquor stores, are also busy. On the other hand, it is also the accelerated flow of the blood and sweat of the laborers.

### Woman Commits Adultery; Husband Requests Divorce; Jurisdiction Issue Resolved; Debate Concluded; Judgment Pending

Zheng Yanling, 29 years old, a native of Ningbo and owner of Weishun Knitting Factory at No. 1 Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, married Zhao Lianying, a woman from the same hometown, who is the same age as Zheng. They have a daughter. The relationship was initially harmonious, but later Zheng discovered that Zhao was committing adultery with someone and wrote a letter of repentance without further investigation. However, in May of last year, Zhao again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun, a peddler in the factory, and often went out on the pretext of meeting in a hotel. On October 12th, Zheng found a love letter from Cui to Zhao, reported it to the French police station, and Zhao was escorted to the Second Special Court, where she was prosecuted according to law. After the trial, Zhao was sentenced to

four months in prison.

Zhao refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third Branch Court. The appeal was rejected. She was allowed to commute the sentence to a fine of three yuan per day, and after being released on bail, she hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing her husband Zheng Yanling of embezzling deposits, etc. The trial was not concluded. Details of these cases have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Zheng Yanling, represented by lawyer Qian Zheng, filed a divorce lawsuit against Zhao Lianying (currently residing at the Hua'an Knitting Factory at No. 4, Lane 59, Huacheng Road) in the Civil Court of the First Special Court.

Divorce lawsuit.

Upon receiving the complaint, the court heard the case in Civil Court 7 yesterday morning, with Judge Li Liang presiding. The plaintiff and his representative, lawyer Qian Zheng, appeared in court and stated that the defendant had repeatedly committed adultery with others. After reporting to the police station, the defendant was escorted to the court for interrogation and sentenced to imprisonment. For the sake of the peace and safety of the family, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting the court to grant a divorce. The defendant hired a lawyer to respond, requesting the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and raising a jurisdiction issue, stating that the plaintiff's permanent address was in Ningbo and that Shanghai was only a temporary residence. It was argued that divorce cases should be

under the jurisdiction of the man's permanent residence.

The plaintiff claimed that although he was a native of Ningbo, he grew up in Shanghai and engaged in business, and did not often go to Ningbo. Regarding the facts of the case, our lawyer is still seeking clarification. Today, after being entrusted with the case, we only raised the point of requesting rejection and jurisdiction. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to present his arguments and then declared the debate concluded, setting the 14th for the verdict and adjourning the court.

### Gambling and Racketeering; Two Months of Imprisonment at Home; Gamblers Fined Ten Yuan Each

### Russian Women's Nurse Accuses Credit Bank of Fraud, Defendant Denies Embezzlement and Counterclaims False Accusation, Case Not a Criminal Matter, Court Orders Review

A Russian woman, A-bo-huo-ting-si-ka-ya (transliteration), residing at No. 7, Lane 51, Ge-xi-lu Road, represented by Russian lawyers Shu Sheng-min (transliteration) and Ai-pu-shi-tai-yin (transliteration), filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The complaint accuses Russians Mu-fu-wo-xi-bo-fu (transliteration, residing at No. 46, Lane 380, Gao-en Road), A-a-bi-te-luo-fu (transliteration, employed at the Asian Trust Company, No. 303, Mai-er-xi-ai Road), and Russian lawyer Si-yi-kuo Liu-si-min Chen-kuo (transliteration, residing at No. 2, Lane 373, Ya-er-pei Road) of fraud and embezzlement, requesting legal action.

The complaint states that the plaintiff obtained Certificate No. 868 issued on July 23, 1938, by the Liquidation Office of the Harbin Credit Bank, stating that she had deposited 2,256 yuan and 3 jiao in national currency until the bank's liquidation, and has only recovered 112 yuan, 3 jiao, and 1 fen to date. The plaintiff, a nurse, accumulated these savings through hard work and deposited them in the bank because of assurances from the first and second defendants that the bank was American and reputable, so she had no doubts. Only when the bank declared bankruptcy did she realize that it was not an American company, but an ordinary partnership, and the owners were the first and second defendants and the now-departed Ke-li-gai-er (transliteration), who opened the bank without any capital, using the credibility of a foreign flag for the purpose of committing crimes.

The plaintiff recently learned that the first and second defendants colluded with the lawyer who was the liquidator of the Shanghai branch of the Credit Bank, the third defendant, to obtain a large amount of funds that were illegally transferred from the Harbin bank to the Shanghai branch, disregarding the promise made by the third defendant to remit any remaining funds to Harbin after settling the Shanghai branch's debts, for distribution to Harbin depositors. The plaintiff believes that the defendants' actions constitute fraud, embezzlement, and professional embezzlement under Articles 339, 335, and 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.

Yesterday afternoon, the court, based on the complaint, held a hearing presided over by Judge Liao. The plaintiff and her lawyers appeared and testified to the previous circumstances. The first and second defendants, along with their defense lawyer Shen Di-guo-fu (transliteration), appeared and denied fraud and embezzlement, claiming that they were also victims as depositors and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The third defendant stated that he was appointed as the liquidator of the Shanghai branch of the Credit Bank and the liquidation was not yet completed and denied collusion and embezzlement.

After reviewing the evidence, the court determined that the case involved civil matters and did not fall within the scope of criminal law, and ordered a review of the matter.

### Fire on Hankou Road

After receiving the report, the fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after more than an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the No. 660 cotton shop and the San Tai Paper Shop, the remaining buildings suffered slight water damage.

### Lu Lu-chen, Head of the Puppet Tax Bureau in Songjiang, Arrested

When Zhang Shou-zhi, the puppet "county magistrate" of Songjiang, first took office, he appointed his confidants such as Lu Lu-chen to establish puppet "tax bureaus" in Desheng Port and other places, extorting huge amounts of taxes from merchants transporting goods. For several months, rumors circulated that Lu and others were making a fortune, which led to internal disputes. Zhang took the opportunity to transfer Lu to the puppet "county government" to serve as a "section chief," which caused Lu to harbor resentment. Taking advantage of the opportunity when Zhu Mou went to the puppet "provincial government" to attack Zhang Shou-zhi, Lu colluded with Zhu to completely expose Zhang's misdeeds. Lu, due to other matters, was uneasy in his position and fled to Shanghai, residing at the Chen Family Beach in the Xiaocai Court on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, at the home of his relatives. After receiving a report, the General Patrol Room of the Public Concession sent Chinese and Western detectives to search Lu's hideout before dawn and arrested Lu Lu-chen, who was temporarily detained pending investigation.

### Zhang Hui-fang is Safe

Zhang Hui-fang, the commander of the People's Self-Defense Corps Guerrilla in the Chuansha border area of Pudong, has one of the strongest forces among the Chuansha guerrilla units. For a year, he has repeatedly fought against the Japanese army along the Shangchuan Railway, inflicting considerable blows. When the Japanese army advanced in force last month, his subordinates Yang Mei-ting and other major teams were once dispersed, but within a few days, they restored their original strongholds. Their actions are unpredictable, and the Japanese side hates them to the bone. Recently, Zhang took a boat to Shanghai on official business. Rumors suddenly spread that Zhang was shot and assassinated by thugs. According to news from Chuansha yesterday, the report of Zhang's assassination is not accurate. Zhang has safely returned to the defense area and was not discovered or injured during his journey.

### Sympathy

— A

"Sympathy" is a good-sounding noun.

However, in this century, "sympathy" should be deleted from the general dictionary. Because with the deletion of "sympathy," words such as "altruism," "humanity," and "mutual assistance" also seem to have no need to occupy a line in the dictionary. -- However, the word "mutual assistance" may sometimes have to be applied in the dictionary of murderers who slaughter humanity. But this is definitely not the "original meaning of mutual assistance" that can be related to "sympathy," etc.

From a historical point of view, there are many stories of giving clothing and food to the needy. Although it is impossible to determine the authenticity of these stories, passing them on to cultivate the "sympathy" of future generations is still slightly beneficial to the world and people's hearts.

However, in fact, the benefit of the dissemination of these stories to the world and people's hearts is also too small to mention. Ardent sympathy for refugees struggling on the line of death is certainly admirable, but the corruption case of selling refugee food has been exposed more than once or twice in the newspapers. Such "conscienceless" behavior is enough to make "sympathy" cry.

Recently, it is even more common to see those "philanthropists" sitting in cars and going to first-class restaurants to discuss the "righteous act" of rescuing refugees. And when the wine is drunk and the ears are hot, before the discussion is over, there are often people who recruit a few girls to drink, or recruit a few escorts to accompany them, to help the fun. And some gentlemen will actually inquire in detail about the life experiences of these fallen women, and reluctantly express sighing and sighing to show that they are full of sympathy. -- Although their eating, drinking, and playing are "undoubtedly out of their own pockets," it seems appropriate to transfer the funds for this eating, drinking, and playing to help the refugees, but the adults and gentlemen will not do it.

The business community promotes the one-hundredth-of-one promotion movement, but every small employee of every store is often struggling in the atmosphere of the terror of "layoffs." "If you lose your job, someone will save you." This is not humor, but somewhat serious. However, in fact, it is not entirely the case. Judging from the incidents of snatching wallets and demanding to eat Kung Si, although unemployed and unable to live, it is not easy to find sympathy without the performance of a tragic story.

The amount of the entertainment donation is surprisingly large. On the surface, the spirit of Shanghai people who "do not forget the refugees in entertainment" is worthy of praise. However, in this great era, they are still so drunk and dreamy. How can they show sympathy for the refugees on a small scale, and how can they show sympathy for the country and the nation on a large scale? The number of dedications that Shanghai people give to relief efforts, to the country, and to finding entertainment and stimulation each month should be listed and expressed statistically to test whether Shanghai people's sympathy is placed in refugees, the country, or selfish enjoyment.

The one-bowl-of-rice movement is the greatest expression of sympathy shown by mankind in the modern world, but on the one hand, the one-bowl-of-rice movement is promoted, and on the other hand, a large amount of military fire is sold to the aggressors to slaughter the people they sympathize with. This kind of sympathy is a bit ridiculously passive.

Once upon a time, there were ten rich men who saw the displaced girls as pitiful, so, based on human sympathy, they took them to their homes one by one to provide them with food and clothing. As a result, these girls all became the rich man's concubines. The modern so-called "sympathy," "altruism," at the lowest limit, there are always a few percent that are typical of this story, although their nature and method may be different.

Therefore, nouns such as "sympathy" should be deleted from the modern dictionary. At the very least, its original definition should be changed to make it more realistic.

### Sharpening the Knife

— Wu Yi

The night is desolate, and the night in a fallen homeland is even more desolate, as if it were dead. I gritted my teeth, enduring the chill from the northwest wind that crept through the window cracks, quietly holding the tattered quilt prepared for me by the nanny and panting.

In the darkness, I heard the long, mournful rhythm of the howling wind and ghostly cries. I saw the will-o'-the-wisps rising and falling among the rubble of the West Village. Ten thousand terrors assailed me. I vaguely felt as if I had stepped into a world of demons. It truly was a world of demons!

"Hu, hu, sha..." A resentful voice clearly came from the black beast squatting on the edge of West Village—the burnt-out empty thatched hut.

"There's a ghost!" I cried out in surprise, shrinking into the tattered cotton quilt.

"It's not a ghost," the nanny said, "but lately, these empty houses often make this kind of sound. The young men in the village were either killed or wounded when the Red Soldiers came; those who could escape have escaped. None of the old ones dare to go near to see what's going on!"

My fear turned to doubt, doubt to contemplation, and I began to seek a reasonable solution for the safety of the villagers. So, I first pretended to be fast asleep in silence, and then, while the nanny was dozing off and mumbling in her sleep, I slipped out through the wooden door.

After staggering drunkenly, stepping over rubble and debris, I was blown stiff by the piercing wind among the hemp stalks about thirty paces from that thatched hut. Here, my eardrums were excited by a clangorous sound, which had changed from 'sha-hu' to a clear ring. I realized it was the sound of sharpening a weapon.

"Stop!" someone shouted in front of me.

After my eyes were blurred by the flashing of an electric light, I managed to regain my composure and recognize the man pointing a pistol at my chest.

"Ah! Donglin, is that you? When did you come back?" The man suddenly lowered his gun, grabbed my hand, and shook it.

"Um, Jin of West Village, are you still..."

I recognized him as Jin of West Village, but West Village had been burned by the Red Soldiers, and Jin had disappeared long ago. Some people suspected he was dead. But wasn't it him standing in front of me now? And why was he holding a pistol, guarding the road at night?

"Donglin, don't be alarmed, it's me, A Jin, I'm still alive. Although the enemy burned my home, they didn't manage to kill my young life, leaving me the opportunity to wash away the blood debts in my life history."

He took a long, excited breath and continued,

"Lately, I no longer grieve over the destruction of my home. From it, I have gained a more precious treasure, and that is a broadsword on my back and this pistol. I believe they will carve out a treasure in my life—a flame in my heart."

As he spoke, he reached out and patted my shoulder warmly.

"I believe you, I completely believe you," I said, moved and ashamed.

Then, Jin told me that the ominous house on the edge of the village, which no one lived in, was now the dormitory for their squad. Not a dormitory, but a place for group work. During the day, they went to the brigade headquarters and the town where the enemy was stationed to gather information, and at night, they gathered and rested here. However, for the sake of prudence, their actions were still being kept secret for the time being.

Jin pulled me to go and see the thatched hut that was their office or resting place. Naturally, lacking practical work experience, I was very willing to go, especially as the friendship between young people attracted me.

When we walked into that thatched hut, under the faint, flickering candlelight, I saw faces shining one by one. They had all suffered the greatest hardships in the enemy's brutality, making them even more happy and satisfied with their current passionate work.

There were about ten of them in total, most of them rolling up their sleeves to reveal bulging muscles, sharpening their broadswords. "Sharpening the broadswords to kill the devils!" I felt as if I had just woken up from a dream.

It seemed that Jin was the leader of this squad. After he briefly introduced me, two men ran up and shook my hand tightly. They were childhood companions from West Village, who had graduated from the S Town junior high school. Now, we were partners on the same front. "Clang, clang, clang," the sound of sharpening broadswords resonated again in the small thatched hut. The sound was loud and clear, bursting forth powerfully from the owners who were barely suppressing it.

"Where did all these knives come from?" Most of them were taken from the bodies of those who had died earlier, and some were donated to the brigade by the people. As for the few firearms that were not enough to distribute, they were the rewards that the enemy presented for our hard work."

Then I understood the reason for their secret actions: it turned out that for the sake of the safety of the broadswords, there were indeed a shocking number of traitors in our country, no wonder they had to be extra cautious. Perhaps the reason why this team was temporarily putting off expanding its organization was right here.

"I'll help you sharpen one too." I also picked up a knife and squatted down next to a whetstone, and what I recalled was the feeling of sharpening grass knives as a child.

"Clang, clang, clang," the sound of sharpening knives in the house became louder, our combined sound drowning out the howling west wind outside.

In this way, I spent a night back in my hometown in a rush of enthusiasm. Looking back, there were a thousand kinds of sweetness and warmth in my throat. Then I suddenly realized that my hometown was still always in spring, growing in the breath of spring; although this growth was new, it was vastly different from the old, lingering life of the past.

### I Love the Firelight

— Luo Xi

I love how the wildfire can unleash ten thousand feet of light in the darkness, it can illuminate; who is the real human, who is the jackal in human form!

Although fire can burn down prosperous cities, although fire can burn down beautiful mountain villages; but this is the alternation of the new and the old, not a permanent disaster!

Man-eating jackals will run everywhere, and the light of wildfires will surge everywhere; no one has a place to escape, to hide!

On the burned ground, millions upon millions of oppressed children are singing in unison facing the soaring firelight;

"Only resistance, then liberation! Our will is a strong outpost; our fists are unparalleled knives and guns!"

Towards the ferocious jackals, millions upon millions of people have merged into a monstrous wave. They will crush the jackals beneath a mountain of bones, they will soak the dregs into an ocean formed of hot blood; after the wildfire subsides, they will build more prosperous cities on the land stained with blood and flesh; create more beautiful mountain villages!

Yes, I love the firelight!

### Half a Fried Dough Stick

— Yu Lin

Living the remaining days of Chu under the threats and surveillance of the fierce and barbaric enemy's guns, fists, and clubs. Life and death depend on their whim; pleading only invites a beating. The body is already exhausted, so forced to temporarily abandon danger, family affection, spousal love, and hope all together, and take a nap. But the brain cannot allow you to rest, scene after scene of past events are being replayed.

Ah! The school is closed, old friends, teachers, have gone inland, and several magazines have been suspended due to the war, and there are only a little over ten dollars left, what to do? I watched my wife with tears in her eyes, and our two children were still sharing a bag of thirty-wen fried soybeans to eat. My wife endured the pain, smiled through her tears, patted her pocket, and said forward, "What's the use of keeping the ring? Exchange it! Gold is very expensive, today I heard it's one hundred and fifty-four yuan, compare it, and you can still earn more than half!"

The end of the month came, the ring paid seventeen of the rent; the manuscript of forcibly collected information was mostly returned, and my wife said let's become refugees! Anyway, the Li family and the Zhang family are there, what's there to be embarrassed about, the long-term method is still this good. Alas! I thought in my heart; what can be done if you're afraid of embarrassment! With the introduction of a good friend, my wife's advice was realized. Again encountering unexpected uses, the money is almost spent.

Soybean rice, with a lot of gravel, the older child is slightly aware, with no vegetables, only eats a little less, the younger child cries and can't swallow, the wife has no choice but to take out a fen, to buy a fried dough stick, store half of it, for the evening meal, cut half of it, into small pieces, mixed with soy sauce, soaked in boiled water, pick out the beans from the rice, one spoonful, one bean, feeding the younger child, saying, "Dad will get paid a few days later, buy half a catty of fried soybeans, you and your brother can eat for another week." After eating, a few spoonfuls of leftover food, the wife said to me: "Er Liang is not full, you can have some more, the soup may have a strange taste too."

The wife gave me the rice, and ate it with the soup, the oil flower "dough stick" crumbs, indeed have a different aroma! In the end, unable to bear to eat it alone, left two spoonfuls to feed the wife, the wife refused, the two played around, looked at each other, after a while tears each fell, the remaining food could not be swallowed!

Waking up in surprise, tears soaking the tattered quilt, neck hurting, regretting very much thinking to say: "What's the benefit of sadness? Only harms the body!" Turning over and over to fall asleep.

The environment is at Jiaotong University in West Shanghai, the refugees are more than fifteen thousand people, the rice cannot be cooked because the new pot has not arrived; having no choice but to buy as many pancakes as possible, five hundred workers, listen to my instructions, to distribute the pancakes to the brethren; one hundred staff, gather at the general office, under my control, cooperate and divide the work.

The time to eat has come, I said to everyone; "I'm very sorry, the new pot has not been bought, the rice cannot be cooked, the director said each person eats a bowl of noodles, and gets a fried dough stick."

Everyone ate noodles and bit into the fried dough stick, I said the noodles are already very delicious, the fried dough stick seems unnecessary, so I kept the fried dough stick, and gave it to a worker to take to my wife.

Late at night, after finishing the official business, returning to the wife's room, the wife asked me if I had eaten the evening meal, I said I had already eaten, the wife said: "We have already eaten the pancakes, the fried dough stick just now, I prepared it for you to eat with the pancakes when you came back, so I left half of it for you to eat. Fried dough sticks don't taste good overnight, let's share it!"

So, half a fried dough stick, half for each person, because full, not wanting to eat much, the wife also said: "Eating it like this for nothing now, thinking about the past troubles of having no vegetables to go with the soybean rice is sad enough!"

The dream woke up again, biting in the mouth there was no fried dough stick, not having had rice for three days, belly hungry, thinking of fried dough stick, even harder to endure.

### Ballad of the Blind Man

— Sha Long

Who has ever appreciated my fingers plucking mournful sounds on the strings,

And who has ever appreciated my mournful sounds and granted me compassion?

The world is so cruel,

Where can I find my comfort,

To caress my wounded soul?

Who has a mouth to tell of my bumpy life?

Who has a heart to understand my unspoken feelings?

Like a crow perched on a withered branch in the depths of winter,

East, west, south, north, I have lost all reliance!

A blind man living in the world is the most unfortunate,

Just because I am blind, I can’t die!

No, I will pluck the strings of the instrument endlessly,

To pour out injustice for the unfortunate.

### Securities and Government Bonds Experienced Two Fluctuations; Few New Transactions; Limited Changes in Foreign Debt

The unofficial market for securities experienced significant fluctuations yesterday, with market prices changing by as much as one yuan in either direction in an instant. This is unusual given the narrow scope of the spot market. Although prices generally declined from their highs, careful observation reveals no connection to the broader environment, with fluctuations driven entirely by speculative activity. Sellers were primarily long positions exiting the market, while buyers were short positions covering their positions. New transaction volume was limited, with more buying than selling. Given the current environment of controlled gold, abundant speculative capital, and increasingly concrete calls for international sanctions, government bonds enjoy excellent protection, and their future prices are therefore likely to rise. These temporary fluctuations are insignificant. Demand from small investors was strongest at the opening of the morning session, with Class A bonds reaching a new high of $63.60. Other bonds also stood at their previous day's peak. Following sales of the 11th and Xie Da bonds, long positions temporarily withdrew, and prices fell by six or seven cents. The 11th bonds then resumed buying. The Lian He bonds and small investors traded frequently, and prices rose again, nearly matching the morning's high. Later, the Tong Kang bonds and small investors sold at the high, and prices fell again. Class C and Class E bonds experienced the greatest price differences. Trading was active and lively, and the future appears promising. In the end, Class A bonds rose by 1.5 cents, while other bonds rose by 0.1 to 0.3 cents. Total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A summary table is provided below:

| Bond Type | High     | Low     | Closing    | Change from Previous Day |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Class A  | $63.60  | $63.30  | $63.50  | Up $0.15                 |
| Class B  | $56.80  | $56.10  | $56.20  | Down $0.10               |
| Class C  | $55.35  | $54.30  | $54.50  | Up $0.20                 |
| Class D  | $54.10  | $53.50  | $54.50  | Up $0.20                 |
| Class E  | $54.30  | $53.40  | $53.40  | Up $0.30                 |
| 96 Bonds | $7.15   | $7.00   | $7.00   | Up $0.10                 |

There were no transactions in stock market. Buyers of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange shares were offering 26 yuan, but there were still no sellers on the market.

London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listed prices on the 9th of this month (Monday) changed very little. Only the Hukwang Railway bond, without the German-issued coupon, rose one pound to 24 pounds. In addition, the Crisp bond fell half a pound to 36.5 pounds. Both returned to their prices from the previous week. In yesterday's market, the Longhai Railway bond was traded, with a transaction price of 13 pounds, which was one pound lower than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the Sino-French US dollar bond with the coupon was transacted (i.e., US$10,000) at a price of 77 pounds, which was one pound higher than the market. The supply of physical bonds was limited to the railway bonds, including 2,000 pounds of the non-winning tickets of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond, priced at 25 pounds, and 1,000 pounds of the winning tickets, priced at 24.5 pounds, which was one pound and half a pound higher than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the Hukwang Railway bond without the German-issued coupon was priced at 25 pounds, which was one pound higher than the market. In addition, 2,500 pounds of the winning tickets was priced at 23 pounds and 15 shillings, which was slightly lower than the market by five shillings. The market price of the British Gold Rehabilitation Bond was 40 pounds for the German-issued coupon and 48 pounds for the German-issued coupon. However, buyers were offering 48 pounds and 5 shillings to purchase it.

### Yarn and Cotton: A Tempestuous Situation; Cotton Yarn Experiences Sharp Rises and Falls; Early Morning, the Financial Community Collected and People's Hearts Were Boisterous; Afterwards, Due to Speculators Closing Positions, a Decline Began Suddenly

After rising for five consecutive days, the yarn market suddenly exhibited a pattern of rapid advances and retreats yesterday. The market opened with strong gains, and the financial community dragged in 100 bales of Double Horse 20s cotton yarn at 402 yuan per piece, breaking through the big mark. Special Golden City 20s cotton yarn shot to 408 yuan. At this time, the market was full of excitement. Unexpectedly, due to the excessive price increase, buyers were hesitant, and a reaction began to occur. As general speculators who had profited saw that the rising trend had weakened, they rushed to release their positions, and the market suddenly changed, with a decline beginning suddenly. Prices fell across the board. Double Horse 20s closed at 391 yuan, a fall of 12 yuan compared to the opening price. This decline was within expectations and was not surprising. Since the market opened on a positive note, Double Horse 20s cotton yarn, compared to the year-end price last year, had already risen by 44 yuan. A decline of 20 yuan cannot be said to be too much, as it is the result of consecutive days of rapid gains. The morning market saw a continuation of the previous day's momentum, with a certain bank again buying, leading to a sharp rise. Opening prices were increased by as much as 7 or 8 yuan. Subsequently, demand from actual users was slightly sluggish due to the high prices, and at the same time, long positions exited the market, resulting in a sudden decline. However, the market recovered slightly at the close. Generally speaking, advances and retreats depend on actual consumption. The total trading volume in the morning was 1,025 bales, with fellow traders accounting for about half of the volume. The closing price of Double Horse 20s cotton yarn fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe fell by 1 yuan, Special Golden City and Heavenly Girl fell by 2 yuan, while 16s and 10s cotton yarn remained relatively flat. Factories remained quiet. Exports totaled 310 pieces, which were shipped to Shantou, and 5 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The volume purchased by each group is recorded below:

| Group         | Volume | Group     | Volume |
| ------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| Fellow Traders | 655    | Wenzhou  | 105    |
| Shantou       | 130    | Yunnan    | 110    |
| Sichuan      | 30     | Ningbo    | 5      |
| Total         | 1,025  |          |        |

The Japanese yarn market was affected by the sharp rise in Chinese yarn, and prices rose by 3 to 4 yuan. However, as Chinese yarn retreated, Japanese yarn also tracked the decline. The closing price of Mizuyoshi 20s spot was 313 yuan, the initial traded price was 317.5 yuan. The current yarn price for Blue Phoenix 20s was 314.5 yuan, and then re-traded at 310 yuan.

### High Prices for "Ignition Flower" Cotton Appear Endlessly; 67 Yuan Exchange Rate; Foreign Cotton Transactions Remain Lively

The cotton business has turned quieter, and the demand for fine cotton has become increasingly scarce. The translated price of foreign cotton has not only failed to rise but has weakened. The American and Indian cotton markets remained dull yesterday, and Japanese factories were very reluctant to purchase. It is because the purchase price of foreign cotton is low, and the quota can be large. Therefore, in recent days, the amount of foreign cotton ordered by Chinese and Japanese factories has been increasing day by day. The transaction of raw materials for 32-count fine yarn is as rare as a phoenix feather. As for the Chinese factories' willingness to adopt foreign cotton is extremely unwilling, but in this environment, it is also necessary to purchase and remedy.

The foreign cotton market, the New York market, due to the uncertainty of Washington news, all industries are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, due to the fall in securities prices, the selling of foreign cotton merchants and the closing of long positions, the price showed a tired phase. As a result, the price of American cotton rose by 12 pounds of sound, and the Indian cotton was predicted to be not much different. Egyptian cotton fell sharply by more than 40 pounds of sound. Yesterday's exchange rate was flat, and the legal currency of American cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton all fell by six or seven cents per load, while Egyptian cotton fell sharply by more than three yuan per load. Although foreign cotton transactions in this city are still lively, they are not as prosperous as the previous days. Yesterday, the selling price of "Ignition Flower" cotton was 67 yuan, equivalent to 64 yuan in cash. The quality of Indian cotton Pingguoer is better than "Ignition Flower," and there is a water foot rebate of about 50 cents per load that can be returned in the future. This kind of Indian cotton has been traded in large quantities on the market, and the cost to the factory is only 61 or 2 yuan. Therefore, the future of "Ignition Flower" and Yao Flower is very bleak. The situation of Tongzhou American cotton is even more difficult. The amount of transactions and the current goods are listed below:

The British-owned Jardine Matheson, Yixie, Yangshupu, and Three Factories opened a total of only 600 bales of 32-count Samsung, 20-count Shepherd, 20-count Samsung, and 6-count Rouge Tiger yarns. The quantity is very fresh, and all will be cleared in the first month.

There is no way but to resist the white-bagged flower in a certain sphere of influence with no appropriate method of resistance, the selling price continued to grow increasing, recent "Ignition Flower" cotton new highs need to be taken over by most of the Chinese factories, and the trading house absorption is also not bad, and the source from Subei has been called not thin, and the Tongzhou flower cotton had 1,789 bales, no opened price has been heard, and the Fu Nian Tuo Port came with 229 pieces, and Bei Sha came with 40 pieces. Yesterday's exported cotton was 140 pieces transported to Hong Kong. The current transaction quantity of cotton and the market conditions are listed on the left.

### Finance: Chinese and Westerners Compete to Settle Foreign Exchange; British and American Exchange Rates Have Shown a Decline; The US Dollar is Softer than the British

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the Mobil Oil company, foreign firm and yarn and cotton merchants competing to settle their accounts, coupled with a light selling attitude from banks, causing the situation to tighten slightly. However, after settling, the US dollar was softer than the British pound, which was due to a decline in the British pound's appreciation rate. Hong Kong telegrams were settled after an initial surge, while Sassoon and the money exchange industry had selling intentions. There were no special changes on the day, and transactions were quite lively.

In the early morning, the London major and New York prices were unchanged, the London raw gold also fell by 2 bits, the exchange rate of British pound to US dollar was small 3 li 8, to French franc was down 25 cents, and to Shanghai was flat; US dollar to British pound was reduced by 1 point, to French franc down 25 cents, to Shanghai up 1 cent. The central listing of various foreign exchange were stagnant as before. Banks opened early, the spot selling price for British exchange was 8 bits 484375, and the US exchange was 16 and a half yuan, compared to the previous close, the British was flat and the US was tight 03125. After opening, due to Hong Kong telegram settling, the British gold was 8 bits 46875, which caused a settling wind, and the banks were unable to supply, causing the situation to soften. The HSBC listed price and the silver balance tax announcement did not move. Thereafter, foreign firms and British and American tobacco companies suddenly surged in settling payments, and the banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market situation became tighter. The British gold was 8 bits 4375, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 40625. At noon, there were few transactions, only the money exchange industry repeatedly threw Hong Kong exchange without end, so the situation was slightly flat, the Hong Kong exchange hardened to 57 yuan 125. The noon closing price for British gold was 8 bits 46875, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 46875, (a certain bank had selling intention at 6 and a half yuan).

In the afternoon, the yarn and cotton merchants and foreign firms continued to absorb, and the bank's selling appetite remained light, causing the situation to tighten again. The British gold was 8 bits 46875, and it was once difficult to settle, softening to the interbank price. Later, because Hong Kong telegrams and Western merchant Sassoon and others suddenly turned eager to sell, and because the bank's absorption appetite was not good, the supply situation gradually became prosperous, and the money exchange industry came to spit out Hong Kong exchange again, so the process became cow-like, and the Hong Kong exchange once again hardened to 57 yuan 125, and then returned to 57 yuan. The evening closing selling price for British exchange was 8 bits 46875, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 46875, which was the same as the noon closing price. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British was tight 015625 and the US was soft 0625. The day's trading is recorded below.

### With a Large Number of Guest Merchants Searching for Purchases, Refined Bare Gold Rises Again

Yesterday's cash refined bare unofficial market conditions, the range of change is increasingly narrow, with only a four-yuan difference throughout the day, but in the middle, a certain money exchange industry once bought a large number of gods on behalf of the guest merchants. Fortunately, the silver building help's supply intention was still good, resulting in fresh changes, but the price ultimately became slightly stronger due to the softening of foreign exchange. Transactions were still prosperous in the early morning, but later, most showed a wait-and-see attitude, and then turned weak.

### Cash Transfers to Rise Four Yuan

Since the early morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening due to a certain money exchange industry's intention to enter was quite strong, so the morning opening was immediately picked up to 1,988 yuan, and then a certain money exchange industry entered gold number one hundred taels, since then the silver building help's selling intention was also strong, resulting in a downturn, the silver building help sold to a certain money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan, (I heard that most of it was on behalf of the South China guest merchants) not long after the gold number vomited, suddenly came to re-enter fifty taels, price eighty-five yuan, all supplied by the silver building help, during which foreign exchange was slightly soft, so it repeated rising, the silver building help sold to the money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan, the gold number also came to re-enter the silver building help fifty taels, price eighty-six yuan five corners, and the money exchange industry fifty taels, price eighty-seven yuan, and finally the money exchange industry sold to the silver building help fifty taels, price eighty-eight yuan, for the noon closing price, in the afternoon the foreign exchange was stagnant and constant, so the market situation was idle, so few opened transactions were made, and until four o'clock there were still no trades, so the evening closing price was still made at 1,989 yuan, which was four yuan higher than the previous day, the cash number's own brand gold selling price was 1,995 yuan, and the receiving price was 1,980 yuan, and the current marked gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold.

### Ornament Gold Returns to Rise One Yuan

The silver building's jewelry gold was initially not changed for each ounce until noon, due to the firmness of the refined, so the consensus was to hang a big yuan, Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others hung 202 yuan, Xin Tong Hang county 200 yuan, and the receiving was 194 yuan.

### Gold Price Decline Gradually Slows

London, 9th - The decline in the price of English pure gold has slowed, mainly due to the strengthening and subsequent weakening of the English exchange rate. The price continued to fall by two pence per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 7 and a half pence. The central bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold (i.e., cash) also fell to 1,213 yuan and 3 jiao. The customs gold price also continued to fall by 5 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also continued to decrease by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, totaling 1,208 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Demand Still Drives Japanese Gold Note Prices

Yesterday, the price of English pure gold continued to fall by two pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies fell back by one cent. The supply of foreign exchange was not strong, demand was slightly weak, and the trend was weak. There was considerable eagerness to acquire silver ingots. Retail investors continued to actively participate, the process was stable, and the market was slightly brisk. Foreign currencies experienced slight fluctuations. The demand for Japanese gold notes was strong, and the market price soared. There were few transactions in the association. Only Qin Tai issued 200 yuan of American gold notes to Hui Tong, and 500 yuan of American gold notes to Hong Chang. Yesterday's market prices were: English gold pounds decreased by 2 jiao, English gold notes decreased by 1 fen, American gold notes increased by 2 fen and 3 li, Hong Kong notes increased by 3 li, Canadian notes increased by 2 fen, Philippine notes increased by 2 fen, German gold notes decreased by 1 jiao, Korean notes increased by 1 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Chaozhou Gold Hooks Market Momentum Revives

The previous batch of Chaozhou Jiazi gold hooks has already sold out. It is reported that over 20 more pieces have recently arrived, with bright colors and considered suitable for sale. Sales have already begun at a price of 95 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than the previous market price. According to news from the production area, this year's output is relatively small, and costs have increased, so the market momentum is stable.

### Sugar Market - Jian Rock Sugar is Coming Soon

Yesterday the sugar market trend was stable. The association's quoted price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 24 yuan and 5 jiao, with no change. Transshipment cargo was quoted at 16 yuan and 2 and a half jiao, down by 2 and a half fen. Taikoo refined white sugar was also slightly soft, with spot prices quoted at 23 yuan and 9 jiao. The new Chaozhou Qing sugar from the national sugar Chaozhou gang, due to higher costs, is not suitable for local sales and may be transferred to Ningbo for sale.

### North-South Goods - Lake Lotus Arrives Continuously - Asking Price Increased by 10 Yuan, No Transaction

Previously, due to the shortage of Chaozhou lotus seeds, the market price had reached 30 yuan, but it quickly sold out. Yesterday, according to market sources, a new batch has arrived. Due to higher costs and increased freight charges, the cargo owners were reluctant to sell immediately, asking for 40 yuan. It is said that a deal might be possible at 35 yuan.

### Grain - Japanese Merchants Massively Purchase Changshu Rice - 60,000 Bags Exported from Hupu - Shanghai Rice Source Causes Concern

Although the source of national rice has been abundant recently, it has been heard that Japanese are actively purchasing in areas such as Changshu and Wuxi in the interior, reaching over 100,000 bags. Yesterday, 60,000 bags were loaded onto the Renhe ship and exported from Hupu. If this situation continues, it will inevitably affect the source of grain for Shanghai. Yesterday, only six or seven ships of Hetian goods arrived in port, with over 10,000 bags of chelun baozi. Sales slowed down, and the local market was inactive. Stockpilers took the opportunity to flood the market, so the situation was initially chaotic and then weakened. As a result, thick japonica rice decreased by several fen to one jiao, and thin indica rice also struggled to maintain its position, following the decline by several fen. Duyang Jian and Bu Jian all showed softness, with the original price being high. Stockpilers released their holdings, but sales were sluggish, and the price fell by one jiao.

### Flour Sales Begin - Wheat Price Stabilizes

Yesterday, the spot flour market remained stable, but retail sales were slightly more active than before. Retail sales of Beiyang gang Qinhuangdao and Tianjin gang were not weak. Purchases from areas such as Shantou in the Nanyang gang also showed vitality. In the overall market, No. 2 flour was still the most traded. The current inventory of No. 3 and lower grades of flour is scarce, and factories are not supplying them, so transactions have also stagnated. In total, about 40,000 bags of Che Chuan brand, Tianzhu, and Yu flour were sold. Apart from the 8,000 to 9,000 bags for local retail sales, the rest was handled equally by the North and South gangs. The prices of all goods were consistently stable. Today, 2,000 bags of spot flour will be shipped to Shantou.

Yesterday's wheat market also turned stable. Regarding the source, several batches of new Jiangbei Puzhen and Yangzhou goods arrived, but the quantity was still limited. Since the Jiangsu provincial government banned exports from the Subei area, the arrival of goods has been hindered. Even in other guerrilla areas, transportation is difficult, so it is not easy for goods to flood the market. Cargo owners were quite firm on their selling prices, but factories disliked the high prices, so purchases were sharply reduced. Only 6,000 bags were sold in the overall market, handled equally by Fuxin and Fufeng factories. The highest price remained at 6 yuan and 7 jiao, and the market has stabilized. Yesterday, 2,600 bags of spot wheat arrived from Xingang.

### Ke Xian Rice Falls Back, Foreign Rice Remains Stable, Yuan Bao Stock Still Priced at 13 Yuan

After several days of market price increases for Ke Xian rice, the source from Che Chuan has increased. Yesterday, 1,200 bags were shipped from Hupu, and even the special high-grade Nanjing Xian rice, considered a rare commodity, was transported to Shanghai, and the market immediately turned weak. The Wuhu Xian inventory was originally sufficient, and the floating goods arriving in port continuously sought to be sold urgently. Yesterday, the overall market price dropped by a small amount, from four to five fen to nearly a jiao.

Foreign Rice

The local market sales were slightly more active, with a few hundred bags of Saigon rice being traded at around 14 yuan and 5 fen. The price, including fees and commissions, for delivery was still around 14 yuan and 3 jiao. This price is not significantly different from the selling price a month ago. As the inventory of foreign rice is low and arrivals are scarce, cargo owners are unwilling to depreciate and sell at a loss again, so they firmly maintain the original price and do not follow the same trend as the local Ke Xian rice. As for the Yuan Bao stock stored in the concession, 300 bags were traded yesterday, still at the original price of 13 yuan, but the bags were full weight, with each bag weighing 185 jin.

### Piece Goods - Sichuan and Yunnan Sales Active - Colored Cloth Supply Falls Short of Demand - Singapore and Siam Purchase Actively - Eastern Cloth Sales Slow, White Cloth Prices Soften

National Cloth

The market has been rising too rapidly in recent days, causing instability in people's minds. Yesterday, the yarn market fell back, and sellers suddenly increased, causing great confusion in the market, with differences as large as two or three jiao. The selling prices of most colored cloth and printed goods were similar to the previous day. The coarse cloth market has been the most stable recently. The prices of other cloths have already risen. The prices of fine cloth and fine twill have risen by about one yuan compared to the end of last month, while the prices of most coarse cloths remain at the original prices. Yesterday, the goods of Yih Ho were slightly tight, and there were still transactions at the original prices. Hand-sewn goods increased by five fen to one jiao. The local and Ning Shao Wen gangs purchased over 300 packages. Fine cloth and fine twill were priced too high, and the customer gangs gradually purchased cheap goods, which needed to be digested. Dyed cloth was cheaper than white cloth, so the customer gangs chose to purchase cheaper goods, and new transactions were quite sporadic. The supply of colored cloth was still short of demand. There were also large orders for white cloth from Chinese factories. The Shantou gang purchased dyed cloths such as Guang Xie, Se Xie, Blue Cloth, and Standard Cloth, totaling 300 boxes. The Chongqing gang had not purchased for a long time. Now that transportation in Sichuan and Yunnan is fast and convenient, they added purchases of colored cloth, colored Xie, bleached cloth, and bleached Xie, totaling over 2,000 pieces. The Kunming and Chengdu purchases also began, with continued purchases of colored cloth, colored Xie, bleached cloth, and printed goods, totaling over 3,000 pieces. White cloth, fine cloth, fine Xie, and fine twill were also continuously shipped out. The Gan gang transported goods from Ou, including fine cloth, bleached cloth, striped Xie, and fine Xie, totaling over 50 pieces. For foreign countries, Singapore purchased 50 to 60 boxes of Lun Chang printed cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth from various factories.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday, actual sales slowed down, and the price of white cloth suddenly softened. Fine cloth and fine twill uniformly fell. Fine cloth was severely affected by the dumping of goods by fellow merchants in the market, with prices falling by about one jiao and a half per piece. However, the market prices remained firm and did not loosen, so no one inquired about them. The trading volume of spot goods outside the market was less than 1,000 pieces, all of which were transferred to local merchants and colored cloth shops for dyeing and sales. The prices of coarse cloth were relatively firm, with 13.5-pound Niutou selling for 11 yuan and 2 and a half jiao per piece. The customer sales of Four Gentlemen Serge and Zhigong were still strong, and the market prices slightly increased, opening at 3 jiao and 9 fen per yard, an increase of 5 li compared to last week.

Exports

The cloth exports today totaled 225 pieces, shipped to Shantou, and another five pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea - Japan Dumps Chinese Silk in France Again - Causing Local Factories Not to Insist - Instead Hoping Silk Market Falls to Lower Cocoon Prices

Yesterday, the foreign silk markets, as reported by Japanese and American newspapers, continued to fall, with only Lyon Shanghai Silk A grade and Guangdong silk showing a slight increase. Therefore, the market in this port was quiet for the American market and there were slight inquiries for the French market. Market forecasts suggest there may be further declines, so manufacturers' price holdings have loosened. It is heard that Bai Factory 78 points has entered the 1,290 yuan level, and the RR character is sold for 1,250 yuan, which is considered a good price. According to industry insiders, the New York market is reacting due to excessive inventory, and the French market has discovered that the Japanese are dumping Chinese silk, so manufacturers in Shanghai are afraid to insist again. At the same time, the price of cocoons in this port has risen too sharply, with native species priced at 220-230 yuan. Therefore, most silk manufacturers hope that silk prices will fall to suppress the cocoon market, so the silk market may continue to decline. Yesterday, twenty-five pieces of silk were shipped to Haiphong. Sichuan angelica has demand in various places, and there are many channels to Shantou and Hong Kong. Recently, the bottom inventory here has become thin, and news from Sichuan says that this year's production is not high. The previous market price was 450 yuan per dan, and now it is tightly priced at 500 yuan. If the subsequent goods do not follow, the upward trend is imaginable.

### Coal - Yuanshan Bituminous Coal - Price Reduction Sales

Although a large batch of bituminous coal has arrived in port recently to meet the market demand, due to high costs, sellers are unwilling to depreciate and sell at a loss, resulting in few transactions. On the contrary, Zhongjue goods are cheaper and have more active sales. Recently, a certain foreign firm has obtained Yuanshan coal, stored it in Pudong warehouses, and entrusted a certain firm to manage and sell it at reduced prices. The overall coal price is only 33 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 30 yuan. Loading from the warehouse and barging are extra.

(Chongqing Communication) The Ministry of Education has already issued travel expenses to the first batch of students above the specialized school level in the war zone who have passed the registration and allocated them to various schools to study.

All those who go to register should submit supporting documents. After passing the review, they can receive travel expenses and go to designated schools to study.

### Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education - Recent Educational Administrative Measures (Continued) - Compiling Educational Expenditure Budgets and Inspecting Schools in Various Counties - Promoting Education in Guerrilla Areas and Restoring Free Education

(4) Approving the Educational Expenditure Budget for Northern Jiangsu. Before the start of the 27th year, the war in Northern Jiangsu was tense. The compilation of the educational expenditure budget and administrative plan for this year in various counties was not carried out according to the plan. Later, as the war situation improved, it was ordered to be carried out. Since the year had already begun, the budget was yet to be established, and the plan should be confirmed. After urging subordinates to speed up the review, all educational expenditure budgets and administrative plans for the period from July to December of the 27th year in various counties in Northern Jiangsu have been successively approved and amended, and orders have been issued to comply with them.

(5) Formulating Standards for Compiling Educational Expenditure Budgets for Various Counties

The accounting year, as ordered, will start with the calendar year from January of the 28th year, and the 18th year will begin in the blink of an eye. Standards for compiling educational expenditure budgets for various counties urgently need to be formulated and promulgated. After consulting with the Department of Finance, and according to the general situation of educational expenditure income in various counties in Northern Jiangsu, the "Points to Note for Various Counties in Compiling the Educational Expenditure Budget for the 28th Year" were formulated and promulgated to various counties, ordering them to compile and submit the educational expenditure budget for the 28th year within the time limit for approval and implementation by the provincial department.

(6) Promoting Educational Undertakings in Various Counties in Guerrilla Areas

The county governments in the guerrilla areas have been established one after another, and local education urgently needs to be reorganized and restored to maintain public morale and cultivate the strength to resist Japan and build the country. In consideration of the actual situation in various counties, three types of plans were formulated: "Jiangsu Province's Plan for Reorganizing Education in Fallen Counties," "Jiangsu Province's Provisional Measures for Restoring Primary Schools at All Levels in Fallen Counties," and "Jiangsu Province's Provisional Measures for Establishing Private Schools in Townships in Fallen Counties," as the guideline for promoting educational undertakings in fallen counties. Efforts should be made to restore local educational administrative institutions in fallen counties, and schools at all levels should be able to continue classes. If schools cannot be fully restored for a while due to funding reasons, and in places where it is not convenient to establish schools openly, private schools are specially allowed to be established to secretly implement education for resisting Japan and building the country. This plan and measures have been approved by the provincial government committee and ordered to be implemented.

(7) Reorganizing Public and Private Schools in the Province That Have Resumed Classes on Their Own

There are many provincial secondary schools and private secondary schools that have been registered and have moved to Shanghai or other locations to resume classes on their own after the outbreak of the war. There are also many private secondary schools from other provinces and cities that have moved to various counties in this province to resume classes, as well as newly established private secondary schools. For the sake of unified management, the Department of Education has specially formulated "Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Provisional Measures for Managing Provincial Secondary Schools That Have Resumed Classes on Their Own" and "Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Provisional Measures for Managing Wartime Private Secondary Schools," which were submitted to the Provincial Government's Council for approval and reported to the Ministry of Education for record. These measures have been communicated to the provincial schools and private secondary schools that have resumed classes for compliance.

(8) Planning to Restore Free Education in Various Counties

Promoting compulsory education is the most important basic work for various counties during the period of resistance against Japan. The compulsory classes in various counties in Jiangsu Province were inevitably slightly affected because the central government stopped subsidizing funds. The Department of Education has specially drafted the "Jiangsu Province's Measures for Restoring Compulsory Education in Various Counties in the 28th Year," which was submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval, and requested the Ministry of Education to continue to allocate funds for subsidies, so that free education in this province can be promoted as usual and eliminate illiteracy throughout the province. The Department of Education is also conducting a detailed investigation of the situation of promoting free education in the 24th, 25th, and 26th years in various counties, the number of compulsory classes set up each year, the provincial funding of county-raised funds, and the monthly subsidies.

(9) Enriching the Scientific Equipment of Various Secondary Schools

The temporary middle schools and normal schools established by the Department of Education have very simple equipment due to funding reasons. In order to enrich the content of each school and facilitate teaching, the original provincial school custodians are ordered to prepare a list of books, instruments, chemical supplies, and sports equipment in the school and report it to the Department of Education, which will then allocate them to various provincial temporary secondary schools for application.

(10) Urging Primary and Secondary Schools to Implement Wartime Curriculum

The Department of Education, at this time of resisting Japan and building the country, urges provincial schools and primary and secondary schools in various counties to actively promote wartime education and cultivate the strength to resist Japan and build the country. In addition to formulating the "General Rules for the Organization of Subject Teaching Material Research Associations in Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools" and issuing them to provincial secondary schools for compliance and active research, and collecting subject teaching materials for resisting Japan and building the country for submission to the Department for review and adoption, it also issued the "Implementation Measures for Wartime Special Education in Primary and Secondary Schools" to primary and secondary schools in various counties for reference and implementation, and to earnestly promote education for resisting Japan and building the country.

(11) Clearing Provincial and County Educational Expenditure Assets

The Ministry of Education issued an order to promulgate a method for clearing educational deposits in provinces and cities in the war zone, ordering the establishment of a clearing committee to clear the deposits of educational institutions in the war zone. "Two Types of Measures for Clearing Educational Expenditure Assets in Jiangsu Province at the Provincial and County Levels" and "Budget of the Clearing Committee for Educational Expenditure Assets in Jiangsu Province at the Provincial and County Levels" were drafted, which were approved by the Provincial Government Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. According to these measures, in addition to establishing a clearing committee at the Huaiyin Department of Education, offices will also be set up in Shanghai and Chongqing to facilitate clearing nearby.

(12) Reorganizing Educational Laws and Regulations in this Province

Educational laws and regulations in Jiangsu Province have not been reorganized for many years. The editorial office was specially dispatched to collect various educational laws and regulations promulgated in Jiangsu Province in the past, and to reorganize those that are currently applicable. It also collected various wartime laws and regulations newly promulgated by the Ministry of Education and compiled them together with the new laws and regulations promulgated by the Department of Education. This work has now been completed, and after it is printed, it will be distributed to the competent personnel of educational institutions throughout the province for compliance and implementation.

### School Overview: Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School

Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School was founded in the spring of five years ago. At that time, although there were many girls' middle schools in the western part of Shanghai, there were very few schools that were well-managed and excellent in both management and education, except for a few established by churches and foreigners. Ms. Chen Naiwen, who had long served in various universities and famous girls' middle schools in Shanghai, saw that the right to girls' education had long been manipulated by foreigners, so she invested in founding a girls' middle school on Avenue Edward VII and Seymour Road, named Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School. The name Zhi Zhong means that everyone can manage their own inner self and achieve the effect of being beautiful on the outside and wise on the inside. After one year, the results were remarkable, and the Municipal Education Bureau specially approved the registration. Since then, the number of students has increased day by day, and the original school site was insufficient, so it was moved to the current address at No. 186 Nanyang Road. This place has the advantage of a garden and is quiet in the midst of the bustling city, making it an ideal place for both studying and resting.

The school is divided into junior and senior high school departments. The senior high school is further divided into business and general subjects, with a total of nine grades and more than 200 students. The faculty members, such as Jiang Zaihua, Zhang Zhongying, Yang Zhenou, Chen Qiuyi, Xia Jinhui, Bao Guanying, Qian Zhaolong, Wang Jialing, Zhu Baoyuan, Wu Shusheng, Yang Mingde, and Li Ruihua, are all scholars with rich knowledge and extensive experience. Therefore, graduates from each session can directly enter famous universities such as Soochow, Yuling, and Shanghai Baptist University. The students studying at the school are also diligent and conscientious because the school values strict education and to avoid being forced to withdraw from school for failing three subjects.

Student extracurricular activities are mostly focused on literature and art. There are the Zhong Sheng Monthly Society and the Shen Sheng Drama Society. The "Artist" and "Peerless Sister", which won the approval of most audiences at the Lyceum Theatre before, were performed by the society. Their literary and artistic cultivation is not accidental.

The school has always valued practicality and does not engage in ostentation. Therefore, although the school has been around for five years, people in the community may not know about it, because the school is buried in hard work and has no time to promote itself extensively. This reporter learned about its past and present situation as above through a detailed conversation with the principal of the school.

Spring and Autumn

### Death

— Geng

Death is the most painful and the most difficult to attain. Therefore, people generally have concepts of death that are either curses or praises.

Death is most painful, which is objective. "Living people parting from the dead is a hatred that cannot be discussed." In other words, only the living can feel the pain of death. Death is most difficult to attain, which is subjective. Everyone is afraid of death, but if you can abandon everything and bravely rush to death, it is difficult to attain. Therefore, death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai. To die when one should not die, or to die when it is not necessary to die, is lighter than a feather; to die when one should die, or to dare to die when one must die, is heavier than Mount Tai. The former's death, because the death is not in the right place, not only cannot gain the sympathy of society, but on the contrary, because it leaves a bad impression, it will also be唾罵ed by society. The latter's death, because he died in the right place, gives people a loyal and chaste story that can be emulated by those who die later, so it is worthy of praise.

In the torrent of resistance against Japan, there are too many stories of death! The soldiers in the front, for the nation, for the country, for justice, died in the thousands and tens of thousands before the god of war. They are the death warriors of the Republic of China and the pioneers of justice and reason. History will not fail to solemnly record their heroic achievements of sacrifice and their spirit of regarding death as home; this will be put aside for now. In the occupied areas, there are also many stories of willing self-sacrifice and scandals of corpses lying in the streets; these many deaths not only have differences in lightness and weight, but also have differences in obedience and resistance.

According to a correspondent from Taixian in this newspaper, Zhenjiang educator Hui Ren was the director of the Dantu County Encouragement of Learning Institute, and Xu Shizhu was the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau. He was from Dagang Township in Zhenjiang and was praised by the township party and society for his morality and writing. Recently, because his nephew Xu X joined the enemy in the township, he strongly advised him to leave, but he refused. Considering it a great shame and humiliation, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the river in Xinzhou a few days ago to serve his country. Those who are willing to be traitors should be ashamed to death. It is said that Xu X felt quite remorseful after hearing the news of his uncle's suicide by throwing himself into the river.

Xu Shizhu committed suicide by throwing himself into the river because his nephew joined the enemy and he was unable to stop him. This not only showed his sense of shame but also showed his ambition. This behavior is certainly deeply moving and worthy of admiration! However, although his death has considerable value, his attempt to use this method of remonstration to exchange for his unfilial nephew's remorse is still open to discussion.

Traitors have no soul. They do not know what is called integrity or moral courage. Our only way to deal with this group of beasts in human clothing and criminals of the nation is to "kill without mercy." It is useless to advise or remonstrate. Since Mr. Xu Shizhu had the courage to die, under the lesson of "strongly advising him to leave but he refused," if he could not use a white blade to kill his unfilial nephew and eliminate a degenerate for the country, and strive for a little righteousness between heaven and earth, he could launch a broad anti-traitor movement and awaken the consciousness of the compatriots in the occupied areas. If this resulted in death, then death would be more valuable and more difficult to attain.

Therefore, we believe that we must have the courage to die, and at the same time, we must have the ambition to demand the price of death.

### Chongqing's Newspapers

— Guan Bao

Chongqing—China's current capital, the number of newspapers issued there far exceeds that in other places. Even Shanghai, which had a population of three million before the war, only issued ten kinds of newspapers, but now Chongqing has as many as twelve kinds.

Most of these twelve kinds of newspapers were forced to withdraw from Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Hankou because of the shift in the front line.

These many newspapers certainly have their own interests, but they are consistently the same in supporting the central government and supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's war of resistance against Japan.

The Central Daily News is the mouthpiece of the Kuomintang and the only guiding newspaper in the current period of resistance. After the fall of Nanjing, the newspaper moved to Changsha for publication. In September of last year, it moved from Changsha to Chongqing and was first published on September 15th; it only left a branch office in Changsha. The Ta Kung Pao is the most authoritative newspaper and has always been one of China's four major newspapers. It was first in Tianjin, then in Shanghai, and now, in addition to being published in Hong Kong, it was also published in Chongqing on December 1st of last year. In addition, there is the Sao Dang Bao, which moved from Hankou, and the Southwest Daily, which is published locally. Although they were born in different places, they can be called brother newspapers because they are all in the same voice as the "Whampoa system" in the government: the former is famous for its detailed military reports, and the latter is known to be affiliated with the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters and pays the most attention to the economic construction of the southwestern provinces. The authorities once had two decisions to merge these two newspapers, but the result was unsuccessful.

The Shi Shi Xin Bao and the Xin Min Bao are also newspapers that withdrew. The Shi Shi Xin Bao was originally published in Shanghai and moved to Chongqing for publication at the beginning of last year. The person behind it now is Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. The Xin Min Bao is a newspaper that moved from Nanjing and is run by a member of the Kuomintang. After the fall of Nanjing, it was the first to move to Chongqing for publication.

The Xinhua Daily is the organ of the Chinese Communist Party. It publishes many messages from the Soviet Russian news agency TASS, as well as many comments and reports on the mass movement. Every day, TASS's messages take up half a page, and the editorials are based on the communist political system and are written by those in charge on a rotational basis. The newspaper was first published in Hankou in January of last year and moved to Chongqing just before the withdrawal from Wuhan.

Some people may think that the local newspapers in Chongqing may not be able to compete with the newspapers that have withdrawn? This is really inaccurate. There are six local newspapers: the National Public Newspaper, the New Sichuan Newspaper, the Jichuan Public Newspaper, the Southwest Daily, the Dajiang Daily, and the Commercial Daily. The first two newspapers are still more popular than the several newspapers that have withdrawn, because their readers are a group of people who are interested in news and are not involved in political relations.

The Jichuan Public Newspaper is the semi-official newspaper of the Sichuan Provincial Government, the Commercial Daily is issued by the local Chamber of Commerce, and the Dajiang Daily is related to the personnel of the Provincial Government.

The sales of various newspapers in Chongqing, according to reliable sources, are estimated as follows:

Central Daily News (5,000 copies) Riri Xinbao (6,000 copies) Ta Kung Pao (7,000 copies) Xinhua Daily (6,000 copies) National Public Newspaper (6,000 copies) Xin Min Bao (8,000 copies) New Sichuan Newspaper (7,000 copies) Sao Dang Bao (6,000 copies) Southwest Daily (2,000 copies) Jichuan Public Newspaper (500 copies) Commercial Daily (500 copies) Dajiang Daily (500 copies)

Due to the lack of printing equipment, all newspapers in Chongqing are limited to issuing one large sheet, divided into four pages, all of the same size. Only the Xin Min Bao is an exception, because it is a small newspaper.

It is very strange that all local newspapers adopt the British style of editing, that is, the first page does not contain any editorials or news. However, the Xinhua Daily of the Communist Party is an exception, it publishes two commentaries on the first page; the Xin Min Bao is based on the American style of editing, and its first

### Shanghai's Bars

— Zhang Zhenshan

Every day, when the night falls, those bars filled with a strong sense of mystery and excitement begin to become active in the competition for nightlife in the happy corners of the city. Huge neon colored electric torch characters twinkle on the street and glitter at the door, like the charming smiles of girls and the leaping of children, complementing the aroma of wine and the tune of jazz music that overflow from the glass door, giving the lonely passers-by an inducement to numb their minds, making them throw themselves into that drunken, lewd, and decadent garden, and dyeing a layer of joyful color on the lonely and depressed souls.

Before the "August 13th" Incident, North Sichuan Road and Broadway Road in the "Mysterious Street" were thriving places for this kind of consumption that combines the double stimulation of alcohol and women. However, now, they have all been transplanted from the dark "hell" to the happy "heaven," so that Avenue Joffre, Avenue Edward VII, and Zhu Bao San Road have thickened their original alluring scenery and faded their former desolation and coldness; every house is filled with the darlings of heaven living in paradise, filling every nook and cranny like waves! The women who sell their souls in exchange for life's sustenance also grin and smile coquettishly, so charmingly comforting groups of lonely people like hungry tigers, letting others hug, dance, and tease them, accompanying the blurred drunken sailors with laughter and joy that carries pain. They are indeed great people who indirectly prosper the bars.

Therefore, every bar is equipped with musicians and dancers, or at least employs a few beautiful waitresses, so that those alien drunkards from distant oceans can get a little erotic tenderness. As long as one side is completely occupied by advertisements. As for printing, only the Xinhua Daily uses color.

Chongqing has a population of about 500,000 to 700,000, which does not actually require so many newspapers. The overlapping news reports in various newspapers are simply a waste of manpower and resources.

Until now, there is still no English-language newspaper in Chongqing. This kind of newspaper is really needed, because the number of foreigners in Chongqing has increased a lot. Recently, there has been a rumor that a foreign newspaper in Hankou will be moved to resume publication. If this comes true, it will enable foreigners traveling in Chongqing to also read the newspapers and understand the current news.

If you have money in your pocket, you can arrogantly hug them, drink from the same cup, kiss their lips sweetly, or crazily tease them on the ground.

There are also small bars run jointly by Western couples, and this kind of scene also appears. The husband pours wine, and the wife dances with the guests, smiling. In a pretentious society where feudalism has not been completely eliminated and women have not completely escaped the bondage of one-sided chastity, some people may shake their heads and sigh when they see this kind of situation. However, they seem to be standing at the forefront of the times and have a generous and forbearing attitude, even though they are trying to break free from the shackles of life.

If you hesitate in front of those bars, poke your head under the neon electric torch characters of "Bar Coffee," listen to the gentle tunes, smell the fragrant aroma of wine, and watch the women's charming and frivolous smiles, the drunkards' passionate enthusiasm, the teasing of money and flesh exchanging, and all the indescribable ease and pleasure swirling around, you will not be able to freely control yourself, grasp your reason, and be intoxicated by the reality in front of you, immersing a pure heart in beautiful reveries, and resolutely stepping into that vortex to seek the fun of excitement.

However, if you are a yellow person and your demeanor is not sophisticated, you may be ridiculed by them, because they come into contact with maritime heroes - sailors - every day. Those tycoons of the gold dollar kingdom, widowers without the burden of living expenses, exchange wads of banknotes for wine and women like they are scattering seeds, cultivating the prosperity of almost the entire Zhu Bao San Road! Therefore, the general bosses and dance halls especially welcome them, treat them with extraordinary closeness, serve them, and flatter them! If we use a solemn and naughty statement to describe them, then they and she are a group of skilled craftsmen who create good phenomena in international trade deficits!

### The Fruit Market of the Sixteenth Dock

— Yushan

Strolling south along the Bund Road in the French Concession, one reaches the terminus of the Concession tramway. The thoroughfare leading to the South City presents a scene of constant commotion, clamor, shouting, and bustling crowds, day after day. After the war, the iron gates were closed, cutting off traffic, as if separated by the boundary between life and death. Looking south, one saw only dilapidated walls, a stretch of rubble, a desolate and cold scene, truly like the silence of death, inevitably stirring endless sorrow.

From Fujian Road (not Shilu) south to the iron gates, this short stretch is lined with fruit and produce stores, interspersed with a few salted fish shops. Before the war, the fruit and produce businesses were mostly located in the Dongmen Road and Guoma Road area of the South City, with only three or four long-established businesses here. Now, the South City businesses have all moved here, clustering along the tramway station area. More than twenty have relocated along both sides of Yuhang Street, making it the central location for the fruit and produce trade.

The businesses are divided into two types: specialized and combined. Specialized businesses focus on fruits or produce, while combined businesses handle both fruits and produce, or even add northern goods to their offerings. As the end of the year approaches, the fruit business focuses on Guang oranges, Fu oranges, Shantou honey oranges, American honey oranges, green olives, bananas, and sugarcane. The produce business concentrates on mustard greens, old ginger, peanuts, and winter bamboo shoots. Northern goods are limited to chestnuts, walnuts, and dried longans. They all serve as wholesale distributors for customers, selling in bulk and not retail. They are the general distribution center for the city's fruit and produce trade. Before the war, they also wholesaled to other cities, but that is now rare.

From five to ten o'clock every morning is the market time. Nearly all the clerks of the city's fruit stores, small vendors, and peddlers in amusement parks and wharves rush to buy wholesale. The doorways of each business are packed with people, a sea of heads moving about. Clerks are frantically busy, trading boxes of oranges, bundles of sugarcane, bags of mustard greens amid the noisy shouting. On the roads, numerous vehicles are carrying goods away, while others are parked waiting to load, creating a bustling scene that is truly hard to describe.

Yuhang Street was also a place of thriving business and the most prosperous place for fish merchants. Before the war, due to the establishment of the fish market, the fish merchants here were ordered to relocate, resulting in a sudden decline. After the war, various businesses gradually reopened here, resuming operations. Therefore, every morning, fishmongers from various markets come here to buy wholesale. The bustling scene is comparable to that of the fruit merchants, truly worthy of being called equals.

### Rain Over Azure Sky, Chapter 1: The One-Armed Old Man Organizes a Free Village, Twin Daughters Reverently Visit the Martyrs' Tomb

— Bao Tianxiao

The fathers of these two Miss He Xiaoda are an international trader from China who has businesses in Singapore and other regions. He is currently helping the government manage import and export trade. In the past, he was called a Huaqiao (Overseas Chinese), but currently, he constantly travels between overseas and mainland China. Because the transportation between Europe, America, and China is extremely convenient now. This time, why are the two Miss Hes visiting Zhu Airen? It turns out that their father is an important figure in the International Trade Commission of the Central Government, and he received an order from the government to come to the capital. Furthermore, he also has many public and private matters to handle in Shanghai. The two Miss Hes heard that their father was coming here, and they also wanted to come along. Firstly, since returning to the country, they have wanted to travel to several major cities in China to broaden their knowledge. They are not reliant on a profession to make a living, but their aspiration is that every citizen, male or female, should have a profession. Since returning to the country, they have not yet taken a job, and now they want to see various places in the country first, broaden their horizons, and then choose a profession, which would be the best thing. Secondly, they can take this opportunity to visit their good friend Zhu Airen. Although they communicate often since returning to the country, letters are not as intimate as meeting in person. Zhu Airen often writes letters inviting them to come, and they also often write letters inviting Zhu Airen to go. But Zhu Airen does not have the time to go, because she cannot leave the infirmary. Therefore, she asks the two Miss Hes to come, so the two Miss Hes are now truly here. Their father was very happy to hear that they wanted to come along. At this time, there are two flights departing from Hong Kong to Shanghai every day. So, he sent someone to the China Travel Service to book three seats on the Hong Kong-Shanghai flight of the China National Aviation Corporation and flew to Shanghai. They stayed in Shanghai for a week, living in one of the largest hotels in Shanghai. The hotel also has over thirty floors, which is considered the tallest building in Shanghai. Shanghai is still a prosperous and luxurious area. Although all sovereignty belongs to China, merchants from all over the world gather here, and it is still a large port for the exchange of goods. China is a newly emerging country after the war, and construction projects all rely on the help of people from Europe and America. Some are related to technology, and some are related to capital. They are all willing to come to the East. Because the first major country in the East, the Republic of China, is a country with the richest resources, the largest population, and the deepest reserves. (10)

### A Record of the Surviving Qin of Sun Zuochen

— Su Shaoqing

Having seen the two articles in this publication, "Sun Zuochen's Surviving Qin" by Mr. Ruoqi and "The Reality of Being Deceived by Xu Muyun" by Mr. Xu Muyun, I could not help but feel a mix of sadness and emotion! The peerless qin player, Sun Zuochen, died in poverty the year before last, and his two sons and one daughter also died one after another. Sun's qin skills have since been silenced. There is only a surviving qin, which I keep in my possession. Every morning and evening, I play the qin and remember the person. How can I not be sad! Now, I will describe the appearance of this qin and the experience of obtaining it, to inform the music lovers of the world.

Sun Zuochen had an unusual appearance. His personality was also particularly strange. In his later years, he lived in Shanghai, quite destitute. I provided him with some assistance. Therefore, we met every evening. He played the qin, and I sang. This went on for half a year. One day, Zuochen and I played the qin together for a Qingke Cairen (a type of performing artist) who was singing in the theater. (The Beizhan Piaofang (theatrical troupe) was performing in the Cairen style at the Lake Society. Shen Junhong was singing "Hongyang Cave" and Zhang Jun was singing "Maca Cao.") When Zuochen played the qin, he would adjust the strings when the performer was about to start singing on stage. With two twists of the strings, the pitch would be accurate, without fail. He had made it a habit and was proud of it. Others could not imitate it. At that time, the Yinzi (prelude) was finished. Zuochen took the qin out of the qin bag and was shocked and lost his color. It turned out that he had not checked it beforehand, and the snakeskin was broken. (This is commonly called "jumping into the well," "trapped in a bamboo horse trap." Replacing the snakeskin is possible.) It was impossible to make sound. Fortunately, I had a good qin with me (a gift from my friend, Mr. Qian), and I quickly took it out and gave it to him. The qin in his hand was also extraordinary. Zuochen was therefore grateful to me. He smiled and said to me, "Your qin is indeed good, but my qin has been with me for more than fifty years. It has had two great adventures: First, the Guangxu Emperor took it into the inner palace. It was only through begging the chief eunuch that I was able to get it back. Second, a certain Japanese person wanted to exchange it for a thousand taels of gold, but I was unwilling. Although this qin has jumped into the well today, like a person suddenly suffering a serious illness and losing his voice, even if he is a great hero, he becomes useless for the time being. I am already seventy-five years old and old. One day I will definitely give this qin to you as a gift." I had wanted to get his qin for a long time, and I was very happy to hear this. Three months later, Zuochen was sick and could not get up. I went to comfort him. Zuochen took the qin from the wall and asked me to take it away. I said, "Later, later, there is no hurry." After another ten days or so, Zuochen died. More than ten days after the funeral, his son, named Wu, brought an object, which was this qin. And he said, "His father left a will, definitely to give it to a certain Su." Therefore, this qin was stored in my leaky room. Zuochen kept his promise, wasn't he an extraordinary person?

This qin has a bamboo pole that is one Chi, six Cun, and four Fen in length (the Yingzao Chi, or builder's foot, is divided into ten Cun, and each Cun is divided into ten Fen, so 8.1 Cun equals 1 Chi). The distance from the first bamboo joint to the drum surface is one Cun and six Fen. (The length of the distance between the first bamboo joint and the drum surface is related to the quality of the sound.) The "smart hole" is eight Fen long and two Fen wide, smaller than the holes on other huqins. (The "smart hole" is a rectangular hole opened in the part of the bamboo pole that is inside the drum. The size and length of this hole are very important to the sound of the qin. Any increase or decrease, even slightly, affects the quality of the sound. Sun Zuochen said: He had a good qin made of Luohan bamboo, but he thought the sound was still not bright enough. He took it upon himself to lengthen the "smart hole" by about one Fen. The sound of the qin became dark and dull. Because of this, he did not eat for several days and was unhappy for more than a month. Later, he found an expert to fix it, and the sound returned, but it was not as good as before. The "smart hole" of this qin is particularly small, so its sound is concentrated and heroic.) The drum is three Cun and four Fen long. The diameter of the round back is slightly more than one Cun and three Fen, and the diameter of the round front, where the snakeskin is, is one Cun and two Fen. The drum is smaller in the front and larger in the back, and the front is not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, all presenting a strange and unique shape, very different from other qins.

The whole body of this qin is covered with a buildup of rosin, like the green and coppery stains of ancient bronze. Where it is frequently touched, it is red and purple and lustrous, like cinnabar stains.

This qin is like an old steed. When it meets a Bole (a legendary judge of horses) who holds the reins, it will let out a long roar and be able to travel a thousand miles. It is also like a bad horse. When played by an incompetent musician, it will invariably stumble and fall off the saddle. It not only doesn't sound, but also makes it impossible to make a tune or a sound. How strange! I consider my skills to be between those of Bole and an incompetent musician. Sometimes, when I am happy, I pick up the qin and play it. Although I cannot follow in the footsteps of Sun and Chen (Chen Yanheng), I play ancient tunes alone and am content with myself. Life is about being happy. Why seek recognition from others?

This qin requires the use of hard erhu strings, thick old strings, and the use of force that penetrates deep into the wood to produce a deep, sonorous sound. Gentle strings and weak fingers will be laughed at by the soul of the qin. Since this qin came into my possession, every time I replace the snakeskin, I must ask "Little Shaoxing" of Lü Shunchang to do it. When he sees it, he will definitely say, "This is Sun's qin." It is known by those who know it. Some say that this qin is about eighty years old and is the legacy of Sun's teacher, "Cha San." Am I not lucky to have obtained this qin?

Alas, the surviving qin of a great Western musician is treasured by the whole world, worth tens of thousands of pounds. Now, Sun is also a great musician of China who is unsurpassed. Unfortunately, his surviving qin has fallen into my hands. Sun was poor all his life, and his qin could not show itself. When I play it and think of him, I burst into tears. I write this article to let the world know about Sun and his qin, for a thousand years of remembrance!

### Gu Wuwei Visits Fan Xuepeng Three Times - Fan Claims to Resign Again from Green Treasure -

— Xiong Tang

Fan Xuepeng jumped from the silver screen to the stage, performing plays at the Green Treasure Theater, and then stopped performing due to lung disease and rested at home. The Green Treasure authorities once "visited her thatched cottage three times," earnestly inviting her to continue her performance. Under the "Three Laws Agreement," Xuepeng returned to the Green Treasure stage on New Year's Eve. At that time, the three agreed principles were: 1. Increase transportation fees by sixty yuan. 2. Provide a special resting room backstage. 3. Before the illness is completely recovered, she can ask for leave or stop performing at any time. This publication has detailed records of this matter.

Fan Xuepeng's illness has not yet fully recovered. The table in the backstage resting room is full of glass bottles and glasses containing pills. It is like a separated hospital. Working day and night is very tiring. Relying on her illness to perform on stage is not a long-term plan. Therefore, she used one of the clauses in the Three Laws Agreement to resign from Green Treasure. However, the Green Treasure authorities, because the theater is still full after she went on stage, are naturally reluctant to let go of this "goddess of wealth" easily. Of course, they warmly retained her and agreed to reduce some of the plays she performed, only asking her to perform one or two plays. The day shows do not necessarily have to be on stage every day, but can be on stage every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. However, the old "Fan School" audience of the Green Treasure Theater are writing letters at the same time, because she has very few plays in the new play "Eyer Mei", requesting to add more plays in the next new play "Mother's Secret", making the Green Treasure authorities in a dilemma. Fan Xuepeng's intention to resign is so firm, and it is said that it will be performed until the 15th. Whether to continue to serve in the position is still under negotiation.

Fan Xuepeng's firm resignation also involves Gu Wuwei. Gu Wuwei came to Shanghai from Hong Kong this time, in addition to paving the way for the Yi Mao New Year, there is also a new plan, which is to recruit talents from the Shanghai film and drama circles to Hong Kong to perform dramas. Seven or eight years ago, he took over the Qitian stage (the original site of the current Gong Stage) in Shanghai and performed the new play "Tixiao Yinyuan". In terms of talent, he adopted the "film and drama hybrid system", which was very profitable. Later, he opened docks in Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin and Beiping, which also made a lot of money. This time, he plans to repeat the method he used eight years ago, so he brought his wife Lu Cuilan to contact separately. Outsiders do not know how the results are. Considering that Fan Xuepeng's Guan Xiugu in "Tixiao Yinyuan" was very popular, he has contacted Fan Xuepeng's residence in the Green Treasure backstage and Shenchengli three times. Although Gu Wuwei and his wife have returned to Xiangdao, the verbal agreement with Fan Xuepeng is still in an "unfinished" situation. Looking at it, Fan Xuepeng's resignation from Green Treasure has something to do with it!

### Gu Zhuanjie's The Tale of Selling a Horse

— Xitong

Gu Zhuanjie's "The Tale of Selling a Horse", which I have been looking forward to for months, has finally arrived. This is truly a "dream come true"! (Note: This play, newly translated by Gu Zhongqiu, is similar to Gorky's "Her Lover.") This is the charity performance held by Guanghua University at the YMCA on the evening of the seventh.

Zhuanjie is a famous young actor of the Xian Ni Society. His "The Tale of Selling a Horse" and the complete scripts written by Yu Zhuanming have company recordings. Zhuanjie has long retired from singing and changed his name to Zhicheng, studying at Guanghua Middle School, and later graduated from the Department of Agriculture of Jinling University. Recently, I heard that he is teaching at Shicheng Middle School. This special invitation by Guanghua classmates to sing is truly a rare opportunity.

I personally feel particularly interested in "The Tale of Selling a Horse". It is funny and laughable to say it, but I only learned the script of "The Tale of Selling a Horse" for a week last year, and I even went on stage to try it out. I have no other skills. Because there was no rehearsal, when I was crying, the gauze hat wings touched Guizhi's headgear and made a clanging sound. When writing the script, I couldn't find a pen because of my nearsightedness. After a long time, I saw a small wooden stick, as thick as a sugarcane, and I thought it might be the so-called pen, so I picked it up confusedly. Fortunately, I didn't make a mistake, because I had never seen such a big pen before!

After watching Zhuanjie's "The Tale of Selling a Horse", Liu Lang dare not show off his poor skills anymore. I would like to write down the advantages of the "writing script" that I saw:

When singing "Say to the official, speak in detail," he pulled Guizhi's sleeve and stood up, the posture was very beautiful. He used both hands to slightly lift Guizhi's left sleeve and sway it, and the steps and rhythms were in harmony.

After listening to Guizhi's permission not to cry, he smiled. Then Guizhi cried, and he immediately hid his smile, opened his mouth, and made a disappointed and surprised expression. This is much better than the ordinary actor adding a sentence "She cried again." The emotions changed drastically, is this the so-called beauty of silence?

When saying "I think a person has two kinds of diseases," he would definitely rush through this part; Zhuanjie made a thoughtful look, pondering the situation, speaking in a low voice, and then saying "This must be false", which is also delicately good.

Listening to Guizhi singing "I have to draw up a confession in court", Zhuanjie said "It's over" three or four times, very anxiously, and suddenly found Guizhi kneeling on the ground, and hurriedly helped her up. When saying "Execution in autumn", he also said it three or four times and suddenly found Guizhi fainting, and hurriedly went to save her. They were all done very naturally. Others only say it once, not as thorough as Zhuanjie.

While reading the script to "Because of disobedience in adultery" and shaking his head, "Autumn will be..." and his hands trembled, the expression was realistic.

After all, Zhuanjie is a scholar. A scholar plays a scholar. It is his true colors. From the overall perspective, the singing voice is gentle, the demeanor is gentle, and there is no anger at all, which is truly admirable!

### Kun Actress Zhang Chuanfang's Assassination of the Tiger

— Fan Yifeng

Zhang Chuanfang, a disciple of the Kunqu Opera Training Institute, is dedicated to learning female roles. She is skilled in many plays. Recently, she has frequently performed the assassination play "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger," and she is a person with a heart. This play has some stimulating elements, so the Xian Ni Society has been full every time it has been posted recently, and its appeal is unusual. On stage, Chuanfang plays Fei Zhen'e, wearing palace attire - see photo - singing "Duān Zhèng Hǎo" (a musical tune). She embodies the anger of the state... In one scene, she vents all her grievances. Until she admits that she is a princess, Li Chuang uses his finger to point to the treasure tiger given to her by Si Liang (another traitor) and suddenly feels dizzy, and Zhen'e has the determination to die. Singing "Gǔn Xiù Qiú" (another musical tune), I grit my teeth, apply rouge to my hips, wipe away my tears, apply powder... In one scene, every word is a tear, making the audience feel as if they are in a real situation. Afterwards, she exchanges vows with the tiger and sends him to the bridal chamber. The tiger is already drunk. Zhen'e sings "Dāo Dāo Lìng" (another musical tune). On the silver hairpin... In one scene, she describes the pain of enduring humiliation. Then, singing "Tuō Bù Shān" (another musical tune) and "Xiǎo Cài Liáng Zhōu" (another musical tune), "Take off..." Since I cannot kill the traitor, I should kill a tiger. So the performer takes off her palace attire, puts on a black coat, and holds a steel dagger in her hand, singing "Kuài Huó Sān" (another musical tune). On the steel knife... In one scene, she shows a heroic spirit that shames the eyebrows. But fearing that she will be timid, she sings "Cháo Tiān Zǐ" (another musical tune) and so on... In one scene, she takes one step after another, and the scene is extremely tense. Finally, she performs various stunts such as hair twirling, somersaults, and falls in succession, while stabbing the tiger and singing "Let him be shattered to pieces, let him be crushed into dust, ah Fei Zhen'e, what a pity for your great talent, ah! It's wasted." This indicates that it is a pity that she did not die to kill the traitor, and as a result, she died herself. Chuanfang's performance is outstanding and appropriate, and it is wonderful to watch!

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace of the Former Capital (7) (1)

— Xu Muyun

The Landlord of Luoma Lake is named Ma

These descendants who enjoy the inheritance of their ancestors, although their behavior is slightly better than Li Pei, the practice of setting up private courts, bullying the people, and raping women continued unchanged until the Republic of China. When people in Xuzhou mention the Ma Family Village, they still treat it like the "Xi Huang Zhuang" (a notorious landlord family). They harbor many gang leaders in their village and raise their own opera troupe, called the Ma Family Troupe. Their manner of doing whatever they please is truly repulsive. Unexpectedly, the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year overthrew the power of the warlords, and at the same time overthrew the local tyrants and evil gentry. Therefore, Party workers reported all their crimes to the Special Court of the Capital. Only then were they arrested in Nanjing and detained for more than a year. Later, they were released due to a special amnesty. Although they were slightly restrained, their nature as bullies and evil gentry remained unchanged. Now it is said that they have become traitors, using the power of the enemy to oppress the villagers of Pi and Su counties. Therefore, the remnant poison of the monkey Li Pei in the early Qing Dynasty still exists in the Ma family clan of Luoma Lake.

Che Gao Gong excels in the art of changing faces

In Peking opera, the singing of "Zhaoguan" is the most complicated, because it is not only a one-man show, with little time to rest, but also the huqin (Chinese violin) goes up and down, sometimes Xipi, sometimes Erhuang, after singing several Erhuang sections, then singing Xipi Erliu and Yaoban, back and forth. If the voice is a little bit worse, you have to open your mouth to sing it through to the end. Moreover, there is no fast tempo in Erhuang, but in this play, the two segments of "Having something on my mind, hard to close my eyes" and "The rooster crows and the dog barks, it's five o'clock" after the third watch and the fifth watch, have more than twenty sentences in total, all of which must be completed in one breath. Although it is called a "glance of Erhuang" (meaning the original tempo), there is no place to drop the drum mallet at all. When singing, you can only use the board to measure the rhythm, with no space to breathe at all. Sometimes three words are sung on one board. If you encounter a person with a big tongue or someone who doesn't speak clearly, then they will definitely stutter like they burned their tongue eating pulled silk yam.

Zhang Chuanfang's stage costume

Letter received: Regarding "Yi Hua giving up Jin Suqin", (omitted) many people in the film industry knew about it at the time. I submitted a manuscript to your publication, and I have no other intention. I am deeply afraid of misunderstandings, so I hereby solemnly declare. Yours sincerely, Editor, Xin Shi
