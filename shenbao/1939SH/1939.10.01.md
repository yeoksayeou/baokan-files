### Unless Poland's Sovereignty Is Restored, Britain and France State There Can Be No Peace; Disregarding German-Soviet Economic Assistance; Hitler's Peace Offensive Intended as a Threat

Paris - The French government announced last night that it had obtained a large number of documents that could prove a secret military alliance between the Soviet Union and Germany. Accepting the Soviet Union's clear statement at this time that peace is impossible without the restoration of Poland to its original state, France must continue to fight until Hitlerism is completely eliminated. Although the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany, such as the supply of oil and wheat, may make it difficult for Britain and France in the war, it will have no impact on their determination to fight. Furthermore, the lack of Soviet sea and land transport capacity may prevent them from fully supplying Germany. At the same time, Britain will intensify its blockade of Germany. French Prime Minister Daladier and French Army Commander Gamelin studied the peace proposals issued by the Soviet Union and Germany in Moscow at the External Affairs Residence yesterday, with Deputy Foreign Minister Léger assisting. General Gamelin's belief in ultimate victory has not changed at all. In Daladier's telephone conversation with Chamberlain yesterday, the consistency of the British and French positions was proven. British and French officials unanimously believe that Hitler's peace proposals are the basis for building peace in Eastern Europe. France is not unaware of the Soviet-German diplomatic and economic assistance, and also believes that the Soviet Union and Germany may have signed a military alliance treaty. As of last night, the French government had not yet received formal peace proposals from the Soviet Union and Germany, although it had long been aware of their content. It is also possible that the Soviet Union and Germany did not intend to submit them because Britain and France had already indicated their rejection in advance. (30th Associated Press)

Moscow - Observers here recently stated that the Treaty of Friendship and Borders signed by Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has effectively divided Polish territory and established a permanent link between the two countries, because both sides have the same interests in suppressing the Polish national restoration movement. The goal of the economic agreement signed by both sides is to implement economic cooperation so as to adjust the production of both sides in the coming years. In other words, Germany will exchange manufactured goods for various raw materials from the Soviet Union so that the trade relations between the two sides will return to the highest level of trade between the two countries in 1931 (according to this year, the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union reached 1.1 billion marks). People in diplomatic circles said that although the Treaty of Friendship and Borders between Germany and the Soviet Union is not a military alliance treaty, it is actually the basis for a military alliance, because this treaty stipulates that if a third country first attempts to interfere in the settlement of the Polish issue, Germany and the Soviet Union will definitely not tolerate it. Since Britain and France have always recognized Poland as their ally, the treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union states that threats should not be added to Britain and France. The joint declaration between Germany and the Soviet Union states, "The governments of Germany and the Soviet Union shall work together to find ways to end the war between Germany and Britain and France. If this effort fails, the responsibility for prolonging the war shall be borne by Britain and France. At that time, Germany and the Soviet Union shall consult each other and decide on the necessary measures." This statement is another threat in itself. Furthermore, the declaration also states that Germany and the Soviet Union will often seek cooperation with other friendly countries when necessary in order to achieve their goals as soon as possible. Regarding this point, foreign observers all stated that the Soviet Union has clearly understood that it is difficult for Britain and France to reach a compromise with Germany. In the future, it is important to note that it will earnestly support Germany in the current war. (29th Havas)

Moscow - Although there is a provision in the German-Soviet agreement stating that if Britain and France reject the German peace proposal, Germany and the Soviet Union will consult on necessary plans, which is intended as a threat, most observers here believe that there is no military alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union, and that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's mission failed due to the non-existence of a German-Soviet military alliance. If Britain and France refuse to accept the peace proposals of the two dictators, Hitler and Stalin, Germany will be almost completely isolated. According to extremely qualified observers, the purpose of the Soviet-Estonian treaty is to prevent future German attacks rather than to completely dominate Estonia. (30th Reuters)

Berlin - After the conclusion of the border and friendship agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, German political figures generally believe that this is the final reorganization of Eastern Europe, and hereby declare Germany's attitude. It should be stated that the purpose of Britain and France's war is to assist Poland. Now that Poland no longer exists, Germany and the Soviet Union have expressed their determination to maintain the reorganization of Eastern Europe. Germany has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of fighting against Britain or France. Therefore, it seems that there is no reason for Britain and France to continue fighting. (30th Haitong)

Berlin - After learning the initial reaction of the Allied countries to rashly reject the joint Soviet-German peace movement proposal, the Nazi Party authorities here today advised Britain and France to "reconsider" before rejecting the peace proposal. Authoritative sources claimed that the joint Soviet-German declaration was the final proposal for peace, and no further official documents would be issued. At the same time, they stated that the main point of the Moscow Communiqué was the right of third countries to speak on the future issue of Poland, and that it could not be limited by a peace conference. (30th Associated Press)

London - People here are still studying in detail what kind of practical assistance the German-Soviet agreement has for Germany. According to Soviet trade statistics, the goods exported from the Soviet Union to Germany have decreased from 30 million pounds to 4 million pounds between 1931 and last year. Germany's exports to the Soviet Union have also decreased from 47 million pounds to 2 million pounds. Last year, due to increased domestic needs, the Soviet Union's production of pig iron, copper, lead, aluminum, zinc, tin ingots, nickel, etc. was not enough for its own use, and there was no surplus for export. The Soviet Union's huge resources can easily be developed under the guidance of German experts, but it is difficult to do so in a short period of several months. Military critics generally expect that Soviet troops will not appear on the Western Front, but it is possible that tanks and aircraft will be lent to Germany. Some critics even said that since Stalin has obtained everything without fighting, why should he participate in the war now? Naval critics said that the agreement between the Soviet Union and Estonia allows the Soviet Union to establish naval and air bases on the Estonian islands. Germany must feel unhappy about this news, because in this situation, the Soviet Union can control the Gulf of Riga and dominate the Baltic Sea. (30th Reuters)

German Foreign Minister Returns to Berlin

Berlin - Hitler returned to Berlin from Wilhelmshaven port last night, waiting for the reply from Britain and France. After the German-Soviet agreement was signed in Moscow on Thursday, Hitler made a peace proposal to Britain and France based on the agreement. Here, it is hoped that the reply from Britain and France can arrive here on the first day of the semester. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to Berlin from Moscow last night and immediately visited Hitler to report on the trip. (30th Associated Press)

### British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty Achieves Final Compromise; Aimed at Ensuring Mediterranean Security; Turkish Foreign Minister to Sign Upon Return from Soviet Union

Istanbul - Ankara diplomatic circles widely rumored that the full text of the mutual assistance and economic agreement between Turkey, Britain, and France has reached a final compromise. It is said that the agreement will be signed immediately after Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu returns from Moscow. Responsible Turkish authorities insisted that the new Soviet-Turkish treaty does not hinder Turkey's promises to Britain and France, and that Turkey's treaties with the Soviet Union, Britain, and France are all aimed at maintaining the status quo of the Balkan Peninsula and the Black Sea, and ensuring the security of the Mediterranean. (30th Reuters)

Amsterdam - London reports that a Turkish military delegation is heading to Britain. A private telegram from Ankara confirms this matter.

According to a statement issued by Minister of Commerce Andreš, "Germany is our country's largest market, and we are unwilling to give it up.

Well-informed sources said that Germany does not intend to ask Yugoslavia to increase the amount of food exports, but will insist on exporting as much copper, iron, zinc, lead, aluminum and other mineral sands to Germany as possible, regardless of the price, and is willing to allocate the necessary trains for transportation.

(29th Havas)

### Britain and France Draw Swords; Determined to Fight for Justice; Stalin Known for Prudence and Self-Restraint; Will Not Take Chestnuts from the Fire for Others - A Glimpse of London and Paris Public Opinion

London - British newspapers today condemned the German-Soviet Pact. The Times called it a proud and evil document, saying that the long-awaited "peace offensive" was nothing more than a trick, and even if it were well-disguised, people would sneer at it. There can be no peace without the destruction of Hitlerism, and its relationship with Stalin will be determined by the fact of revealing its own intentions, but Herr Hitler's will has not yet been revealed. We have never sought to interfere with the Soviet Union. As for whether the Soviet Union wants to make things difficult for us, we must wait and see. The Daily Telegraph said that Germany's desire to use the Soviet Union to guide the hope of peace will eventually fail. If the Soviet Union threatens with hostile actions, the response from Britain and France will naturally be the same. However, Stalin is very cautious and will not take chestnuts from the fire for others. The Daily Mail said that Hitler wants peace at a fixed price, and we reject his terms. We keep our promise to restore Poland and will not make peace with Hitler and his ilk. The Daily Herald said that we need not admit that the German-Soviet Pact may have significant implications, but Britain's determination and purpose will not change. The News Chronicle: The conditions of peace that can make the world breathe again and move upward can be proposed today and discussed tomorrow, but such conditions do not recognize aggression. We have drawn our swords for freedom and will not turn back until the act of dominating other countries by force has come to an end. (30th Reuters)

Paris - French newspapers unanimously rejected the Hitler-Stalin peace proposal. Le Figaro published an article by former ambassador to Romania, Daumergue, saying that there can be no peace with those who have abandoned everything in diplomacy and ideology. (30th Reuters)

### Estonia Falls Under Soviet Control; Soviet Union Sends Military Delegation to Estonia; Plans to Build Military Ports on Estonian Islands

Moscow - The Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Pact, signed here on September 28, was approved yesterday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (30th TASS)

Moscow - The Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Agreement has been approved by the governments of both countries. The Soviet military delegation is now scheduled to head to the Estonian capital tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. In addition to army, navy, and air force personnel, the Soviet delegation also includes several engineers to plan the construction of defensive projects on Vormsi Island, Hiiumaa Island, and Paldiski Port. It is learned that the above-mentioned three military projects will begin construction in the near future. (30th Haitong)

Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter, after signing the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov, is scheduled to fly back to Tallinn tomorrow morning. Foreign observers here recently commented on this treaty, saying that as a result of the reconciliation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the survival of Poland has been sacrificed. Now, Estonia has also lost its independence and has become a Soviet vassal state. From then on, the Soviet Union can occupy Vormsi and Hiiumaa Islands and Tallinn Port, and strategically control the key to the southern part of the Gulf of Finland. In addition, Latvia originally had an alliance treaty with Estonia, but it did not participate in the talks between the Soviet Union and Estonia this time. (29th Havas)

Tokyo - Today, newspapers here paid more attention to the Soviet Union's conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty with Estonia than to the German-Soviet agreement on a common border. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the European war has given the Soviet Union a good opportunity to take advantage of the fire, so the Soviet Union will definitely maintain neutrality, because doing so will create many similar opportunities. After establishing an Estonian "protectorate," the Soviet Union can control the Polish coast, and later wait for the opportunity to advance in the Balkans. The Asahi Shimbun also said that since the Soviet Union has realized its desire to control the Baltic Sea, it seems unlikely that it will take further action against Latvia, Lithuania, or Finland, but will focus its attention on the Black Sea region. As for whether the war will immediately spread to the Balkan Peninsula, it is difficult to determine, but Britain, France, and both Germany and the Soviet Union will wage fierce diplomatic wars in the Balkans.

### British Air Force Bombs German Fleet; Several British Aircraft Fail to Return to Base

London - The Information Department recently issued a communiqué stating that British aircraft attacked several German warships in the Heligoland Bight in the North Sea. At that time, although the German anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, our aircraft were still able to fly low and drop bombs accurately, but several aircraft have not yet returned to base. (29th Havas)

Amsterdam - News from London has confirmed the report from the German Supreme Command that five or six British bombers were shot down when attacking the German Navy near Heligoland. According to the British Air Ministry, British bombers disregarded the dense anti-aircraft fire of the German warships and flew low to drop bombs. However, the British report did not mention the results of the air raid, only stating that several bombers failed to return to base. This report can indirectly prove the news that British aircraft were shot down. (30th Haitong)

Berlin - According to responsible military sources here, a total of 19 enemy aircraft and two balloons were shot down when the German Air Force engaged in air battles with British and French aircraft this week. In addition, five British aircraft were shot down again by the Germans yesterday when they bombed the German Navy. Therefore, Germany has shot down a total of 24 enemy aircraft since the 24th of this month. (30th Haitong)

Berlin - The General Command recently issued a communiqué stating that six British combat teams bombed the German fleet in the Heligoland Bight in the North Sea today without hitting anything. German destroyers immediately took off to intercept them, engaged in battle, and shot down five British aircraft. (29th Havas)

London - The American wireless station broadcast the message last night that one of the National Army's ships has been damaged by German aircraft. The British Navy has just acknowledged that it is true that a British warship was attacked by German aircraft, but it was not hit and even less sunk. In addition, the Information Department issued a communiqué stating that British aircraft pilots had caught sight of a German submarine on the Atlantic Ocean, immediately circling to investigate for fifteen minutes, aiming at the target, and dropping several bombs. Soon, oil slicks floated on the sea surface, which did not dissipate for a long time, proving that the submarine had been sunk. (29th Havas)

Berlin - Two teams of British fighters, a total of twelve aircraft, attempted to invade German territorial waters along the North Sea coast. One team attacked destroyers in a German bay without success. The British aircraft were repelled by German anti-aircraft guns and the German side suffered no losses. The other team encountered German fighters and five of the six British aircraft were shot down. (30th Haitong)

Editorial

### What the United States Expects

In recent days, international changes have been complex and confusing. In addition, international schemers, in order to achieve their own country's goals, have fueled the flames, creating all kinds of smoke and mirrors. The propaganda world has picked up bits and pieces, turning them into neurotic inferences. For example, rumors are spreading that the Soviet Union is re-emerging on the European political stage. Therefore, it has reached a mutual understanding with Japan, allowing Japan to take free action in the Far East. Moreover, because Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Geneva, foreign observers have further speculated that Japan and the Soviet Union intend to harm China's war of resistance. As a result, people who are concerned about the overall situation in the Far East cannot help but speculate and become deeply worried. In fact, the two years of war have been enough to make Japan realize that it is impossible to subdue China by force. It is also well known that China's war of resistance does not depend on any country. Even if some countries that sympathize with China have changed their international policies in other aspects, so far, there has been absolutely no change in their attitude towards China. Therefore, China's foreign policy, as Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said, is entirely based on treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, with the purpose of thoroughly maintaining China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence; it has never wavered from beginning to end. Furthermore, looking at the international situation, the United States' policy is the most stable and most in line with China's foreign policy. Since President Roosevelt took office, what he has proclaimed to the international community is that the main purpose of American foreign policy is to "do its best to eradicate war between nations;" at the same time, he is working hard to build a greater navy to deal with aggressors who use war as a tool. The two echo each other, but with different tones; in other words, his large navy plan is being promoted very rapidly, while his steps to deal with aggressors are slow. After the past few years and up to now, the United States' pressure on aggressors has gradually intensified. At the end of last year, he raised a protest that was very substantial in content but not particularly special in appearance; but in July of this year, he announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with lightning speed. This calm and unhurried expression will surely make the part of the Japanese people who have not yet gone mad realize that this is a serious warning. The reason why the Japanese Abe Cabinet appointed Nomura to adjust relations with the United States in order to concentrate its efforts on solving the so-called "China problem" lies here. Now that the Japanese side feels the seriousness of the warning, and still wants to use diplomatic skills to deal with it hypocritically, the United States' expression of its stability and firmness is not limited to diplomatic maneuvers. For example, the aircraft carrier Langley and many other warships sailed to the Philippines; bomber squadrons and reconnaissance squadrons flew from Honolulu through Midway Island and Guam to the Philippines. This is the first decision of American warplanes to cross the International Date Line; and a large submarine fleet was sent from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines to enhance the maritime defense capabilities of the United States Asiatic Fleet; Importantly, the United States Navy Department announced that it would hold large-scale naval exercises centered on Hawaii, and most of the fleets on the west coast were also transferred to Pearl Harbor; although the United States government does not think that these actions are related to the European war or Japan's intensified invasion of China, who can say that they are meaningless, blind actions! For example, the United States Army Department allocated US$12 million to open up two large airfields in Honolulu, and the Navy Department allocated a large sum of money to build harbors and air force bases in Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, as well as Roosevelt's announcement in mid-July to build strong air force and submarine bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and allocated US$14 million to build an air force base to defend Panama; and US$40 million to build an air force base in Alaska; all these large-scale military expansion plans cannot be regarded as a waste of wealth or relief for the unemployed! Japan understands this very well, so when her new foreign minister took office, he made it his basic policy to improve relations with the United States, and the reason is nothing more than this. It is not difficult to improve relations, and it is not difficult to revise the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation; changes in foreign ministers and envoys, and even cabinet reshuffles, are not a problem; as long as there is an honest and fair reply to the memorandum at the end of last year. This is the only expectation of the United States. It is also the only key between the United States and Japan!

### German Artillery Active on the East Bank of the Saar River; French Army Takes Shearing Offensive; French President Inspects Front Lines

(Paris) The Paris General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 52, stating, "Last night, the entire line was calm and uneventful. Our troops patrolled the east bank of the Saar River once." (Havas telegram dated 30th)

(Paris) The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 51, stating, "Enemy artillery was quite active today on the east bank of the Saar River, south of the cities of Zwei-Brücken and Bitsch. Both enemy and our aircraft have conducted reconnaissance flights." (Havas telegram dated 29th)

(Paris) President Lebrun went to the Maginot Line area on the northeastern border today to inspect the army, and met with General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, and a certain Corps Commander of the Front Line Commander. He witnessed that the front-line troops and the civilians in the rear were able to maintain a courageous and calm spirit, which he greatly appreciated. In addition, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac was accompanied by General Vilmin, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, to inspect several air squadrons that recently participated in the war. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

(Paris) According to informed sources, the French high command is currently trying a certain strategy, not eager to launch a large-scale offensive against the Siegfried Line. This strategic expectation of time will continue until the German army is truly fighting on the Western Front. The French army's last local offensive has repeatedly proved the principle of first capturing a place with fierce artillery fire and then occupying it with infantry. After exerting their combined power, the French artillery and infantry have penetrated five miles into the front, closer to the Siegfried Line. The German side has realized that it is impossible to defend the area. British and French aircraft have repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights behind the Siegfried Line without being obstructed by German fighter planes. Recent French war reports stated that enemy artillery fire was launched in the area east of the Saar, especially in the territory south of Bitsch and Sarre-Union. Reconnaissance battleships were quite active on both sides. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)

(Paris) The French High Command announced last night that the French army attacked the German positions on the Moselle River near Pirmasens yesterday, advancing one mile, with a five-mile-long battle line. The French army has so far occupied 50 German villages. The French army has also made progress in Saarbrücken, "with very few losses." The French army's goal is to contain both banks of the Saar River in the Saar region. The French artillery is in a position of great advantage, forcing the German army to withdraw from the entire Saar mining area. After French reconnaissance planes flew over German territory, they reported that a large German army was concentrated behind the front. German anti-aircraft artillery damaged several French planes, but all planes returned to their bases. French Communiqué No. 52 stated, "Today, enemy artillery on the east side of the Saar River attacked our army in Zwei-Brücken and Pirmasens. Reconnaissance agencies of both Germany and France are active on the front line." (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)

Berlin The German High Command announced last night that the British Air Force attacked the German fleet near Heligoland yesterday, but "failed." Five British planes were shot down by German planes. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)

(Paris) A French military commentator heard today that Saarbrücken has been surrounded on three sides and is about to fall. Although the German army wants to contain the French army's actions, the French army continues its war, slowly and orderly. Its purpose is to encircle the Siegfried Line in the central salient of the Saarbrücken town. The French army is now using a shearing action to pressure the core defenses of this town. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)

### Warsaw Garrison Surrenders; 100,000 Polish Soldiers Disarmed and Dispersed; German Army to Enter City Tomorrow; Przemyśl Fortress Transferred to Soviet Union

(Warsaw) The city defense command recently issued a communiqué stating that it has agreed with the German commander on the method of surrendering the city, which will be implemented today. The German side allows Polish officers to continue to wear their swords and allows all soldiers to return to their hometowns. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

(Warsaw) The Warsaw garrison and the German commander have reached a compromise. The Warsaw garrison must not be detained, but must be sent home. According to the German announcement, more than 100,000 Polish soldiers have been disarmed. It is expected that the German army will not enter Poland before Sunday. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)

(Bern, Switzerland) The German High Command recently issued a communiqué stating that the Przemyśl Fortress in southeastern Poland, originally occupied by Germany, was transferred to Soviet troops yesterday. In addition, after the Warsaw city garrison surrendered, it is now being gradually dispersed, which is expected to take two or three days to complete. The German army will enter the city on October 2nd. The garrison of the Modlin Fortress west of Warsaw has also collapsed and surrendered. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Berlin The German Command announced this afternoon that the current situation of the eastern front is nearing completion. 269 Polish officers and 5,000 soldiers at the Modlin bridgehead south of the Vistula River have surrendered. (Haitong telegram dated 30th)

Berlin The German High Command claimed that the Polish garrison in Warsaw has begun to withdraw, and the German army is preparing to occupy Warsaw on Monday. After the German army enters the city, it will immediately begin to provide medical relief to the wounded soldiers and civilians. Among the Warsaw garrison who surrendered unconditionally, there are 1,200 Polish officers, 30,000 soldiers, and 14,000 wounded soldiers. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)

Berlin According to various newspapers, Prince Dietipo, as a lieutenant in the army, participated in the Polish war and has been killed in battle at the age of 23. His father, Duke of Letipo, owns many properties, coal mines, and factories in Austria and Upper Silesia, and is one of Germany's richest men. In addition to the prince, there are also four daughters and one son. (Haitong telegram dated 30th)

### German Submarines Cause Trouble; Swedish Shipping Paralyzed; Denmark Clears Mines from the Sea

Stockholm, Sweden, heard that Sweden's shipping industry throughout the world has almost been paralyzed due to submarine attacks. It is widely believed that the Swedish commercial delegation currently in London should request a more effective escort system. The reason why the Swedish merchant ship Nerland was sunk by a submarine off the coast of Norway yesterday is incomprehensible, because the ship is a neutral country's vessel, departing from a neutral port and sailing to another neutral port. Local newspapers stated that the maritime war has apparently shifted to the territorial waters of the Scandinavian countries, and that the British claim that Britain's method of resisting submarines is now extremely effective may be proven by this. According to the captain of the Nerland, when he was on the German submarine, he was sure that the submarine had received detailed information from the land about the ship's movements. Other shipping industry people also said that an espionage system with many members and a well-organized organization must be at work. It has now been discovered here that some foreigners who used to live frugally have recently spent extravagantly. According to a visit to Antwerp, Belgium, by the Paris Evening News, 5,300 tons of ore sand delivered to the Liege steel plant in Belgium have sunk to the bottom of the sea along with the Nerland. The sinking of this ship has aroused the indignation of the people in Antwerp. The shipping industry is now suggesting that the governments of the countries that participated in the Oslo Conference should lodge a protest. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)

Stockholm, Sweden After the Swedish freighter "Nierlant" was sunk by a German submarine in the western waters of Norway yesterday, the government recently ordered the minister to Berlin to protest to the German government, and stated that "the goods carried by the 'Nierlant' were transported to neutral Belgium, and should not be considered contraband. We hereby reserve the right to claim compensation for damages." (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Bern, Switzerland The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that Germany and Britain have laid a large number of mines in the southwest waters of Denmark. The Danish authorities have decided to clear them, and have organized a fleet to search for them everywhere in order to protect the country's shipping safety. During the last European war, Denmark also worked hard to clear the mines laid by the belligerent countries, totaling no less than 10,000. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Oslo, Norway After the Norwegian ships "Djerv" and "Jorn" were sunk in the North Sea and the "Solas" was sunk in Skagerrak, a spy fled Norway yesterday. It is widely believed that the activity of German submarines is related to the activities of these spies in various Scandinavian ports. After they find out the date and itinerary of the ship's movements, they report to the Berlin authorities. The Norwegian authorities have paid close attention to this matter. The crew members of the "Djerv" and "Jorn" received warnings before being attacked and were allowed to go to Sangegaard on lifeboats. The crew members of the "Solas" were rescued by a Swedish ship. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)

Berlin In the past two days, German destroyers and torpedo boats have searched 45 ships coming and going in Skagerrak and Kattegat, some of which were arrested for carrying wartime contraband. (Haitong telegram dated 30th)

### Pan-American Conference Examines Proposals from Various Countries; Venezuelan Representative Proposes Drawing a "Neutral Space" in the Sky

Panama City The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to hold a full secret meeting tomorrow. Today, the Economic, Peace, and Neutrality Subcommittees will examine the proposals of various countries separately. The representatives of Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay have jointly submitted a proposal on wartime trade issues. The representatives of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina are studying a proposal to delineate a safe zone around the Americas. In addition, the representative of Venezuela submitted a proposal on protecting neutrality, advocating that the American countries must decide on a common attitude towards submarines, aircraft carriers, all warships, and armed freighters of the belligerent countries, and propose that in addition to delineating a safe zone along the coast of the Americas, a "neutral space" should also be drawn in the sky. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Panama City Informed sources at the Pan-American Conference learned last night that the subcommittee has decided to remove the item of food from the list of contraband. This proposal was submitted to the conference by Argentina and Uruguay. However, the United States and Argentina cannot agree on the issue of neutrality. The United States' position is that there is no need to set up a uniform blockade zone around the Americas, and each country should decide to set up a zone of 50 or 100 miles, but war activities must be stopped near ordinary transport lines. The United States will oppose Argentina's request for the right of neutral countries to freely make loans. The United States pointed out that it is difficult for the country to approve this motion of South American countries, that is, to obtain loans from the United States and then lend them to the belligerent countries. (Haitong telegram dated 30th)

Mexico City The Senate recently passed the Neutrality Law under emergency procedures, prohibiting all submarines of the belligerent countries from entering Mexico's territorial waters and prohibiting all aircraft of these countries from flying into Mexico's airspace. This Neutrality Law is used to supplement the International Law signed at the Hague Peace Conference in 1907. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Panama City Representatives of various countries at the Pan-American Conference continued to hold talks today, still focusing on the topic of delineating a safe zone on the western periphery of the Americas. The conference is waiting for the proposals to be submitted by the representatives of the United States and Cuba. Other representatives have already unanimously expressed their approval of the principle of this proposal. In addition, people at the conference commented extensively on the establishment of various agreements between Germany and the Soviet Union yesterday, saying that the only consequence of this move is enough to make the representatives of certain countries who sympathize with Germany feel disgusted.

### Submarines Appear Along the Coast of the United States; Nationality Unknown

Washington President Roosevelt recently told the press that the government has repeatedly received reports that submarines of unknown nationality have appeared along the coast of the United States. After investigation by the national fleet, it has been found that this report is indeed true. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

### French Newspaper Reports Goebbels Dismissed

Paris The Petit Parisien reported from Stockholm that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels has been dismissed and detained in a "sanatorium" belonging to the Propaganda Department. Goebbels' "disfavor" was due to trading in currencies. Hitler had been planning to detain Goebbels for a long time. (Reuters telegram dated 30th)

### United States Maintains Neutral Attitude Towards European War; Avoids Getting Involved in Territorial Disputes

Washington Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that he had not heard of the rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union had proposed peace talks, advocating the convening of a peace conference and inviting a neutral country, namely Italy or the United States, to attend and participate. The reason why the aggressor countries propose peace talks is obviously to legitimize their conquests. If the United States were to participate, it would definitely not be approved by public opinion in the country. President Roosevelt also told the press that he knew nothing about the invitation to the United States to attend the peace conference. This kind of rumor is indeed very suspicious to us. Informed sources said that even if Germany and the Soviet Union launched such an initiative, it would be difficult for the United States to accept it, because the current foreign policy of the United States is to try its best to avoid getting involved in the vortex of European countries' territorial issues. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Washington President Roosevelt reiterated at the press conference yesterday the United States' intention to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war, and said that all questions can be answered with this. However, the President was unwilling to discuss the amendments to the Neutrality Act and the Western Hemisphere security zone. A reporter at the scene once requested the announcement of the industrial mobilization plan, and the President's answer was not only very slow, but also very deliberate. He said roughly, "We have not participated in the war, and I don't think we will participate in the war, so I think this matter may not be valued by the public." In addition, the President reiterated that all actions of the government are implemented in accordance with the principles of peace, because the United States hopes to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war. The President also said that the national patrol ships have received reports of foreign submarines operating in the waters of the United States, but no evidence has been obtained yet. (Associated Press telegram dated 30th)

New York After Germany and the Soviet Union concluded an agreement in Moscow yesterday, the news that they would immediately propose peace proposals to Britain and France was published by local newspapers with headlines such as "Peace of Gangster Robbers," and editorials were published at the same time, roughly saying that no American opinion would have any illusions about the meaning and value of this kind of peace offensive. The Democratic New York Times stated that "Britain and France can never accept peace under such circumstances. The agreement concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union is more like propaganda material than a practical treaty. Its only major consequence is the obstacles that Britain and France may encounter in rebuilding an independent Poland in the future, not only Germany, but also Germany and the Soviet Union." The Republican People's Advocate stated that if Britain and France accepted the peace talks at this moment, it would be equivalent to a temporary truce. "After the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union was concluded, the Führer Hitler failed to regard himself as a victor, but wanted to achieve peace, because he was unwilling to make any concessions to Britain and France, and only used force to seize peace. The German-Soviet treaty is just a few scraps of paper, and it is not enough to bring about peace." (Havas telegram dated 30th)

### US Senator Pittman Talks; Johnson Act to be Amended; Amendment Proposed by Wall Street to be Discussed by US Senate Tomorrow

Washington Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told the press that the amendment I proposed is to amend the Johnson Act to a certain extent. (Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid their debts to the United States may not obtain loans in the United States again.) "Because the Johnson Act was established in peacetime, now that the European war has broken out, we must have a way to deal with the new situation in Europe. Germany does not owe the United States any war debts. According to the Johnson Act, it can borrow loans from American citizens. On the contrary, Britain and France are restricted by this law and have no way to obtain fear-term loans in the United States. I do not believe that the Senate is willing to facilitate Germany and make Britain and France suffer disadvantages. This is why the Johnson Act must be amended." (Havas telegram dated 29th)

Washington The Senate is scheduled to submit the Neutrality Act Amendment (i.e., the amendment proposed by Pittman, Chairman of the Committee) passed by the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion on the 2nd of next month. The senators of both the pro and con factions are currently busy drafting speeches. At that time, there will be a heated debate with sharp tongues and swords. Political figures believe that the center of the debate between the two sides will be nothing more than two points: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause, (2) Giving each belligerent country a credit loan of 90 days. Regarding the second point, Johnson, the creator of the Johnson Act and the Republican Senator Johnson, strongly opposes it, but the current Neutrality Act does not prohibit the American people from giving short-term loans to the belligerent countries. However, when the Senate discusses it, it may mention the war debt issue and cause criticism from the isolationists, so the passage of the Pittman Amendment may be more difficult, which is a matter of concern. (Havas telegram dated 29th)

### Japan Hopes to Reopen English-Japanese Negotiations to Discuss Tianjin Issues

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today carried news that the English-Japanese conference will soon resume, stating that after the establishment of the Abe Cabinet, the British Ambassador, Craigie, formally proposed continuing the English-Japanese talks. This was likely around September 5th. Kato, the Japanese special envoy in China, is expected to meet with Craigie today. The British Embassy neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of a meeting between Kato and the British Ambassador today. It is heard that the Japanese side proposed that the issue of the Tianjin incident should be brought up for discussion again from the point established on August 15th. The Asahi Shimbun claims that Britain is forced by the European war to change its policy towards Japan, but the Japanese government has no such intention. The English-Japanese talks broke down as a result of direct clashes of opinions, and there have been no major changes in international relations or the Far Eastern situation. The Japanese government is now willing to temporarily set aside the general rights issues between England and Japan and discuss issues of maintaining public order in Tianjin and other places. Britain has withdrawn its Consul-General in Tianjin, Jameson, and will soon recall its Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen. These moves by Britain give people the belief that there may eventually be a fundamental adjustment in English-Japanese relations in China. However, discussions on such fundamental issues are not yet ripe, because Japan's proposal to Britain and France on September 5th to withdraw their troops from China is still pending. Regarding this matter, Britain and France must first take concrete steps. The Hochi Shimbun claims that Japan will insist that Britain must abandon its pro-Chiang Kai-shek policy to comply with the spirit of the Arita-Craigie Agreement. The Kokumin Shimbun states that it is now known that Foreign Minister Nomura's proposed changes to the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be completed before the resumption of the English-Japanese talks. Therefore, it is still questionable whether Kato will remain the chief Japanese representative in the English-Japanese negotiations, as Kato will be responsible for important matters related to the organization of the Wang Jingwei new regime. It is said that the person mainly handling the English-Japanese talks will be Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tani Masayuki. (Reuters, 30th)

Tokyo: This morning, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while receiving reporters from Japanese newspapers, strongly denied the news carried by the Asahi Shimbun and other newspapers that the English-Japanese conference on the Tianjin incident would be resumed soon, saying that the Japanese government has not yet received any proposal from the British side regarding the continuation of the Tokyo conference. Observers here who are qualified believe that the Japanese government, in view of the international situation, is now adopting a cautious attitude towards resuming this conference. Unless there is a real prospect of a peaceful resolution to the various issues between England and Japan, the Japanese government may not accept the British proposal, even if there is one, because if the second English-Japanese conference is suspended again, the relationship between the two governments will inevitably deteriorate further. (Reuters, 30th)

### Amau Promoted to Japanese Ambassador to Italy

Tokyo: According to official sources today, the Minister to Switzerland, Amau, has been appointed as the Ambassador to Italy. Amau is fifty-two years old and has rich experience in European affairs. In 1937, he served as the Minister to Switzerland and concurrently as the Director of the Japanese Delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva. During the second half of the Great War, he served as a secretary at the Japanese Embassy in London. In 1919, he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Paris Peace Conference, and later transferred to Berlin. He served as the Japanese representative at the Washington Naval Conference. In 1923, he served as the Consul-General in Guangzhou, and later served as the Consul-General in Harbin, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Chinese army has won another great victory on the south bank of the Miluo River, and the morale of the front line is even higher. (30th telegram)

Changsha: After the Chinese army in northern Hunan was ordered on the 25th to make an active strategic shift, it used mobile warfare in conjunction with positional warfare to sandwich the Japanese army in Nanbo and Miluo on the outskirts of Changsha. On the 28th and 29th, it ambushed the Japanese army in Fulinpu, killing more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers in total. After the battle of Xinqiang, the Japanese army suffered another heavy blow, which was quite棘手 (棘手: troublesome). (30th telegram)

Changsha: The Japanese army in Shuanghuajian, between Fulinpu and Jinjing, reinforced its eastward attack on Jinjing again on the morning of the 30th, but was bravely resisted by the Chinese army, with more than 700 casualties. The Chinese army also captured more than 10 machine guns. The battle was still fierce at the site on the evening of the 30th. Also, a group of Japanese troops from Shangshiji, 60 li south of Fulinpu, harassed the area, and were also met with Chinese counterattacks. On the 30th, the fighting on the outskirts of Changsha was most intense in the Jinjing Shangshiji area. (30th telegram)

Changsha: The Japanese army that invaded southwards along the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway sneaked to Qiaotouyi, 60 li north of Changsha, from Sanxingqiao, and a fierce battle occurred there with the Chinese army. On the morning of the 30th, they were still in a standoff in the nearby mountains. Another group of Japanese troops that invaded southwards along Fulinpu were ambushed by the Chinese army on the 29th and suffered heavy setbacks. Although the Japanese army sent a part of it east to Jinjing, 40 li south of Pingjiang, in an attempt to eliminate the threat on its flanks, it was painfully blocked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 30th, and suffered heavy casualties. It has now retreated west and stopped at Shuanghuajian between Fulinpu and Jinjing, waiting for reinforcements. Also, Xiangyin has fallen on the 27th. The Japanese army is now sending minesweepers to clear the blockade on the river north of Xiangyin day and night, in an attempt to use the gunboats of the Dongting Fleet to go up the river and help invade Changsha. (30th telegram)

Chongqing: Today, we received military news from the Chinese side, stating that the Chinese army on the west bank of the Han River in northern Hubei crossed the river on September 27th and launched a general attack on the Japanese army's positions on the east bank in order to reduce the pressure exerted by the Japanese army on Changsha. The Chinese army on the opposite bank of Zhongxiang has captured Changshoudian and is now shelling the Japanese army's positions in the southern suburbs of Zhongxiang. The Chinese army is also advancing towards Yingshan and the vicinity of Suixian, west of Wushengguan on the Pinghan Road, northwest of Hankou. Another Chinese army is also advancing towards Xinyang and Pingjingguan on the Pinghan Road. At the same time, the Japanese army north of Changsha divided into two routes yesterday to invade southward. One route advanced along the Guangdong-Hankou Road and has reached Sanjiqiao (transliteration), and the other Japanese force advanced along the old road to Changsha and has reached Fulinpu. Japanese planes bombed Xiangtan and Zhuzhou yesterday, and Japanese reconnaissance planes also flew over Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling. (Reuters, 30th)

Chongqing: Today, we received military news from the front line in northern Hunan, stating that there is fierce fighting near Xiangyin and Baishui near the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The battle east of the railway in Pingjiang is in progress. The Japanese army there is now trying to advance towards Changsha along the main road from Hankou to Changsha. The Chinese army is resisting strongly, and a certain commander is personally supervising the battle at the front line. (Reuters, 20th)

Guilin: The battles on the outskirts of Changsha have been extremely fierce in recent days. The Chinese army, which is firmly defending the junction of Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Changsha, has used the precipitous mountains to inflict heavy losses on the Japanese army. The Japanese attempt to advance south has obviously suffered a major blow. On the morning of the 29th, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers, who sneaked to Baiyu, Qiaotouyi (north of the Yangtze River), and Shangshiji along the railway line, were attacked by the Chinese army in different directions. After suffering casualties, they did not dare to advance further. There was fierce fighting in Kuzhukou (northeast of Qingshan City) in the area between Qiaotouyi and Shangshiji. In addition, a part of the Japanese army, more than 300 strong, invaded Huayong'an City (33 kilometers from Changsha) at 3 pm on the 29th. The Chinese army immediately took the posture of encirclement and annihilation and blocked it. The Japanese army dared not fight back and fled to the northeast. (30th telegram)

Changsha: After the Chinese army inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army on the line north of Baishui and south of Daqiao in the past few days, the position has become more stable, and the Japanese army's offensive has also been frustrated. The Japanese army in Fengxin invaded westward on the evening of the 29th, aiming to increase the Japanese flames in northern Hunan, but suffered heavy casualties in a battle near Shangfu. (30th telegram)

Chongqing: He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, today denied the rumors that Changsha had fallen, and said that the Chinese army is determined not to let the Japanese army easily occupy Changsha. According to military news obtained here today, the fighting is currently the fiercest in the Xiangyin area. After a day of fierce fighting yesterday, the front line has expanded to the east and west. The closest point of the Japanese army to Changsha is Malinpu, which is only 45 kilometers away from Changsha. The Japanese army that crossed the Miluo River to the south advanced in two routes yesterday. One route advanced along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and the other route advanced along the ancient road on the east bank of the Miluo River. It is reported that this is the location personally commanded by the commander of the Chinese army. Also, in the past three days, Changsha has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese planes day and night, with more than 200 bombs dropped. Wenyizhong School (transliteration), Zhizhong School (transliteration), and thousands of other houses and thatched houses outside the East Gate have been destroyed. At the same time, Xiangtan, the junction of highways, and Zhuzhou, the junction of railways, were also bombed yesterday morning. (Associated Press, 30th)

Chongqing: According to front-line news received here today, the Chinese army in northwestern Hubei Province is now concentrating on a powerful counterattack against Japan in order to relieve the danger in Changsha. The Chinese army in Suixian is advancing rapidly towards Yingshan and Pingjingguan, threatening the positions of the Japanese army in Leidonggu and Xihe. The Chinese army that crossed the Han River northwest of Zhongxiang captured Changshoudian on Wednesday. According to the military spokesman here recently, most of the Japanese troops attacking Changsha were transferred from Hubei Province. (Associated Press, 30th)

Fancheng: The Japanese army, in order to cooperate with the battles in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, has been restless in Xinyang recently, feigning attacks on Pingchangguan and Wanggang from east to west. There have been artillery sounds from time to time. On the 20th, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers bombarded Yuelou Wujiapo and other places via Wulidian with more than a hundred rounds of shells, appearing to be invading Luoshan. (30th telegram)

Guilin: The Japanese army, which invaded the Chinese territory of Pingjiang via Tongcheng and around Jiangxi Province, was divided into two routes. One route, with more than a thousand infantry and cavalry and four cannons, invaded south via Benshaqiao and Zhuxichang on the evening of the 27th. At 9 am on the 28th, it came into contact with the Chinese garrison in the area north of Longmenchang (110 li northeast of Pingjiang). The other route was the main force of the Japanese army, which crossed the Gaiwenling and attacked the northwest side of the Jiangshiguan Chinese Longmenchang. The Chinese army resisted the danger in the Wan Mountains. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The Japanese army was exposed to corpses everywhere and suffered heavy losses. The battle in the north also intensified from morning to noon. The Chinese army charged back and forth, and more than half of the Japanese army was killed or wounded. Then, on the border (5 li north of Longmenchang), a situation of confrontation across the river was formed. Until the evening of the 29th, more than 200 Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes sneaked to the vicinity of Longmen south of 口口口. The Chinese army is encircling and annihilating them. Also, starting from the morning of the 29th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Taoshugang from both sides, and another unit attacked the flanks of the Japanese army in Longmenchang from the area of 口口. The rear of the Japanese army has been cut off. (30th telegram)

Hong Kong: According to a telegram from Changsha, the battle in northern Hunan is still stalemated near Baishui Street. The Japanese army in Dongting continues to move restlessly and is sending reinforcements to Yingtian. The Japanese army invading southern Hubei is fighting fiercely with the Chinese army and has the potential to invade Pingjiang. The Chinese army is blocking them. The Chinese army attacking Zhongxiang has captured Changshoudian and is pressing on Suixian. (30th telegram)

### General Li Zongren Talks About the Reasons for China's Inevitable Victory, Launching a Full-Scale General Counterattack When the Time is Favorable. The Purpose of Attrition Will Soon Be Achieved.

Chongqing: Before General Li Zongren returned to the front line this week, he told the Associated Press reporter, "China is now on the road to victory. China can achieve final victory when one of the following three conditions is met: (1) When the Chinese army launches a full-scale general counterattack at a favorable time; (2) When China's war of attrition against Japan causes widespread war-weariness among the invaders; (3) When external pressure on Japan greatly increases." According to General Li, China can continue to fight for many years in order to fully realize the above three conditions, but he believes that it is not necessary to test the people's perseverance to the extreme. General Li continued, "The 33 divisions that Japan initially sent to China can be said to have been almost completely exhausted. The Japanese side has repeatedly attempted to encircle and destroy China's elite, but every decision has failed. As for today, the battle situation is completely different from the early stages of the war. In the early stages of the war, the Japanese side was able to concentrate a large number of troops because it could use the superior transportation lines along the coast, the river, and the railway. As for now, the front lines are too scattered, and the Japanese army can no longer concentrate on one or several points. Even if the Japanese army can concentrate on one or several points, we can easily cut off its rear transportation lines. On the other hand, our troop strength can be said to be increasing every day, and millions of new soldiers have been trained. When the time is favorable, when the success of the general counterattack is certain, our new army will launch a large-scale counterattack. When this time comes, the initiative will be in our hands, so only we can know where to attack and when to attack. At the same time, the large amount of troops we use will surely make the other party flee at the sight of us. Even if Japan opens up the country to send reinforcements, it will be in a doomed position. Furthermore, the current Sino-Japanese war is a stimulant for China in terms of spirit, but the morale of the Japanese side, whether on the battlefield or in the rear, has gradually declined. In the early stages of the war, the Japanese soldiers we captured often committed suicide by cutting their abdomens, and none of them were willing to answer questions from the Chinese side or provide information. But today, the situation has changed greatly. Most Japanese soldiers are happy to find opportunities to surrender to us because the war has been prolonged and completely contrary to the expectations of their superiors. At the same time, when they arrive at the prisoner-of-war camp, they see that life is very peaceful, and they are willing to talk freely. Therefore, a lot of valuable information from the Japanese side is obtained. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers we are encountering now are not as scary as in the early stages of the war. The Japanese soldiers who come to China today are either older or younger. Among them, what the former misses most is the problem of the living pressure of their families during the prolonged war." General Li Zongren, the commander of the northern Yangtze River theater in central China, has been in Chongqing for several days and has discussed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. When he flew back to the theater headquarters, he had a three-hour long talk with the reporter (from 11 pm to 2 am). General Li was full of energy and was very interested in talking, but the reporter was almost exhausted during this long meeting. According to General Li, his subordinates, in addition to being able to fight the Japanese army on the positions, also use lightning-fast guerrilla tactics from time to time to cut off the rear transportation lines of the Japanese army on the Pinghan Line, the Longhai Line, and the highways in the areas nominally occupied by the Japanese army. Talking about the current Japanese offensive against Changsha, General Li believes that the Chinese side has sufficient preparations to cope with the Japanese offensive and more than enough. However, if the Japanese side uses absolutely superior force, the Chinese side should abandon Changsha, just as it has abandoned other cities in the past, but not sacrifice the troops needed when the general counterattack period comes. Furthermore, even if the Japanese take Changsha, they cannot control the entire section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and even the Wuchang section they control can be cut off by the Chinese side from time to time. Moreover, the purpose of the Japanese taking Changsha is not military, but political, because the anti-war sentiment in Japan is extremely strong and there must be news of a new victory to excite them. But in the end, the Japanese army will be cut into pieces by the Chinese side and annihilated. (Associated Press Far East Manager Marshall, 29th)

### China Has No Possibility of Peace Until the War of Resistance is Won. Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Special Statement to Supplement His Talk on the 27th.

Chongqing: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui previously told Marshall, the Far East manager of the Associated Press, that the United States is in the position of a mediator in the Sino-Japanese war. Now Dr. Wang has issued a supplementary statement to this remark in order to clarify his position. The statement stated, "I said in my speech on September 27th that the National Government is determined to resist until the end, until China achieves final victory. I now say that our war of resistance against Japan is not only for the independence and integrity of China, but also for the maintenance of international treaties (including the Nine-Power Treaty). We will never lay down our weapons unless this goal is achieved. As for the level of the United States' position in the Far East mentioned in my speech, this is my personal opinion. My personal opinion is that the United States can indeed achieve a great deal in the Far East in terms of the situation. The United States has the power to seek a fair solution to the Sino-Japanese war based on the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the note to Japan on December 31, 1938. At the same time, this action by the United States is also in line with the policies we have always held. However, my views should not be misunderstood, because I know deeply that only when the goal of China's war of resistance can be achieved and the final victory can be achieved, will peace be possible." It is reported that the reason why Foreign Minister Wang continued to issue this statement was that foreign reporters, seeing his talk with Marshall, asked him to provide a more complete and clear explanation of the basis on which the United States could serve as a mediator. (Associated Press, 20th)

Hong Kong: In the Foreign Minister's talk, it was said that it was most appropriate for the United States to speak to Japan at this time, and it was not specified that the United States was expected to mediate. Because the Associated Press added emphasis, causing misunderstandings in all parties, there will probably be some explanation. (Special telegram, 20th)

### Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recovers Monanzhen. The Remaining Japanese Troops Collapse to the Southwest. The Chinese Army is in Pursuit of Victory.

Luoyang: On the southern Shanxi front, the Japanese army, which converged from Yuxiang, Ershililing, and Fenglingdu, and invaded eastward, is now entrenched in Ruicheng with about a thousand people, about eight or nine hundred in the southern village, about eight or nine hundred in the Nan'ai village, and about four or five hundred in the Ximo village and Weigong village area. The Japanese army in Monanzhen has been fiercely besieged by the Chinese × unit for days, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. On the 27th, the Chinese army launched a renewed bayonet assault and captured it in one fell swoop. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed to the southwest, and the Chinese × unit took advantage of the momentum to pursue, and has reached Weigong village and continued to attack Ruicheng. (Telegram, 29th)

Luoyang: The Japanese army in the three strongholds of Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan, which were besieged by the Chinese army, has suffered heavy casualties after two months of separate annihilation. Although the Japanese army has broken through several times, it has been fiercely intercepted by the Chinese, and has not succeeded so far. Since last week, the Japanese army has changed its strategy, on the one hand, holding on to the corner, and on the other hand, launching battles on the north end of the Baijin Highway and the middle side of the Hongtun Highway, in an attempt to cooperate. The battles between the two sides in recent days have been extremely fierce. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Guchengzhen (north of Qin County) in Qin County invaded eastward in separate routes on the 26th and fell into Wuxiang at Chenshi on the 27th. A certain Chinese unit has rushed to the residence to meet the attack. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in Liao County also invaded southwestward in separate routes on the 25th, one part westward through Xiaolingdi and fell into Guoshe on the 26th, and one part southward into Wenquan, attempting to echo the Japanese army in Dongyangguan. In addition, on the Hongtun Highway, the Japanese army in Fuchengzhen fell into Nankongtan on the 27th and contacted the Japanese army in Mabi (north of Qinshui) in an attempt to aid Changzhi. At this moment, the Chinese army from all directions has begun simultaneous operations on the inner and outer lines, and is fiercely encircling and annihilating the Japanese army. (Telegram, 30th)

### Guerrilla Warfare in Central Anhui Achieves Double Victory

(Fancheng) The guerrilla warfare in central Anhui has recently won another victory. The Japanese army, which was confronting the Chinese army at Xiatangji, which belongs to Hefei County on the Huainan Road, suddenly crossed Zhuangmuqiao on the morning of the 22nd, and occupied Caojia'an, and joined forces with the Japanese army in Zhuxiang, totaling more than 500 people, with three cannons attached, and fled towards Shouxian. It was blocked by a certain Chinese unit in Dagudui, and finally turned to defend the nearby mountains due to insufficient firepower. Although the market town was lost, it was counterattacked and recovered by the Chinese that night. The remaining Japanese troops broke through and fled towards Maxu, and were ambushed by the Chinese army in Laishanji, and fled back to Baijia'an in a panic. It is estimated that more than 100 Japanese troops were killed in this battle, and many trophies were seized. (2) On the morning of the 21st, more than 200 Japanese troops in Chaoxian invaded Yuncao and were repelled by the Chinese army, and more than 20 Japanese troops were killed.

### Coal Mines in Jiaozuo and Other Places Rebel

(Shaanzhou) Since being invaded by Japan, the Zhongfu, Yaxin, Minning, and Minyou coal mines in Jiaozuo have been deliberately oppressing the Chinese mine police force. The captains Yan Sihe and Xu Mingyuan were extremely indignant. On the 24th, taking advantage of the Chinese army's attack, they suddenly led more than 300 troops to rebel, attacking the rear of the Japanese army. All the Japanese troops were annihilated by the Chinese army, and the machinery for Japanese coal production in the mine, worth 2 million yuan for 80 tons, was completely destroyed. In this battle, more than 180 Japanese troops, including Lieutenant Tanaka, were killed, and many ammunition, military supplies, and documents were seized. The mine police force has now been incorporated into the Chinese army and is awaiting orders to kill the enemy. (Telegram, 29th)

### Soviet-German Partition of Poland, Redrawing Borders, Industrial Areas Included in German Territory, Most Oil Wells Belong to the Soviets

(Moscow) Germany and the Soviet Union yesterday signed a border demarcation treaty, redrawing the boundaries of the areas occupied by both sides in Poland. There were many revisions to the provisional boundaries delineated by both sides on the 22nd of this month. The cities of Siedlce and Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, which had originally been ceded to the Soviet Union, are now assigned to Germany. The town of Praga (east bank of the Vistula River), near Warsaw, will also no longer see Soviet troops. All areas purely inhabited by Poles have been placed under German rule. Even the area near the town of Suwałki, between Lithuania and East Prussia in Germany, has been assigned to Germany. What the Soviet Union has gained are areas inhabited by Ukrainians and Little Russians. It appears the new boundaries largely conform to ethnic distribution. As for the city of Vilnius in northern Poland, an important railway hub, although currently owned by the Soviet Union, it is highly likely it will be returned to Lithuania. In addition, cities such as Grodno, Białystok, Brest-Litovsk, Lviv, and Przemyśl have all been assigned to the Soviet Union. In terms of economic benefits, except for the textile and sugar industries of Lviv and the oil region in eastern Galicia, most of Poland's industrial centers have been included within German territory. (Havas Agency, 29th)

(London) According to the agreement signed by Germany and the Soviet Union in Moscow yesterday, 80% of Poland's oil wells are owned by the Soviet Union, and Lviv, the largest city in southeastern Poland, and the area bordering Romania and Hungary, have also been assigned to Soviet territory. In addition to Lublin, Germany occupies Siedlce and Biała Podlaska east of the Vistula River. Current attention is focused on the provision in the German-Soviet agreement for exchanging Soviet raw materials for German manufactured goods, and the question of how this will affect the war. Transporting large quantities of raw materials across a long distance of land via the Soviet Union is a difficult problem. In addition, there is another difficulty, which is the Soviet Union's own domestic needs, the most obvious being the supply of oil. Although Soviet oil production has increased in the past eight years, it has all been absorbed by domestic demand. Apart from these practical considerations, some people also hold the opinion that the Soviet Union expects this decisive battle to result in a German revolution, so that the Soviet Union can turn it into a communist country. Therefore, does the Soviet Union want Germany to collapse sooner, or provide some assistance to Germany to prolong the war and make the situation worse, so that it can profit from it? This is the question. (Reuters, 30th)

### Charity Tennis Tournament Kicks Off Yesterday, Continues Today, Li Guofan Wins Lido Cup, Xu Chengwei and Wang Wenzheng Tie

The much-publicized charity tennis tournament kicked off yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Tennis Club on Avenue Joffre, with a large gathering of elegant ladies, making it a grand occasion. Including the handicap Group A final, a total of matches were showcased. Li Guofan defeated Zhang Dingzhao two sets to zero, winning the Lido Cup. Xu Chengwei and Wang Wenzheng each won one set. In the McCall singles, Tao Maonv defeated Wang Miaosong to win the finals spot. The event will continue today from 1:30 PM, with an even more exciting program. Yesterday's tickets are still valid. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:

Ribbon-Cutting and Opening Serve

The handicap Group A singles final between Li Guofan and Zhang Dingzhao started first. Li's tennis skills have improved rapidly, and he won the championship two sets to zero. The Lido Cup was presented by Gao Huai'de, president of the Lido Sports Association, to be held for one year. Then, Madam Fan Xiangwen, wife of Qiu Maolin, cut the ribbon. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General of the Refugee Association, delivered a speech, and Dr. Shi Zhaoji, former ambassador to the United States, served the opening ball. The ceremony was grand, and the charity tennis tournament was declared open.

Auction of Velvet Balls

During the break, three tennis balls used in the match were auctioned off, presided over by Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mrs. Bu Lisheng. Various philanthropists competed to donate generously. Mr. Chen Qihao opened with a price of 100 yuan. Mr. Bu Lisheng, Pan Zhiquan, Chen Kui, and Qiu Maolin competed in the bidding, and finally Mr. Qiu Maolin purchased them for 450 yuan. The total ticket revenue, in addition to the 2,599 yuan in advance sales, was another 114 yuan sold at the entrance yesterday (including five 5-yuan tickets, sixteen 3-yuan tickets, and forty-one 1-yuan tickets). The balls used in today's matches will also be auctioned off. It is expected that the revenue for the two days will exceed 3,500 yuan, greatly benefiting the distressed compatriots. The auctioned balls will be accompanied by a brocade box provided by the Refugee Association, and signed by Mr. Yu and Yuan, and Qiu to commemorate the event.

Performance Highlights

In the handicap Group A final, Li Guofan defeated Zhang Dingzhao at level scores, 6-2, 7-5, winning two sets in a row. Only the second set was slightly competitive. Li's tennis skills have improved significantly in recent years. His serve and forehand are both excellent, definitely better than Zhang Dingzhao. If Li could have utilized net play in the second set, victory would have been easier. The McCall singles semi-final between Tao Maonv and Wang Miaosong was entirely a performance of baseline long shots and power. The only drawback of McCall's tennis is the lack of variety. Besides groundstrokes, there were no overheads, smashes, or net play. Both players' forehand and backhand groundstrokes were extremely proficient. Tao had several angled shots that were rarely seen. Her skills were much better than Wang's. Wang Miaosong's footwork was messy and she tried to go to the net many times, but she couldn't smash, and ultimately failed. Xu Chengwei's tennis skills are completely different from when he participated in the National Games, enough to overwhelm Wang Wenzheng. His forehand and backhand groundstrokes are both excellent, his forehand bearing much resemblance to his elder brother's style. It is a pity that he still lacks stability. His serve is still not reliable. Li Guofan and he are the most promising young people. Wang Wenzheng seems to have reached his peak and it is difficult for him to excel further. The final doubles match was unremarkable, merely a performance.

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Take Advantage of Low Prices to Buy, Cash Gold Rises Sharply After Falling, Settlement at Foreign Exchange Rates Gradually Tightening

Yesterday, the black market situation of cash gold showed initial weakness due to easing foreign exchange rates. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates returned to normal and Hong Kong banks showed strong buying interest, there was a strong rebound. As a result, although foreign exchange rates balanced out, the price of gold soared by 80 yuan. As a result, settlement at foreign exchange rates tightened slightly. The settlement price for British gold was 4,598 yuan, and the settlement price for US dollars was 4,710 yuan. The trend yesterday was that the morning opening was slightly weak due to loose foreign exchange rates, and the price was pushed down slightly to 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm and securities firms began selling, and the price retreated to a low of 3,990 yuan twice. As foreign exchange rates suddenly softened, it stimulated buying interest, and some money exchange businesses and securities firms rushed to buy. In addition, a certain silver building also turned from selling to buying. Soon after, Hong Kong banks also came to buy aggressively, so the price soared, once reaching a high of 4,105 yuan. However, the afternoon close was 4,100 yuan. In the afternoon, because there was no market on Saturday, the preliminary meeting outside the market reached 4,080 yuan. Later, Hong Kong banks had strong demand, and the price rose to 4,100 yuan again. Trading in the first half of the day was still active, at 1,400 to 1,500 taels. The price of silver building ornaments increased by 10 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained stable.

Gold Rises 80 Yuan

Since the morning, the initial opening price per bar (10 taels) was weak due to loose foreign exchange rates and a certain gold firm having a strong desire to sell. The market was sluggish from the opening, and the price was lowered by 20 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels, calling for 4,000 yuan. After the opening, the gold firm sold 10 taels to the money exchange business at 3,990 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business suddenly bought over 100 taels on behalf of a customer, and the sellers took the opportunity to raise the price, so the price increased by 25 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 10 taels each from the securities firms and silver building firms at 4,015 yuan. After this, the gold firm started selling again, and the securities firms also came to sell, coupled with customers temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the price could not support itself and fell again, retreating into the 4,000 yuan range. A certain Yu firm sold 10 taels to the silver building firm at 3,990 yuan. Soon after, foreign exchange rates softened, and another securities firm suddenly showed buying interest. In addition, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought on behalf of Hong Kong banks, coupled with a shortage of sellers, so the price soared, rising sharply by 80 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels at 4,070 yuan. At this time, market sentiment was very enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, the gold firm and cash gold firm took the opportunity to sell at a high price, which caused retail investors to sell. At that time, customers also turned sluggish, and the price soon fell by 30 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to the silver building firm at 4,040 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange rates continued to soften, and Hong Kong banks' buying interest was rekindled, so they bought over 500 taels aggressively, and the market became strong again, soaring by 65 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought 10 taels from the gold firm at 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms sold 20 taels to the cash gold firm at 4,100 yuan as the afternoon closing price. As a result, the price rebounded by 80 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan in the first half of the day. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the refined gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by slightly over 30 yuan. The current margin gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Ornament Gold Increases 10 Yuan

At the beginning, the selling price of silver building ornaments was still 405 yuan per tael. At 10:20, the price increased by 5 yuan, and at noon it increased by another 5 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the selling price of Da Tong Heng was changed to 415 yuan. The new industry had the same price as the previous price, and the purchase price must be reduced by about 20 yuan.

Cash Supply is High, Discount Rate Returns to 5 Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and notes initially rose to about 90 yuan per thousand yuan. Later, the supply of cash exceeded demand, and the price quickly decreased, reaching about 80 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it fell to 77.5 yuan, resulting in a drop of 5 yuan. The interest rate for money industry associations was 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.

US Silver Falls Slowly, US-Indian Silver Prices Weaken

London, 29th. Silver market speculators first sold and then bought, and the market was sluggish. The closing price was still flat, and trading was sparse. The spread between near and far term silver narrowed by 0.125 pence. New York Silver News: US spot price decreased by 0.025. Also, Bombay Silver News: The Indian silver market is unstable. Spot and October prices narrowed by 1 rupee and 9 annas, while November decreased by 1 rupee and 10 annas. A total of 100 orders were transacted.

### Foreign Exchange Has Scattered Settlements

The foreign exchange market was like yesterday, and the HSBC listed prices did not change. The opening price of the black market for British and American currencies was slightly softer, with British gold at 4 shillings, 4.2875 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan. Later, speculators came to liquidate their long positions in September, and foreign banks, such as Li Mou Bank, also had a strong desire to sell, which caused the potential trend to loosen. The most expensive price for British gold that the bank bought was 4 shillings and 5.625 pence, and the cheapest price for US dollars that the bank sold was 7.5625 yuan. Then, foreign firms took the opportunity to settle transactions one after another, and Chinese banks also came to buy, and speculators' desire to sell had subsided. As a result, the market turned soft again. The most expensive price for British gold was 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the softest price for US dollars was 7.375 yuan. However, the afternoon closing price was 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and 7.4375 yuan, respectively, with no change compared to yesterday. It was heard that the situation after the closing was slightly soft, with British gold at 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan. The trend in October was the same as in the spot market. Trading in the first half of the day was still active.

The gradual return to flat after loosening

In the early morning, the London silver price for near and far terms decreased by 0.5 pence, and the New York silver price decreased by 0.025. The price of London bullion remained stable. The exchange rates for British pounds vs. US dollars, vs. Shanghai, and vs. France were all flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 vs. the British pound, increased by 0.5 vs. Shanghai, and decreased by 0.025 vs. France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The morning opening selling prices of the banks' spot currencies were British gold at 4 shillings and 4.21875 pence, and US dollars at 7.40625 yuan, which was slightly higher than the previous close by 0.015625 pence for the British pound and slightly lower by 0.03125 yuan for the US dollar. After the opening, most of the speculators who were not strong in September tended to liquidate their positions, and foreign banks, such as Li Mou Bank, often came to sell. Although foreign firms came to settle transactions, the amounts were small, so the trend loosened. It was reported that Chinese merchants and Li Mou Bank sold spot British gold to HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain foreign firm for prices ranging from 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence to 4 shillings and 5.3125 pence. Also, the price of spot US dollars ranged from 7.4375 yuan to 7.5625 yuan. When HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was announced to have decreased by 2.75, Li Mou Bank sold spot US dollars to the foreign firm for 7.5625 yuan. At 10:00, the desire of Chinese merchants to sell had subsided, and Chinese banks came to buy, so the situation gradually returned to flat. It was reported that Chinese banks bought spot British gold from foreign banks for 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence and 4.375 pence and spot US dollars for 7.5 yuan and 4.375 yuan. Near noon, the most expensive price for British gold was over 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the asking price for US dollars was 7.375 yuan, but soon the prices returned to flat. Extending to the closing time, the selling prices of spot currencies of the banks were British gold at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and US dollars at 7.4375 yuan. The prices for October were 4 shillings and 2.8125 pence and 7.125 yuan for US dollars. As a result, there was no change in the current prices of British and American currencies compared to the previous day. It was heard that the situation after the closing was slightly soft, with the selling price of British gold at 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence and US dollars at 7.375 yuan. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

The price of US dollars remained unchanged at 6 yuan. The Shanghai currency increased by 4.5 yuan to 123 yuan. The black market price for "United Currency" increased by 3.5 yuan to 81 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Unevenly

The foreign currency market yesterday showed inconsistent trends. British and American gold pounds rose by 1.5 yuan with the gold price, the former opening at 96 yuan, and the latter opening at 99 yuan. US dollar notes initially traded at 13.7 yuan, eventually closing at 13.93 yuan, increasing by 0.13 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes increased by 0.5, Canadian notes and Philippine notes each increased by 0.1, Japanese gold increased by 0.007, Korean notes decreased by 0.003, British gold notes also decreased by 0.3, French francs decreased by 0.01, Singapore notes decreased by 0.3, Dutch notes decreased by 0.2, Annam notes decreased by 0.05, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Wavering, Foreign Stocks Showing Slight Gloom

Securities Grey Market: Yesterday's market conditions saw a slight easing of sentiment due to the U.S. President's statement, leading to price stability. Trading activity was thin yesterday, with prices showing a wavering pattern. Generally, the morning was slightly weak, while the afternoon saw some strengthening. On the buying side, Sheng Da Yuan Yu made some purchases in the morning, but Yong Yong Kang and retail investors mostly sold, creating a slight oversupply. In the afternoon, the No. 11, Da Feng, Lian He, and Jin Wei shares were relatively strong, with Class C shares briefly exceeding six yuan. Overall, most shares improved slightly by two or three cents, while Class D and E shares declined slightly by five to ten cents. The total transaction volume amounted to approximately six to seven hundred thousand yuan. A summary table is provided below:

Stock Trading: Fifty shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were traded at a price of 38.75 yuan.

Furthermore, the Public Brokers Association reported that yesterday's stock market was slightly gloomy, with general prices trending slightly downward and trading activity being thin. Sellers did not experience any pressure, likely because it was the end of the month and operators were focusing on closing their accounts.

London, 29th: Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks were generally stable, with only the Mercantile Bank shares rising by two shillings and sixpence to a price of six pounds, seven shillings, and sixpence.

London, 29th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds still included the four types denominated in French francs and U.S. dollars, with stable prices and no changes.

### Cotton Yarn: Sluggish Sales, Leading to Increasing Bearishness

The bearish sentiment in the cotton yarn market is gradually increasing, with widening fluctuations. This is due to the sluggishness of actual transactions. Demand for fine yarn has decreased significantly in South China, preventing the market from stabilizing and causing it to trend downward. However, procurement of 10-count coarse yarn has continued, but the market has not been immune to the weakness of fine yarn sales. Coupled with rampant rumors of peace, weakening market sentiment has also been drawn into the whirlpool. Nevertheless, the foundation of raw cotton prices remains firm, and bulls remain calm, showing no signs of panic.

The opening of the yarn market this morning saw industry players refraining from action. General brokers only began shouting prices around 9:50 AM, but with a lack of actual transactions, the opening price immediately fell by seven or eight yuan. The spot price for "Double Horse" yarn was 765 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 730 yuan. Soon after, rumors spread, leading to a further drop of ten yuan, with the spot price reaching 758 yuan and the warehouse receipt price at 722 yuan. Subsequently, bargain hunters entered the market, causing prices to rebound by ten yuan. A half-day transaction volume of 767 bales was recorded. "Double Horse" yarn fell by 15 yuan, "Double Globe" by 16 yuan, "Tian Nu" by 10 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Today, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong and 41 pieces to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each group is listed below:

Same Trade: 555 Hong Kong: 110

Inland: 102 Statistics: 767

### Interrupted Cotton Flower Arrivals, Prices Rise Again by Three to Four Yuan

Spot cotton trading has become quieter, likely due to the recent fatigue and slight recovery in yarn prices, leading to a weakening of mill buying interest, coupled with various peace rumors causing increased uncertainty. Consequently, trading activity has significantly decreased. However, selling prices remain firm due to the interrupted arrival of goods from various sources. No Tong cotton has arrived from Northern Jiangsu, with only 1,120 bales of North Sha cotton arriving. Given the low inventory levels, price declines are unlikely, leading to Tongzhou cotton prices rising again by three to four yuan to 160 yuan. Trading among industry players remains active, with 240 bales exported to Hong Kong. The spot cotton sales situation is listed below:

Hui Si Deng: 171.50 Industry Trade Purchases: 600 pieces Cash Warehouse Delivery

Xia Sha Hua: 161.00 Xin Sheng Mill Purchases: 176 bales Cash Factory Delivery

Xin Te: 135.00 Industry Trade Purchases: 250 pieces Cash Warehouse Delivery

Tongzhou: 160.00 Industry Trade Purchases: 200 bales Cash Warehouse Delivery

Another report indicates that yesterday's trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was also particularly favorable due to relatively loose immediate exchange rates. Consequently, many industry players with looser credit took advantage of the opportunity to purchase goods. Compared to October futures, each dan could be purchased for six to seven yuan less. There were no large-scale bookings of American cotton, only sporadic transactions, possibly due to mills being affected by various rumors in the market.

Foreign cotton market prices were slightly weaker in early trading in New York, with prices falling by five to six points. Prices were further weakened due to short selling in the South. Subsequently, rumors spread that the government would provide cotton loans for this year's new cotton crop at a rate of 3.375%, causing market prices to suddenly improve. As a result, prices rose by five to six points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by seven rupees, Liverpool was particularly quiet, and Egyptian cotton rose by over ten points.

### Grain: Recycled Flour Enters the Seven Yuan Range

Wheat Flour: The flour market was quite sluggish yesterday due to the weekend and the end of the month. The flow of customers from both North and South was notably average. Retail transactions were also affected by the gradual decrease in demand after the holidays. Additionally, warehouses with recycled goods were under pressure from mill rents and calls for delivery, leading floating holders to consider selling, resulting in a decline in the market. Yesterday's end-of-month survey showed a total flour inventory in Shanghai of over 2 million bags and a wheat inventory of over 500,000 bags. Mills were still holding firm at the original price of seven yuan and were unwilling to compromise, while recycled goods had already fallen into the seven yuan range. The lowest price was only 6.89 yuan, a decrease of five to ten cents compared to the previous day. Furthermore, 46,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and 1,800 bags to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was stable before weakening. Following continuous purchases by mills and high production prices, the market was briefly brisk. However, mills adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the flour market suffered a downturn, causing the situation to deteriorate. As a result, high-quality wheat lacked trading volume, and medium-quality wheat generally weakened. Kunshan wheat sold for 9.93 yuan, Taicang wheat for 9.91 to 9.97 yuan, Changzhou wheat for 9.70 yuan. The Fu and Fu mills only purchased over 1,000 bags, and warehouses took in four to five truckloads.

### Japonica Rice Remains Firm, Indica Rice Falls, Attracting Out-of-Town Sales

Tu Rice: No goods have arrived from He Xia, and besides Wuhu and other areas being under some form of control, most of the goods are shipped to the Hongkou area, with only three to four thousand bags of new goods arriving in Kunshan, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Fengjing, and other areas. Since each top grade fell sharply yesterday, market prices seem to be low. Therefore, general rice merchants, considering their capital costs, are mostly unwilling to easily sell. However, since sales in this street are weak and rural distribution is limited, trading is at a standstill, resulting in stable prices for each top grade. Japonica rice has a small volume in the market, so although sales are weak, it becomes a rare commodity as soon as inquiries are made. Therefore, the situation is still quite firm. Regular japonica rice sells for 42 to 43 yuan, medium for 40 yuan, Wuxi special japonica rice for 42 yuan, high for 41 yuan, medium for 40 yuan, Suzhou and Kun japonica rice for 40 yuan, new japonica rice for 37 to 38 yuan. 20 dan of recycled early and late rice from He Xia sold for 37 yuan, original bags for 40 yuan, Jia Kun Fengjing and other new Yang Top Grade 26 yuan, market 25.5 yuan, second grade 24.5 yuan, Lu Top Grade 26 yuan, market 25.5 to 25 yuan, Variety Yuan 33 to 34 yuan, and the total market volume was only 4,200 to 4,300 bags.

Ke Xian Rice: Yesterday, over 4,000 bags continued to arrive from various routes, but after the market price fell, it attracted inquiries from inland merchants yesterday, and the sellers' attitude became firm, with asking prices immediately rising by three to five cents. The total market shipped 3,500 bags to the interior, and 2,000 bags to this street, high Ke Xian rice around 24 yuan, medium and second grades varied, while brown rice was only 20 yuan and 19 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Sesame Rises Again, Beans Turn Weak

Miscellaneous Grain Market: New sesame is experiencing limited and obstructed sources, resulting in few arrivals, creating a potential for speculation, and prices have risen repeatedly. Yesterday, the Yangzhou white sesame rose from 26.5 yuan to 26.9 yuan, with a total of over 140 bags sold, all purchased by this street. Most beans have softened, as distribution to various regions has become sluggish, and the trend is still wavering. Yesterday, 340 bags of yellow beans were traded, 160 bags of green beans, 236 bags of broad beans, and 30 bags of Chongming corn.

Six thousand bags of beans were shipped to Tianjin today, 1,160 bags to Hong Kong, 1,500 bags of raw peanuts to Hong Kong, and 500 bags of corn to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Declines, Xinghua Brown Sugar Expected Next Week

Yesterday's sugar market remained weak. The association marked the spot price of #24 coarse white sugar down by 5 cents to 54.5 yuan. Transshipment goods remained at 42 yuan. Taikoo Car White declined by half a yuan, B Mark 58.2 yuan, CW Mark 58 yuan, CX Mark 57.5 yuan, DY Mark 57 yuan, HX Mark 56.5 yuan, H Mark brown sugar remained at 43.2 yuan, Dutch brown sugar decreased by 2 or 3 cents to 44.2 to 44.3 yuan, transshipment remained at 37 yuan. Local Mian White decreased by 5 cents, Zhen Ji #1 55.2 yuan, #2 55 yuan, #3 54.5 yuan, #4 54 yuan. Local rock sugar increased by half a yuan, #1 67 yuan, Jing Ming rock sugar 68.5 yuan. It is heard that a whole batch of domestic Xinghua brown and white sugar is expected to arrive next week, so merchants' interest remains weak, and a proper market will only form depending on the arrival quantity. However, it is said that the water cost will increase fourfold. On the 27th, 9,000 bags of sugar arrived from Holland.

### Piece Goods: Month-End Expiring Goods Dumped at Reduced Prices

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market continued to be brisk in spot sales, and mills' opening prices for next month's goods were higher than current market prices, stabilizing sentiment. Yesterday was the end of the month, and deliveries of expiring goods were very busy. Some warehouse holders sold their profits, and due to tight credit, hand goods were released at prices one to two and a half cents lower than the market price, causing some confusion in the market. However, with enthusiastic buyers, the overall market stabilized. In the later market, with continued brisk demand from this street and the clearing of hand goods, the market price rose by one or two cents. This street traded over 800 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, greige, and bleached and dyed cloth. The Wen Yong Jinhua group purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored twill, colored cloth, serge, and cotton flannel. The Guangdong group purchased over 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, group cloth, and cotton flannel. Merchants from Siam and Singapore added 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth and bleached twill with red and flowered labels. Today, 330 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong and 125 pieces to Haiphong.

Eastern Piece Goods: Yesterday, the white goods market was willing to loosen up on hand goods due to the end-of-month credit settlement, and selling prices retreated. In the morning market, Longtou fine cloth was sold at a low price of 22.6 yuan, and then the market rebounded and strengthened, closing at 23 yuan, a decrease of two and a half cents (per piece) compared to the previous day. Fine twill also fell back by two or three cents. This street's demand was still smooth, with 500 to 600 packages of fine cloth and fine twill traded. The demand for colored serge and Zhigong continued to be strong. The spot market price of Four Gentlemen serge has risen to 7.1 cents per yard.

### Miscellaneous News: Sauce Shops Increase Prices Today

The Shangnan Chuan Sauce Shop Association, due to soaring raw materials and increased costs, tentatively increased prices on August 1st. Unexpectedly, as of today, raw material transportation is obstructed, and costs are increasing. Yesterday, a resolution was passed to increase prices again, uniformly by 20% starting today. The new prices are listed below:

### Dried Goods: New Dates from Fu Offer Newness

Some new dates from Fu have arrived, totaling dozens of packages. The quality is still good, but the quality is only average. The price opened at 30 yuan. Due to the poor harvest of Gaojin red dates, miscellaneous market demand is relatively light, so the market is stable.

On the 27th, 1,500 bags of starch and 1,000 bags of beeswax arrived from the Netherlands.

### Coal: Orders Surge, Hongji Coal Prices Ease

Hongji White Coal: At the beginning of the month, due to the European war, shipping was temporarily suspended, causing managers and merchants to feel anxious about shortages, leading to a situation of having prices but no market. Although there was some stock in the market, the owners were hoarding and speculating. Recently, communication has been restored in many ways, and shipping has also resumed, with a continuous source of supply, but the water cost has been slightly increased to 9 shillings per ton. A large number of orders arrived from Yitai Xing again the other day. In the market, industry players dismantled the price at 106 yuan per ton. The out-of-warehouse cost and labor charge are added separately, and the retail price of lump coal at the door is 18.5 yuan per basket.

### The Pseudo-Municipal Government Attempts to Collect Housing Tax, Residents of Western Shanghai Refuse En Masse; Post on Dunxin Road Again Occupied; Over 300 Pseudo-Police Deployed; Trend of Relocation Intensifies

The situation in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai has become tense since the invasion and occupation of posts by pseudo-police. According to investigations, the total number of pseudo-police in the out-of-bounds area has reached 300, dispatched by the pseudo- "Police Brigade" of Fahua Town. Pseudo-patrol cars are also conducting armed patrols outside the boundary. The pseudo- "Finance Bureau" has set today to collect the winter housing tax. The general residents are determined to unite and resist. The Settlement Administration is determined not to give up police power there. The various situations are recorded as follows:

Dunxin Road Post Again Occupied

In the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary, the activities of pseudo-police have become active again recently. Four pseudo-police officers suddenly deployed at the intersection of Dunxin Road on Daxi Road the other day. Starting yesterday, the pseudo-police occupied the post there and engaged in traffic management. The original patrol officers were forced to retreat to the sidewalk. At the intersection of Columbia Road on Daxi Road, the pseudo-police and patrol officers still maintain double posts and an uncooperative attitude. When the patrol officers direct north-south traffic, the pseudo-police release east-west traffic, making it extremely difficult for vehicles traveling there.

Residents Disgusted, Relocation Increases

The number of pseudo-police in the Caobao area has decreased since yesterday. In addition to guarding the original posts to direct traffic, pseudo-patrol teams rarely travel there. The surface is still calm. In the area of ​​Jessfield Road, Yu Yuan Road and Haig Road, the number of Japanese military police and pseudo-police has obviously increased sharply. Their traces can be seen everywhere. Transportation trucks and motor bicycles are constantly on the road. Residents are terrified when they see it. They feel deeply troubled. The trend of moving and closing the market is spreading more and more widely, and the air is very tense. However, the pseudo-party is eager to make money. It is heard that the pseudo- "Finance Bureau" has sent personnel to investigate the household registration of each neighborhood and notified that the winter housing tax will be collected starting today.

Pseudo-Police on Post Reach 300

After being instigated by a certain party, the pseudo- "Municipal Government" implemented the invasion and deployment of posts in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai. All the intersections west of Jing'an Temple, including Daxi Road, Yidingpan Road, Haig Road, Pingyuan Road, Difeng Road, Anhe Temple Road, Jessfield Road, etc., have pseudo-police traces. In addition to occupying the posts of patrol officers in the concession, there are also three or four armed pseudo-police officers with guns standing on the sidewalks around the area. According to reliable sources, these pseudo-police officers belong to the pseudo- "Police Brigade", and the team headquarters is located in Fahua Town. Every morning, patrol cars transport the pseudo-police to various posts and work in shifts of three hours. After "work", they are also transported back by patrol cars. The number of people currently invading the cross-border area has reached about 300. At the same time, there are patrol cars (commercial trucks) carrying several pseudo-police officers with machine guns patrolling everywhere, so the situation is obviously tense, and residents feel uneasy.

The Pseudo-Party Even Plans to Collect Donations Today

The pseudo- "Municipal Government" has recently been in dire financial straits because the "Reformed Government" stopped paying subsidies, so it coveted the collection of housing donations in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary to save the declining situation. After the pseudo-police invaded and occupied the posts, the pseudo- "Finance Bureau" immediately sent personnel to various neighborhoods to investigate household registration and set up a "Shanghai West District Tax Collection Office" to handle tax collection matters. It is learned that the pseudo-party will start collecting winter housing donations from shops and residents in various stores and households starting from (the 1st).

Shops and Residents Unite to Resist

Shops and residents in Western Shanghai expressed their indignation at the forced collection of housing donations by the pseudo-party. According to general reports yesterday, since the invasion of the pseudo-police, residents have been panicked and many have moved to avoid them, resulting in a sudden downturn in the market. Now the pseudo-party is intensifying its efforts to forcibly collect housing donations. Most shops and residents deeply understand the righteousness and will absolutely not cooperate with the pseudo-organization. If they want to collect donations, they will resolutely refuse and will unite to firmly resist. On the one hand, they still hope that the concession authorities will take effective measures

Robbers Rampant in Western Shanghai

On the west side of the cross-border road construction in Western Shanghai, after the westward shift of the war, the area did not suffer any losses due to the stationing of British troops, so the shops and homes were dense. Moreover, the factories that moved from the occupied areas all regarded this place as a Peach Blossom Spring to avoid Qin Dynasty, and it became a considerable factory area and bustling market. However, after the British troops left, there were suddenly dozens of gangs of bandits, some with a few people, some with more than ten people, and some with more than 20 people. The leaders arrested and extorted without doing any evil. In the past two months, it has been close to millions.

### Rumors Abound, Exchange Market Boils, All of a Gambling Nature; Official Traders Absent, Excess Floating Capital and Speculation Abound

Since the outbreak of the European War, trade with China by all countries except the United States and the Soviet Union has been greatly affected, so Shanghai's foreign trade is extremely stagnant, and the traces of merchants in the exchange market are no longer visible. But today's exchange market is not lonely, but has a boiling phenomenon. Those who buy and sell in the exchange market today are all speculation experts. These people use the currencies of various countries as a gambling object to operate and profit, and have no other purpose in the exchange market. Therefore, speculators in the market arbitrarily spread rumors in order to make profits. The other day, after Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui spoke to the Associated Press reporter, the speculators created various peace atmospheres, resulting in a sharp decline in the black market for foreign exchange, a decline in the black market for gold, and a soaring grey market for securities. The main reason for the rampant speculation is the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai. To prevent speculation and manipulation of the market, the only way is to find a way to transfer the excess floating capital to the inland, and it can also assist the government in completing the construction of the southwest and developing the rich resources of the inland.

### No Treaty Between Soviet Union and Japan; Peace Between Japan and Japan Awaits; Sino-Japanese War Has Not Reached a Decisive Stage; No One Can Say When It Will End; Important Remarks by Tsentsu

The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that Mr. Tsentsu, a Japanese director of the Municipal Council and director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, has now retired. The reporter met him this (30th) morning. According to him, he is 66 years old. He came to Shanghai in 1926 and has been here for 13 years. During this period, Shanghai has been greatly different from the past. It has developed rapidly in all aspects, and there have been so many events that have occurred in these 13 years that it is impossible to remember them all. As for the current world

Political Situation

He does not believe that Japan will sign a treaty with the Soviet Union. He reconsidered his opinion and still said that he did not believe that Japan and the Soviet Union would sign a treaty. Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, he believes that the war is still in an undecided stage, and it is too early to predict peace between the two countries. No one can say how long the Sino-Japanese War will last. However, if the war is prolonged, the Japanese must prepare to

Longer Support

Yun, Tsentsu remained silent on his activities in Shanghai, only saying that shortly after he became the director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai. At that time, the Public Concession was disturbed by the fear of possible disputes for a long time. From the Japanese point of view, so-called anti-Japanese elements have caused several unfortunate incidents since then, leading to the Jinan Incident, until

The disaster a few days ago, according to Tsentsu, came from a farmer's family. He entered the diplomatic world in 1894 and served as the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin and Shanghai. He left his career in 1926 and came to Shanghai to serve as a director of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China and as a director of the Municipal Council for several years. He is scheduled to sail to Japan next Saturday and Sunday and return to his Tokyo residence to retire.

### Principal and Interest of the Jinlong Public Bonds, Discounted Payment; Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank Issued Discount Certificates Yesterday

The National Debt Fund Management Committee, after consulting with the Zhongzhong Jiaonong Called Bank, agreed that the four banks would discount and pay for various tariff-secured bonds. The twelfth principal and interest payment of the long-term financial public bonds of the Republic of China, totaling 1,532,812.5 yuan, were discounted and paid by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank starting yesterday. It is stipulated that the bank will issue "discount certificates" to be paid in six installments, with each installment being paid in one month, and the payment will be made with Shanghai's general exchange bills. As for the sixth resolution of principal and interest of the Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of 1936 and the fifth resolution of principal and interest of the Guangdong Province Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of 1937, both due yesterday, the designated banks for payment of principal and interest made full payments. However, since these public bonds were issued in Guangdong Province, there is no payment agency in Shanghai. The sixteenth principal and interest payment of the 1935 Telecommunications Public Bonds was temporarily suspended due to the theft of the fund (international telegraphic fees).

### Group Rice Purchase, Continued Registration; Once Rice Transportation Opens, Orders Will Be Placed Overseas

Regarding the joint purchase of Saigon foreign rice by various groups in Shanghai, the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association was entrusted to handle the registration. Since the beginning, it has been nearly a month. A total of 101 groups, institutions, and major companies have registered by yesterday, totaling 15,718 bags. The registration method was previously stipulated that the price and shipping cost of Saigon foreign rice will be investigated and determined by the initiators. "When implementing the purchase, the purchaser should pay at least 50% of the price, and the rest will be paid according to the result of the settlement", and "the purchaser shall not cancel the amount they have ordered", and "the minimum purchase amount is 50 bags", etc. The Accountants Association has sent letters to various groups and institutions that have registered to order foreign rice. As soon as the transportation of Saigon rice is smooth, orders will be placed overseas, and a meeting of purchasers will be convened to discuss methods and elect custodians. The Certified Public Accountants Association is still continuing to process registrations, and a decision will be made soon.

### British Women's Association Raises Funds to Knit Socks for the Troops

The Zi Lin Bao stated that the Shanghai British Women's Association will cooperate with the general plan of the central fund suggested by the British Joint Association to be established for wartime work and relief purposes when formulating plans within a considerable period of time. However, the British Women's Association's wartime work fund has already begun to be raised, and its nature is different from the general plan. British women in Shanghai have already started raising funds to purchase wool, knit socks for the troops and other purposes. Under the leadership of Chairman Mrs. Mosu, an appeal for donations has now been issued. Judging from the enthusiasm and patriotism of British women, it is expected that this move will be a great success and will show what work British individuals can do to reduce the burden on soldiers on the front line.

### Mrs. Gosmer Has Returned Home; Took a Plane to France

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 30th that Mrs. Gosmer, the wife of the French Ambassador to China, has now returned to France. Her return route is said to be by plane.

### Coal Market Panic Gradually Subsiding

The coal balls used daily by Shanghai citizens previously soared in price due to the skyrocketing price of coal dust, reaching a massive 80 yuan per ton in national currency. The retail prices of various coal shops were even more erratic, greatly affecting the lives of citizens. The other day, a large batch of Hongji No. 1 and No. 2 coal dust arrived in Shanghai, totaling no less than 20,000 tons, and the market price of coal balls fell by 4 yuan per ton. Yesterday, Mao Chunpu, a member of the Coal Industry Association, told a Dazhong News Agency reporter that traders hoarding large quantities of lump coal had to sell off their stockpiles due to tight money during the Mid-Autumn Festival. This has slightly alleviated the coal market panic that has gripped the city for several months. Statistics also show that over the past week, foreign coal arriving in Shanghai, in addition to the 1,000 tons of Indian lump coal that arrived on the 24th, has continued to arrive daily, totaling no less than 10,000 tons. According to the city's coal consumption, only about 5,000 tons are needed per month. In addition to the 10,000 tons of inventory from before, which is enough for two months, the arrivals this week are also enough for two months. Therefore, the supply of coal in Shanghai is no longer panicking, and coal prices will also fall in the future.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Water Price Increase Due to Foreign Exchange Contraction Leading to Increased Expenses, Water Rates Increased by 50%

The Shanghai Waterworks Company recently submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for permission to increase water rates by an additional 50% to increase revenue and offset various losses. It is claimed that the company's operating expenses and the amount payable for dividends have greatly increased due to the contraction of foreign exchange. It is found that the company's budget for this year is based on an exchange rate of 3 shillings and 6 pence. Although various revenues have increased, the annual net profit that can be obtained is insufficient to offset the shortfall in dividends from the previous year, and after deducting the dividends for national currency preference shares, the remainder is insufficient to pay the ordinary share dividends payable under the company's business charter, resulting in a large difference.

Next Year's Budget Has Even More Deficit

Next year's budget is based on an exchange rate of 4 pence. Due to the increase in operating expenses, the deficit is large. In May of this year, the Waterworks Company once submitted a request to the Municipal Council for permission to increase prices. Later, due to the obvious improvement in business and in view of the extraordinary situation at the time, it expressed its willingness to extend the period for six months and consider the price increase issue again.

Price Increase Is Inevitable

In the past three months, the exchange rate of British gold has fallen from over 8 pence to 4 pence, so the company's budget must be greatly changed. As a result, the proposed price increase is inevitable. The company said that the proposed additional 50% water rate is the minimum necessary amount, otherwise the future safety of the business will be difficult to maintain. The above petition has been reviewed by the Chief of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council.

Chief of Finance Department Considers It Reasonable

The Chief of the Finance Department stated that the budget submitted by the Waterworks Company this time was compiled based on the actual business results of the first half of this year. The expenses listed in it have increased a lot due to the impact of the exchange rate. The company's proposed price increase is reasonable, so it is proposed to request the Council to allow it to add an additional 50% surcharge on bills ending on or after November 1 this year. However, this surcharge should be re-evaluated at any time before May 31 next year depending on the situation. The above suggestion has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council.

### Area A North of the Suzhou Creek to Register Households Soon, Residents Are Panicking, Many Are Moving, Extension of Deadline for Inoculations

Since the Japanese army took over the defense of Area A north of the Suzhou Creek, residents of the area have been in a state of unease. However, because it is not easy to move, they have to remain calm. In recent days, in addition to searching everywhere, the Japanese army has forced residents to be inoculated. Recently, there has been talk of registering residents, so the residents there feel even more panic. The details are recorded below:

Forced Inoculation Has Been Extended

The Japanese army has set up a Li Ren Hospital inoculation station at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, to the right of the Shanghai Telephone Company, forcing residents of the area to go for inoculation. The period was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but because there were so many people, it was impossible to popularize it for a while, so the inoculation date had to be extended to October 10. Also, due to the crowded conditions at the inoculation station, incidents of fake police whipping residents occurred from time to time. In order to maintain order, the patrol房方面 dispatched several Chinese patrolmen, one Indian patrolman, and one Japanese patrolman to the scene starting yesterday, using wire mesh to form a passageway so that those who were inoculated could enter in order, and the crowded situation began to ease.

Household Registration Causes Great Panic

Recently, when patrolling the various alleys, the Japanese army notified residents that residents living in the area must hold their inoculation certificates from tomorrow and report the number of people in their households. After the Japanese army verifies them, they will issue verification certificates to be posted on the doors before they are allowed to live there. Residents were greatly panicked when they suddenly heard this news. When the reporter went to the area for inspection yesterday afternoon, he saw movers carrying loads on vehicles and shoulders, one after another on North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road.

Receiving Permits Now Uses National Currency

The fake police in the Tianhou Palace, after being driven out by the British patrol team, were found again yesterday, and their number increased to no less than a dozen. They stood empty-handed at the permit filling station, checking those who went to collect permits. However, one thing is quite noteworthy, that is, those who went to collect permits originally had to pay in Huaxing banknotes, but now a notice has been posted to change to paying in national currency. In addition, at the Bazilu intersection at the end of North Henan Road, and at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, there are still British soldiers on guard. The barbed wire on the border road is still blocked. The barbed wire erected by the Japanese army from Jiangxi Road Bridge to Bazilu has not changed. The Japanese army posts are still at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenzhaisi Road, and at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. Pedestrians to the east of the barbed wire must present their permits for verification.

### Temporary Shelters Added to First Refugee Camp

The First Refugee Camp on Dunxin Road, affiliated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recently expanded its scope and took in the completely helpless refugees from other refugee camps. The 19th Board of Directors meeting recently approved the rental of the open space in front of the gate and the construction of 195 temporary shelters, costing a total of more than 26,300 yuan. Construction has now begun and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The camp currently houses a total of more than 8,000 refugees. If the new houses are completed, it can accommodate another 5,500 helpless refugees. All recurring and construction costs are covered by the Association. In addition to the administration still being handled by the Association, the Salvation Army is responsible for all internal management responsibilities, so the camp's morality and order are stricter than before, and the results have also improved significantly.

### Xinxiangtai Sails to Eastern Zhejiang, Original Ship Returns

After trying to transport goods to Eastern Zhejiang, three Japanese planes flew to harass the area on the 25th of last month, dropping five bombs near the碼頭, causing the British ship Casdimar and New Beijing to be affected by shrapnel, and the cabins were slightly damaged. They have sailed back to Shanghai to avoid the area and changed to other routes. Also, the British ship Xinxiangtai, represented by Taichangxiang, was intercepted by a Japanese warship when it arrived at the mouth of the river and was not allowed to enter.

### Industrial and Commercial Sectors Exchange New Fractional Currency Notes, Bank of China Adopts Gradual Issuance System, Tobacco Exchange Industry Requests to Receive More New Notes

The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association accepted the entrustment of the Central Bank to receive fractional currency notes and distribute them to its members. The distribution has now been completed, and a public notice has been issued stating: "Notice: This time, our association has exchanged fractional currency notes, and all members have completed the exchange. All non-members are requested to exchange directly at the Central Bank. This notice is dated September 30, 28th year of the Republic of China."

Bank of China Continues to Handle Exchanges for Various Industries

The Central Bank's new subsidiary coins of one fen and five fen began issuance procedures the day before yesterday. In addition to handling exchange procedures in advance for银钱业 banks, firms, and tobacco exchange merchants in order to circulate them on the market at any time and solve the difficulties of零我 for various industries, it also continued to handle the exchange of notes for various banks and industrial and commercial sectors yesterday. The needs of major factories for giving change for wages, as well as the零數 for the business of major companies and商號, were all supplied in moderation. The number of notes exchanged must not exceed 200 yuan at most. The needs of various菜塲 in Shanghai can be supplied by the sale of tobacco exchange stores, and the bank does not directly supply them. Secondly, if members of various industry associations need to exchange new notes, they can directly send a letter from each association to the bank for consideration. It is heard that the bank will continue to distribute new notes in the future until there are enough to circulate on the market. The difficulty of零找 in Shanghai has been resolved.

Tobacco Exchange Industry Asks to Receive More New Notes

According to Dagang News Agency, reporters learned from the tobacco exchange industry that the Bank of China only allowed the industry to exchange 40,000 yuan in new notes the day before yesterday. The exchange target is limited to tobacco exchange members, but the association has many members, and the total amount exchanged is not enough to distribute to members, which has caused members to criticize. The association authorities were forced to send Shen Peifan and others to the Bank of China to request an increase in the amount of exchange to meet the needs of members. It was agreed to consider it, but a reply must be given after a decision is made.

Seven People Injured in Exchange Fights

Since it was reported that the Bank of China entrusted the tobacco exchange association to distribute fractional currency notes to the industry, various sectors mistakenly believed that they could also exchange at the association, so they flocked to the association's meeting place on Ningbo Road to request exchange. The crowd was crowded and noisy. Fortunately, the Old Gate patrol房派探捕 maintained order, and no incidents occurred all day. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning,市民 still did not understand the truth and flocked to the association to ask for new notes, reaching 700 to 800 people. The association told them that the new notes had been used up and there were no notes to exchange. At that time, a member商號 of the tobacco exchange industry took out 200 yuan in new notes, and the exchangers immediately began to criticize and then fought each other. As a result, one person's head was broken and bleeding, seriously injured, and six others were slightly injured. The person in charge of the association explained and the matter was settled. It is said that the tobacco exchange market was affected by this and stopped trading for the past two days.

Collecting Tokens for Full Exchange

The issuance of fractional currency notes is based on the face value without discount. When it was originally issued, it was reported that unscrupulous people deliberately raised the value, exchanging each corner for only nine fen. After receiving the report, the Central Bank decided to notify the tobacco exchange industry association to correct it. Since yesterday, the market has unanimously refused to use miscellaneous token notes. At the same time, various companies such as Daxin and Sincere and the token notes issued by various industries have begun to be recalled and cancelled. As for the token notes issued by the tram company and the bus company in the two concession areas, because the quantity is huge and has penetrated into various industries, it is difficult to recall them for a while, so they are still circulating as usual. As for the hard nickel coins issued by the bus, it is not intended to be recalled, but it is limited to use on the bus.

### Disaster Relief Needs Are Urgent, Appeal for Support, Continue to Collect Previously Pledged Donations, or Request to Raise Other Special Donations

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday sent a letter to various public organizations, industry associations, and clan associations, stating: "Greetings, at the previous annual general meeting of members, representatives of various organizations attended, and regarding the fundraising item, a unanimous resolution was made to 'continue to promote the fundraising method by extending the various donations recognized according to the original plan.' The minutes are recorded. Our association is organized by various organizations, and many of the organizations are those that have recognized various donations. The disaster relief funds of our association rely entirely on the regular donations paid by the organizations and the enthusiastic donations and enthusiastic support from all walks of life, which have been maintained for a year. We are grateful to the representatives for agreeing to extend all the donations recognized, so that our association's disaster relief work can continue to proceed in the future without interruption. All the refugees in the city are greatly grateful. The members of our association express their admiration. However, in recent months, prices have risen sharply, doubling from the past. The originally fixed food allowance for refugees was two yuan per person per month, but now it is five yuan per person per month, and it may have to be increased again in the future, which is difficult to predict. The number of people is difficult to reduce, and expenses have also increased sharply. Winter is approaching in a blink of an eye, and cold clothes must be added, and various post-disaster tasks must be actively prepared. The donations received are not enough. The refugee problem in the city has entered a severe stage. If we do not widely fundraise, there will be adverse consequences, and the impact will cause endless troubles. Since our association is responsible for disaster relief, we have to urgently appeal. We dare to send this letter to you, hoping that you will give your special support from beginning to end. In addition to continuing to collect the originally pledged donations, please consider increasing the originally recognized amount, or raise other special donations to provide assistance. If you have various fundraising methods, please give us your advice at any time, and we will send someone to contact you. This is specially announced, hoping you will take it into consideration."

### Fake Police in Tianhou Palace Once Detained by British Army, Released Immediately After Investigation, Report in Japanese Newspaper About Expulsion Is Incorrect

The Zi Lin Bao said that British military officers stationed in Shanghai yesterday (29th) denied the Japanese newspaper's report that on Tuesday, a British patrol team attempted to expel two "municipal government" Chinese police officers from the Tianhou Palace building on North Henan Road that they occupied. According to the Japanese newspaper, a branch office of the "Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau" is now set up in the building to handle the issuance of permits, etc. to the Chinese. The British patrol team attempted to expel the two Chinese police officers from the building but failed, and then retreated. However, according to British military officials, the incident occurred because a British military patrol team was stationed on the sidewalk opposite the building and saw a "municipal government" police officer, so they detained him for investigation. After learning that he was a member of the police team in the Tianhou Palace building, he was released immediately.

All 'Huaxing Banknotes' should be rejected and absolutely no dealings with them should be made. However, 各銀錢烟兌各 in Shanghai may inevitably receive, pay, buy, and sell them due to retail trade and must be strictly investigated and prohibited. The Ministry issued a QianDian telegram in July to instruct the distribution and warn them, and to investigate and stop them at any time. Now, according to the previous situation, in addition to the telegram, we reiterate the need to earnestly distribute and warn them, and to do everything possible to stop them."

### YWCA Benefits Unemployed Women

Since the war of resistance, women in general war zones have fled to Shanghai one after another, and among the working women in Shanghai, there are even more who have become unemployed due to the impact of the war. Among them, it is even more difficult for women who have received primary and secondary education to find a way out. To seek their survival in Shanghai, where the current cost of living is high and everything is skyrocketing, their suffering cannot be described in words. The YWCA at 99 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, in view of this, has created a nanny training school to provide job opportunities for unemployed women. The first group of nanny graduates have all been introduced to families and institutions for service, which has been deeply praised by society. Therefore, the second session will be continued and is now starting to enroll students. The semester is tentatively set for five months, and the tuition fee is 20 yuan. Those from poor families can pay half first, and the other half can be paid after graduation. Recently, unemployed women have been crowding to register, so those who are interested can contact the association as soon as possible, which is good news for the unemployed.

### Foreign Tenants' Association Actively Opposes Rent Increases, Founding Meeting Scheduled for the 11th of This Month, Seeking Membership from Various Nationalities

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the Shanghai Foreign Tenants' Association, initiated by foreigners in Shanghai, has now decided on the date of its founding meeting. There are two more lawsuits filed by Chinese landlords against the court. The British ambassador is currently investigating the excessive rent, and the French Concession authorities have also re-raised the order regarding rent increases. The movement of tenants opposing unreasonable rent increases took a definite step forward today (30th). The details are recorded below:

General Meeting to Be Convened in Mid-Month

The Shanghai Tenants' Congress, which was postponed a few weeks ago due to political relations at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm on October 11 in the hall of the New Tian'an Church. Members and other tenants concerned about this matter can enter, but they must ask the person in charge to certify.

Tenants Oppose Rent Collection in Foreign Currency

Li, the landlord of the Riverside Park 公庽 (transliteration), was recently sued by a央籍 tenant for requesting to collect rent in US dollars. Li lost the lawsuit. It is now heard that another British tenant has sued Li and will be in court on the first day of the month. It is also heard that the Chinese landlord of Plunville Villa (transliteration), about a quarter of a mile east of Kaixuan Road, recently requested to collect rent in foreign currency. The tenants of the villa held a meeting last night (29th) and decided to sue the landlord.

British Ambassador Has Considered the Matter

The Shanghai Tenants' Association sent a letter to the British Ambassador and has now received a reply, stating that the British Embassy is still considering protecting British僑 and opposing excessive rent. However, in view of the complexity of the situation, the Embassy's investigation has been slightly suspended, but it is expected that an announcement will be made soon.

Actively Seeking Members of Various Nationalities

The Shanghai Tenants' Association is international in nature and believes that taking action on behalf of members of any nationality will indirectly assist other members, so it is currently actively seeking members of various nationalities. The association's organizing committee decided last night that the membership fee and annual fee are both ten yuan and agreed on various articles of association.

French Municipal Council Maintains Old Case

The French Concession Municipal Council issued a notice today stating that a certain real estate company has issued a new rent plan to tenants in the French Concession without notifying the Municipal Council. The collection of房金微 and other matters must still be handled in accordance with the orders issued by the局方 in 1935 and 1937. The Municipal Council's notice may be due to a certain company collecting rent from tenants in all its公庽, intending to calculate水電 and other items separately from the "basic rent." The tenants of a certain公庽 are quite troubled by the news, because the "basic rent" currently demanded is itself higher than the previous total rent. The Shanghai Tenants' Association is also paying attention to this matter.

### News of Arrival of Empress

The Empress of Russia, a mail ship of the Changxing Company, arrived in Shanghai today from Vancouver via Japan and will dock at the Gonghexin码头 in Hongkou. It will set sail tomorrow (2nd) for Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The ship's import and export times and the ferry schedule for picking up and dropping off passengers are kept strictly secret due to the European war. Passengers will be notified directly by the company. Also, the Empress of Canada is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Vancouver in mid-month and go to Little Luzon. According to the schedule, it should return to Shanghai today. It is now learned that the ship has been slightly delayed in the South Pacific and will probably return to Shanghai next Wednesday (4th). The return date to Canada will also have to be postponed by three days.

### Second Phase of Military Supplies Government Bonds Not Solicited from the People, Underwritten Solely by the Banking Sector, Not Yet Circulating on the Market

In order to enrich the second phase of war of resistance expenses, the National Government issued 600 million yuan of military supplies government bonds in the 28th year of the Republic of China, issued in two phases, with each phase being 300 million yuan. The first phase was issued on June 1, and the second phase is scheduled to be issued starting today. The annual interest rate is six%, the term is 25 years, and the consolidated tax and tobacco and alcohol tax revenue are used as the fund. After the government bonds are issued, they will be underwritten by the banking sector and will not be solicited from the people, so they will not be circulating on the market for the time being.

### Tenants in Qingyuli Prevent Demolition of Houses, No Illegal Actions, Excluding Infringement Is to Protect Their Own Rights, Five Tenants Charged with Damage After Trial, Eviction Judgment Has Been Suspended

The女子银行 needs to renovate the Qingyuli on Chongqing Road, which led to a lawsuit with the tenants. As a result, the court ruled that the tenants should move out, and the execution procedure has been confirmed. However, more than 3,000 tenants in the里 cannot find a house to move into because it is a very special time, so they applied to the execution judge for a stay of execution on the 20th of the month when the eviction agreement was due, and stated that they had

Obtained New Evidence

Filed a retrial lawsuit with the Second Branch of the High Court. After the execution judge consulted with the representative of the plaintiff女子银行 and obtained his consent, the execution was suspended for several days. However, the女子银行 suddenly ordered workers to surround the里 with bamboo fences on the 22nd. At that time, the tenants believed that the court had not issued a mandatory execution order, and the女子银行 had rashly fenced, intending to demolish the houses, which was obstructing the exercise of rights. They also believed that once construction and demolition began, it would endanger the lives of the tenants, so for legitimate defense and

Excluding Infringement

They demolished the built bamboo fences. The女子银行 reported this to the Chengdu Road patrol房, ordering Chinese police head Zhang Wenjun and detective Zhou Yushan to rush there and arrest the tenants Gu Jiren, Jiang Jinkui, and Chen Dongyang, and send them to the Special First Court, ordering each to pay a bail of 400 yuan within a time limit. The patrol房方面 stated that Gu and others confessed at the patrol房 that the demolition of the fences was instigated by lawyer Ping Jinya and painter Qian Huafo, so they also sued Ping and Qian for the crime of instigating damage. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the Criminal Division No. 8 and

Summoned All Five Defendants

The five defendants jointly hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend them. patrol房 lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the process, sued them in accordance with Article 25 and Article 354 of the Criminal Law, and requested that they be sentenced according to law. Questioning Gu Jiren, he admitted that he was at the scene demolishing the houses and confessed that Ping Jinya and Qian Huafo instigated them. Jiang Jinkui and Chen Dongyang admitted that they demolished the fences, but it was a legitimate act of excluding infringement and denied that they were instigated by Ping and Qian. Ping Jinya and Qian Huafo denied instigating them and claimed that this act was an action by each tenant to protect their own power and

Exclude Illegal Damage, Why do they need us to instigate them? Lawyer Yuan declared that the Second Branch of the High Court had ruled that the execution of the eviction judgment was suspended, and the女子银行 had committed a mandatory demolition act before the court issued a mandatory execution order, endangering the safety and rights of others, so according to the law and precedents, the actions of the defendants could not be considered guilty, and he requested that they be found not guilty. After Judge Meng checked the confessions, he ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled to announce the judgment next Monday.

### October and Children

— Zhang Mengzhao

Little Friends, This Is A Message You Must Not Ignore

Time truly flies. In the blink of an eye, today is the beginning of October. In terms of seasons, the solar October corresponds to the mid-autumn of the lunar calendar. The north wind is just beginning to rise, and the cold air is sharp. Everyone is changing from single-layer clothing to lined clothing, presenting a somber scene once again. On the streets and in the corners of buildings, many refugee children are wandering, crying from cold and hunger, trembling. Why are they in this state? Little friends who are enjoying happiness, please close your eyes and think about it.

In another eight days, everyone will be celebrating the National Day commemoration in the third year of the War of Resistance (which can also be said to be the nation's year of hardship). Looking back from the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang to October 10, 1911, when the revolutionary army revolted in Wuchang and the Republic of China was born, the course of hardship in between involved sacrificing countless martyrs' heads and spilling countless martyrs' hot blood. Many failures were overcome, but eventually, they wove together the brilliant flower of freedom for the Chinese nation, regaining the glory of the mountains and rivers.

When the artillery fire resounded across the isolated island weeks ago, my children experienced for the first time the National Day amidst fireworks (anti-aircraft fire) and flying flesh and blood. The sounds of planes and cannons played a fervent and grand tragic song. The children were not only unafraid but also extraordinarily spirited and excited! I want to thank its bestowal, and I feel even more that the Isolated Island National Day in the first year of the War of Resistance is the most memorable and worth recalling. Little friends who once stood on the isolated island, experiencing an exciting National Day amidst intense artillery fire, probably still remember it very clearly, right?

The season tells us that it is October again. Great October, we must welcome it and encourage it. Millions of brave soldiers at the front are stepping on the bloodstained footprints of the martyrs, advancing one after another, tirelessly fighting for more than two years. "Failure is the mother of success." One day, we will weave together the brilliant flower of freedom for the Chinese nation once more, regaining the entire glory of the mountains and rivers.

Little friends, now is precisely the time for you to bury yourselves in your studies. Do not waste a single moment, do not relax for a single moment. The great word "October" is also the epitome of Jesus's universal love and aid to the masses. When you see homeless, wandering children on the streets and in the corners of buildings, you should know your own happiness and joy, and give them extra sympathy and assistance.

### The Natural World in Autumn

— Ci Kai

After several heavy rains, the weather has become much cooler. People have, without prompting, put on lined clothing. The time tells us, "It is autumn."

In the autumn, what kind of changes do the sights of the natural world undergo?

In the mountains and fields, the grass is either withered or yellowed. In reality, they have already kept their rootstocks, underground stems, or seeds, quietly waiting for germination next spring. The insects are gradually decreasing because they have already laid their eggs, their mission is complete; therefore, they themselves have also died one by one. However, a small portion of mosquitoes and flies, etc., still remain in warm places, secretly passing through this harsh winter.

Those trees with thin leaves begin to gradually cut off the passages within the leaves because they fear that so many leaves exposed to the fierce north wind will cause the moisture inside the body to evaporate quickly. Soon, the leaves fall. The broken ends are tightly sealed with a layer of rubber, preventing moisture from secretly escaping. However, those trees with thick leaves and needle-like leaves do not need to do this because their leaves already have very perfect equipment, and even in the most fierce north wind, moisture will not escape very quickly.

The plane trees on the roadside will soon be left with only bare trunks and branches. As a result, the roads become much more open.

You should know that after the function of the leaves gradually ceases, the substances inside also undergo changes. Therefore, some turn into red leaves, and some turn into yellow leaves. People like to take these two kinds of discolored leaves as ornamental items.

The decrease in insects causes great panic among animals that live by eating insects. Therefore, the swallows begin to hold meetings, planning to fly south in groups on a clear morning. The bats, however, prepare to hibernate, waiting to wake up from their sleep when the insects breed again.

Is the natural world in this autumn so bleak? It is not.

Look, chrysanthemums are blooming in the garden, one clump here, another clump there. Geese are coming from the north. A flock flies across the sky. Also, beans and vegetables are being sown at this time.

— Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Part 36 —

To the west of Ming'er's third home was a mountain stream. The water flowed day and night, gurgling into the low-lying stream channel, flowing endlessly. Whether in drought, in rain, in spring, in summer, water was always sounding throughout the four seasons. However, the sound of the water was sometimes strong and sometimes weak, which was related to the amount of water. Especially in the middle of the night, the sound of the water played out exceptionally loudly, pouring into Ming'er's slumber, entangling him incessantly, and a sense of annoyance burned in his heart, but he could not suppress the piercing sound.

One day, Ming'er helped his mother carry the basket to the stream to wash clothes. The stream water was so clear that one could distinguish the pebbles at the bottom of the stream, but the water was never still for a moment. Where did the water flow to stop? This aroused his curiosity, so he lifted his feet and followed the direction of the water flow, walking on and on.

As Ming'er's footsteps moved, the stream gradually widened, and the speed of the water flow also increased. The pebbles on the bank of the stream, polished by the rushing water every day, had no edges or corners. Occasionally, one or two beautiful, shining kingfishers lingered on the smooth stone surface. In an instant, a rush of water came, driving them from their occupied position, washing away the marks on the stone surface, and shining roundly towards the sunlight again. Ming'er still moved forward.

A row of straw tied together, long and wide, lay across the center of the stream, hoarding the stream water from the upper reaches. The water accumulated more and more, constantly overflowing along the upper edge of the straw row. The water flow passed this difficult obstacle, becoming exceptionally rapid. What other purpose did the man-made dam have besides causing a huge rushing water sound? Ming'er walked forward without thinking. Before he could walk more than ten steps, he found another embankment, and the water was even more rapid. After a few dozen steps, there was another dam. The water barely escaped from these three difficult obstacles with its life. When the drainage flew straight down from the high dam, it hung down on the dam like a silver-white curtain of water. Moreover, due to the reflection of the sunlight, it was like a priceless pearl curtain, colorful and dazzling, radiating light in all directions. Such a spectacular sight was rare. Countless silver beads of foam splashed on the stones in the stream, emitting a mad roar. Round whirlpools swirled in the stream, flowing aimlessly.

A wooden house was built not far from the dam. Beside the house was a huge wooden wheel. The wheel blades were struck by the rushing water, lazily rotating. Moreover, there was a sound of hammering inside the wooden house. Ming'er could not help but break in.

It was a two-room wooden house, not very tall. Bags of grain were piled up inside. A stone mortar was embedded in the mud floor, filled with rice, waiting for the wooden cone installed in the axle to strike down. The squeaking axle seemed unwilling to be rotated by the water, but it was controlled and dared not move, so it could only emit a squeaking complaint. The wooden cone struck into the mortar with heroic force, and the rice was violently oppressed by it. Some had their husks stripped off, some were still resisting stubbornly, and some escaped the confines of the mortar. Sadly, they were caught and brought back in by the guard - the rice miller in the house - acting as an accomplice. The final result was that they could not escape the violent blow, and they revealed their original form naked: that was rice.

The sound of the cone hitting, the sound of the axle, and the sound of the water flow interwove into a piece of unstructured music, and the rice steam tightly sealed that wooden house. Ming'er could not stand the suffocating stimulation and retreated.

"Rice milling is like this!" He gained this brand new harvest again and returned home along the original road with a smile.

### The Function of Saliva

— Wang Bin

Saliva is an indispensable substance for people. Although we often do not pay attention to its function.

Little friends! When saliva is mentioned, you will always think that whenever there is food in front of you, there is always more saliva in your mouth. If you are not careful, a few drops will drip out. Some little friends think this phenomenon is shameful, so they have to keep swallowing it. It is often discovered by others, but this is not shameful because saliva is extremely necessary when food enters the mouth, so it cannot help but secrete a lot before it enters the mouth.

The main function of saliva is of course to moisten the chewed food, mixing it with the food crumbs to make it easier to swallow. It is especially needed for dry foods such as roasted rice flour and biscuits. In addition, it also has a function of being able to digest starch. When we chew white rice carefully, we often feel a slight sweetness. This is the result of the starch in the rice being broken down into sugars (glucose) by saliva.

Saliva can also lubricate the mouth, allowing the tongue to move freely and making speech fluent. If you talk for too long, you will feel thirsty, and this is the reason.

The proverb says, "Saliva is medicine, useful everywhere." This is not an empty statement. For example, if you are accidentally bitten or stung by ants or bees, your skin will swell up. If you apply saliva to it, the redness and swelling will subside. This is because when bees and ants sting people, they send a kind of formic acid into the person's skin. Saliva then neutralizes the formic acid through its alkaline action.

Little friends! Think about it: isn't saliva very useful?

### The Old Woman and the Servant

—Aesop's Fables—

There was a very good housekeeper old woman who would shout for her maidservant to get up every morning when the rooster crowed. The maidservants were all afraid of getting up early, so everyone discussed killing the poor rooster. They said, "If it weren't for the rooster waking up our mistress, she wouldn't come and wake us up." But that good woman, lost her clock (the rooster), would often get the time wrong, and would wake them up in the middle of the night. So they not only did not improve things, but it was even worse than before! (Zhao Yilin)

### The Blue Dwarf (2)

— Ai Li

A Li replied: "What is there to be afraid of? Of course I'm not afraid." When she said this, she looked down on A Li's timidity somewhat. But A Li was really a very small child, only eight years old this year, while A Li was almost twelve years old. When she was eight years old, she was just like A Li, afraid at the slightest thing. Looking back now, she feels that there was no reason to be afraid. She still remembers that previously, her older cousins often ridiculed her timidity, intentionally talking about ghosts and monsters to scare her as a game. Even now, whenever it is dark and the lights are not on, she still feels a bit nervous and fearful when she is alone in the room. When A Li thought of this, she used a gentler tone to comfort her younger brother, saying, "Of course there is nothing to be afraid of at all. When I think of those blue dwarfs, I just feel that they are fun. A Li, you must know that in fact there are no such things as celestial beings, ghosts, or monsters."

A Li quickly said: "But there are always dwarfs. Wasn't that little old man just now clearly a dwarf?" A Li said: "Yes, dwarfs are dwarfs, but they cannot be classified as celestial beings, ghosts, or monsters. They are also humans, but they are just born a little shorter. Perhaps they fell very badly when they were young, which prevented them from growing taller and made them permanently short." A Li said: "Is that so? I didn't know that. I hope I haven't fallen too badly before, because many people say that I shouldn't be so short at my age." As he said this, he looked at his short and powerful legs with some worry.

A Li couldn't help but laugh loudly and said, "Hehe, A Li, you are really a funny child. This worry is unnecessary. You must know that you are definitely not a dwarf. You will grow stronger and taller year by year in the future." A Li put down his worries and returned to the question of the blue dwarf, slowly saying, "But I feel that this matter is a bit strange. You were just talking about the blue dwarf when a short old man walked down the street and passed in front of our window. A Li, didn't you see him look at us with a rather funny expression, as if he had heard our conversation?" Li said: "Actually, the people in this village look at us all like that. Perhaps their eyes see both of us as a bit funny. Like your sailor suit and my velvet hat, they are rarely seen, so they think they are strange, just as we feel that the village women's purple shirts and bright blue skirts are strange."

Entertainment World

### Xiong Foxi's "Sai Jinhua"

— Xitong

Xiong Foxi is one of the earlier and more established modern drama writers. I heard he was unhappy because his works were included in the "Popular Drama Series" by the Literary Research Society, thinking it was an undervaluation of him. In reality, being able to make works popular and acceptable to the masses is not an easy feat to achieve. Mr. Xiong might as well utilize his strengths in this area.

For example, his short play "The Artist," which depicts a painter pretending to be dead, almost resembles civilized drama or "farce." Furthermore, his "Sai Jinhua," which was performed at the Xuan Palace Theater, incorporated excerpts from Peking opera such as "The Drunken Concubine" and "Battle of Taiping," as well as the addition of Little Tiger, which added a lot of joyful and happy elements to the play. No wonder Lin Ke said to me, "This play is quite lively." Xu Xingzhi's "The True Story of Ah Q" also shows signs of heading in this direction. I am very happy and hope that more Guan Hanqings or Li Yus will emerge. Not everyone has to be Bai Pu or Tang Xianzu!

However, if viewed from the perspective of popular drama, "Sai Jinhua" seems to have a sense of being overly new. This is because the play not only has "flashbacks," where the characters talk about past events, but also "omissions." These omitted parts require the audience to use their minds to fill in. For example, the scene where Sai Jinhua meets Waldersee is explicitly written by Xia Yan, but Xiong Foxi uses an indirect approach. Sai Jinhua being wrongly imprisoned and the prostitute she bought committing suicide are also presented indirectly. These are things that audiences accustomed to civilized plays or movies with clear beginnings and endings are not used to. However, the many implications can attract attention, which reduces difficulties for the audience. Therefore, even civilized drama audiences can accept it with a little effort.

The tragic atmosphere of this play seems to be stronger than Xia Yan's work, although the basic tone is the same—helping others but being forgotten in return. Sai Jinhua is the Chinese "Ball of Fat" (Maupassant's novel). Xia Yan's work only considers leaving the brothel as the highest point of sorrow, while Xiong Foxi's work precedes it with imprisonment and follows it with the poverty and destitution of old age, which is extremely touching and almost unbearable to watch. Starting with drunkenness and ending with drunkenness, the entire play is integrated into one, showing considerable ingenuity.

Ru Hui's adaptation is commendable for its ending, which not only elevates Sai Jinhua's personality but, more importantly, reminds us not to forget reality.

### "China" Two-Week Anniversary

— Xinying

The China Film Studio, abbreviated as "China," was established on October 1st, the 26th year of the Republic of China. Originally, it was under the film section of the Political Training Department of the Military Commission. After expanding its organization, it was renamed China Film Studio. Therefore, today marks the two-week anniversary of "China."

The main goal of expanding the film section of the Political Training Department into "China" was, of course, to produce wartime films. However, due to the repeated internal movements of the Chinese army, "China" moved from Nanjing to Hankou and then from Hankou to Chongqing. It is still engaged in film production in Chongqing today.

After the outbreak of the war, some of the progressive film stars from Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places set off to the interior to take on the work of saving the nation through film and drama. At that time, "China" recruited many promising male and female film stars. However, the current treatment of film workers in "China" is very low. Even top-tier stars only earn around 60 yuan per month. Therefore, regardless of whether they are male or female stars, their lives in Chongqing are very simple and without the habits of film stars.

After "China" moved to Chongqing, it produced more than 20 dramatic films and documentaries in the past two years. Although these films could not be publicly screened in Shanghai due to special circumstances, they were screened in almost all the busier cities in the southwest. In Chongqing, the lack of film sources and the unsuitable weather conditions affected film production, sometimes even causing "China" to temporarily stop filming. Otherwise, I think "China's" output in the past two years would not have been limited to just over 20 films!

### Briefs from the Art Scene

When Yu Lin was filming "Flying over Walls" in "The Adventures of Jianghu," playing Gan Lianzhu, she shouted, "Being suspended and pulled around with wires like this is simply treating life like a child's play!" But she doesn't know how imposing she will look on the screen as a "female knight-errant."

Recently, Lu Ming has been riding a bicycle on Route Petain every morning. Xu Qingfang strongly opposes this, but Chen Kengran absolutely agrees because Qingfang can't ride it, but Kengran can handle it (the bicycle wheel).

Nanjing actor Ye Dexi originally intended to go to Sichuan to join "China Electric" in Hong Kong, but later accepted Tang Huaiqiu's invitation to help "China Travel." Yesterday, he received a letter from Lin Jing of "China Travel" saying that Ye Dexi had died of illness in Hong Kong on the 28th of last month, and his funeral was very bleak!

Ying Yin recently wrote from Hong Kong, saying that she has arrived safely in Hong Kong and will set off for Shanghai within a few days. Miss Li Danlu, a film and drama personality from Hong Kong Island, will accompany her.

Tang Huaiqiu of "China Travel" wrote, saying that he was invited by a certain theater in Shanghai and will lead all the partners of China Travel back to Shanghai at the end of October. The actors include Lu Cuilan, Chen Ping, Gong Jiabao, and Hong Kong movie stars Zhang Ying, Wu Hui, and many others. The lineup far surpasses its heyday.

### A Short Note on Wu Suqiu

— Ruochang

Wu Suqiu, a native of Penglai, Shandong, is the prospective daughter-in-law of General Wu Ziyu. At the age of thirteen, she entered the Chinese Opera School to study opera. She excelled and was the best female role performer in the entire school. After graduating, she became a student of Shang Xiaoyun, the master of Xinfang Studio, specializing in the Qingyi (young female roles). The plays she learned, such as "Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Sacrificing to the River," "Visiting the Palace," "Herding Sheep Mountain," and "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," were all personally taught by Qi Xia. Later, she joined Xiao Liuzhao's school, also studying various Hua Dan (vivacious female roles) plays, such as "Yutangchun," "Flower Hairpin Error," "Thirteenth Sister," "Pan Qiaoyun," and "Pan Jinlian," all following Hui Sheng as a model. Ziqiu has a wide and bright voice, suitable for both strong and gentle tones. In strong passages, she is very much like Xiaoyun, and in gentle passages, she is like Huisheng. The beauty of her singing is the best since Xue Liu. Suqiu has brought a large number of private repertoire plays with her. "Peacock Flies Southeast" and "Peach Blossom Face" have been performed in Tianjin and Beijing to packed houses. "Peacock Flies Southeast" is a unique play of the Chinese Opera School. The best performances are by Wu Ziqiu and Zhao Jinrong. The entire play has many singing parts, with Xipi slow rhythm, two-six quick rhythm, and Nan Bangzi tunes. The premiere will be next Monday, and good ticket sales can be predicted. It is said that Zhao Jinrong and Suqiu are very close, and Zhao Jinrong has decided to let Suqiu shine alone in this play.

### Today's Romania: After the Partition of Poland, Losing Lips Leads to Losing Teeth

— Wu Zhixuan

It is Quite Difficult to Deal with Being Between Two Powers

The German-Polish War, which lasted less than a month, finally resulted in the disintegration of Poland under the form of the German-Soviet partition. Romania, which is in a position where losing the lips leads to losing the teeth, is probably the second target of the aggressors. However, what will Romania do?

A Target in the Eyes of Aggressors

Romania is a country rich in agricultural raw materials. Its agricultural products are so abundant that it can be called the main food storehouse of Southeastern Europe. Its oil production history is very rich, with annual production exceeding seven million tons. Many of the European countries' mechanized troops' needed oil is supplied from here. Germany is a "oil-less" country, and its need for Romanian oil is even more pressing. If Germany could seize this huge resource—oil and grain—it would not have to fear naval blockades or oil sanctions from various countries; it could take from Romania without any worries. Therefore, how could the aggressors not be drooling over such abundant oil and fertile land?

After the end of the last European war, Romania's territory increased somewhat. In addition to its pre-war territory, it also seized fertile Dobruja from Bulgaria; seized the beautiful Dacian Plateau and Banat from Hungary; and took advantage of the Russian Revolution to recover Bessarabia, which it had lost in 1812. Supported by the power of England and France behind it, it effortlessly ruled this land for ten years. However, today its neighbor Poland has been defeated, and the environment has suddenly changed. These recovered or seized lands are precisely the hidden dangers of future destruction. Who can guarantee that these rapacious aggressor countries will not use this as an excuse to seize Romania's rich resources?

The Stirrings of the Iron Guard

Hitler's usual tactics of aggression are to create internal turmoil in a country and then achieve his goal of occupying it without rewarding a single soldier or firing a single shot. Romania's Nazi Iron Guard is the group he has been subsidizing with financial resources, instructing them to disrupt the government for many years, and their power is quite considerable. Last March, King Carol of Romania, deeply concerned about the threat of the Iron Guard, captured 200 members of the Iron Guard, including its leader, Codreanu, charged them with treason, and sentenced them to ten years of hard labor. As a result, the Iron Guard's arrogance was slightly reduced. At the beginning of this year, Codreanu was shot and killed for escaping from prison, which greatly angered Germany, but King Carol's attitude was firm, and Hitler could do nothing about it.

Unexpectedly, more than half a year later, just as there was war in Europe, the Iron Guard of Romania took the opportunity to move again, assassinating Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Calinescu on September 21. It can be seen that the Iron Guard's power in Romania still exists and is stirring restlessly during this turbulent international period.

External coercion and internal crises are indeed pushing Romania's fate to the brink of gunpowder explosion. So how will Romania deal with this?

His Future Fate

According to recent Reuters dispatches from Bucharest, Polish President Mościcki and Polish Army Commander Migrić, who had taken refuge in Romania, were detained by the authorities. This is because Romania fears the aggressor's excuse and has no choice but to do so:

However, before its fate has fundamentally changed, this policy can only temporarily delay being invaded and does not alleviate the crises around it.

Recently, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived in Moscow and will propose a Soviet, Turkish, Romanian, and Bulgarian pact to protect the existing borders of the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria. Therefore, how Romania's situation will develop depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union? At the same time, it also depends on whether Germany will concentrate all its efforts on dealing with Western European democracies or attack Eastern European countries first.

Economic Chat

### Foreign Exchange and Arbitrage

— Yongsheng

1.  What is Foreign Exchange?

Foreign exchange is the exchange rate of our country against other countries. Because different countries use different currencies, some use the gold standard, some use the silver standard, and the purity and weight of each country are different, the value of currencies is also inconsistent. Foreign exchange is the exchange rate between our country's currency and the currencies of various countries. For example, the British exchange rate, the American exchange rate, the French exchange rate, the German exchange rate, and the Hong Kong exchange rate are the exchange rates of our country's legal tender against the currencies of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Hong Kong.

2.  The Price of Foreign Exchange

In normal times, due to trade and other relationships, supply and demand parties buy and sell freely, and the prices are not far apart. However, since the War of Resistance, in order to prevent the escape of funds, foreign exchange control has been implemented. It is currently stipulated that except for the foreign exchange required for necessary imports, which can be applied for supply by the Central Bank, other foreign exchange cannot be purchased at all. Due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, in addition to the legal exchange rate listed by the Central Bank, there is also a black market foreign exchange, that is, the gray market price. There are two types of gray market prices: one is the price listed by HSBC Bank, and the other is the market trading price. The recent reports on the contraction and rise and fall of foreign exchange refer to the gray market. Inquiries show that due to trade relations, there are only two types of British exchange rate and American exchange rate in the market trading. The following is a list of several important foreign exchange prices on September 19:

British Exchange Rate: Value of One British Pound in National Currency

Central Bank Listing:

One Shilling and Two and a Half Pence

HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):

Three and a Half Pence

Market Trading Price (Closing):

Four Pence Three Four Three Seven Five

American Exchange Rate: Value of One Hundred US Dollars in National Currency

Central Bank Listing:

Thirty Yuan

HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):

Five and a Half Yuan

Market Trading Price (Closing):

Six Yuan Eight Seven Five

French Telegraphic Transfer: Value of One Hundred French Francs in National Currency

Central Bank Listing:

1.080 Francs

HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):

253 Francs

Hong Kong Telegraphic Transfer: Value of One Hundred National Currency in Hong Kong Dollars

Central Bank Listing:

95 Hong Kong Dollars

HSBC Bank Listing (Selling Price):

23.25 Hong Kong Dollars

(Note 1) The exchange rates listed by the Central Bank above have not changed since the outbreak of the war. The prices listed by HSBC Bank and the market trading prices often change.

(Note 2) The price listed by the Central Bank is a fictitious price. The original regulations on the review and approval of foreign exchange applications for the legal prices, have now been abolished.

3.  The Occurrence of Arbitrage

Arbitrage is commonly known as "profiting from differences". Because foreign exchange rates are divided into near-term and forward-term, if near-term rates are cheap and forward-term rates are expensive, buying near-term and selling forward-term at the same time can result in a difference. This difference is what is called arbitrage. The greater the difference, the greater the arbitrage interest rate. Foreign exchange arbitrage is mainly initiated by foreign banks (that is, those who post the interest). The size of the difference is determined by the needs (commonly known as "positions") of each foreign bank, and the amounts are not the same across all banks. In addition, they are mostly specified on the order form, stating that this foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank and does not accrue interest. The bank issues a deposit certificate or receipt, so foreign exchange arbitrage can be said to be credit loans absorbed by foreign banks from the Chinese. Most arbitrage is calculated in US dollars.

4.  Simple Calculation Method of Arbitrage Interest Rate

There are two calculation methods for arbitrage interest rates: one is the ordinary method, and the other is the simple method.

The simple calculation method is listed below:

(Difference between the current month's rate and the next month's rate) ÷ (next month's rate) = interest rate (monthly interest)

For example, on August 14, the US dollar price was 6.5 yuan in August and 5.875 yuan in September. The difference is 0.625 yuan. Calculate the monthly interest rate of arbitrage.

0.625 ÷ 5.875 = 106.38

That is, the monthly interest rate is 10% and 6.38%. (Note) The commission for brokers has not been deducted from the interest rate obtained above.

From January to May of this year, the arbitrage interest rate averaged between 4-5% and 5-6%. The market prices in June fluctuated greatly, and the arbitrage interest rate varied by 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%. As for the months of July and August, the highest arbitrage interest rate was as high as 11-12%. That is to say, doing foreign exchange arbitrage, with 10,000 yuan in legal tender, you could get 1,100-1,200 yuan in legal tender in interest after one month. Such a high interest rate is an unprecedented and astonishing record. However, it is heard that in September (that is, last month), foreign banks were unwilling to post interest, so there were few arbitrage transactions.

Seeing the Scenery Brings Feelings—A Refugee from North China

### The Battle of Dongting Lake: Talking about Changsha

— Rui

Since the Japanese army violently attacked the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan on the evening of this year's "September 18th Incident," the war situation has become increasingly fierce. The Battle of Dongting Lake, centered on the fight for Changsha, has already begun. Changsha, which was washed by fire on November 12th last year, has once again become the focus of attention for the people of the whole country.

Changsha's Topography

Changsha was formerly known as Tanzhou. During the Five Dynasties period, Ma Yin entered and called it Chu. Since the Qing Dynasty, it has been the capital of Hunan Province, with a dense population and bustling industry and commerce. In terms of its topography, it connects to Lingbiao in the south, points to Jingchu in the north, is flanked by Zhangjiang and Ganjiang on the left, and connects to Qianzhong on the right, occupying the key points of Hunan Province and controlling the north-south hub. It is located at the confluence of the Xiangjiang and Liuwei rivers, with a majestic shape. The railway runs through it, and boats and vehicles reach everywhere, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, the summer cloth of Liuyang, the porcelain of Liling, the rice of Xiangjiang, and the tea of Anhua are all concentrated here. The rice market is the most prosperous, second only to Wuhu in the country.

Local Attractions

There is Water Egret Island in the heart of the river west of the city, floating in the weaving waves, with lush vegetation and a serene view. Looking into the distance, it is like a night rain in Xiaoxiang, quite interesting. During the second year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty (1852), Hong Xiuquan's army marched north from Guangdong Province and besieged Changsha. The Qing army fought Xiang Rong outside the city, intending to seize Water Egret Island. Just as they were crossing the river, they were attacked from behind by Hong's army around the tail of the island. The 3,000 Qing troops were completely defeated and almost entirely wiped out. Xiang Rong fled in disgrace. This battle can be considered a miracle in the modern Chinese civil liberation war history.

Yuelu Mountain, also known as Yunlu, on the opposite bank of the Xiangjiang River, was formerly known as the tail of the seventh and second peaks of Hengyue, as mentioned in the Jingzhou Ji. The peaks are stacked and beautiful, the winding paths lead to secluded places, the bamboo and trees are lush, and the springs and streams flow. Looking at Changsha from afar, the smoke and trees are vast. Looking down at the Xiangjiang River, the sails are reflected. It is truly the first scenic spot in Changsha. Halfway up the mountain is an industrial school, rumored to be the old site of Yuelu Academy in the Song Dynasty, where Zhang Shi and Zhu Xi both lectured. At the highest point of the mountain are the tombs of the two pioneers who created the Republic of China, Huang Xing and Cai E, which are clearly visible. The remains of Mr. Ding Wenjiang, a famous figure in the modern academic world, are also buried here.

An Unprecedented Catastrophe

The Great Fire of Changsha on October 12th last year can truly be called an eternal catastrophe! After five days and five nights of burning, almost all the essence of the brocade-like Xiangyuan was turned into scorched earth. At that time, the Japanese army on the railway line was still north of Xinqiang River, 115 kilometers away from Changsha. The Japanese army on the highway was also north of Jiuling, 60 kilometers north of Pingjiang. Changsha Garrison Commander Feng Ti and others mistakenly believed the rumors beforehand and were hasty and impatient at the last minute, leading to this disaster. Although they have been executed, they truly deserved to die! Changsha originally had 420,000 to 430,000 people and more than 80,000 households. More than nine-tenths of the population fled before the fire. The remaining number should be no less than 30,000, but more than 2,000 people were buried in the fire!

After being hit by this great fire, Changsha should have been ruined. However, the courage of the Hunanese is admirable. In less than four or five months, Changsha slowly recovered from the scorched earth, and the population gradually increased to 300,000. It was only recently that it was evacuated again, and it is said that it is now no more than 30,000 again.

Military Value

As for the Japanese army's attempt on Changsha this time, most of it was due to political reasons. As Reuters reported, it was just to set off a firecracker on the eve of the establishment of the puppet central government to add some color. According to the opinions of senior Chinese military strategists, as far as the overall war situation on the Chinese side is concerned, after Wuhan, Nanchang, and Yuezhou fell, the gain or loss of Changsha was no longer important. However, the reason why the Chinese side is currently sending elite troops to guard northern Hunan is not only to protect Changsha but also to consume the Japanese army's ammunition and manpower. Although the Japanese army vainly hopes to open up the Yuehan Railway after capturing Changsha, connect with its troops in northern Guangdong, and advance northwest along the highway to Shashi and Yichang, the terrain of Hunan is very dangerous, with the Jianghan Plain and the hilly area of southern Dongting very steep. The northern Dongting Lake is flooded, the central Hengyue Mountain stands, and the southern Five Ridges are horizontal, all of which are natural barriers. I still remember that in the Northern Expedition, after the National Revolutionary Army occupied Hengyang, Wu Peifu's army abandoned Changsha and retreated directly to the border of Hunan and Hubei to fight a decisive battle. It can be seen that Changsha has no value in being defended to the death militarily. Even if the Chinese army abandons Changsha for strategic reasons in the future, it can still advance step by step. The Wan Shan mountains between western Hunan, Hengyang, and Baoqing will be the place for the decisive battle between the two sides. Moreover, the healthy men of the three Xiang areas are chivalrous and righteous, and have the most patriotic spirit. Geography and people are obviously advantageous to the Chinese army. The Japanese army is taking a risk by going deep, no different from suicide! Therefore, in this battle for Changsha, even if the Japanese army is lucky enough to succeed, what they will seize is nothing more than a scorched earth. Even if the Chinese army abandons it, it is the prelude to luring the enemy deep.

Anecdotes of Celebrities

### General Gamelin, the French Army Commander Who Predicted Events Like a Prophet

— Wu Ying

General Gamelin, the French Army Commander, is a veteran general with the oldest qualifications and most respected. Among the military figures of England and France, he is truly the most experienced and outstanding talent. In the last war, he served under the command of the brilliant General Joffre with the rank of Army Major. At that time, he suggested withdrawing the French army and joining forces with the British army to attack the enemy's right flank in Lille, but initially, Joffre did not adopt this plan. It was not until August 25, when the left flank of the army suffered a major threat, that Joffre was convinced of Gamelin's prophetic abilities and began to implement it, ordering him to command the withdrawal of the troops. Later, because General Joffre used General Kluck of Germany, who went deep into enemy territory alone, he fell into the enemy's trap. Joffre hastily sent Gamelin to transfer the French Paris garrison to the Marne front for encirclement and suppression. In this battle, Gamelin fully demonstrated his talent and completed the task within the scheduled time. In November of that year, the year the war broke out, he was promoted to Major General of the Headquarters. It was not until January 1916 that he left Joffre to serve as the commander of the Second Vanguard at Anmu Harbor. In 1925, he was ordered to help relieve the siege of allied forces in Syria, and his fame greatly increased. In January 1935, he succeeded General Weygand as the Chief of Staff of the French Army. It is said that Gamelin has a great interest in military geography, which has been of great help to his victory over the enemy. Therefore, he highly values this field. When training his subordinates, military geography was listed as an important subject. He also has a very deep understanding of strategy and tactics. From the French Revolution to the end of the Great War, he has a clear understanding of the process of each important battle and strategy, and the key to success or failure. Although he is now an old man with white hair, his spirit is still strong, just like a young man. Therefore, he will definitely be able to fulfill his important responsibilities this time.

### Thus Have I Heard

I heard that last year, a German missionary was preaching in a church one day, and accidentally said, "A lame man is a liar." Unexpectedly, a few days later, this sentence reached the ears of the German secret police. The police then warned the missionary and said, "What do you mean by this sentence? You must know that our Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, is a lame man." The teacher knew that things were a bit bad, so he simply did one thing and did it right. He asked, "Could it be that our Minister of Propaganda is a liar?"

### New Women of the Soviet Union: Only Then Can Equality Between Men and Women Be Said to Exist

— Guanqing

The new women of the Soviet Union participate in almost all kinds of activities within their country, working as men do. If the number of women participating in national cultural and industrial work is analyzed, the results are quite astonishing.

Women account for 71% of the staff in health care organizations, and 56% of school teachers.

Women make up 33% of university students. In medical universities, there are more female students than male students, with a ratio of three to one.

Among the 1,467 leaders of national scientific research institutions, women account for 92. Among the qualified scientists nationwide, there are 7,000 women and 18,000 men. A total of 20,000 technical inventions are registered in the name of women.

A woman named Mrs. Kuxina made a significant contribution to the manufacture of stratospheric balloon gasbags and was awarded the Order of Lenin, the most glorious and rare medal in the Soviet Union. Another woman, Mrs. Gamon Kagiayeva, made extremely ingenious reforms to the method of manufacturing rubber, which can greatly save labor.

In addition, Soviet women were inspired by the feat of Lusinova (the first Soviet woman to explore the Arctic) and now hold leading positions in Arctic exploration, such as Ms. Youshakova's exploration of Mawi Island at the mouth of the Lena River, who is the leader of the Second International Arctic Observation Team, and Ms. Tangmei's leadership of the Northern Winter Camp, which are the most notable.

Essentials of Health Preservation

### Autumn Diseases and Their Prevention

— Ding Huikang

When autumn arrives, the weather gradually becomes cooler, unlike the sweltering heat of summer, so life feels much more comfortable! However, several diseases, such as dysentery, malaria, and typhoid fever, seem to be prevalent in autumn as if on cue. Therefore, while enjoying the relatively comfortable life in autumn, we must remain vigilant and guard against the invasion of these diseases. Now I will write about the prevention of dysentery, malaria, typhoid fever, etc., which are just some common knowledge for everyone to prevent diseases in autumn.

(1) Dysentery

A. Causes: There are two types of dysentery: one is caused by infection with Shigella bacteria. When the excrement contains only mucus and pus, it is called white dysentery; if it contains a large amount of blood, it is called red dysentery. The other is caused by infection with amoebas and is called amoebic dysentery.

B. Prevention

(1) Flies are the carriers of dysentery. All food and drinks should be covered with gauze. Do not eat any food that is not covered with gauze.

(2) Do not drink raw water.

(3) It is best to peel all fruits before eating.

(4) Do not use the same toilet as people with dysentery.

(5) Do not put the patient's tableware in your mouth; wash it with boiling water after the patient uses it.

(6) Caregivers should wash their hands with medicated soap every time they come into contact with the patient.

(7) Lime can be put into the patient's excrement, which can kill bacteria and prevent flies from breeding.

(8) If dysentery is suspected, the pathogen can be diagnosed by examining the excrement, making it easier to prescribe medication accordingly.

(2) Malaria

A. Causes: The pathogen of malaria is a parasite belonging to protozoa, called Plasmodium sporozoite. It is transmitted by mosquitoes. The transmission route is that mosquitoes suck the blood of patients, and the blood contains pathogens. When they suck the blood of others again, they pass the pathogens on. Once infected, due to the different types and developmental forms of Plasmodium sporozoite, there are three different symptoms:

(1) Tertian fever (intermittent fever)

(2) Quartan fever

(3) Tropical fever

Among the above three types, tropical fever has the most severe symptoms, but this is a malaria that is prevalent in tropical regions and is not common in temperate regions.

B. Prevention

(1) Make efforts to eliminate mosquitoes.

(2) Use mosquito nets in bed.

(3) When malaria is prevalent, take two quinine tablets every three days.

(4) If malaria is suspected, a diagnosis can be made by examining the blood, so that the treatment will not be delayed.

(3) Typhoid Fever

A. Causes: Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi invading the human body. Flies are the carriers of the disease, and all food and drinks containing typhoid bacteria are the route of infection.

B. Prevention

(1) The method is roughly the same as preventing dysentery.

(2) When typhoid fever is prevalent, preventive injections can be given, or typhoid vaccine can be taken internally.

(3) If typhoid fever is suspected, an accurate diagnosis can be obtained by examining the blood and stool, which is easier to treat.

Customs Anecdotes

### Strange Marriage Customs of the Mongols

— Xin

Mongolian men and women are married off by their parents at the age of eighteen or nineteen. Before the marriage is arranged, it is first necessary to see how many cattle and sheep the other party has, just like we look at how much property the other party has.

On the day of the wedding, the groom wears a brand-new Mongolian outfit, rides a fast Mongolian horse, and goes to the bride's side with the matchmaker to pick up the bride; however, the bride's side closes the door and does not let the groom and matchmaker enter. The groom must sincerely explain: he will never treat her harshly or scold her in the future, only then will they allow the bride to go with the groom.

The bride and groom return together, and the man's side also closes the door and does not let the bride enter. The bride must also sincerely explain: she will definitely obey the teachings and guidance of her parents-in-law, only then can the bride and groom enter together.

### Early Married Children

— Xiaotan

Due to customs, heredity, bad environment, obscene books and movies, etc., children can mature early. Early-matured children often take the path of early marriage. Various European and Western countries have explicit regulations on the age of marriage, and the household registration survey is precise, so there are fewer early marriages, while the opposite is true in Africa and India.

French marriage laws prohibit girls under the age of fifteen from marrying, but in the barbaric tribes of Africa and India, most girls have already become mothers when European girls are playing with dolls. In the United States, due to the different laws of each state, and the household registration survey in some places is inevitably flawed, so that there are still more than 4,000 girls under the age of fifteen who have been formally married and have become mothers.

This article does not discuss eugenics but only reports the facts: therefore, only the photos of three early-married girls are attached below, with a brief explanation.

Photo 1: This sixteen-year-old Indian boy married a six-year-old girl named Linmeidina. Not long after the marriage, she gave birth to a beautiful baby weighing three kilograms.

Photo 2: In 1938, Ms. Columbus of the United States, who was only ten years old, married a blacksmith, Taketo. Five days after the marriage, her husband abandoned her and fled to the mountains, and could not be found. Columbus was then sent to an orphanage for adoption by the authorities. Since then, the local government has strictly prohibited similar incidents from happening.

Photo 3: In January 1937, in Tennessee, USA, there was a girl named Winsvit, who was only nine years old and was married to a wealthy farmer, John, who was twenty-two years old. He was a giant and seven feet tall.

### Modern Women: Standard Height and Weight

— Junpei

According to his latest research, Dr. William Johnson, a famous American medical doctor, believes that a woman's weight and height should have a certain standard to be considered a beautiful figure; therefore, he has formulated a comparison table. Currently, female college students use this comparison to test their weight.

Dr. William Johnson's standards are as follows:
