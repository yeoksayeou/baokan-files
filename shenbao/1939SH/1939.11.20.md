### Urgent Telegram from Chen Zhimin via Express Mail

Respectfully addressing Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Ju of the Judicial Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, and Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: I humbly report that last autumn, due to the burden of providing security, the people suffered excessive stress, which also affected their reputation. Therefore, after the details of the case became clear, I had no choice but to write "Methods for Manufacturing Transaction Devices," abbreviated as "Transaction Device Law," in order to prove my innocence. The book was published this spring, and I immediately sent copies to famous figures from all walks of life for correction. Besides the letters of encouragement received from this and other cities, there was no criticism or slander until the "Economic Special Issue" of the "Shen Bao" on October 9, when a person named Pan Chuandong, with unknown intentions, deliberately omitted parts of the contents of the article and then misinterpreted it, even distorting right and wrong and creating confusion to mislead people and affect social happiness, etc. After reading the report, I was extremely alarmed and mailed an urgent request on October 16 to famous figures from all walks of life, hoping they would provide their honest and balanced opinions as guidance. However, apart from the letters of praise received from Committee Member Xue of the National Government, the Central Library, and the Hong Kong Exchange Industry (which was purchased by Juxing Exchange and studied by its colleagues), I have received no other replies (there are too many other letters of praise to list). I am now submitting five copies of my humble work and six newspapers (submitted to the Aviation Bureau today). I humbly request your judgment and appraisal. If it is deemed to be misleading, confusing, and affecting social happiness, I am willing to accept the punishment of the national law. However, if it is indeed Pan Chuandong's malicious misinterpretation and distortion of right and wrong, then he should be punished accordingly. After all, any creation has a great relationship with the world, and its meaning should not be misinterpreted or misinterpreted. Considering that our country's language has been inconsistent, how can it have thousands of years of history, depending on the unified interpretation of the text? If the text can be misinterpreted at will and it is considered no major crime, then our country has 400 million people and should prevent 400 million interpretations, then the consequences are unimaginable! In short, a businessman who writes a practical reference book for his industry is not sure whether it is suitable for national law. In short, all the rights and wrongs are requested to be promulgated laws to correct the public's opinions. It is here that people's hearts are not old and treacherous are rampant. If the law is not strictly extended, how can we punish the effect? At this time of national crisis, I dare not have this adventure. Because it is a matter of the people, the small one is related to the future generations, the big one is looking forward to extra forgiveness. In the district, I am humbly and respectfully submitting this report. The people, Chen Zhimin, kowtow.

Editorial

### Thinking of Czechoslovakia and Poland

Various records concerning Czechoslovakia and Poland still occupy an important place in world newspapers and are quite vivid. Recently, such as the restoration movement led by former Czech President Benes, about 50,000 professors teaching students and ordinary cattle farmers were arrested in Czechoslovakia within a few days because of suspected national movements; the Polish government in Paris, France, officially visited London, England, Polish people in France The compilation and training of foreign troops will be completed, and Polish warships will be incorporated into the British fleet to fight together; all these political and military news of the Czech and Polish nations are what the world is paying attention to.

Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany in March of this year, and Poland was divided by Germany and the Soviet Union in October of this year. Both annexation and division are facts, but both are unresolved issues, or even judged as issues that must be redressed or can be redressed, because the Polish government still exists, and some Czech diplomats abroad still exist, which are regarded by various countries as legitimate representatives of the Czech Republic and Poland; the international community denies annexation and division as reasonable and legal, thereby denying the validity of the facts: Britain and France are at war with Germany, and restoring the Czech Republic and Poland is one of the main goals of the war. The Czech Republic and Poland are participating in this war, and the war is ongoing and has not been won or lost. For all these reasons, speaking of the Czech Republic and Poland today: it cannot be said that they are healthy, nor can it be said that they are dead; they are neither nominally dead but actually alive, nor nominally alive but actually dead, because they are in a tragic process of precariousness. This is the moment of their survival or extinction. We deeply sympathize with them and take them as a warning. Every time we hear about the recent events of the Czech Republic and Poland, we feel endless anger! Therefore, I will take a few points to tell my readers.

Today's leader of the Czech national restoration movement, Benes, still published a paper yesterday, freely talking about the general situation in Europe; this gentleman has moral integrity and can write articles. More than 20 years ago, he was very famous for his participation in the Czech revolution and national construction movement; however, strictly speaking, Benes is responsible for the Czech Republic's disaster this spring. Germany, which annexed Czechoslovakia, wantonly invaded and provoked discord in Czechoslovakia, and threatened violence, which is unforgivable and need not be discussed. From Czechoslovakia itself, there are three reasons for its self-destruction: (1) Even with a strong neighbor peeping, it still clung to the differences in race and belief, and could not unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression; for the Sudetenland and the Slovak nation, it led wolves into the house and suffered its disaster. (2) Benes, who bore the heavy responsibility of the country, could not eliminate domestic contradictions and did not know that the aggressive neighbors were insatiable; although he once said boldly that "the Czech government must try to avoid war, but is also determined to fight for survival", after the German army invaded the Sudetenland, he suddenly thought that the war would not be won, so it was better not to fight, cede land for peace, and hope for complete preservation; judging from the situation at that time, wouldn't it be said that he could bend and stretch, and was a hero who knew the times, but he never expected that he would seek complete preservation through compromise and be in dire straits, followed by leaving office and traveling far away, and finally the situation would become worse and worse. (3) Hacha succeeded Danenes as president, and he did not know how to fight against the war for survival. He went to the enemy country and accepted the conditions for national subjugation; he returned and announced to his people that "the German mechanized troops have penetrated deeply, and if the people were to resist, it would only increase the pain of national subjugation", which is like declaring their own demise. These three paragraphs are really dangerous for the country. Czech patriots, try to recall, regret is useless, can you not feel heartache?

Hacha has already sent Czechoslovakia to Germany through a compromise, and he is still the president under the control of German forces; the subjugated foreign race certainly has no independence and equality, and it is self-deception to talk about it. The living drama of yesterday and today: Germany arrested 50,000 Czech intellectuals and ordinary civilians and detained them in concentration camps, because intellectuals are naturally a thorn in the side of foreign races, and the people of the subjugated country have no guarantee. The German ordered the police under Hacha to be dismissed for poor service and the German political police arrested them. It appears the puppet president has no right to build his own power. The German representative in the Czech Republic, calling himself a protector, blackmailed President Hacha into recruiting one million Czech men and driving them to the battlefield to declare war on Britain and France, and enticed them to change the name of the protectorate to the Republic. Hacha could not obey, so he was placed under house arrest, but he still had to broadcast a speech to the people, saying that they should live in peace and not disturb each other, because the country is not their country, the people are not their people, there is no freedom in diplomacy, and no freedom in war and peace. What freedom does the "president" and the people have? Under the control of violence, they are allowed to call the name the state and the form the republic. In short, after they have subjugated the country and enslaved its people, those in power have no reluctance to have an empty name.

As for Poland, although it is still on the verge of extinction, the reason why the war is not lasting. If it had continued to fight after the German army invaded, the current situation in Poland would definitely not be like it is today: if it could continue to fight for two or three years, then the aid given by Britain and France to Poland would definitely be more effective with less effort. However, the entire army was defeated after only four or five weeks of fighting, which is a pity! What is most commendable is that Germany got Hacha as its tool in Czechoslovakia, but it could not find such a person in Poland. According to yesterday's Havas news agency's telegram from Romania, Germany is planning to organize a pro-German government in the occupied area of Poland; the German authorities have contacted a certain newspaper editor, a certain lawyer, and a certain former mayor one after another, but they were all rejected, and the German attempt has failed. From this, it can be seen that the invading country must have puppets, and it can also be seen that puppets really help the invasion; in the midst of all kinds of pain, no one in Poland is willing to be a puppet, help the invasion, and betray their country and compatriots. This is the supreme honor of the Polish nation and is enough to be proud of!

### Results of US Public Opinion Survey: Sympathy for China Gradually Increasing, Willing to Apply Pressure on Aggressor Nations

Chongqing: The Anti-Aggression China Association recently received a survey report from the American branch of the American Institute of Public Opinion, the figures of which are very interesting and meaningful. It said that in recent months, American people's sympathy for China has gradually increased, and they are willing to use various economic pressures to deal with Japan, the aggressor nation generally recognized by the public. In June, the company's current survey found that 72% of voters supported the embargo on war materials to Japan, while 40% supported the same embargo on China. Now there is a big difference. According to the latest survey, the number of people willing to stop buying "goods made in Japan" has also increased compared to the past. In October 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, only 37 out of 100 American citizens said they were willing to boycott Japanese goods. In June of this year, as many as 66 out of every 100 people supported this move. The results of the current survey show that Secretary of State Hull's notification to Japan to abolish the trade treaty has been endorsed by almost all Americans, regardless of party affiliation. In the public opinion survey conducted by the company, 81% of Democrats expressed their agreement, 82% of Republicans, and 79% of other small parties. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that American citizens are backing Hull, advocating the abolition of the US-Japan Trade Treaty and no longer transporting war materials to Japan. During the public opinion survey, the company asked the following two questions to solicit answers: (1) By the end of January next year, the US-Japan Trade Treaty will expire, should the United States no longer sell war materials to Japan? The statistics of the answers were 82% yes, and only 18% no. (2) Do you support the government's abolition of the US-Japan Trade Treaty? The statistics of the answers were 81% yes, and only 19% no.

### Central Daily News Discusses Philippine-American Relations

Chongqing: The Central Daily News in this question believes that the statement made by Sayre, the US High Commissioner to the Philippines last week, has revealed important information about the US policy towards the Philippines. The US believes that it is necessary to strengthen the defense of the Philippines because Japan may advance south. The close relationship between the US and the Philippines is enough to show its attitude towards the situation in the Far East. The newspaper went on to say that the Philippines is located in a strategic location, but it is doubtful whether Filipinos have the power of self-defense. Three years ago, Quezon, the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, said to the reporter of the Central News Agency when he passed by Changsha that the defense of the Philippines was not strong enough, so it was necessary to implement a new defense plan. However, this defense plan has not been mentioned to this day, which shows the general view of the United States' entire Pacific policy. Until recently, American politicians have regarded the Philippines as the outpost of the United States in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded that the United States was originally a stabilizing force in the Pacific. Today, it is necessary to rebuild its historical prestige in the Pacific, otherwise, the American interests in the Far East that have been invaded and ravaged by Japan will be in danger of complete withdrawal.

### Soldiers Cai and Liu Show Courage in the Face of Danger

Chongqing: Cai Shaoqing, a sergeant, and Liu Fuye, a private first class, of a certain unit of the Chinese army in the Third War Area, have repeatedly made decisions to scout out Japanese intelligence quickly and accurately. On the 4th of last month, they were again sent to scout out ×× Bridge, deep into the Japanese lines. Unfortunately, they were captured. First, they were baited with heavy money to induce them to confess the situation, but Cai and others were unmoved and scolded them loudly. The Japanese then tortured them severely. Cai and others had their hands and feet broken, but they did not yield. The Japanese believed that Cai and others refused to tell the truth, so they executed them by shooting at Shangxia Yangcaoping the next morning. Cai and others shouted loudly and calmly faced their deaths. A certain commander reported that the soldiers were loyal and courageous and unyielding, which was commendable. He specially telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to order praise and commendation and handed over the deeds to the Political Department for commendation to show encouragement and encourage those to come.

To Convene a National Assembly This Winter

Chongqing: According to reliable sources here today, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has decided to convene a National Assembly on December 12, 1940, to promulgate the constitution and establish a constitutional government to replace the current one-party government. (November 12 is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Republic of China.) The representatives of the National Assembly will be composed of those elected by the provinces and cities. The four northeastern provinces and the occupied provinces, Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and the occupied special municipalities, such as Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, and overseas Chinese in various countries will be able to elect representatives. The method of electing representatives in the occupied areas will still be based on the election law promulgated in 1937, with 400 people. After the Sixth Plenary Session is closed, the election will be carried out immediately. The National Assembly, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Program, is the highest power organ of the Republic of China, and its power is similar to that of the parliaments of Britain and the United States. According to reliable sources, the representatives elected in 1937 have already established an office for the representatives of the National Assembly in Chongqing to exchange opinions and study the future constitution of China. It is said that after the date of the National Assembly is determined, the friction between the parties will be greatly reduced. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)

### General's Instructions: Methods for Destroying Roads

Changsha: A certain general recently personally participated in strengthening road destruction efforts in a certain location. He also instructed the local populace on methods of road destruction and emphasized the significant importance of plowing fields and storing water early to convert roads into fields. He stated that the purpose of destroying roads is to impede the movement of Japanese heavy weaponry and increase the difficulty of Japanese troop marches and transportation. He urged that damaged highways and railways be quickly converted into paddy fields, that major roads be transformed into minor paths, and that dry fields alongside the roads be plowed and hoed early, with constant water storage to prevent dryness. The people of northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and northern Jiangxi should take advantage of this relatively idle time in early winter to wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to this important work to benefit the war effort. The populace was inspired upon hearing this and enthusiastically engaged in the work. (18th Dispatch)

### Sino-American Cultural Association Holds Tea Party

Chongqing: The Sino-American Cultural Association held a tea party on the 19th to welcome the association's directors, Wang Zhengting and Cheng Tianfang. Association President Kong Xiangxi presided over the event and delivered a welcoming speech. Wang Zhengting spoke about the relationship between China and the United States and the support of the American government and people for China's war effort. Subsequently, the association's Deputy Secretary-General and New York Times correspondent, Dou Dian'an, reported on the association's work. The association was established in February of this year, and branches in Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang have recently been established. A sister association will also be established in the United States, chaired by Stimson. (19th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Dr. Wang Zhengting, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a speech at a welcoming event hosted by the Sino-American Cultural Association today. He requested that the United States strengthen its Far Eastern policy and frankly inform Japan that the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty will be completely void on January 26th. However, Mr. Wang believes that while the United States' attitude towards the Far East is passive, it has already provided great assistance to China. Furthermore, this policy of the United States is consistent with its past policies towards China. The reason why American assistance to China is only passive is that it fears being drawn into a war with Japan, which is not supported by American public opinion. Regarding the cultural relations between the two countries, Mr. Wang believes that the friendship between China and the United States is due to similarities in politics, geography, and religion. Mr. Wang could not make a precise prediction about the future of the Sino-Japanese War, but he stated that unless Japan earnestly abides by the treaties it has signed, the attitude of the United States will be greatly unfavorable to Japan.

Prague: According to official reports, three Czechs, including two police officers, were sentenced to death for attacking Germans and executed by firing squad yesterday. (19th Haitong Dispatch)

On the 15th of this month, disturbances occurred again, but the situation was not serious. Up to today, one German has been shot dead.

London: Czech Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Masaryk, stated today that he frequently receives news from the Czech Republic through secret channels, and that the Czech Republic is not yet ready for a major revolution against the National Socialist government. If there were a revolution at the moment, it would not only be premature but foolish. However, it will eventually be inevitable in the future. The National Socialist Party is now carrying out its systematic plan to eliminate Czech nationality and destroy its economy. The entire protectorate can be called Hitler's largest concentration camp. President Hacha is now under house arrest in a village in Bohemia. (18th Reuters Dispatch)

### Under German Pressure, Hacha Makes Extreme Statements; Many Arrests Also in Austria

Prague: Czech President Hacha delivered a radio address last night, appealing to the people to maintain discipline during these difficult times. According to reports from British and French news agencies that Hacha had been imprisoned, this has now been disproved. In his radio address, Hacha emphasized that the events that have occurred in the Czech Republic in recent days are harmful to the rights enjoyed by the Czech Republic. The majority of Czech people are well aware of the position of the Czech Republic. Only the incitement of a small number of irresponsible elements has caused extremely regrettable events. Germany is currently engaged in a major war. It is fortunate that the Czech people can live in peace and are not suffering the horrors of war like Poland. He hopes that all people in the country will abide by the law, otherwise the authorities will take strict measures to crack down. (19th Haitong)

Brussels: The German authorities in Bohemia and Moravia are dealing with Czech students with planned high-pressure tactics. Yesterday at dawn, motorized units of the National Socialist Party's Guard arrived in Prague from Germany. They tightly surrounded the University, the Svera College and the Masaryk College, and set up machine guns at the gates. Then, fully armed, they rushed into the dormitories, dragged the students out of bed, did not allow them to put on clothes, and ordered them to board heavy trucks and be taken away. The team members then moved the machine guns to the school windows and occupied them. By noon, troops had entered the medical, law, and agricultural colleges, arresting all the professors and students and taking them to the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, Germany for detention. In addition, Czech patriotic groups and the Sokol Sports Association were also searched, and three officers of the Sports Association were arrested and taken to the concentration camp. Many Czech politicians have also been arrested. In total, it is estimated that 50,000 people were arrested throughout the Czech Republic that day. The German authorities also stated that they will continue to search and arrest people in order to eliminate the crisis of disturbance. The German agencies in Prague are heavily guarded by the National Socialist Party's Guard, which has set up machine guns, and there are many tanks patrolling the streets. (18th Havas Dispatch)

Copenhagen: A reporter from the Political Newspaper stationed in Berlin reported that members of the German National Socialist Party's Guard in Prague yesterday morning, on the 17th of this month, stopped people at Masaryk College and violently beat many students. Several of them were seriously injured, and the rest escaped from the back door wearing pajamas. The injured were taken to the hospital, but relatives who went to visit them were refused. In addition, most of the well-known Czechs have disappeared. It is not yet known whether they are hiding in hospitals or have been kidnapped. (19th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: The Morning Post reported a dispatch from the capital of Yugoslavia stating that many people are arrested in Austria every day for being related to the Munich bombing.

The express train from Vienna to Trieste was stopped for several hours, and all passengers were strictly inspected. (18th Reuters Dispatch)

### Canadian Expeditionary Force Prepares to Depart; Orders Aircraft from the United States

Ottawa, Canada: Lieutenant General McNaughton, commander of the First Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force to Europe (who will be appointed commander of the Expeditionary Force in the future), recently told the press that the date of departure of the First Division's troops is being kept secret, but morale is high, training is thorough, and its achievements will exceed general expectations. Our officers and soldiers all know the meaning of fighting, which lies in protecting civilization and not being threatened by National Socialism, so military morale is strong. This war is likely to be protracted, and the United Kingdom, France, and Canada must adjust all resources. This is what we know. Time is on the side of the Allied countries of the United Kingdom and France, and we can take our time to strengthen our forces. The Canadian people still yearn for the concept of the League of Nations, believing that after the end of the war, if we want to prevent the recurrence of a crisis, we must rely on this concept. (18th Havas Dispatch)

Ottawa, Canada: According to reliable sources, the Canadian Federal Government has ordered a first batch of 1,500 trainer aircraft from various aircraft factories in the United States, mostly Harvard-style single-leaf, dual-seat aircraft, which will be used to train fighter pilots. In addition, the Federal Government has recently purchased many Oxford Avro aircraft from the United Kingdom, which will be used to train bomber and reconnaissance pilots. (18th Havas Dispatch)

London: News from the Commonwealth of Australia has just been received here, stating that the state is currently organizing an expeditionary division of 20,000 troops, which will be sent to Europe to assist in the war as soon as training is completed. In addition, since the US arms embargo has been lifted, the number of aircraft ordered by the Australian Federal Government from the United States has doubled, and many merchant ships have been equipped with weapons to supplement naval power.

### Western Front Quiet

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 153, stating that "The front line was quiet last night." (19th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 152, stating that "The advance units and artillery units of both our army and the enemy were quite active in various locations on the front line today." (18th Havas Dispatch)

French Front Line: There are currently no fewer than 10 million soldiers from the three countries on the Western Front. However, due to continuous heavy rains, muddy roads, and rivers overflowing their banks, they have become a major obstacle for modern mechanized units. Therefore, there is unlikely to be a large-scale war before next spring. In fact, there are no signs of an early offensive from the other side. In terms of preparation, the German side's preparation behind the Siegfried Line has long been sufficient. As long as the order is given, the offensive can be launched immediately. The no-man's land between the French and German lines is half a mile wide in narrow places and about a mile wide in wide places. No one is visible during the day, but at night, both sides send out patrols everywhere. There are still villages in the no-man's land that are no longer inhabited. Patrols often visit them. When the two sides meet, they immediately open fire with machine guns. So far, activities on the Western Front have been limited to this. As for the British and French front lines on the Western Front, daytime work is completely focused on strengthening fortifications. These public works either utilize the local terrain or are specially constructed in accordance with the original plans of the General Staff. In the past month, countless trenches and tank traps have been rushed to completion. In addition, heavily concealed heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns have been deployed, and mines have been laid to deal with enemy tanks. Large trees have been cut down and placed across the roads. As for the deployment of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, the area is even wider. It is heard that the construction of the Maginot Line is more underground than the Siegfried Line, so the lives of British and French soldiers are more comfortable than those of German soldiers. However, the lives of British and French soldiers in machine gun positions outside the main fortresses are also very difficult. (19th United Press Dispatch)

Berlin: A statement from the German High Command said that there was heavy artillery and machine gun fire on a section of the Upper Rhine. The fighting on other sections was quieter. The German Air Force continued to monitor French activities. (19th Haitong)

### Bombs Explode in West London; Major Fire at Edinburgh Freight Station

London: There have been several bomb explosions in West London tonight. The seriousness of their nature is unprecedented since the implementation of the blackout. Near Piccadilly, two bombs exploded first, and half an hour later, a third and fourth bomb exploded in succession. A fifth bomb was detected before it exploded. The glass windows of several shops were shattered, but no one was injured. However, the sound of the explosions and the sound of glass falling greatly alarmed residents in the dark streets. This violence must have been committed by terrorists from the Irish Republican Army. (18th Reuters Dispatch)

London: A major fire broke out at the Edinburgh railway freight station tonight. Although fire brigades from all over the city rushed to put out the fire, the fire took advantage of the wind and spread very quickly. Several houses were burned down, including a large building containing various goods, which was completely destroyed. When the blackout was implemented, the fire soared into the sky, illuminating the entire city. Many people watched the fire. (18th Reuters Dispatch)

### The European War and the Direction of Peace by Former Czech President Beneš

(Paris Air Mail) Since the failure of the Locarno Treaty, Germany has no longer been subject to any restrictions and has expanded its power. The annexation of Austria, the contention for Czechoslovakia, and the war in Poland are all consequences of this. However, the crux of these matters is not in Austria, Czechoslovakia, or Poland, nor in how the German minorities are treated. The so-called minority issue is merely a pretense. In fact, the current war is a new and great struggle. The issues involved are no different from those in 1914. The European political situation, as a result of evolution since 1915, has reached its peak again. Ideologically speaking, this war is a clash between democracy and authoritarian National Socialism and Communism. This is the same in nature as the conflict between European autocratic politics and Western European democratic systems in 1914. In terms of the participating countries, this war is still a struggle between strong countries, with one side wanting to forcibly redistribute the world and further expand its power to dominate Central Europe and Southeastern Europe after destroying the balance of power. In terms of national concepts, the crux of this war can be summed up in one sentence: a certain nation wants to enslave the various small and medium-sized nations in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula and destroy their national and political independence. In summary, what kind of politics and spirit permeated Europe in 1938-39? Where is the cause of this war against Germanism and National Socialism? It can be seen that various historical developments, whether occurring in Europe or in other parts of the world, have a consistent system in terms of ideology, society, and economy. All major events, such as wars and revolutions, even if they erupt suddenly, are actually like a chain, connected to each other. Tracing back to the French Revolution, although the various nations of Europe have experienced vicissitudes in politics and society, they are still closely related to the situation before the Great Revolution, just as since the end of the last European War, frequent changes have occurred over the years, although the various causes and effects are intertwined, they are still related to the situation before the European War and develop along the old path. In other words, this war, even if it causes various profound changes in politics and society, will generally not be later than the historical category of the past 25 years. What must be asserted is that in waging war today and making peace tomorrow, we should recognize this purpose, seek the right goal, and organize the new Europe based on this purpose.

I believe that the meaning of this war is the same as that of the last European War. The problems to be solved and the conflicts of interest to be adjusted are not different. That is, seeking new conditions for lasting peace in Europe, the basis on which to rely is also roughly the same. Based on this, if we can seek a fairer and more lasting foundation for peace based on the experience of the past 25 years, we will be able to make some contributions. If we seek without success, Europe may disintegrate, and its political and social situation may be turbulent and restless, and even after three or four decades, it may not tend to clear up. This so-called foundation for peace is that autocratic systems, dictatorial systems, totalitarian systems, and National Socialist Party systems that glorify culture but are barbaric in reality must be overthrown unconditionally and replaced by free democratic systems. The reason is that democratic systems are morally superior and more in line with human dignity. Even in politics, they are fairer. The result sought by the current war is only this. The barbarism implemented by National Socialism in spirit, politics, and culture is fundamentally contradictory to the free thinking of Europeans and the social, political, and democratic systems it symbolizes. They are as incompatible as fire and water. When one rises, the other falls; when one survives, the other perishes. This is inevitable. Now, to establish a truly new balance of power in Europe, we must first unconditionally break Germany's National Socialist ambitions, so that it no longer considers controlling Central Europe and Southeastern Europe, and no longer imposes terrorist acts on European countries. Otherwise, wars and revolutions will continue endlessly. On the one hand, Germany criticizes the so-called humiliating Treaty of Versailles, and at the same time seeks to establish a political system, which is self-contradictory in its consciousness and spiritually bankrupt, politically shameful and unfair, and oppresses small and weak nations with barbaric means. Compared with the treatment of German minorities after the last European War, the differences in happiness and suffering are vast. From this, it can be seen that the political system that Germany intends to establish is far below the Treaty of Versailles. The distance between them cannot be measured. If this is to be politically measured, how can it be ignored and allowed to run wild? The National Socialist Party system is shameless and has no morality. It is unprecedented in European history and cannot be tolerated by any country. Even if modern human morality is declining and the spirit is decadent, it must not allow the National Socialist Party system to succeed in Europe for a moment. Otherwise, the spirit of political generosity and magnanimity will vanish in an instant, and peace and cooperation will be out of the question.

Moreover, what this war should solve is also the national issue. The Europe of the 19th century was created by the newly emerging major powers based on their own nations. The small and medium-sized nations of Eastern and Central Europe also participated in European political life as independent entities. All these nations constituted sharp problems during the last European War, and have been most threatened during this war. However, their national independence and their own political life are not to be violated by other nations. Therefore, the Europe of the 20th century should be a Europe of harmonious cooperation between major powers and small and medium-sized nations. If this problem is not solved, then after the end of this war, major powers will still have disputes because of the small and medium-sized nations, and how can Europe have peace? The crux of the problem lies not only in the principle of national self-determination. The definition of this principle was neither accurate nor fair after the end of the last European War. What should be paid attention to at this time is a pressing and simple fact, that is, if the small and medium-sized nations are allowed to participate in the policies of any strong country, the harm done will inevitably lead to destruction, bankruptcy, or loss of their nationality, and Europe will become a wilderness. The experience of Poland and Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. In this way, the independence of the small and medium-sized nations should be re-established and guaranteed within a new system of evenly distributed powers in Europe, so that they can cooperate with major powers in a peaceful environment, and lasting peace can be established.

I dare to draw a conclusion that the only goal of the current war and future peace is to seek a new peaceful solution based on the following three key points: (1) A true balance of power should be re-established between major powers; (2) A new system of peaceful cooperation should be established between major powers and small and medium-sized nations; (3) Strengthen the foundation of democratic systems and improve the collective security system, so as to establish a universal political foundation for peace. All these three points must be unconditionally implemented in order to establish peace. Our responsibility lies in following these three basic principles as guidelines, and seeking practical solutions to specific issues related to a certain country or a certain nation in Europe based on reason and a sense of honor. Then there may be peace in Europe.

Note: Beneš was a student of Masaryk, the founding president of Czechoslovakia. During the last European War, he followed Masaryk and worked hard for the national construction movement. When the war ended and Czechoslovakia was declared established, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then succeeded Masaryk as President after Masaryk's death in September 1937. Later, the Munich Agreement was reached in 1938, and he resigned and went to the United States to teach. When this war broke out, he returned to Europe to preside over the Czech restoration movement. This article is the first work he has written since his resignation. (Havas)

### 江陰偽員　陳祖培已槍決　　
From a Changyinsha Dispatch: Chen Zupei, a native of Cheng (Jiangyin), resided in Qiaoqi Township. He was recently captured by the Chinese army. After interrogation by the command, it was proven that Chen had previously served as a deputy in charge of land tax for the county government. He was dismissed due to embezzling over ten thousand yuan of public funds. However, Chen indulged in opium and lust, and even masterminded the robbery of public land. He was apprehended by military police near Qingyang on the Xicheng Road in previous years, but managed to escape and hide. After the war, he participated in the puppet organization, holding positions such as "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee and Director of the Opium Suppression Bureau." Recently, he also served as the puppet "Director of Land Tax," and volunteered to travel to the countryside to persuade people. His crimes were too numerous to be forgiven. Therefore, on the morning of the 11th, a team was dispatched to escort him to the foot of Wenxing Bridge in Houteng Town, where he was executed by firing squad.

Economic Supplement
Gains and Losses of Japanese Economy in the War
Li Shumin

The so-called "gains and losses" still cannot escape the scope of "loss." Because its direct "loss" is indeed a "loss," even if there is some "gain," it is "not worth the loss," which is enough to worry about for a lifetime. Here, I would like to add a detailed review of the "gain" situation, while the actual situation of the "loss" has already been described by many people. Here, I will only state its outline.

Japan's economic losses: (1) Military expenses—the budget up to 1940 will cost 125 billion yen. If it is extended to the end of 1942, the current annual cost of 5 billion yen will increase by 125 billion yen, totaling 250 billion yen. (2) Japan's export trade—Japan's trade with North and South America, Europe, and Africa has decreased by 31/100 since the Sino-Japanese War, and will decrease further in the future. (3) Japan's shipping revenue—This revenue has fallen by 46/100 compared to 1938 and 1936, as merchant ships are forced to be used for military needs. (4) Revenue from travelers—Since the start of the war, revenue has decreased by 55/100. This is certainly not a permanent loss, but it will not be restored without five years of peace and prosperity. (5) Reserves—The reserves to maintain Japanese currency have fallen from 1,600,000 yen to an uncountable amount. (6) China's hatred—The hatred of the Chinese people towards Japan caused by the invasion will forever prevent Japan's attempts to establish friendly economic relations with China.

As for the economic gains in the war, they must be explained in detail from three aspects: (1) Raw materials—Raw materials can obtain cotton, wool, and iron resources; however, these resources have disappointed the Japanese in terms of quantity, and tens of billions of yen must be invested to develop them. (2) Commercial markets—The Japanese can manipulate China's import trade, but the collapse of the purchasing power of the Chinese people will limit the import trade to a small portion of the past. (3) Looting Japan has acquired several Chinese factories, railways, electrical plants, and a large number of iron sheets; and obtained profits from selling drugs; and money exploited from the commercial aspects of the Chinese. However, the total addition of several benefits is still less than the cost of a Japanese wave.

Raw Materials

According to reason, the reason why China has become an ideal raw material supply base for Japan actually has hidden factors, that is, the special raw materials produced in China are more needed by Japan than other raw materials. In 1936, the three largest items imported by Japan from abroad are listed in the table below:

These three types accounted for 45/100 of the total import amount that year, mostly imported from Britain and the United States, and very few imported from China. The Japanese argument is that if they can subdue China and apply scientific production methods, they will certainly be able to make it self-sufficient. The following ironclad evidence will make them utterly disappointed.

(A) Cotton: In 1936, China was the third largest cotton-producing country in the world, with a production of 4 million bales (475 pounds per bale), almost the total amount needed by Japan. However, Chinese cotton yarn is very poor (coarse). 96/100 of the production is sold as cotton cloth by domestic yarn factories: that is, the total supply of cotton to the Chinese market and Japanese export trade is no less than 8 million bales. By the beginning of 1939, most of China's cotton-producing areas were behind the Japanese front line; because the countryside was a guerrilla zone, farmers were advised to reduce cotton fields by 70/100. From this, it can be known that before the guerrillas are eliminated, the amount they obtain is only a small number of what they used to produce. Moreover, even if "security is restored, the cotton-growing area cannot be increased to 20/100 of the pre-war level, otherwise there will be a risk of famine; unless they can make Manchuria a granary to make up for the lack of food in the new cotton fields, otherwise they will have to rely on the world market for 3/4 of the cotton."

(B) Wool: The wool produced in northwest China and Inner Mongolia was mostly exported to the United States in 1936, accounting for (35 million pounds), or 14/100 of Japan's needs. The Japanese ambition is to be able to compete with Australia with scientific methods. After the establishment of the puppet government of Inner Mongolia, eight Japanese wool textile factories were allowed to obtain exclusive rights to collect wool. The Japanese once selected 5 million dan of high-quality wool (133.3 pounds per dan), buying it at a price lower than the current price and reselling it to the Japanese authorities, but they did not gain the government's favor; and Chinese ranchers began to refuse to sell wool, so the Chinese government bought and transported it to the Soviet Union in exchange for other goods. In 1938, Japan obtained only 1/3 of what it produced. Due to its limited capabilities, Japan cannot protect it with force or cultivate it with capital to compete with Australia until it becomes clear.

(C) Iron ore: In 1936, China produced 1.3 million tons of iron, almost all of which was transported to Japan, which was not even one-tenth of what it consumed. After the war broke out, the demand increased sharply, and it was estimated that 10 million tons (most of which was expected to be from China) would have to be imported by 1940 to achieve balance. However, this iron supplied by China is another disappointment for the Japanese. China's main iron ore is concentrated in two places—Longyan in Inner Mongolia and Hubei and Anhui in the Yangtze River. The former had stopped before the war, and the latter had been mortgaged to Japan in the past 20 years. Last year, Japan began to export Longyan iron, hoping to obtain 500,000 tons, because Longyan iron ore is only profitable during the war, so we doubt whether the 500,000 tons of iron can be obtained in full. As for the iron in Hubei and Anhui provinces, it reached its peak in 1936, but it was still less than 100 yuan of what they consumed. They obtained it in 1938.

Commercial Markets

China has always been Japan's worst commercial customer, that is, Taiwan, with a population of only 5 million, purchased more Japanese goods than China between 1930 and 1936. In 1936, China sold more than 4 percent of Japanese export goods; this number was still less than 1/6 of what China imported. Japanese merchants hoped that military occupation of China would inevitably lead to more sales of their goods, and they were not disappointed in this regard: In 1938, Japan occupied the main transportation lines of ten provinces in China, and Japanese goods accounted for 46/100 of China's imported goods. If only the areas occupied by the Japanese army are counted, Japanese goods have accounted for 65/100 of the market. However, this increase in trade was mostly obtained at the expense of European and American businesses. The means used were (1) issuing a new currency system in North China, (2) all railways were controlled by the Japanese, and European and American goods were always blocked, (3) puppet governments were established to lightly collect taxes on foreign merchants' goods. As a result, US trade with China fell sharply by 52/100 in 1938, British trade also decreased by 46/100, and German trade decreased by 35/100. And further reduced until Japanese goods accounted for 80/100 of imported goods (the same as other colonies). This is not enough to clarify the tragic situation of the market in this war. The great collapse of the purchasing power of the Chinese people after the war was its direct result. The loss suffered by Shanghai alone is nearly 10 billion yuan. The population of Nanjing has decreased from 1.2 million to 10,000, and Guangzhou has decreased from 1 million to 20,000. The number of homeless and unemployed people in various places is even more alarming. There are 300,000 people in Peiping who rely on public relief for a living, 500,000 workers are unemployed in Shanghai, and there are no fewer than 200,000 workers in Qingdao who have no way to make a living. Japanese merchants have indeed plundered China's import business, but their main market has shrunk to a small part of what it was before. To restore China's prosperous commerce, tens of billions of investments are needed to rebuild factories, shops, houses, re-equip machines, re-import goods, and help refugees return to their homeland. However, can the Japanese bear this cost? Then the business can only be allowed to decline.

Looting

The cause of looting lies in the consequences of their "quick victory" that could not be obtained. In Shanghai, the Japanese army destroyed 5,255 factories and collected their dilapidated machinery; in cities along the Yangtze River, they collected iron lampstands, iron sewer covers, stoves, and even mailboxes as raw materials for Japanese arsenals, and machinery and iron sheets from the Hanyang Arsenal. The total amount of iron obtained in this way was millions of tons. The remaining industrial and public utilities along the coast were all plundered by Japanese merchants. In North China, they plundered 80 factories producing wheat flour, cigarettes, water, cement, cotton yarn, beer, and soda.

As for China's commerce, the Japanese also tried their best to exploit it. All the shops in North China must join the Japanese as partners, and famous hotels in coastal cities were forced to sell their assets at a fraction of the market price. The exclusive rights to eggs, China's largest export, have been granted by the Japanese army to a retired military officer. Other reports say that military officers have resigned from the military to run a monopoly business in vegetables in Shanghai.

The most barbaric of all Japanese patents is their coastal production company. They sank Chinese fishing boats along the coast and shot fishermen with machine guns; according to reports, the Japanese Navy was behind them. It is reported that between June and December 7, 1938, a total of 216 fishing boats were sunk by Japanese military boats. There will be more news about the sinking of fishing boats near Shanghai.

Those who operate gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens are thousands of Japanese merchants and hooligans who came to China with the army. Their power is spreading rapidly. There are 304 places selling drugs in the city of Peiping, all of which must pay taxes to the Japanese military police; in Shanghai, the Japanese sell narcotics, and the price reaches 1.5 million yuan per month (according to an investigation by American Alco). In total, 7 million yuan was earned in July 1938.

The looting situation is indeed very large, but in the eyes of their warlords, they still think that it is far from ideal and despise it.

To sum up, Japan's disappointment in seizing Chinese raw materials, the lack of profits in Chinese commerce, and the small amount of loot obtained are the overall situation of their "gains"; these three things have led to the gradual reduction of Japan's exploitation plan. At the beginning of the invasion, a Japanese banker declared that Japan would invest 150 million yen in North China. Three months later, the Shanghai war ended, and the investment amount was reduced to 130 million yen. Four days later, Suzhou fell, and it was reduced to 80 million yen. Last year, Hankou fell, and it was further reduced to 35 million yen. Where did the capital flow? It is "bombs, shells, bullets."

The Past Week

The price of rice jumped three or four yuan, which is obviously manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. But the rice merchants are still ceaselessly talking, explaining the reasons:

(1) The Japanese puppets are blocking the source.
(2) Japan is facing a rice shortage and is coming to China to buy.
(3) Some even say that the high price of rice can encourage merchants to transport rice to Shanghai.

Let us believe it for the time being: The rice merchants are, in fact, like all citizens, part of the oppressed. And they recently hope that the financial community will expand rice mortgages so that they can hoard rice for the citizens, "stock up grain to prevent famine." Because the authorities of the concession's plan to set up grain storage warehouses cannot be implemented. This shows that they are still concerned about people's livelihood and protect the food supply! They should be thanked.

However, it is hard to believe that there are no bad people in the rice industry. For example, when the Bureau of Public Works initially tried to limit prices, many rice merchants were arrested for violating the law. This is a public example.

Furthermore, we dare not "believe it for the time being" about the above three reasons. The so-called "rewarding merchants" is even more of a joke. And for the act of manipulation, they have already confessed without being beaten. As for the first two points, there are also problems. Because:

Shanghai people, except for a very small number, do not communicate with the occupied areas. What are the Japanese puppets doing? It is just hearsay, and there is no way to understand. And cutting off the livelihood of the Chinese people and killing the lives of the Chinese people is the original face of the Japanese puppets. Large-scale invasion of China and massacre of Chinese people are still ongoing. Therefore, blocking the arrival of rice in Shanghai can be deeply believed. But what is strange is (1) Why have recent Japanese puppet newspapers hardly recorded this item? (2) Why are there no figures of Chinese rice exported to Japan in the Japanese customs registers? Instead, there are records of a large amount of Japanese flour coming to China. (3) The financial resources of the puppet organizations rely on harsh taxes. If rice is prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, they will suffer a major loss. The more rice from the occupied areas is transported to Shanghai, the more income they have. Isn't it suicide to prohibit exports? (4) If it is said that it is because of harsh taxes that rice is expensive. Harsh taxes should be a fact, the problem is how much is collected? And since the price of rice is expensive because of harsh taxes, there is no room for price drops after it is expensive: Why did they suddenly dump the rice once before? As the saying goes, "The weasel on the chicken coop, even if it doesn't steal chickens, it is still a chicken thief." The evil deeds of the Japanese puppets are like yellow chicken wolves: no one wants to and cannot defend them. However, the above points of doubt are also worth noting. The facts that we can believe are: the harsh taxes of the Japanese puppets are a fact; it is also a fact that they obstruct the transportation of rice to Shanghai for the sake of harsh taxes. But their purpose is to make money. If the harsh taxes are excessive, no one will buy it at all. Therefore, their tyranny must be limited. Since the Japanese puppets are levying harsh taxes, and Shanghai has no way of knowing how much they actually levy, the rice industry's bad elements take this as an excuse to raise prices and hoard goods. Since the price of rice in Shanghai is expensive, the Japanese puppets will naturally want to expand their demands when levying harsh taxes; so the price of rice in Shanghai is even more expensive. The price of rice in Shanghai, after they colluded in such a mess, rose again and again. The people were flustered, and more households bought, and speculators participated in hoarding. This is the reason for today's phenomenon. This is the reason for the past surge in rice prices.

As for the recent rise in rice prices, the above reasons have changed. One is that the new rice is on the market, and the other is that there is a good harvest in various places; all parties unanimously hope that it will be small; for the sake of revenue, the Japanese puppets have to reduce their extortion. This is the reason why the previous rice price once returned to small.

Since the price of rice collapsed, hoarders were greatly afraid. Therefore, they used all kinds of opportunities or created all kinds of atmosphere. For example, a certain public group requested the authorities of the concession to set up warehouses to store grain, and the news that Japan was facing a rice shortage was an opportunity for them to use. Recently, the newspapers have also been reporting a large amount of foreign rice imports. Judging from the situation, even if it is a fact, it is definitely not a new order. 99% of the time, it is the order in the rice shortage that was delivered this time. Because its price is not much different from today's rice price, but it is much more expensive than the price increase before this time. At the time of the last surge in rice prices, all parties did not want to import foreign rice because there was no profit to be made; how much more so now. But the spread of this kind of news can greatly suggest to all sectors: The rice shortage in Shanghai has reached the point where foreign rice must be imported." Foreign rice is so expensive, and Dumi will certainly be more expensive." The rice price rebounded, and the hoarders have a chance to survive, not only this: (1) The autumn harvest will soon begin, and there will be a salt harvest, and the bottom line in the inland is very thick. (2) Farmers are eager to sell

### Dutch Steamer "Simon Bolivar" Sinks in North Sea After Hitting German Mine; 140 Feared Dead in Wartime's Greatest Tragedy; British Admiralty Alleges German Violation of International Law

London – The Dutch regular passenger steamer "Simon Bolivar" has sunk off the east coast, with 140 people feared dead. 250 survivors have landed at a port on the east coast. The captain is reportedly dead. According to a ship's officer, the ship suddenly heard an explosion off the east coast, and the ship shook. Everyone on board knew something had happened, but there was no excessive panic. People rushed to the lifeboats, and some took a few belongings. Shortly afterward, there was a second explosion, as violent as the first. In the opinion of the officer, after the first mine exploded, the second mine, connected by an iron cable, also exploded, hence the two explosions. It is reported that two other ships were also destroyed by mines at the site where the "Simon Bolivar" sank, but were able to sail into port. (Reuter, 18th)

London – Following the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar," more than 250 rescued passengers, including more than twenty children, arrived here last night. It is reported that the total number of casualties is 140, most of whom were killed when the ship struck the mine. The Dutch ambassador, accompanied by several embassy staff, visited the survivors at their hotel this morning to express condolences and inquire about the incident. They said that the ship struck the mine twice, once at the stern and once on the starboard side. These mines were probably laid the previous evening. A survivor said that the ship was sunk by two torpedo hits. One survivor told the press that when the "Simon Bolivar" first exploded off the coast of eastern England, all the passengers rushed into the lifeboats. At that time, the captain was on deck and was killed on the spot. Fifteen minutes later, a second explosion occurred, making rescue even more difficult. I saw more than eighty passengers fall into the sea, and the sea was full of oil stains. The ship's wireless radio was also damaged and unable to send out a distress signal. (Havas, 19th)

The Hague – Following the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar" in British waters yesterday, it has been learned that the ship, weighing 8,000 tons, set sail from the Dutch port of Eemshaven on the 17th of this month for the Dutch island of Curaçao in South America. According to the latest news, the total number of casualties on the ship is 265 passengers and 135 crew members. 310 people have been rescued. The ship carried 90 British passengers, as well as many Jewish refugees from Germany and Central European countries. (Havas, 19th)

London – 260 survivors of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar," including those seriously injured, were immediately sent to hospitals for treatment after landing at Harwich. A baby under one year old was also injured. Some of the survivors arrived in London at midnight, and many doctors and nurses were on the station platform to care for them. It is reported that after the ship struck the mine, the ship shook violently. At that time, the passengers remained calm, preparing to board the small boats to escape. Unexpectedly, another explosion occurred, probably caused by a second mine exploding, so the rescue work could not proceed as usual, and the ship capsized. In addition, all ships within a quarter of a mile around the accident site were shaken, and two ships that were closer were damaged but were still able to sail normally. (Havas, 18th)

London – Regarding the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar" in British waters after hitting a German mine, the British Admiralty issued a statement saying that the area where the accident occurred is a route frequently used by British and neutral ships. Germany laid mines in this area without notifying neutral countries, which is a violation of international law and another clear example of disregard for humanitarianism. (Havas, 18th)

London – The Dutch passenger ship "Simon Bolivar" sank in the North Sea after hitting a mine. 140 passengers and crew members are feared dead. If this news is confirmed, it will be the biggest tragedy since the outbreak of the European War. In the "Athenia" sinking, only 112 people died. 260 survivors of the "Simon Bolivar" arrived on the east coast of England last night, all extremely exhausted. 17 people were immediately sent to local hospitals, including three infants under one year old. The ship's first mate was also among the rescued. The Admiralty declared that this case is another example of Germany violating international law by laying mines in commercial shipping lanes without notification. The survivors arrived in London by train before midnight yesterday. Ambulances, cars, and doctors and nurses were waiting at the station in the dark. When they arrived, they were all disheveled, some wrapped in blankets. Police officers illuminated with large flashlights and helped them onto the cars. The women were not combed, and it was reported that one or two had sleeping babies in their arms. One of the ship's stewards on the "Bolivar" stated, "We were sailing along the east coast and there was no warning when there was a large explosion. The people on board immediately felt the seriousness of the situation and immediately rushed to the lifeboats. Then there was another mine explosion. I think this second explosion may have been caused by another mine connected to the first mine. The 'Bolivar' was a large ship with 265 passengers and a large crew. Although the number of dead and injured is not yet known, I believe it will be a significant number." The steward then wrapped his blanket tightly and continued, "I don't know how I escaped. I was lucky to survive." (Associated Press, 19th)

### German Navy Captures Two Swedish Ships; Two German Ships Leave Portuguese Port

Stockholm – The Swedish ships "Oscar" and "Tourer," both not carrying cargo, have been captured by German warships and ordered to sail to Swinemünde, Germany. (Havas, 18th)

London – The German ship "Glory," carrying a large quantity of wheat, was captured by a British warship a few days ago, and sailors were sent aboard to escort it to a port in Scotland. The German crew members have been detained. (Havas, 18th)

Beira, Portuguese West Africa – The German ships "Wilfried Warman" (13,000 tons) and "Adolf Warman" (8,000 tons) had taken refuge in the Portuguese port of Lobito at the beginning of the European War. Until last night, they suddenly set sail from the port and headed for the high seas. Where they intend to go is still unknown. According to observers, the sudden departure of these two ships from a neutral port is related to the news of German pirate ships operating in the South Atlantic. (Havas, 19th)

London – The captain of a German ship, along with 57 crew members, landed at a port in Scotland today. They scuttled the ship when the British warship ordered them to stop. Among the crew members was a boy of fifteen years, holding a cat. When they landed, they waved and cheered at the residents. (Reuter, 18th)

Copenhagen – The captain of the Danish ship "Canada," which sank in the North Sea on November 4, Klausen, insisted during the Danish authorities' investigation of the sinking today that it sank due to hitting a "magnetic mine." (Reuter, 18th)

### British and Polish Navies Establish Cooperation Methods

London – The Polish government has signed an agreement with the British authorities to establish cooperation methods for both navies. Several Polish warships are now in the North Sea and will cooperate with the British Navy until the end of the war. (Havas, 18th)

### German Prisoner Escapes from Scottish Asylum; Found in Corridor

London – Three young Germans, who were imprisoned in an asylum in eastern Scotland, broke through the wire mesh outside the asylum and escaped today. They were searched for in the southern Scottish countryside that night and are now under police custody. The three were all members of the German submarine crew. They had no money or food, and could not speak English. They were wearing khaki clothes when they escaped that night, but not uniforms. (Reuter, 18th)

The Hague – According to news from London, three German ship stewards, one only fifteen years old and the other two seventeen, who were detained in a British concentration camp in eastern Scotland, escaped from the concentration camp yesterday morning. The British authorities issued a broadcast alert to hunt them down. By the evening, there was no news. (Haitong, 18th)

### Italian Newspaper Opposes Soviet Expansion into the Balkans; Mussolini Delivers Speech, Striving for Economic Self-Sufficiency

Rome – An Italian newspaper stated that if the Communist Party hopes to use revolutions in other countries, or use untimely social revolutions as bait, to expand its influence in the Balkans, it will inevitably conflict with Mussolini's doctrine and the Italian army. This doctrine and army have fought against the Communist Party in Italy, Spain, and other places. (Reuter, 18th)

Rome – The Italian Supreme Self-Sufficiency Conference was held yesterday, with Prime Minister Mussolini presiding and delivering a speech, emphasizing the importance of economic self-sufficiency. He declared, "Today is the fourth anniversary of the national humiliation of the five countries being subjected to economic sanctions. The Economic Self-Sufficiency Conference is being held on this historically significant anniversary, and we should intensify our efforts to implement the policy of economic self-sufficiency." Mussolini declared that there is only wartime economy in the national economy, and no peacetime economy, because even in the so-called peacetime, wars occur. The Italian nation has learned from history that only economic self-sufficiency can ensure survival. Regarding the existing achievements, I express my gratitude to inventors, manufacturers, workers, and consumers. However, progress must be accelerated, and strength must reach its goals. I hope that the whole country will unite and work hard for the future of the motherland. (Haitong, 19th)

### Belgium and the Netherlands Protest to Belligerent Countries Regarding Aircraft Crossing Borders

Brussels – A communiqué was issued here today stating, "In the past two days, aircraft of the belligerent countries have frequently flown in Belgian airspace. The Belgian government has instructed its ambassadors abroad to protest to the governments of the countries concerned." (Reuter, 18th)

The Hague – There have been two incidents of German aircraft violating Dutch neutrality. The Dutch government has protested to Germany. In the first incident, a Dutch fighter plane encountered a German seaplane while flying over Vlieland and fired at it. The German plane returned fire with machine guns and then escaped. In the second incident, a Dutch plane encountered another German plane in its national airspace. The German plane only flew away after the Dutch plane fired. (Reuter, 18th)

Brussels – A semi-official Belgian news agency stated that there is reason to believe that the rumors that Italy and Spain have expressed concern to Germany regarding the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and Belgium are not without foundation. It is reported that the governments of these countries have made this move jointly, with the apparent purpose of assisting the peace movement of the Netherlands and Belgium. However, they negotiated with Berlin separately, not jointly. It is also reported that these countries conveyed the same message to the British and French governments on November 11. Responsible parties in Brussels have neither confirmed nor denied these rumors. It is also reported that Italy and Spain have requested the British government to grant neutral countries equal treatment in maritime trade. (Reuter, 18th)

Brussels – It is reported that the governments of Italy and Spain have notified Germany through diplomatic channels that they are extremely concerned about the need to respect the territorial integrity of Belgium and the Netherlands. A local evening newspaper recently reported that officials are unwilling to publicize this matter, but according to reliable sources, Italy and Spain did make representations to Germany on November 12. The Italian government did so indirectly, while the Spanish ambassador to Germany expressed his views directly to the German government in a firm tone. (Havas, 18th)

### Egyptian King Declares Full Support for Britain

Cairo – The 15th session of the Egyptian Parliament opened today. King Farouk ordered his Minister of the Court to attend the meeting and read out a decree, stating, "Our country has been fully assisting Britain and is determined to defend our territory. We firmly believe that justice and righteousness will prevail, and our country will become stronger. The government has now drafted plans to develop the cotton industry and various other industries, so that Egypt, even in these troubled times, can fulfill its responsibilities." (Havas, 18th)

### Mussolini's Son Leaves Portugal

Lisbon – Bruno Mussolini, son of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, paid a visit to the Portuguese President Carmona and then held talks with the Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar yesterday morning. He then flew to Seville on his own plane in the afternoon of the same day. (Haitong, 19th)

### Finland Willing to Cede Seven Islands

Helsinki – According to news from Moscow today, the Soviet Union's demands in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations include two points: (1) Modify the Soviet-Finnish border, moving it north to the line of Kovisto-Ribara in Karelia; (2) Cede the seven islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union. It is reported that Finland's counter-proposal has agreed to the second point, the cession of the seven islands. Regarding the first point, the Karelian border, it only allows moving north to the line of Ribara-Vämäsu. (Haitong, 19th)

Helsinki – A Finnish social democratic newspaper's international political editor, Sven Tuominen, suggested reopening the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. He opposed the view of the "Finnish Uusi Suomi" newspaper that a state of no treaty is better than an unfair treaty. He pointed out that continuing negotiations is to continue maintaining the legal basis. If the negotiations break down, the international legal basis will also be destroyed. Reopening the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is the best guarantee for maintaining peace. (Haitong, 19th)

Helsinki – Eight Finnish freighters, carrying a batch of celluloid and heading to the United States, were intercepted by German warships last month and ordered to sail to the German ports of Stettin and Swinemünde for detention. It has been more than a month, and they were only released today. In addition, seven other Finnish freighters are still detained in German ports. (Havas, 19th)

### Wartime Life of German Senior Military Officers

Berlin – The "German General News" published an article stating that the current German senior staff officers are slightly younger than the German senior staff officers before the European War. Hindenburg was sixty-seven years old when he became the commander of the army. In this German-Polish campaign, the commanders of the German army were almost ten to fifteen years younger than Hindenburg's age when he took office as commander. Most notably, the current German Air Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Jeschonnek, is only forty years old and has already held an important position. Since the establishment of the Prussian and German army, there has never been such a young person holding such a high position. In this German-Polish campaign, the German generals who received the highest awards were all between fifty and sixty years old, most of whom had participated in the previous World War, serving as junior officers. During this operation, the German senior officers mostly shared hardships with the soldiers. The regimental commander and even the division commander also fired on the front line with the soldiers. Officers often slept in the open on the roadside during combat, lying on straw or mud with the soldiers. General Reichenau, age fifty-two, was extremely brave and jumped into the Vistula River with the vanguard infantry and swam across the river. The soldiers were even more inspired when they saw this.

### Before Japanese Troops Land in Beihai, Japanese Planes Harass Various Subordinates of Lianzhou; Lingshan and Beihai Bombed; French Catholic Church in Beihai Also Destroyed

Guangzhou Bay News: The Japanese aircraft carrier on Weizhou Island has been continuously sending planes to harass various counties in southern Guangdong and invade Guangxi Province. At dawn on October 18, eight Japanese planes took off from the Weizhou Island aircraft carrier and sneaked into the airspace of Lingshan, dropping 20 bombs, destroying more than 20 houses and killing and injuring seven men and women. After the Japanese planes committed atrocities, they fled south, passing through Wuli, Baishi Water, Zhang Huang, Jiuzhou, to Changxu, and the areas along the river, opening machine guns for indiscriminate shooting. After investigation, it was found that a total of two cargo ships were sunk, eight cans of wood oil were destroyed, one civilian was killed, and five people were injured. On the same day, the bombs dropped by Japanese planes in Lingshan included two bombs landing behind a certain hospital, one bomb hitting the rear of Guanghe Hall on County Front Street, one bomb hitting Huang's residence at No. 12 in a certain park, one bomb hitting the Lianglai Inn and the nearby Zeng's residence, one bomb hitting the front of the County No. 2 Elementary School, and one bomb hitting the auditorium. The ancestral hall of Liu in Ximen and the nearby water pond near the Huang's ancestral hall behind the Martyrs' Shrine, and the road near Huaguang Temple were all bombed. In addition, one bomb also landed on Sanhaiyan, and one bomb landed on the county's dormitory and the courtyard and the nearby water pond. Two men and one woman were killed and four people were injured there. At dawn on the 20th, one Japanese plane invaded Beihai again and dropped four bombs, two bombs landed in Tang'er Village on the outskirts of the city, one hit a rice field, destroying a cattle cart and a house, with no other losses, one bomb hit the red building where the priest of the French Catholic Church lived. The bomb landed diagonally, uprooting several pine trees next to the foreign house. The French expatriates there were terrified. Another bomb landed in front of a middle school, destroying three houses. The walls of the middle school were full of bullet marks. On the 19th, residents of various places in Lianzhou, terrified of the Japanese planes, fled to safe areas at dawn. The weather was excellent that day, and there was no air raid alarm in northern Lianzhou all day. Unexpectedly, at 6:05 pm, at dusk, Lianbei and the coastal towns, as well as Wuli, which belongs to Lingshan, simultaneously issued night attack alerts. Although the alarm was issued at night, fortunately, the moonlight was dim, and the evacuation was not too chaotic, so the order was still good. It was later learned that at 5:35 that night, 27 Japanese planes took off from Haikou and raided the Leizhou Peninsula, and then there was silence, and the localities began to disband.

Also, since the Japanese aircraft carrier sailed to the waters of Weizhou, it has been more than three months. Although it has moved to Haikou three times, it returns the next day, sending planes out every day to attack various places in Guangdong and Guangxi. The coastal counties and cities of southern Guangdong, such as Xuwen, Mecha, Suixi, Hepu, Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fangcheng, have all suffered from its harassment.

### Japanese Planes Use Air-Burst Bombs That Explode Without Hitting the Ground

Kunming News: Kunming's terrain is particularly high, reaching an altitude of 3,000 meters. If bombers come here to drop bombs and cannot maintain an altitude of more than 6,000 meters, they are easily hit by ground fire. Very few of Japan's current bombers have this function. In addition, Kunming is now too far from the Japanese air force base, and summer and autumn are the rainy season, for various reasons. Therefore, since the war of resistance, Kunming has been bombed by Japanese planes far less than other major cities in the Chinese rear. However, recently the Japanese side has stepped up bombing of important cities in the Chinese rear, and Kunming is of course the most important of these important cities. Moreover, because the rainy season has passed, it is generally rumored here that the Japanese side will soon use the most excellent planes to gamble on this. The Yunnan Air Defense Command held an important meeting at 4 pm on the 4th to strengthen air defense. In addition to active air defense, there are various plans in the passive aspect. It is also heard that at the meeting, a telegram from Chongqing on the 1st of this month was read out, stating that according to reports, Japanese planes recently planned to use a large number of air-burst bombs. This type of bomb explodes without hitting the ground and is specially used to kill civilians in large numbers. It is especially effective for civilians in the open air in the suburbs. In the past, when Kunming encountered air raids, most civilians gathered in the suburbs. We should strengthen prevention against this cruel and poisonous conspiracy. The meeting should conduct in-depth research based on this instruction, and countermeasures have been determined. After the meeting, according to the Air Defense Department, many of the strongest large-scale air raid shelters will be built in the near suburbs of Kunming. In addition, during air raids, the military police and strong men in the city still perform their duties in the streets as usual, which is extremely dangerous. It has now been decided to purchase large 50-gallon gasoline barrels and install them underground to provide shelter for them when necessary.
