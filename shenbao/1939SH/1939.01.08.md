Under the leadership of our supreme leader, we have fought on the battlefields for a year and a half, avenging our humiliation and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks.

We hereby appeal to the military and civilians of the entire country to unanimously advocate sanctions against Zhao and to unite sincerely, adhere to the national policy, and support our supreme leader and resist to the end.

Editorial

### Public Mobilization in Guerrilla Zones

Since the War of Resistance entered a new stage, the role of guerrilla warfare has become increasingly important. The Military Affairs Commission issued a general order that "occupied areas" should be uniformly renamed "guerrilla zones," indicating that wherever the Japanese army has set foot, a broad guerrilla war should be launched, which is not only a matter of renaming. Although guerrilla warfare is a military action, it must be coordinated with public mobilization to succeed. The nature of guerrilla warfare is definitely not the "roaming around" plundering like roving bandits as advocated by Wang Jingwei, but a sudden attack that can be launched anytime, anywhere. It is impossible to accomplish this task unless the military and the people are integrated into one. Therefore, the term "coordination" is not enough, it can even be said that the public mobilization in guerrilla zones should be even more important than military action.

The Japanese army's iron hooves can only occupy "points" and "lines," not the entire "area." Everyone understands this. However, in the so-called point and line areas, although the "land" has fallen, the "people" have not fallen. Mechanists will think that there are no "people" at all in the areas that have fallen, because the people have already dispersed before the army retreats, and when the army retreats, the people also go to the rear. What the Japanese army gets is scorched earth and empty cities, with no materials or people. Even if there are some who remain, they are either the old and weak or traitors. But the reality is not entirely so. China, except for a few transportation hubs, is an agricultural society. Not to mention the countryside, even those who live in cities are mostly landlords, small businessmen, and handicraftsmen needed by an agricultural society. The people of an agricultural society are all attached to their land and reluctant to leave their homes easily. Even if they reluctantly abandon their fields and gardens once, they will eventually return home and resume their old business. Looking at the poems and songs of ancient poets, they all lament at the sound of the partridge and miss their hometown when they see the bright moon, and rarely encourage people to travel far. The Japanese army is well aware of this psychology, so after occupying an area, searching, and massacring, they deliberately show small favors and implement "pacification" work, recruiting the public to return to their homeland those who have taken refuge elsewhere, and to return to the cities those who have fled to the countryside. Therefore, in various places in Jiangnan, only three or four months after the fall, 60-70% of the public had returned to their homes. These people were not traitors at first. They were only forced by their livelihood and it was not easy to live abroad, so they had to temporarily return to their homes and live a life of humiliation. The Japanese army thought that this could both embellish and squeeze, so they used traitors to persuade people to resume their businesses, start education, collect rents and taxes, and promote opium and gambling. Knives, swords, poison, all are used together, extracting wealth and anesthetizing them, trying to achieve results beyond guns and bombs. This is also what they call public mobilization. People tend to be greedy for immediate peace and forget long-term considerations. After a long time, impressions are easily erased. The Japanese public mobilization may not be effective now, but if given time, it may be able to cover up the traces of their brutality. Therefore, the current plan is for the Chinese side to strengthen the organization of public mobilization in the occupied areas, educate the public, train the public, explain the great righteousness, and state the advantages and disadvantages, so that they will not be forced by the situation or lured by interests. Then these thousands of people will not be used by the enemy now and will still be national treasures in the future. If the Chinese side relaxes on this, the Japanese side will reduce one obstacle and increase one strength. The stakes are extremely high between gain and loss. Therefore, I believe that even when there is no military action in the guerrilla zone, public mobilization should still be a very important ongoing work.

There are many methods of public mobilization, but they boil down to organization and training. The organizational method should take the form of secret societies. The units should be small, the distribution should be wide, and the political and training personnel of the guerrillas should be responsible for their success. Other organizations such as religious groups and trade guilds should be fully utilized and their effectiveness should be brought into play. In addition to the military training required for guerrilla warfare, the training method should also pay attention to general training. For the sake of popularization and ease of promotion, it is possible to put forward some simple and feasible slogans as creeds to be followed by the general public, such as "Do not pay grain to the puppet organizations," "Do not eat in puppet institutions," "Do not inform," "Do not go to the puppet government to file lawsuits," "Do not send children to puppet schools," "Do not buy and sell enemy goods," "Do not take trains, ships, or cars in guerrilla zones unless necessary," etc. In each small organization, members should swear to these creeds and adhere to them unswervingly. If there are any violations, the small organization will impose sanctions. This matter is very simple and easy. If it can be universally promoted, then the beautiful land will not actually have fallen at all, and what the Japanese army occupies will not even be as good as "points" and "money."

### China National Aviation Corporation to Increase the Chongqing-Guiyang Route, Opening on the 10th with Two Round Trips Per Week; All Commercial Air Routes Continue to Develop

(Chongqing) China's commercial air routes continue to develop and maintain their unique success. Passing through commercial air routes that are indeed war zones is unique in the world, and its airports are targets for enemy air raids.

The company claims that the newly added plane will fly between Chongqing and Guiyang every Tuesday and Friday starting January 10. According to the company, its planes currently fly to Chengdu every day and return on the same day, fly to Kunming every Sunday and Tuesday, fly to Yichang every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday, fly to Jiading every Wednesday and Sunday, and fly to Guilin every Monday.

The routes from Chengdu to Xi'an and Lanzhou are only allowed to be flown by Chinese pilots. The planes of both companies are parked at airports within range of Japanese planes, and their pilots stand by their planes. As soon as there is an air raid alarm, they immediately fly the planes away. All planes fly to secret locations, so although the planes are parked in the field, their engines never stop. So far, the only tragic incident has been when a Douglas plane of the China National Aviation Corporation was shot down by a Japanese plane near Guilin. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

### Japan Blockades China's Ports; Britain and America Consider Countermeasures; Britain Applies Pressure to Japan; US Far East Trade Sees Significant Decline

(London) According to a diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, there is reason to believe that British cabinet members have recently paid serious attention to the Far Eastern situation caused by Japan's refusal to maintain an open-door policy in China. Discriminatory measures against British and other foreign interests by Japan have also been discussed. The correspondent also stated that it is now believed that British cabinet members have carefully considered what kind of positive pressure can be applied to Japan. It is reported that the Treasury Department has been ordered to report on various measures that can be implemented gradually to persuade Japan to change its intentions. It has recently been learned that the US government has also similarly considered actions to ensure that American interests are respected. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

(Washington) According to estimates released today by the Department of Commerce, US trade with the Far East has declined sharply since 1938. In the first eleven months of last year, US trade with China and Japan decreased by approximately $221,000,000 compared to the same period in 1937. Imports from Japan have decreased from $192,000,000 to $114,000,000, and exports to Japan have decreased from $280,000,000 to $211,000,000. Imports from China have decreased from $98,000,000 to $43,000,000, and exports to China have decreased from $48,000,000 to $31,000,000. Experts here believe that the main reason for the decline in US trade with the Far East is the Sino-Japanese War, as US trade in the Far East was still flourishing before July 1937.

### Japanese Make Arrogant Claims; Prepare for a Century of War; Unite with Germany and Italy to Remake the World; Lieutenant Colonel Takashima Publishes Thesis

(Tokyo) All newspapers in this city affiliated with the Nichinichi Shimbun carried the first chapter of a lengthy thesis titled "Japan Declares a Century of War" by Lieutenant Colonel Takashima of the Army General Staff, causing great astonishment. It roughly states that the China Incident has reached the stage of a long-term war. We must understand that the significance of East Asian construction and Asian revival lies in creating a new world based on the method of Japan and China to transform the chaotic existing world. The Western powers currently dominating the world have prospered by exploiting Asia, and their ability to dominate the world is based on colonial aggression in the Far East. The resolution of the China Incident will inevitably result in an unprecedented global transformation, and Japan is now concentrating all its efforts on this. Historical evidence suggests that such a great undertaking cannot be achieved without a century of war. Japan has now begun a century of war in order to achieve a global reform according to the method of the Japanese Empire. The various sacrifices that Japan has offered on the altar of peace in China, such as destroying the Chiang Kai-shek regime, building a new China, and reorganizing its military to confront the Soviet Union, are merely useful national efforts to build a new foundation for peace in East Asia. Reading modern Japanese history, Russia is generally regarded as the country with the world's strongest army, but Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 completely changed the world's perception, and the international order between Europe and Asia was also shifted. This was the starting point for remaking the world on a new foundation. When the European War broke out, the various weaknesses of Western culture were fully exposed, and Red Russia also emerged as a result. The birth of Manchukuo, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, and the past eighteen months of Japanese military action in China are only steps in the process of transforming East Asia according to the methods of the Japanese Empire. The new political concepts of Germany and Italy are the dawn of hope for the revival of European culture, and the joint anti-communist alliance of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be a powerful impetus for the remaking of the new world. This new political front currently has far-reaching influence throughout the world, such as the Mediterranean, Southeastern Europe, Africa, Southwestern Asia, and South America. The governed peoples continue to be oppressed due to European political disputes and are now gradually calling for liberation. Judging from history and facts, among all the countries in the world, only Japan can save them. The direction that the remaking of the new world will take will be to reform everything using Japanese methods and to understand international affairs with Japanese views. The new history of the world is now gradually unfolding a new and bright page with Japan as its axis. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese Inflation; Financial Panic; Paper Money Issuance Breaks Record; Government Intensifies Foreign Exchange Controls

(Beiping) According to the Zheng Wen Daily, "The impact of controlled economy on the Japanese people last year was extremely significant, almost changing the structure of the entire society. Now that the Sino-Japanese War has entered its third year, Japan's economic panic has become increasingly acute. It is reported that the amount of paper money issued by the Japanese government last year reached 1.858 billion yuan, breaking all previous records. The result of this inflation is, of course, rising prices. In order to express their revenge, the Japanese people have transferred all the new Japanese banknotes they have received to purchase Japanese government bonds. As a result, the new banknotes issued by the Japanese government returned to the original treasury in an instant, causing the Ministry of Finance great pain and amusement. As for Japanese prices, the most significant increase has been in retail and wholesale prices, which the government has been trying hard to suppress. The index of price increases is not yet aggressive." (7th Express News Agency Dispatch)

Haiphong: According to the "Post" here, the Bank of Japan specially withdrew 300 million yen from its gold reserves in July last year as a foreign exchange fund. It is now reported that this fund is gradually being exhausted, which has caused great panic in the Japanese government. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, it intensified the control of foreign exchange and issued four measures as follows: (1) Those who apply for foreign exchange must return it to the government within four to six months. The method of repayment is to use the raw materials purchased from foreign countries to manufacture commodities, and after exporting them, return the foreign exchange earned to the government. (2) From this year onwards, no matter who it is, unless they provide a guarantee to the government that the foreign exchange they are applying for is indeed for the purchase of raw materials, and that the commodities manufactured in the future can definitely be exchanged for foreign exchange, they will not be allowed to receive a loan from the foreign exchange fund. (3) International traders who have foreign exchange claims overseas can use them as collateral for applying for foreign exchange. (4) Those who apply to the government for foreign exchange must pay interest, which was previously 1% to 2%, but has been raised to 2.5% or 3% from this year onwards.

### US Congressman Asks Congress to Allocate Funds to Aid Refugees in Chinese War Zones

### US President Fully Promotes the Movement to Amend the Current Neutrality Law; Excludes Aggressor Nations, Aids Aggressed Nations; Hopes Congress Can Grant Broad Powers

(Washington) Regarding the amendment of the current Neutrality Law, well-informed sources here recently stated that the government has decided to go all out to achieve three goals: (1) To clearly distinguish between aggressor nations and aggressed nations; (2) To implement "exclusionism" against aggressor nations, namely, to impose arms embargoes, economic and financial sanctions, and all other means of resistance on aggressor nations; (3) To provide assistance to aggressed nations by all means, but not military assistance. The government's intention is to maintain full freedom of choice within the scope of a general anti-dictatorial policy. It is particularly concerned that Congress may not grant the government the power to act expediently. The government may have no choice but to seek a decision, only requesting the passage of an amendment to completely abolish all provisions of the current Neutrality Law except for the "cash and carry" provision. This move has two benefits: first, US transport ships will not be at risk of being detained or sunk; second, the British and French navies and merchant fleets can dominate the seas and obtain convenience. Conversely, various dictatorial countries may be sealed off. In addition to the benefits, there are also great inconveniences, namely, Japan, which has a strong navy and merchant fleet, can continue to purchase various military supplies from the United States. Therefore, the US government must go all out to negotiate with Congress in order to obtain broader powers to deal with various dictatorial countries. As for the current situation, President Roosevelt could have imposed economic sanctions on countries that discriminate against American commerce in accordance with the tariff law, but the policy that the President intends to promote is extremely broad in scope and would rather wait for Congress to clearly express its wishes before taking any action.

Washington: Congressman Collins today intends to propose a constitutional amendment to prevent the government from lending funds to warring nations. According to Collins, the government's action of lending money to any party in a war carries the risk of involving the United States in the war. If Collins' proposal gains the support of general congressmen, then loans like the recent loan to China will become impossible in the future. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Having Inspected North African Defenses, French Premier Returns Home by Ship; Will Soon Convene Military Conference with Determination to Defend Territory

French Port of Toulon: Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by his entourage, returned here this morning at 10:15 AM aboard the cruiser "Admiral Foch" from the French Algerian port of North Africa.

Port of Algiers: French Prime Minister Daladier has completed his North African national defense inspection today, believing that the French defense line is unbreakable. It is expected that Daladier will arrive in Paris before the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary go to Rome. Daladier and his entourage held a meeting with the colonial defense generals here before returning to France. European countries believe that the French Prime Minister's decision to inspect the Mediterranean is a warning to Italy, implying that he will not make any concessions regarding Italy's colonial demands. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

Port of Algiers: After French Prime Minister Daladier returns to Paris, he will convene a meeting of the French Higher Military Council. This resolution was decided yesterday after a major military conference was held here between the main French military authorities and the North African authorities. The public sees this decision as particularly important because British Prime Minister Chamberlain will go to Rome within days. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

Port of Algiers: French Prime Minister Daladier gave a speech at a banquet hosted by the Governor-General of Algiers yesterday, reiterating, like the Durisley declaration in Corsica, the determination of France to maintain its colonial empire. Daladier first expressed his gratitude for the Governor-General's banquet, saying that he was gratified by the Algerine Governor-General Le Beau, the Moroccan Resident-General Rogues, and the Arab leaders' assurance of their loyalty last autumn, which would not change in twenty years. Daladier continued, "If necessary, France will not hesitate to fight for French freedom and world freedom. The blood of French soldiers in the European War was not shed solely for France, but for other allied countries, one of which now seems to have put this fact behind them. In order to seek peace, France has made great sacrifices, and therefore resolutely opposes any attempt, direct or indirect, to destroy the integrity of the French Empire. This determination cannot be broken by any force in the world." After Daladier's speech, the whole hall cheered and stood up together, singing the French national anthem and dispersing.

### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's Visit to Italy; Will First Visit Paris; The Two Countries Maintain Contact

(London) Officials announced that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are scheduled to depart from London at 11:00 AM on the 10th of this month and arrive in Paris at 3:40 PM. They will immediately drive to the Foreign Ministry to have tea with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet, and then leave for Rome at 7:30 PM, arriving at the Italian port of Genoa at 10:00 AM on the 11th and in Rome at 4:30 PM. They will first go to the palace to present their credentials. On the same evening at 9:00 PM, they will attend a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Mussolini. On the morning of the 12th, they will go to the tombs of the past Italian kings and the war memorial for the fallen soldiers of the European War to present wreaths. Then they will be received by King Emmanuel III, and the King will host a luncheon at noon. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, they will watch the parade of the Fascist youth group, and in the evening they will go to the opera house to listen to music. After the end of the play, they will attend a "midnight snack" banquet at the invitation of Foreign Minister Ciano. On the morning of the 13th, they will be received by Pope Pius XI. In the afternoon, they will visit the metallurgical industry exhibition and attend a reception hosted by the Rome city authorities. The visit will then come to an end. Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to go directly to Geneva on the morning of the 14th to participate in the Council of the League of Nations. Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to his country via Dublin. (6th Havas Dispatch)

(London) The British cabinet members' visit to Rome has been modified at the last minute. Political figures are surprised to hear this and say that the authorities of Britain and Italy, originally scheduled to conduct formal talks, now intend to change them to informal talks, without any formal records. Because Prime Minister Mussolini is proficient in English, there is no need for an interpreter. Regarding the content of the talks, according to reliable sources, Prime Minister Mussolini is prepared to order the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain on the condition that the Nationalist forces in Spain win their attack within the territory of Catalonia. Prime Minister Chamberlain will tell him that the withdrawal of volunteers will enhance the relations between Britain and Italy, and Italy may therefore gain significant economic benefits. In addition, when the British cabinet members leave Paris, they will meet with the French cabinet members, so that the British and French maintain contact. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, even if Prime Minister Mussolini asks Britain to mediate, he should refuse to do so. As for the request of the Spanish Nationalist forces to enjoy the rights of a belligerent party, Prime Minister Chamberlain is still opposed to it. However, Britain's final position will depend on the development of the Nationalist forces' offensive. So far, although the Nationalist forces have made some progress in Catalonia, the fighting strength of the government army has not been shaken. (6th Havas Dispatch)

(London) Foreign Secretary Cadogan received French Ambassador Corbin yesterday afternoon and immediately informed him that Prime Minister Chamberlain would always refuse to discuss the issue of French territorial concessions to Italy when talking with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and would not be willing to discuss Italy's other demands in detail. It is reported that Secretary Cadogan decided to explain to Ambassador Corbin that if Prime Minister Mussolini mentioned the issues between France and Italy, Prime Minister Chamberlain would only advise Italy to negotiate with France in a spirit of compromise and would do his best to persuade him to abandon the policy of intimidation. Prime Minister Chamberlain will also personally confirm this to Prime Minister Daladier when he leaves Paris on the 10th of this month. In addition, although the Prime Minister's visit to Paris to talk with the French authorities was caused by a formal invitation from the French government, the general public believes that there is reason to believe that the Prime Minister himself is also happy to do so.

### Roman Newspapers Advocate War; Unwilling to Fight If Demands Not Met

(Rome) The relationship between Italy and France was recently commented on in an article published by the "International Relations Magazine," saying that if Italy's demands are not met through diplomatic channels, they should be resolved by force. In other words, others must make concessions to Italy's demands. "Italy is not afraid of France." The Italian nation is prepared in spirit and material, and will not hesitate to go to war. "The Axis of Germany and Italy can be our backing." (7th Havas Dispatch)

### Disturbances in Central Europe Unsettled: Conflict Erupts on Hungarian-Czech Border; Czech Troops Shell Munkács; Both Sides Reinforce, Confronting Each Other Across the River

Budapest: Regarding the Munkács incident, the Hungarian Telegraph Agency, a semi-official body, issued a statement saying that while plenipotentiaries from both the Czech and Hungarian sides were in negotiations for a resolution, Czech artillery fired six shells at the city, immediately causing serious injuries to one Hungarian soldier and one child. At the same time, Czech forces initiated an encirclement of the city. A Czech colonel and a lieutenant arrived at the city at 3:10 PM. They claimed to be completely unaware of the attack by their own troops, and when questioned why the Czech artillery opened fire during the negotiation period, they offered no explanation, stating only that they had no authority to order a ceasefire. The Hungarian Telegraph Agency later released a message at midnight stating that the Czech shelling of Munkács had not ceased as of 11:15 PM. The Hungarian garrison has orders from above to refrain from retaliating unless directly attacked. (Havas, 6th)

Budapest: Following the invasion of Hungarian territory by a Czech regular army unit in conjunction with Ukrainian guerrilla forces, semi-official sources here claimed that the Hungarian border guards had defeated them, but the Czech troops had not yet withdrawn from Hungarian territory. A Czech colonel invited Hungarian authorities to negotiate. When the Hungarian plenipotentiary was en route by car, the Czech side opened fire with machine guns, wounding one Hungarian representative in the head. The Czech side then resumed shelling Munkács at 2:00 PM, which continued until dusk. The Hungarian side then dispatched reinforcements. At the same time, the Czech side also gathered forces to reinforce its strength, but failed to cross the Latorica River. As of now, Hungarian troops have captured one Czech tank and one mortar within their own territory, and several Czech regular soldiers have been taken prisoner. They confessed that a company from the 8th Infantry Regiment of their country was ordered to occupy the Hungarian town of Ólosvón. (Has, 6th)

Budapest: Regarding the Munkács incident, semi-official sources here recently stated that after the plenipotentiaries of the Czech and Hungarian sides held a meeting in the city yesterday at 5:30 PM and parted ways, the Czech side continued to shell the city. These sources also believe that Czech troops are currently concentrating on the Hungarian border. (Havas, 7th) Budapest: According to news broadcast here yesterday afternoon, the border conflict between the Czech and Hungarian sides, which occurred yesterday morning due to the Czech army's invasion of Hungarian territory near Munkács, is not comparable to a local incident. According to a news agency, artillery fire continued along the border last night. Official intelligence stated that the Czech army's attack had been repelled, and they fled back into Czech territory, adding that the Hungarian side did not use armored vehicles or artillery during the conflict. It is reported that a Hungarian governor, accompanied by a military officer, was traveling in a car to discuss a solution with two Czech officers when they were shot in the head by machine gun fire. According to Hungarian sources, one Czech tank, one trench mortar, and one machine gun were captured within Hungarian territory. It is reported that Czech artillery continues to shell Munkács. Meanwhile, negotiations to cease the conflict, which were held at the city hall yesterday, have been halted. Currently, one soldier and one child have been wounded by artillery shells.

A communiqué issued from Prague yesterday stated that border clashes had not ceased by 5:00 PM and indicated that this unexpected incident was caused by an unprovoked attack by Hungarian forces on three Czech gendarmes on patrol. After the Czech gendarmes opened fire, the Hungarian army launched a highly organized attack on Czech outposts. According to official sources here, it is noteworthy that the area of ​​the current conflict, Munkács, originally belonged to Ruthenia. After the Munich Agreement, it was arbitrated by Germany and Italy and assigned to Hungary. Although Hungarian sources claimed that there were still conflicts on the border last night, sources in Khust, the capital of Ruthenia, said that no gunfire had been heard on the border since 8:00 PM last night. Yesterday, an official from Bratislava, Czech Republic, told a Reuters reporter that Hungary had violated the border and attacked Czech gendarmes, saying that Hungary had crossed the border near the village of Rosvizkov.

### Hungary Lodges Strong Protest with Czech Foreign Ministry, Accusing the Czech Republic of Responsibility for the Incident, Forming a Joint Committee to Investigate the Truth

(London) According to the Hungarian Legation in London to Reuters, the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires in the Czech Republic lodged a strongly worded protest with the Czech Foreign Ministry regarding the border conflict between Hungarian and Czech troops. It stated that Hungary's efforts to improve relations between the two countries had been undermined by acts of aggression, which was regrettable, and rejected any future responsibility. (Reuters, 7th)

Budapest: According to official sources here, the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires in the Czech Republic has asked the Czech government to take note of Hungary's recent efforts to promote friendly relations between the two countries. However, the Czech side continues to invade Hungarian territory. The Czech government is fully responsible for all losses of life and property suffered by the Hungarian side as a result of this invasion. The Hungarian government will take preventive measures. According to Hungarian official reports, the Czech Foreign Minister has expressed regret over the matter, saying that he has sent senior staff to Munkács, the scene of the incident, to stop the attack. The two governments have also agreed to send a joint military delegation to Munkács to investigate the facts and determine responsibility. (Haitong, 7th)

Budapest: Regarding the Munkács incident, semi-official sources here stated at noon that the Director of Political Affairs of the Czech Central Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kleno, expressed his pleasure to the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires, informing him that a colonel from the General Staff had been ordered to go to the scene of the incident, and that a joint Czech-Hungarian committee would be formed to conduct an investigation. Once the issue of responsibility is determined, those responsible will be punished. If these two measures are taken, this incident can be considered over. These sources also said that since this incident was caused by Czech regular army units carrying armored vehicles and machine guns to participate in the fighting, resulting in the deaths of four Hungarian officers and many soldiers, the Czech government should bear the responsibility. Moreover, this action not only violates Hungarian territory but also offends Germany and Italy, as the current border between the Czech Republic and Hungary was demarcated by arbitration by those countries. (Havas, 6th)

Prague: Regarding the Munkács incident, an official communiqué stated that the investigative committee formed by Czech and Hungarian officers held its first meeting at 1:00 PM today. Regarding this matter, "the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires lodged representations with Foreign Minister Chvalkovský yesterday. The military attaché of the Hungarian Legation in the Czech Republic also visited the Czech General Staff to conduct a long discussion. The two sides discussed the situation caused by the Munkács incident, and both hoped to resolve it in a friendly spirit and agreed on various measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again."

### Polish Troops Concentrated on Czech Border; Teschen Region Militarized; Situation Increasingly Grave

Prague: Local newspapers here recently reported that Poland is mobilizing troops in the Teschen region (i.e., the area of ​​Czech territory ceded to Poland), with a total of six regiments of infantry and cavalry, and ten machine gun teams, all concentrated near the Czech border. (Havas, 7th)

Prague: According to the latest reports received here, the serious situation in Teschen, a town in Czech territory ceded to Poland, is getting worse. The Polish military authorities have taken extensive measures to militarize the entire area. Several infantry regiments, cavalry units, and several machine gun teams are now concentrated in the area. At the same time, heavy troops are also stationed on the Czech-Polish border. It is expected that these emergency measures may not be lifted until the end of February. (Haitong, 7th)

Warsaw: The disputes between the Czech Republic and Hungary in Munkács have recently been commented on by semi-official sources here, stating that the incident was caused by irresponsible elements, which shows that the Czech Carpathian Ukraine province is a center of activity for agitators. If it is allowed to maintain its current autonomous status, unrest in Central Europe will be endless. (Havas, 6th)

### German-Polish Talks; Differing Views; Beck Returns to Warsaw

Munich, Germany: Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this afternoon. The content of the talks has not been disclosed by either side. Colonel Beck also attended a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop tonight. Polish Ambassador Lipski and General Epp, Governor of the German province of Bavaria, were invited to accompany him. Minister Beck and his wife then took a train back to Warsaw via Berlin at 10:20 PM. (Havas, 6th)

(Paris) Although there is no direct news to confirm the content of the talks between Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and the German authorities, according to political figures here, Minister Beck did not accept the German views. The statement issued by Polish semi-official sources regarding the dispute between the Czech Republic and Hungary in Munkács (see previous telegram) provides a glimpse of this. The Polish government agency, the Pat news agency, has also issued a communiqué supporting Hungary and reiterating the proposal that the two countries should have contiguous territory, which runs counter to the views held by Germany. Therefore, the outcome of the talks between the German and Polish authorities can be imagined. (Havas, 6th)

(Paris) French newspapers' various speculations about the talks between Führer Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Beck were severely criticized by Paris official sources today. According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Beck had notified the French government before visiting Berchtesgaden. All the newspapers’ speculations are arbitrary. Poland is still an ally of France, and this relationship is an important element of stability and equilibrium in Central and Eastern Europe. (Haitong, 7th)

### Germany and Italy Compete Overtly and Covertly; Berlin Remains Silent; Italian Newspapers Voice Support for Hungary

(Berlin) The German political circles do not criticize either side regarding the conflict between Hungarian and Czech troops near Munkács. They only say that it is regrettable that the Vienna settlement, which both sides promised to abide by, has been disrupted. German newspapers also take the same attitude, disclosing the communiqués issued by both sides simultaneously without adding criticism. (Reuters, 7th)

(Berlin) Following the dispute between the Czech Republic and Hungary in Munkács, well-informed sources here recently stated that the German government intends to make serious representations to both the Czech Republic and Hungary, urging them to strictly abide by the arbitration ruling announced by the Vienna Conference regarding the border issue between the two countries. Political figures here were extremely surprised to hear about the incident and said that Italy and Germany convened the Vienna Conference and issued the arbitration ruling after being requested by both the Czech Republic and Hungary. It is regrettable that the situation in this corner of Europe has not yet been stabilized. However, it can be asserted that the troublemakers must be irresponsible elements in the local area, and the Czech and Hungarian authorities are not involved. (Havas, 6th)

(Rome) Following the dispute between the Czech Republic and Hungary in Munkács, political figures in Italy were extremely surprised, but refused to comment. The newspapers voiced support for Hungary's views. Among them, "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that the Munkács incident was caused by a serious provocation by the Czech side. (Havas, 6th)

(Rome) Regarding the Munkács incident, newspapers here continue to publish news issued by the Hungarian side with large headlines, the content of which is mostly inflammatory. The newspapers refrain from commenting, but prominently display the news of the protest lodged by the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires in the Czech Republic with the Czech government, saying that the "Czech aggression" has aroused indignation within Hungary. They also reprint the remarks made by Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy, who said that the Czech Republic's repeated attacks on Munkács were "despicable and faithless." In addition, the newspapers also echo the Polish view that Carpathian Ukraine has become a "haven for outlaws and irresponsible elements," and that the province, in its current form, can cause disturbances in Central Europe. However, it appears that the Czech government is willing to resolve the Munkács incident in accordance with the spirit of arbitration of the Vienna Conference. (Havas, 7th)

### German Reports Suggest Imminent Spring Offensive; Actively Increasing Aircraft Production; German and Italian Air Power Surpasses Britain and France

(London) The Daily Telegraph quoted an article by Captain Payne as saying that since the Munich Agreement, the activity of German aircraft factories has greatly increased, which proves the accuracy of Hitler's order to the air force to prepare for a spring offensive. Experts from the U.S. Army Air Corps have reported that the output of German military aircraft in November reached an alarming figure of 1,000 aircraft per month. Combining Germany and Italy, their fleet of first-class aircraft in September was six times larger than what Britain and France could muster. The German aircraft manufacturing industry currently employs 400,000 skilled workers, while the British industry employs only 100,000. There is now reason to believe that Germany's efforts in aircraft production in peacetime are close to, if not exceeding, the results achieved by Britain at the end of the European War. Although these estimates are mostly based on speculation, judging from the various information obtained, we can conclude that Germany's current output of first-class aircraft is no less than twice that of Britain. Colonel Lindbergh recently expressed the opinion that British new-style aircraft are superior in efficiency and application to any other country's products in the world. Unfortunately, the production volume of British aircraft has not yet caught up with that of Germany. (Reuters, 7th)

### German Newspaper Warns That if Other Countries Interfere in the Spanish War, Germany and Italy Will Take Action

(Berlin) The official mouthpiece, the Foreign Policy News, carried a warning, saying that if another country attempts to disrupt the balance of power between the two sides fighting in Spain, Germany and Italy will not be able to remain inactive. The newspaper mentioned certain new activities in France, and said that any attempt to interfere in the Spanish civil war is unwelcome because it has no bearing on the independence of Spain or the maintenance of the status quo in the Mediterranean. The newspaper also said that if there is an attempt to disrupt the balance of power between the two sides fighting in Spain, such a measure will inevitably provoke a reaction from the other side. (Reuters, 7th)

### Bank of England Sells Gold to Increase Exchange Equalization Fund; Pound Sterling Rises

(London) After restricting transactions in foreign currency and gold yesterday, the Bank of England announced today that it has sold gold worth £2,001,571 to the Exchange Equalization Fund. As a result, the price of the pound sterling rose this afternoon (from US$4.6344 at the close of trading yesterday afternoon to US$4.6612 this afternoon). Banking circles here said that the Exchange Equalization Fund held a large amount of gold during the same period last year and had to sell a portion of it to the Bank of England. Now it has bought it back from the bank. From March to September last year, gold exports amounted to no less than £145,000,000. Since September, a large amount of gold has continued to be exported. Officials were concerned about the weakening pound and restricted transactions in gold and foreign currency yesterday. The Bank of England sold gold today to show that Britain has sufficient reserves to effectively intervene in the foreign exchange market, which is commendable. France transferred a large amount of funds to London for safekeeping during the period of European tension, and it is now normal for them to withdraw it. According to precedent, British monetary conditions tend to tighten at this time due to commercial needs. Therefore, there is no reason for the people to be concerned about gold exports. (Havas, 6th)

London: After consultations between the British Treasury and the Bank of England, a record of proceedings was issued in accordance with the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, proposing to increase the issuance of credit certificates from £230,000,000 to £400,000,000. Officials announced that this increase was related to the transfer of £200,000,000 worth of gold to the Exchange Equalization Fund by the Bank of England's Notes Issue Department on Thursday. The transferred gold is worth a total of £250,000,000 at current prices. According to law, this record of proceedings will be submitted to Parliament for discussion. The government intends to propose legislation when Parliament convenes next session to amend the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928. Reuters has learned that the purpose of the transfer of gold from the Bank of England's Notes Issue Department is to increase the Exchange Equalization Fund, so that it has sufficient funds to cope with any changes. The increase of £170,000,000 in the issuance of credit certificates can largely be regarded as a bookkeeping procedure. The gold was sold for £200,000,000, while only £170,000,000 was paid. As a result of the increase in issuance, the Bank of England has restored its position to before December 6 last year, when it temporarily issued an additional £30,000,000 in credit certificates due to the heavy demand for currency during Christmas. According to well-informed sources, what Londoners find different about this move by the authorities is not the nature of the move but its size, as there has recently been a proposal that the Bank of England should transfer £60,000,000 worth of gold to the Exchange Equalization Fund. Since the above news was released, the price of the pound sterling against the US dollar has risen from $4.645 to $4.6737, due to short covering. (Reuters, 7th)

(Paris) The French authorities are still discussing ways to assist the British authorities in taking steps to maintain the price of the pound sterling. According to a news release issued by the Economic News Agency today, "We are now instructed to announce that the Bank of France fully agrees to continue to provide effective and reliable assistance to the Bank of England. In addition, major French banks will also strive to provide the London authorities with united cooperation." It is expected that speculation on foreign exchange will be tightened. Since the maintenance of the franc, loans using gold as collateral have not been allowed, and those who want to purchase foreign exchange must first submit commercial documents. However, there are still some who sell francs short to buy US dollars, and although various central banks are working together to curb this, it has not been effective. British commercial banks in Paris have not received any special orders. It seems that there is no need to take any special measures at this time, as the long-term price of the pound sterling is still better than the franc. The price of the pound sterling opened strong today, at 176.97. (Reuters)

### Overseas Chinese in the United States Invent New Lifebuoy

Duncan: A Chinese named Hua Xingzhou (transliteration) here has invented a box that can also be used as a lifebuoy. It is said that Hua returned to China several years ago and saw that the life-saving equipment on Chinese ships was very inadequate, so he intended to invent a lifebuoy that was easy to carry. As a result, he succeeded. Hua has now received approval from the American Inventors Association, which believes that his plan can indeed be implemented and has granted him a patent. The structure is roughly as follows: it is usually a box that can hold items, but in an emergency, it can be converted into a lifebuoy. The lid and bottom of the box are both made of cork and other buoyant materials. Hua, who is already a member of the American Inventors Association, came here at the age of ten and has been in business in British Columbia for 30 years. (Associated Press, 6th)

### Soviet Union Actively Preparing to Open Arctic Air Route to the United States; Three Giant Passenger Planes Under Construction

(Moscow) The Soviet Union has not abandoned its plan to operate a passenger air route from Moscow to the United States via the Arctic. It is currently building three large three-engine aircraft, aiming to accommodate 42 passengers and six crew members, for use on this route. The aircraft is expected to be completed by May of this year and will first be test-flown on the Moscow-Vladivostok route, and then fly to the United States via the Arctic. (Haitong, 7th)

### The Situation of the Chinese Army Besieging Zengcheng: Once Charging into the City and Capturing Many, Japanese Army Actively Reinforces, Battle Fierce

Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army in the eastern district of Guangdong Province recently, feeling that the area is vast and fearing attacks from Chinese army guerrillas, changed their strategy and reduced their defense zone. Those along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway only firmly defend Dongguan to form a strategic point with Humen and Taiping. The Japanese army near Dongguan uses the Wantai Highway and Wanzhang Highway as strongholds. The Taiping Market, Baisha Market, Xiaoyao, Hetian and other areas outside Humen are also stationed with considerable forces, echoing the Humen Navy. In this situation, the Japanese army has indeed adopted a defensive posture in the eastern part of Guangdong Province. The local defense army, Zhang Ruigui's troops, is currently being reorganized, and the troops that fought near Shian some time ago have been reorganized into the Fourth Route Army Eastern Route Garrison Army, with Zhang Ruigui as the commander-in-chief and Tan Sui as the deputy commander. It governs the ××× Division, Wen Shuhai's troops, and the ××× Division, Huang Tao's troops. In addition to sending Liang Cailin's brigade to join Huang's division to attack Zengcheng, Wen's division is stationed in Huiyang and Boluo, dealing with the aftermath and posting announcements to accommodate scattered soldiers, setting up reception stations in Tiantangwei, Buji and other places. Those who return to the camp with weapons will be rewarded differently. As for the people's self-defense force, its momentum is still huge. Once the Chinese army launches a large-scale counterattack, it will mobilize and cooperate. It is found that the self-defense teams of the Chinese army in Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan and other counties are no less than 200,000 people, all adopting guerrilla tactics. Among them, Yuan Xiajiu's troops are the most powerful. His troops are scattered in Shilong, Chashan, Mashi, Shiwan, Jingshan, Nanbu, Yuetan and other places in Dongguan, constantly posing a threat to the Japanese army in Shilong. Most of the Japanese army in Shilong has moved to Dongguan City. The Japanese army commander, Miyazaki Hisanaga, has set up his headquarters in Minsheng School in Dongguan City. Most of the infantry are stationed in the garden ridge outside the city. The roads near the headquarters, such as Ximenkou and Gaodi Street, are under curfew at night, with small cannons and machine guns erected to cut off pedestrian traffic. Recently, an order was issued to conscript strong men for driving, so most of the residents fled out of the city and would rather join the guerrillas, vowing not to be the running dogs of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, due to the emergency of the Chinese army's counterattack on Zengcheng in recent days, transferred five or six hundred cavalry and hundreds of infantry from Guangzhou to guard the western suburbs of Dongguan City to prevent the Chinese army guerrillas from attacking from Shilong, Sucun and other places. On the other hand, more than a thousand troops were transferred to increase the defense of Taiping Houjie, Shitan, and the main passes of the Wantai Road.

After December 21, there were fierce battles in the suburbs of Zengcheng. Huang's division of the Chinese army marched south from Heyuan in two routes, one approaching the suburbs of Zengcheng and advancing to more than 30 miles outside Zengcheng. At the same time, a part of the ××× Division of the Chinese army also set out from Zijin, joined the Luofu Mountain battlefield, and fought hand-to-hand with the Japanese army. In order to prevent the Chinese army from copying Shitan from Boluo, the Japanese army has destroyed the Sanheshi bridge on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng section of the second main provincial road.

The Chinese army has recovered Futian, Jiu, Tan, Xinzoutang and other key points in the northeast of Zengcheng in continuous attacks, and then occupied Tiechang, which is only fifty or sixty miles away from Zengcheng. The Japanese army here, with more than 2,000 people, occupies the high ground and uses platoon guns to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. The Chinese army can only avoid the real and attack the empty, so that the Japanese army cannot see where the main force of the Chinese army is. The guerrillas once attacked the Japanese camp attached to the city on the evening of the 24th, and gained quite a lot, and then returned to coordinate the regular army to advance according to the opportunity. Currently, the Chinese army is encircling and attacking the eastern suburbs of Zengcheng with a certain two troops, and also telegraphically requested the troops stationed in Conghua in the Beijiang to attack Paitan from the flanks to contain the activities of the Japanese army's left wing. At the same time, another part of the army went out of Futian and attacked Shilong and Shitan along the river. On the 24th and 25th, the Japanese army used special trains to transport a large number of defensive materials to Shitan from Dashatou in Guangzhou to increase the construction of defensive works, and the situation was quite busy.

After the northeastern and northern Chinese armies made contact, they planned to recover Zengcheng first. If they break through it, the Japanese army in Guangzhou will collapse without being attacked. Then, on the 21st, they divided their troops and surrounded Zengcheng. Wen Shuhai's brigade of the Eastern Route Garrison Army advanced eastward from Luofu Mountain in Boluo, and Chen Mianwu's brigade of the Northern Route advanced southward from Taipingchang in Conghua. On the evening of the 22nd, the Eastern Route Army arrived at the eastern suburbs of Zengcheng and engaged in fierce artillery battles with the Japanese army. At 10:00 p.m., the vanguard of the Northern Route Army of the Chinese army rushed into the Shiqiao Zhucun area between the Guangzeng Highway and surrounded the rear of the Japanese army in Zengcheng. When Chen's brigade advanced to Shiqiao, it encountered five or six hundred Japanese troops, and a fierce battle broke out immediately. After an hour of confrontation, the Japanese army fought back in the middle of the night, and was extremely panicked. Then the plateau north of Shiqiao was occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese positions were threatened, with hundreds of casualties. The Chinese army's artillery took advantage of the situation to cover the advance of the infantry, and the Japanese army finally collapsed. Shiqiao and Zhucun were successively recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Zengcheng, seeing that the left wing had lost contact, fled from Zengcheng in panic. The vanguard of Chen's brigade once charged into Zengcheng City and captured a large number of Japanese troops and military supplies, as well as several small cannons. That night, the Japanese army withdrew from the city and fled south to Dakeng City. According to reports from the Japanese army in Guangzhou, a large team was immediately sent to reinforce, taking the road to Xintang and out of Dakeng City Yonghe Market to resist stubbornly. The next morning, dozens of planes were sent to assist in the battle. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army moved out of Zengcheng on the morning of the 23rd without any losses. In total, the Japanese army suffered six or seven hundred casualties in this battle, and abandoned supplies all over the ground. After this heavy blow, on the 23rd and 24th, they urgently built fortresses in the eastern and western suburbs of Zengcheng to prevent the Chinese army from attacking again.

### The Seven Counties in Lixiahe: Accumulated Water Has Not Receded, Will Become a Wetland, Officials and Gentry Gather to Discuss and Appeal for a Quick Blockage of the Breach to Save the Wealthy Area from Becoming Wasteland

Xinghua Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the winter season has arrived in the counties east of the canal and south of the river, and the accumulated water has not receded, which will seriously affect the spring plowing next year, specially ordered the seven counties in Lixiahe to gather in Dongtai to discuss methods of dredging the waterways to the sea. Representatives of various counties held a meeting at Honglan Villa in Dongtai at 2:00 p.m. on the 20th. Those present included Ling Huian, chairman of the Yancheng County Chamber of Commerce, Su Zhichen, county magistrate of Dongtai County, Zhang Shouchang, technical director of the Dongtai County Government, Su Zhichen (acting) county magistrate of Gaoyou County, Jiang Guodong, technical director of the Funing County Government, Xu Guanqun, technical director of the Baoying County Government, Gu Zifang, gentry of Xinghua County, Xu Zenghua, technical director of the Xinghua County Government, Zhang Xueqiao, technician of the Taixian County Government, Shen Baozhen, director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, Wang Zizun, chief of the Hebei Canal Engineering Bureau, and Xue Zhankui, inspector of the Hebei Canal Engineering Bureau. Xue Zhankui was publicly elected as chairman, and the following important cases were discussed: The chairman proposed that the accumulated water in the counties east of the canal should be dredged and eliminated. Please discuss the case. Resolution: The affected counties should telegraph the provincial government to submit a request to the central government to find a way to block the breach of the Yellow River in southern Henan to cut off the source. The affected counties should telegraph the provincial government to quickly block the Chexin and Liangba dams in time, and should not adhere to the eight-foot water level precedent of Yumatou to block the dams, which will hinder spring plowing. It was resolved to dredge the following projects: A. Ermaoyou River Tail Levee, 800-zhang diversion river; B. Widen and deepen the opened dams of the Doulonggang Xiaoxiao Gate; C. Wuyougang Xicao Shui River; D. The silting part of the diversion river of Tianfei Zhengyue Two Gates and the reduction river under the Xinhekou Field; E. The unfinished project in the upper reaches of Huangsha Port; F. Other parts of the waterways to the sea that should be dredged will be handled after the Canal Engineering Bureau sends personnel to survey and deliberate. The relevant counties jointly telegraphed the provincial government to urge the Lixiahe Waterway to the Sea Engineering Committee to plan and proceed immediately. The representatives of the counties jointly telegraphed the provincial government to appeal. The telegram reads as follows: "Since the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou Zhaokou, it has diverted into the Huai River and entered Jiangsu, trending east to Hongze Lake, crossing the Canal and directly entering the counties east of the canal. This year, the Huai River has not risen, and the flow of the Yellow River is only a quarter of that in previous years. The counties in Huaiyang have reached a water depth of Xun Zhang on the ground, and the water-receiving area reaches 100,000 square miles. Now that winter has arrived, the water is still overflowing and has not receded. Spring plowing next year is bound to be hopeless. Although there are five ports to the sea, the discharge is limited, and it is impossible to divert the Huai River. It is even more difficult to withstand the exchange of thousands of miles. If the breaches in southern Henan are not promptly blocked, the spring, summer and autumn floods next year will bring down both rivers at the same time, and the counties in Huaiyang will inevitably become lakes forever, and will also invade the Yangtze River and flood Taihu Lake, turning the wealthy area in the southeast into wasteland. The facts are as such, and we dare not deliberately make alarmist statements to sensationalize the public. We respectfully ask you to examine and submit a request to the central government to take advantage of the deep winter water depletion and quickly plan to block the breaches to cut off the source and save the sinking disaster, in the midst of great difficulties. We are extremely anxious and cannot bear to be disturbed. [Signed] Party departments and public groups of Yihua, Yancheng, Dongtai, Funing, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian, Huaian, Jiangdu and other counties, and all the people."

### After the Fall of Guangzhou: What I Saw and Heard on the Guangdong-Guangxi Road (4): Japanese Army Harasses Various Cities and Towns Along the West River, Guangxi Army Moves East to Increase Defense and Consolidate the Chen Line

A certain division of the Guangxi army also moved eastward in a steady stream, and set off to Zhao for co-defense. The transport ships and ferries above Zhaoqing to Wuzhou were used to supply military transport, and rarely carried passengers and goods. Only one ship, the Southwest, traveled between Zhao and Wu every other day to maintain the only traffic. A few days later, the Guangxi army arrived in Zhao and completed the deployment. The defense of the upper reaches of the West River was more consolidated than before, and people's hearts were greatly stabilized. Therefore, the shops in Zhaoqing gradually resumed business, but alarms were issued every day, because Japanese planes kept flying in to bomb and harass.

On November 5, I took the Southwest and arrived in Wu from Zhao. Just after mooring at the shore at about 9:00 a.m., I encountered an alarm. Five Japanese planes flew from the lower reaches of Sanshui to attack Wu City, dropping bombs at the Fuhe Triangular Spit, the Sulphuric Acid Factory, Guangxi University, and other places. As soon as the citizens heard the alarm, they all fled to the mountain caves in the northern foothills, Bingjingyong, and Longmu Temple. After the reporter landed, he also followed the citizens to hide. It was found that the air defense room in Wu City was dug into the mountainside, winding and circuitous. Each cave could accommodate fifty or sixty people to more than two hundred people. There were a total of more than four hundred caves in public and private buildings in the city, which could accommodate more than sixty or seventy thousand people. Having such good air defense buildings is rare in the provinces and cities of South China. Is this also due to the natural terrain?

The day after Guangzhou fell, Wu City announced martial law, and many defensive works were added to the main passes. The old, weak, women and children in the city were evacuated, because the refugees entering Guangxi from Guangdong were extremely crowded. In order to facilitate the entry of refugees, the authorities temporarily exempted ships from entry inspection, but hotels and hotels still carried out inspections. When a traveler arrives in Wu, if he is staying in a hotel, he is only allowed to stay for three days. If he exceeds the time limit, he must find a local store or a relative or friend with a job to guarantee him. The intention is probably to prevent spies. Although the population of Wu City was ordered to be evacuated, the number increased day by day, because those who fled from western Guangdong all took Wu City as a gathering point. Business was quite calm in the morning, but as prosperous as usual in the afternoon and evening, because they had to avoid the Japanese planes in the morning. The import goods such as kerosene, cotton yarn, matches, woollen cloth, cloth, cotton and wool ornaments, cigarettes, foreign wax flour, etc. were one to two times more expensive than before the fall of Guangzhou. The local products of the province, such as grain, rice, pigs, chickens, ducks, cattle, etc., were particularly cheap. The top rice was only sold for more than five to six yuan per hundred catties, pigs were sold for fourteen or five yuan per hundred catties, and chickens were sold for two corners and five cents per catty, because the downstream traffic was blocked, and the supply of local products exceeded the demand, so the import goods were expensive and the export goods were cheap. However, the farmers' economy was greatly affected. As for the intra-provincial traffic, such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, Baise, etc., although the military transport was busy, the ferries were not blocked. Although the inter-provincial transport was greatly affected, it was still possible to pass through Longzhou to Vietnam, Yongning to Beihai, and Yulin to Guangzhou Bay, but the long-distance detour and freight were uneconomical. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Guangxi Province was under serious threat, and the responsibility it bore for the war of resistance was even heavier. In early November, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai rushed to Guilin from the northern front to convene commanders of various routes and senior generals to receive instructions in person. At the same time, the military and political affairs of the province were also reorganized. Precise arrangements were made for where to station heavy troops, which counties to designate as garrison areas, who to command which routes, and the allocation of guerrillas in each county, the transfer of vehicles, and the raising of supplies and equipment. At the same time, in terms of politics, preparations were made to implement the popular election of county magistrates in all counties of the province in January of the 28th year. Before the popular election, starting from November of this year (the 27th year), all county magistrates in counties close to the Guangdong border and adjacent to the war zone were assigned to people from the original籍of each county, such as Huaiji, Cangwu, Cenxi, Rongxian, Guilin, and Tengxian. The county council was also established at the end of this year. The heads of districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets in each county were all elected by the local people to implement the county autonomy system. The families of runaway conscripts who were detained in various counties in the past were all released from December 1. Because the situation was critical to the extreme, the authorities hoped that the army and the people would unite to save the country, so both the military and political aspects were reformed.

### Japanese Army in Yongxiu Closes Doors and Defends to the Death: Japanese Plane Drops Communication Bag and Mistakenly Falls into Chinese Army Position, Firmly Instructing Not to Challenge, Nanchang-Jiujiang Line Only Barely Maintained

Zhang Gongdu Dispatch: On the Xiu River front, the Chinese and Japanese armies are facing each other across the river, and have become deadlocked. The activity of the Chinese army guerrillas on the north bank makes the Japanese army worry about being surrounded and annihilated from time to time. Therefore, the Yongxiu city gate is closed all day long, leaving only the north gate for entry and exit. Fortifications are built near the outside of the city, and barbed wire is erected. At 9:00 a.m. on the 16th of last month, a Japanese plane flew over the north bank of the Xiu River and dropped a communication bag. When it was flying low over Yongxiu to drop it, due to the wind direction turning south, one of the communication bags mistakenly fell into the Chinese army's position. The following is an excerpt from the content of the letter published by the Chinese side: "Major Yamamoto's troops must now defend Yongxiu to the death. Baicha is in an unfavorable position, and there is a danger of being surrounded and attacked by the enemy (referring to the Chinese army, the same below). It should be withdrawn to Qiujin immediately. The fortifications on the north bank of the Xiu River should be located seven li away from the river surface. If there is no artillery, heavy machine guns can be used instead. The troops stationed in Jiujiang are successively concentrating towards Hankou. If the enemy does not attack, do not challenge under any circumstances, and try to avoid enemy artillery and enemy aircraft bombing as much as possible. The attacking target of our army (referring to the Japanese army) has now shifted to ×× and ××. On the Nanchang-Jiujiang line, we can only adopt a defensive posture."

### New Fourth Route Army: Divided into Political and Military Systems, Political System is the Lifeline of the Army

Continued dispatch from American Evening News Special Correspondent Belden: The main difference between the New Fourth Route Army I saw and other armies is not that they are braver in combat, nor that they live harder, but that their political department occupies an important position in combat. The political system is the lifeline of the army. Each team has a political instructor who leads the combat. He is in the front when attacking and in the rear when retreating. He must also scout the enemy's阵, encourage the soldiers, and be an example for every combatant. Therefore, the casualties of political workers are also high. The New Fourth Route Army can be divided into political and military systems. The chief of staff and headquarters on the military side, and the political instructors, etc., are all commanded by the chief and deputy commanders. Broadly speaking, the work of the political department is divided into two categories, namely, teaching and reading theories of resistance and history, etc., and the other is to ensure the success of the orders issued by the commander. According to the leaders of the army, the most important purpose of political work is to ensure the victory of the war of resistance. After investigation by the reporter, I am deeply convinced of their words. The combatants of the army are all volunteers, two-thirds of whom come from the southern provinces. Most of them are guerrillas of the old Red Army, so political work is easier to carry out. However, there are also several weaknesses, such as the dispersed and vast military strength, and the inability to obtain contact with each other. The political department strengthens the army's strength through political methods, first increasing the political education of the soldiers, explaining why China is fighting, and telling every combatant why China must win. The political department also follows the tradition of the old Red Army, such as new soldiers fighting with old fighters in difficult conditions, living in difficulties, and inheriting the Red Army's spirit of loving the people and self-sacrifice. The New Fourth Route Army strictly prevents spies and traitors. The political instructors all know where their soldiers come from, their abilities and their intentions, so no traitors have ever been found in the army. When the Fourth Route Army initially decided to assemble in southern Anhui, because the Japanese army had superior aircraft, the political instructors painstakingly explained to the soldiers not to fear the enemy or underestimate the enemy. Recently, it was discovered that officers and soldiers were wasting money and paper, so an economic movement has been started, and meetings have been convened. The officers explained in detail the importance of economy, saying that there is little money in the army. If materials and money are wasted, they will not be able to purchase the required items, thus affecting the combat strength. Therefore, the officers and soldiers began to save money automatically. Recently, the New Fourth Route Army has launched a strong united front movement in the army through lectures in classrooms, slogans, newspaper propaganda, pasting posters, and singing songs. The army leaders believe that this can strengthen combat effectiveness. The soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army are not limited to any belief in the main attack. Members of the Kuomintang and fallen bourgeois are also fighting in the army, because in the war of resistance, it does not matter whether they believe in communism or the Three People's Principles. According to Deputy Commander Xiang Ying, we will accept them regardless of their political beliefs, but we will carry out political work in accordance with the principles of the Three People's Principles.

### Changzhou Rice Merchants: Oppose Harsh Taxes, Puppet Organization Also Plunders

Changzhou Dispatch: Since Changzhou was occupied, the prosperous areas have been destroyed by fire. The current market is in the Ximen area, barely serving as a decoration. Recently, the puppet business tax bureau ordered rice merchants to increase the surtax on each stone, which was strongly opposed by grain merchants. Because the Mishiwan outside Ximen has long lost the focus of the rice market due to river traffic relations in recent years, the resumption of business after the disaster, most of the goods on the market are for the relief of the people's food. In addition, the disaster has been severe, and the people's livelihood has not been restored. The grain business has been reduced to zero, and the main business is that when a whole batch of goods arrives, it is taxed and sold by a commercial firm, and then distributed by various shops. At present, the business focuses on the circulation of the people's food. The most difficult thing is that when the taxed grain is transported and unloaded, the puppet inspectors check it up and down, causing trouble and delay. Because the grain is trivial and the procedures are complicated, it is by no means possible to save the poor and supplement the deviations with all the separate transport documents. Grain concerns the lives of the people, and Wujin has suffered more severely than other counties. At present, the rice market is barely focusing on circulation, and there are no large-scale transactions. More than 20 grain merchants have specially elected representatives such as Qian Renchang to request the reduction or exemption of surtaxes from Wang Zhongping, director of the puppet provincial business tax office.

### Taixing Suffers Severe Disaster: Eagerly Awaiting Relief, Disaster Victims Reach More Than 5,000 Households

Taixing Dispatch: Since the full-scale war of resistance, the districts of the county under the jurisdiction of the river, 1, 6, 7, and 8, have been burned and plundered repeatedly due to the passage of Japanese warships. The tragedy of the war has been unbearable to witness. In the past two years, the river water has risen sharply and the discharge has been unsmooth. In addition, the Yellow River has diverted and overflowed, causing disasters. Last autumn, a hurricane passed through the territory, and the harvest was barren, which further affected the livelihood of farmers. At present, there are still places in the flooded farmland that Zhu can cultivate in spring. Natural and man-made disasters have occurred frequently. Now that the severe winter has arrived, they are starving and freezing, waiting to be fed. According to the survey, there are more than 5,000 households waiting for relief. However, because the county is small and the local finances have been exhausted after the disaster, it is unable to save itself. At present, the public groups in the county are calling for help from outside, and they hope that international charity groups and overseas gentry will assist in providing relief.

### Japanese Side in He: Buys Up Legal Tender, Traitorous Merchants Actually Act as Accomplices

Jiaxing Dispatch: In order to buy up foreign exchange and carry out economic aggression, the Japanese side has recently set up shops in He to specialize in collecting Chinese silver and legal tender, as well as valuable securities, with military tickets and Japanese tickets. It has been a month, so that the legal tender in He is rarely circulated in the market. Moreover, some good merchants, seeing that it is easy to make profits by engaging in this business, actually disregard righteousness and rush to open shops under the pretext of collecting Chinese torn banknotes, specializing in buying them up, and hiring unemployed people to go to the towns and villages near the city to collect them in large quantities. It is learned that the well-known shops in He that specialize in buying up for the Japanese side are Dali and other families at No. 33 Beida Street. The Chinese authorities have learned of this matter and have specially ordered restrictions on pedestrians carrying legal tender in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy.

### Chinese Army in Jiashan: Eliminates Bandits and Traitors, Those Who Impersonate Guerrillas Are Also Arrested and Executed by Shooting

Jiashan Dispatch: The county magistrate of Jiashan has been appointed by the provincial government to be Wu Cixian. Wu has started to handle the Baojia system and organize the district and town offices. The Chinese army stationed in Jiashan is the ×× Brigade, which has completely destroyed all the bridge wedges and culverts on the Hangshan Highway. The Japanese cannot build them. The only places where the Japanese army's power can reach are the dead city of Jiashan and the transportation strongholds along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. Recently, the ×× Brigade, in view of the fact that there are many bandits impersonating guerrillas in the four townships, disturbing the people, has sent teams to search for bandit traces in recent days, and has successively captured Jin Maomao, the bandit leader from outside Xidou Shao, Yu Bianxi, who was rampant in the Dingzha area, and Chen Binkui and Yang Misheng, who were entrenched in Xitang Ganyao. The troops of Yang Changchi of the Dayun Temple guerrilla team were also disbanded. Jin Maomao and the other four were successively executed by shooting. Bandits were also captured everywhere and buried alive, no less than fifty or sixty people. Since then, the bandit atmosphere has greatly subsided. The ×× Brigade also detected that a barber Huang Guisheng outside Dongmen, who usually treated diseases by挑痧, and an unknown fortune-teller had suspicions of being traitors, and arrested them together and shot them near the Jiaoshan Highway. Zhou Donglin, the puppet town chief of Xitang, and eight others were also arrested and interrogated, and then released. Other traitors and personnel of the puppet county office will also be arrested and executed.

### Coal Supply in Shanghai

— Jin Zhixuan

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, and none can be separated from fuel. In clothing, the spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing of cotton, hemp, silk, and wool all require the power and heat of fuel to complete the work. As for food and fuel, they have had a close relationship since the invention of drilling wood to make fire. The materials for building houses, and the heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hygiene, and fire prevention in daily life, also cannot do without fuel. After the advancement of transportation tools, all ships, trains, airplanes, cars, etc., cannot do without fuel. Therefore, its importance is no less than that of food. Studying fuel should be an urgent matter. People living in Shanghai should especially know the general situation of Shanghai's fuel supply. What is described in this article must have omissions, but it is better than nothing.

Any substance that can burn and generate heat, without the danger of explosion during combustion, and without the risk of economic miscalculation, can be called fuel.

Belonging to solids and easily melted solids:

Coal: Bituminous coal, anthracite coal, lignite coal, coal briquettes, and coke (minerals)

Charcoal: Various types of soft and hard charcoal and charcoal briquettes (plants)

Firewood: Firewood, wood chips, straw, etc. (plants)

Seed fillings: Cottonseed hulls, bran, bean pods, peanut shells (plants), etc.

Mineral hardened wax: Paraffin wax, etc. (minerals)

Plant hardened wax: Asphalt, etc. (plants)

Animal hardened wax: Congealed fat from fish and beasts

Belonging to liquids: Mineral oil: Gasoline, kerosene, diesel (minerals)

Vegetable oil: Rapeseed oil, green oil, etc. (plants)

Alcohol: Made from grains, plant roots, wood, etc. (plants)

Belonging to gases: (Heating solids or liquids to gasify is not included)

Mineral gas: Fire well marsh gas, etc., carbon-light compound gas (minerals)

Artificial chemical gas: Made by compounding or analyzing methods (not limited)

Animal skin and bone biogas: Garbage gas, lamp gas, etc., artificially manufactured (animals)

(1) Coal

Although there are many types of fuel as mentioned above, coal accounts for the main part of fuel. In advanced countries around the world, each person needs an average of four tons of coal per year. Now, the sources, quantity, and distribution of coal used in Shanghai are summarized below:

Coal is divided into three major categories: bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and lignite coal. The total amount of coal consumed in Shanghai each year, based on statistics from 1933 to 1937, is 3.25 million metric tons, averaging less than one ton (0.91 tons) per person per year. Among them, 11.5% is anthracite coal, 1.5% is lignite coal, and the remaining 87% is bituminous coal. For clarity, bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and lignite coal are described separately below:

The sources of bituminous coal are divided into domestic coal and imported foreign coal. Due to the location of production and transportation, domestic coal is divided into five major routes: Kailuan, Shandong, Pukou, Yangtze River, and North China.

Kailuan: The Kailuan and Australian mining areas are in Hebei Province, a Sino-British joint venture, also known as domestic coal.

Shandong: Coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway, with a small amount going to Jinan, and most exported from Qingdao.

Most of the Shandong coal in Shanghai comes from Qingdao, also known as Qingdao coal, such as Yuesheng, Boshan, Hongshan, Taishan, etc. Some of them are also Sino-Japanese joint ventures, collectively referred to as domestic coal.

Pukou: Bituminous coal produced along the Jinpu Railway in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces, with Pukou as the export concentration area, transported to Shanghai, such as Zhongxing, Huadong, part of Shandong, Jingxing, etc. Coal exported from Haizhou to Shanghai is also included in this category.

Yangtze River: Various mines that transport coal to Shanghai along the Yangtze River, such as Huainan, Datong, Liuhegou, etc., are collectively referred to as Yangtze River coal. Huishan and Changxing also belong to this category.

North China: In addition to Kailuan, Shandong, etc., which form their own category, coal from various mines in Hebei, Shanxi, and those close to Shanhaiguan, such as Datong, Shanxi, Doutougou, Beipiao, etc., are transported to Shanghai by sea from Qinhuangdao or Tanggu, collectively referred to as North China.

Among the foreign coal imported in Shanghai, Japanese coal is the most common, including those from Japan proper, Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory—such as Fushun—all transported by ship. In addition, those from India, Annam, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia or other countries are also transported to Shanghai by ship.

Of the 2.83 million tons of bituminous coal consumed in Shanghai each year, the distribution of the above-mentioned sources is as follows:

The current situation is very different from the past. According to the reporter's estimation, the total amount of imported bituminous coal for the whole year of 1938 was 400,000 tons, of which 70,000 tons were Japanese coal, and the rest came from British and Dutch colonies and other countries. The amount of Kailuan and Australian coal arriving in Shanghai was 950,000 tons. As for the actual consumption, it is difficult to determine, because there may be coal stored and transported in various places, but at most it is only 50,000 tons. Therefore, the total consumption of bituminous coal for the whole year of 1938 was 1.4 million tons, which is half of the previous year's amount. From this, it can be seen that the coal consumption of factories throughout Shanghai, directly and indirectly, is 1.45 million tons per year. The sources of anthracite coal are also divided into domestic coal and imported coal. Domestic coal is divided into three types: Qinhuangdao, Henan, and Shanxi.

Qinhuangdao: The Liujiang, Great Wall, Taiji and other mining areas are mostly in the occupied areas, with Qinhuangdao as the concentration area for export to Shanghai. Although there were Sino-Japanese joint ventures before the September 18th Incident, they were all taken over by the Japanese after the September 18th Incident, but they are still regarded as domestic coal.

Henan: The most famous anthracite coal in Henan is the anthracite coal from the Fuzhong Company. In addition, there are many small mines, all with Hankou as the concentrated export area. Some are transferred from Zhengzhou via the Longhai Railway and come to Shanghai via Pukou.

Shanxi: Anthracite coal produced in northern Shanxi Province is mostly loaded onto the PingSui Railway in Datong and shipped from Tanggu to Shanghai.

Among foreign anthracite coal, that from Annam is the most common, and Hongji is the most famous. Marke, etc., are also sold on the market, transported by sea from Haiphong to Shanghai. In the past, anthracite coal has gradually replaced charcoal, and its consumption has increased. Since the issuance of coal briquettes, the sales of anthracite coal fines have greatly increased. After the routes from Liujiang, Shanxi, and Henan were blocked, anthracite coal from other mines in Annam, such as "Dong Tuo Li," etc., also came to Shanghai in large quantities.

Of the 373,000 tons of anthracite coal used in Shanghai each year, the distribution according to the source is as follows:

Summer 1933 to Summer 1935     Current Situation

The use of anthracite coal is mostly limited to heating in winter, making daily-use coal briquettes, and for use in restaurants, confectionery shops, and cake shops. Therefore, its consumption does not decrease due to the war, and still maintains the statistical figure of one-tenth of a ton per person per year. However, domestic coal is reduced, and replaced by imported anthracite coal.

The sources of lignite coal are limited to domestic sources, mostly from Pukou and the Yangtze River. Pukou coal includes part of Lieshan (Yili), and Yangtze River coal is mostly produced in Huangshi Port, such as Fuhua and Lihua mines. The average annual sales in Shanghai are 47,000 tons. Except for a small part used in restaurants and food shops, and for making earthen coal balls, most of it is used for making "Jue Deng" and other coal briquettes. Since the Yangtze River was blocked, the supply has been cut off, and it is currently replaced by anthracite coal fines. Coal briquettes are made of anthracite coal fines and lignite coal fines from various places, which on average contain more than 15% clay or other adhesive substances. From a scientific point of view, the quality of coal briquettes depends on anthracite coal. However, due to the addition of soil during artificial manufacturing, it is suitable for use on earthen stoves and is easy to ignite. There are thirty or forty coal briquette factories of various sizes in Shanghai, producing 600 tons of coal briquettes per day, totaling about 200,000 tons per year. Since coal briquettes are made of anthracite coal fines, the coal poisoning from their combustion is no different from that of anthracite coal. It is absolutely forbidden to burn coal briquettes indoors for heating in huts without chimneys.

Coke is also a type of coal, which is as flammable as charcoal. It has smoke when it first burns, and no smoke after it is completely red. In the autocratic era, it was exclusively used for palace fire basins. It is produced in northern Shanxi and is very expensive. Three or four years ago, when the price of anthracite coal in Tianjin was ten yuan per ton, the price of coke was forty-five yuan per ton.

Coke is made by calcining bituminous coal fines. On average, 100 tons of coal fines can yield 60 tons of coke. Before the war, Shanghai consumed 2,000 tons of coke per month, of which 500 to 600 tons were shipped to Hangzhou and Wuxi. The most suitable coal for coking is Kailuan, Zhongxing, Jingxing, and Liuhegou coal. Japanese coal is not suitable for coking, so Japan imports mostly coking coal each year. Coke is used in iron casting and steelmaking plants. Some coke is directly transported from the mines to Shanghai, but two-thirds are made from coal fines locally. Therefore, the amount of coke is mostly already included in the above-mentioned annual coal consumption. Even if there are slight discrepancies, the number is extremely small. In the past, the market price was below 30 yuan per ton. This year, the price is close to 200 yuan. It is currently rumored that Kailuan and Australian coal are being tested for coking in Shanghai, and the price may be slightly lower.

The distribution of the 3.25 million tons of coal used annually in Shanghai before the war is as follows:

The value of coal has always been calculated by the ton. The average value of major bituminous coal over five years is listed below:

Coal Name   Average Wharf Delivery Price per Ton over Five Years (in National Currency)
Kailuan      12.00
Zhongxing    14.00
Datong       12.25
Shandong     11.50
Huainan      11.75
Fushun       17.25

The current prices vary greatly. Kailuan is still sold at 26 yuan delivered, while Indian coal ranges from 38 yuan to 45 yuan. Even Japanese coal is at least around 35 yuan. It is feared that there is no hope for lower coal prices in the short term, but due to the manipulation of powerful coal merchants, a fluctuation of three or four yuan per ton is unavoidable. If the exchange rate changes, and the source of Kailuan and Australian coal cannot maintain the current proportion, then the rise in coal prices should be expected.

### Hometown Association Fundraising Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting, Passes Organizational Charter and Fundraising Methods, Elects Xu Xiaochu and Others as Directors

The Shanghai Refugee Association Hometown Association Fundraising Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3 PM yesterday. The meeting passed the organizational charter and fundraising methods, and resolved to promote piggy bank disaster relief and theatrical fundraising. The details are recorded as follows:

Representatives Present

The inaugural meeting yesterday was attended by Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Xu Ji, Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng, Fundraising Directors Fang Jiaobo, Lin Kanghou, Director Jiang Yiping, representatives of various hometown associations Ningbo Le Rucheng, Dong Xinqin, Qin Runqing, Jin Zongcheng, Huining Zhang Yiqi, Cao Zhigong, Wang Yisan, Xiuning Dai Binnan, Wu Mingxin, Taixian Song Shixiang, Wenzhou Lin Daji, Hu Xiru, Xunshe Zhan Ziyang, Zhu Chaoran, Anhui Xu Xiaochu, Hong Juehe, Shangyu Wang Hesong, He Wuliang, Xianju Wang Jingdong, Nantong Ge Futian, Rugao Chen Weifan, Chaozhou Chen Zimi, Zhang Kanglong, Kunshan Tao Leqin, Shandong Jing Yaosan, Shaoxing Pei Yunxiang, Hushe Tang Chongshi, Jixi Cheng Kefan, Baoshan Yu Yaoqiu, Yinxiang Xing Guxiang, Pudong Pan Zhiwen, Lu Wenshao, Changzhou Hu Shouqi, Wang Yunfeng, Xu Guanqun, Zhenjiang Chen Peide, Fan Guoren, Jin Xiaodong, Hebei Chen Zhongru, Wujiang Zhou Xinmei, Cai Yuanzhan, Zhenhai Liu Zhongying, Jiading Chen Jicheng, Zhang Tianbai, Sichuan Li Qingfan, Suzhou Ge Shouyi, Dinghai Chen Yiting, Taizhou Yan Nianshan, and the presidium Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunxiang, Xu Xiaochu, Lu Wenshao, Cao Zhigong.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Xu Xiaochu delivered the opening speech, saying: "Today, the Hometown Association Fundraising Committee is holding its inaugural meeting. We are deeply honored to have the leaders of the association present to guide us. Since the August 13th Incident in this city, an extremely serious relief problem has arisen. At that time, no less than hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Shanghai from the war zones, and were accommodated in reception centers. At the peak, there were more than 300,000 people. After efforts were made to evacuate them, the number gradually decreased. However, the 100,000 refugees currently remaining in Shanghai are mostly homeless and impoverished, and urgently need relief. Now that the association has been established, the relief measures are becoming more and more complete, which is truly good news for the refugees. Taking the Ningbo hometown association as an example, there are no less than one million people engaged in business in this city. Considering all the refugees in Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai should take the responsibility of providing relief. We, the people of various hometowns, should immediately do our best to promote fundraising work to assist the association in handling relief affairs. It is our inescapable duty. Moreover, the fathers in various reception centers are all disaster-stricken fellow villagers from various places. Although the establishment of our fundraising committee is perhaps a little late in terms of timing, doing one more point of effort will always yield one more point of effect."

Association Guidance

Refugee Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing said: "In addition to providing rations, the association's work has now begun to handle refugee factories, hospitals, education, and other matters. Preparations are also being made for the future repatriation of refugees. The central government is extremely concerned about the refugees in Shanghai. Currently, the refugee's winter clothing can still be dealt with through donations from all walks of life, but there is an extreme lack of quilts." Yuan Ludeng said: "Since the establishment of the association, it has been unanimously supported by various industries, groups, and people from all walks of life. Now that the hometown associations have risen up again to make universal promotions, they will definitely be able to achieve the goal of 'everyone knowing and everyone working together.'" Fang Jiaobo said: "The establishment of the Hometown Association Fundraising Committee will reduce the difficulties of various hometown associations in conducting individual fundraising by coordinating and managing hometown fundraising. It is expected that after today's meeting, actions will be taken separately according to the resolutions, and satisfactory results will surely be obtained."

### After the Implementation of the Blockade in Western Shanghai, Gambling Dens Suffer Drastic Business Decline Strict Measures Had to Be Taken to Maintain Peace and Order in the Concession

Since the Japanese and puppet regimes have been sheltering and allowing local gangsters and ruffians to open gambling tables and opium dens in the areas outside the boundaries of the Western Shanghai roads, bandits have been lurking, robberies have occurred from time to time, and the nearby residents have felt uneasy. Recently, the bandits have intensified their actions, daring to cross the border to rob concession police of their firearms and attack police officers, which has seriously affected the security of the concession. In order to maintain order within the boundary and ensure local peace, the police authorities had no choice but to take strict measures. Since last month, they have implemented a blockade at the main entrances and exits of the roads outside the boundary, piled up barbed wire and other obstacles to block traffic, and dispatched armed police to patrol day and night. The situation is extremely tense. Since the adoption of these measures, concession residents who want to go to gambling dens have found it extremely inconvenient to enter and exit, and there are many dangers as bandits run rampant around the gambling dens. Therefore, many people have hesitated to go forward. In recent days, most of the gambling tables have been deserted, and business has become increasingly sluggish. Although there are still sounds of gambling and drinking, most of them are employees in the gambling dens, who gamble with each other in their boredom for a bit of entertainment. It is said that the owners of the gambling tables are all frustrated. Many, such as Lishang Company and others, have already announced their closure because they cannot maintain operations.

### Japanese Sources Report Chinese Troops Attacking Hangzhou Japanese Troops Unable to Find Peace on New Year's Day Chinese Troops Still Fighting North of Hangzhou

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, Japanese sources reported today (7th) that Japanese troops in Hangzhou had planned to immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere on New Year's Day, but this atmosphere was dispelled by the attack of Chinese troops and guerrilla squads. The main force of the 63rd Division of the Chinese Army crossed the Qiantang River near Liangjiaqiao (transliteration), 15 kilometers southwest of Hangzhou. Another unit landed at Zhoujia (transliteration) between Hangzhou and Fuyang. The two armies then converged in one place. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese Army attacked Hangzhou directly from the southwest and engaged in fierce fighting west of Hangzhou. The Japanese side also dispatched several bombers to reinforce the ground troops. The headquarters of the 63rd Division of the Chinese Army is located in Shaoxing. Another unit of the army landed at Haiyan on the north bank of Hangzhou Bay in the early morning of New Year's Day, and pressed towards Hangzhou from the west, engaging the Yamada Detachment of the Japanese Army. The next day, another 8,000 Chinese troops, including 6,000 suicide commandos, also advanced towards Hangzhou from the north and are still fighting with the Japanese army north of Hangzhou.

### To Maintain Foreign Trade Position, Exert Efforts to Encourage Export of Domestic Goods, Exempt Transit and Export Taxes, and Provide Full Transportation Facilities

After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission made efforts to adjust the market prices of domestic goods to promote exports, goods that should be settled in foreign exchange are allowed to be exported tax-free. At this time of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain the foreign trade position of major domestic goods, all efforts are being made to handle the tung oil, silk, and tea industries, so that production increases and sales abroad are smooth. The details are recorded as follows:

Encourage Exports

The Trade Commission has the following measures:  For export goods that have been proven to be sold abroad, the premiums for war risk insurance insured with the Central Trust Bureau are specially allowed to be recorded on account. If the goods are sold at a loss, the premiums will be exempted.  When export goods are transshipped, if the foreign sales are guaranteed, the transshipment tax will be exempted according to regulations, and there is no need to go through the procedures of collecting first and then refunding.  Goods for export that should be settled in foreign exchange are exempt from export tax.  The competent authorities provide full facilities for the transportation of export goods.  When the cost of export goods is lower than the market price abroad, the purchase price of the origin and distribution market of the goods may be determined according to the market price abroad. The association and merchants will purchase as much as possible. When the cost of export goods is higher than the market price abroad, the purchase price of the origin and distribution market may be determined according to the production cost of the goods. If the merchant is unwilling to purchase due to the high price, the association will purchase and trade as much as possible according to the price.

Major Domestic Goods

Major domestic goods exports last year:  Tung oil: 680,567 quintals, valued at 38,222,582 yuan  Silk: 5,178,831 kilograms, valued at 33,877,696 yuan  Tea: 384,024 quintals, valued at 30,354,276 yuan  Pig bristles: 33,438 quintals, valued at 25,535,175 yuan  Cotton: 1,295,561 quintals, valued at 95,162,235 yuan  Wool: 4,152,363 kilograms, valued at 9,657,984 yuan. The above figures are converted into legal tender based on the statutory price of customs gold. Compared with the previous year, except for the increase in cotton, the rest have decreased, but the decrease is not very large.

### Japanese Army Building Airfield in Datong, Plans to Control Sand and Gravel Due to Lack of Piping Materials

Express News Agency Local Dispatch: To defend Shanghai, an important military base in central China, the Japanese army is now constructing fortifications on a large scale in the urban area and surrounding suburbs of Shanghai. They are also using Chinese people for forced labor and controlling sand and gravel as building materials. Details are as follows:

Building a Large Airfield and Constructing Military Roads

Near Datong, the Japanese army is currently enclosing thousands of acres of land to build a military airfield of the largest scale in central China, to serve as an air force base for the war of aggression against China. At the same time, a military highway is being newly built from Zhabei to Yanglinkou. According to Japanese sources, this project is contracted by a Chinese man named Chen, in collusion with a Japanese named Iwakawa Hidezuru. Work was supposed to start earlier, but it has been delayed until now due to a shortage of building materials and is still not completed. The Lack of Materials and Control of Sand and Gravel

The most important material for this military construction is sand and gravel, so the Japanese side is attempting to control it. The Japanese side was advised by Chen and Yuan, scum of the sand industry, to invest 500,000 to organize a sand and gravel control company. A site has been surveyed in Wusong to store huge quantities of sand and gravel. Sand and gravel are produced in Huzhou in Zhejiang Province and Sijiao in Jiangsu Province, etc., and are the main raw materials for construction projects. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Huzhou sand has been scarce due to transportation difficulties. The yellow sand arriving in Shanghai is all transported by帆船 from Sijiao offshore. The price of sand before the war was about two yuan per ton, but after the war, due to the urgent need for Japanese construction of forts and other projects, the price has skyrocketed to more than ten yuan. The Zhejiang authorities have strictly ordered a ban on exports. If the Japanese side controls it, the sand needed by the construction industry will also become a problem. It is said that sand and gravel merchants are extremely worried and will gather to discuss countermeasures.

### Miscellaneous Grain Association Thoroughly Investigates Stolen Wheat, Rumored to Have Been Sold to a Certain Party and Shipped to Qingdao by Boat

Members of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, including Ren Cheng and Cheng Yongtai, have raised tens of thousands of yuan to send personnel to be stationed on a regular basis, setting up temporary grain purchasing firms at various ports in northern Jiangsu, specializing in purchasing miscellaneous grains such as wheat and soybeans for sale in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, the firms loaded more than 4,500 bags of wheat and transported them from the port to Shanghai. When passing near Yanglin and Liuhe, they were robbed by bandits on horseback, resulting in a loss of as much as 43,40,000 yuan. The firms jointly reported to the association and notified the industry not to buy stolen goods. On the other hand, they sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. Now it is learned that the wheat has been sold by Ji to a certain party in batches and delivered in Jiading and Datong, then loaded on ships and shipped to Qingdao. Now the association, after verifying the facts and evidence, will report to the police for a thorough investigation.

### Sino-American Loan Can Be Repaid in Two and a Half Years, China's Tung Oil Exports to the United States Are Quite Large

This Sino-American loan is secured by China's special product, tung oil. According to economists, the loan can be repaid in two and a half years at most. The United States imports tung oil every year, accounting for 70% of China's total exports. In 1937, China's tung oil exports were 1,029,789 piculs, worth 89,845,563 yuan (then the total value of tung oil imported by the United States should be about 63 million yuan. The total amount of the new Sino-American loan is 25 million US dollars, or 150 million legal tender. This number only equals 2.4 times the annual value of China's tung oil exports to the United States, so the loan can be repaid in two and a half years.

### Japanese Yarn Dumping in the Mainland, Chinese Merchants and Factories Actively Resist, Guerrillas Enforce Regulations on Punishing Traitors, Cotton Weavers Change to Weaving Native Cloth with Good Sales

The Japanese side has long intended to seize China's entire yarn industry. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai war, most of the Chinese-owned yarn factories have been in the war zone, and the Japanese side took the opportunity to seize them and monopolize the cotton weaving industry in the guerrilla areas, hoping to achieve the goal of controlling the yarn industry. However, the factories in the mainland would rather sacrifice their business than cooperate, and they advocated spinning and weaving native cloth, which is sold everywhere. The details are as follows:

Japanese Attempt to Control the Yarn Industry

Since the Shanghai war moved west, the Japanese yarn factories in Hongkou and Caojiadu in western Shanghai, the main base of the Japanese yarn industry, have regrouped and recruited workers to manufacture day and night. On the one hand, they colluded with the puppet organization to collect cotton at low prices in the mainland areas controlled by the Japanese army. On the other hand, they arbitrarily increased the price of yarn. Under the three principles of low wages, suppressed raw materials, and increased market prices of products, it can be said that the Japanese yarn industry has developed unprecedentedly, but they are still not satisfied and want to control the yarn market single-handedly. They used special forces to increase taxes on Chinese and foreign merchants' yarn and thread transported to the mainland to resist them. Chinese and foreign yarn factories cannot compete, and the mainland has almost become a Japanese yarn market.

Mainland Factories Refuse to Purchase Japanese Yarn

The production areas of machine-woven cotton cloth have always been known for Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changshu, Wuxian, Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading and other counties in Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that there are more than 3,500 large-scale factories. Their sales are mainly in Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou in southern China, and Wenzhou, Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, Wuhu, Shexian in Anhui Province, etc. The factories suffered heavy losses in the war. Later, those with more capital tried to continue to start work. However, the mainland was full of Japanese yarn, so the factories were mostly forced to use it in terms of raw materials. Since October of last year, the crackdown on Japanese goods has been very strict everywhere, and the Japanese yarn purchased was intercepted by guerrillas on the way during transportation, causing manufacturers to suffer heavy losses. According to the reporter of Xiandai She, after inquiring from the cotton weaving merchants stationed in Shanghai in the mainland, the manufacturers, considering that they are in the midst of a long-term war of resistance, are willing to sacrifice their business for fear that the mainland's assets will flow out and vow not to purchase Japanese yarn. However, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants who are greedy for profit and still do not hesitate to solicit business for Japanese merchants or open factories to manufacture. They are being closely investigated and cracked down on. It is now learned that guerrillas everywhere have followed the regulations on punishing traitors promulgated by the central government. If they find anyone trafficking in Japanese goods or using raw materials to open factories for manufacturing, they will be shot immediately after being arrested.

Change to Weaving Native Cloth with Good Sales

Recently, cotton weaving manufacturers in the mainland have advocated changing to weaving native cloth, implementing self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing, and converting the original iron and wooden machines into native cloth weaving machines. In addition to collective work, cotton is distributed to the countryside to spin yarn, and then the yarn is distributed to the people to weave cloth. It is now learned that since the promotion of this native cloth, the sales in the Shanghai market have been very wide. It is also widely used in Shantou, Fujian, Wenzhou, etc., and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a certificate of pure domestic production. This native cloth has light weight and high profit, so all factories are planning to change to weaving.

### Future Trends of Film Companies, No More Filming of Supernatural Films

The film companies in this city all suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the "August 13th" war, and film production was suspended. Later, they tried to recover and started filming one after another. The fact that the Chinese film industry can still continue to develop on the isolated island depends on the hard work of the company authorities. Although there were rumors that the major companies in Shanghai had compromised with the Japanese puppets, it was purely fabricated and was obviously a conspiracy to sow discord. The Shanghai film industry, except for a few scums, all value integrity and firmly reject all threats and inducements. However, due to environmental constraints and limitations in financial resources, they had unconsciously filmed supernatural films in the past, which aroused the concern of the cultural circles in this city. Now it is learned that the authorities of the film companies have long felt that supernatural films should not be filmed, and have automatically determined the filming policy. They will uphold the original intention of assisting social education and film more new films that are beneficial to the people. They are deeply grateful for the concern of the people from all walks of life and are happy to accept any criticism, guidance and assistance. It is expected that the Shanghai film industry will continue the glorious history before the war and carry it forward.

After overseas Chinese tycoon Hu Wenhu decided to invest in the development of the rich resources in the southwest, all the work is gradually becoming concrete. The development fund is tentatively set at 30 million national currency. The first step is to carry out the mining of minerals in Yunnan Province. In addition to sending Cai Xianzhang, Hu Zhaoxiang, and others to Yunnan to investigate reclamation areas, he has also hired mining engineer Huang Fengjun and eight skilled personnel to return to China and go to Yunnan to engage in mineral exploration work before proceeding with formal mining.

### Relief Society and Yunnan Provincial Government Negotiate Resettlement of Refugees, In Addition to Reclaiming Wasteland, Promoting Sericulture

After the Relief Committee implemented the transfer of war-zone refugees to the southwest for development, the committee has sent a member, He Chongjie, to Yunnan to negotiate with the provincial government on the arrangement of refugee production matters, such as wasteland reclamation and sericulture. Details are as follows:

Reclaiming Wasteland

Yunnan Province is located in the tropics, rich in resources that are inexhaustible. It is sparsely populated and has a vast area of 400,000 square kilometers with a population of only 13 million people. Thanks to the efforts of Chairman Long of the province over the years, those who have reclaimed wasteland include the草地墾荒區 at the intersection of the滇越 railway and the箇碧 railway, the绿野 plain. The transportation is very convenient. There is a開蒙墾殖局 under the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission, with a jurisdiction of 100,000 mu. The director, Yang Wenbo, has been working hard for two years and spent more than 300,000 yuan. The water interest has been removed, the water conservancy project will be completed soon, and the property rights are completely publicly owned. 1,400 tenant households have been recruited and more than 8,000 mu of rice fields have been cultivated. It is expected that 30,000 mu will be cultivated in February this year, of which 10,000 mu are in urgent need of tenant recruitment, which can accommodate 500 refugee households. The provincial government welcomes the Relief Committee to immigrate and reclaim. The思普 area along the border can reclaim 700,000 mu of paddy fields, 3 million mu of dry fields, and 7 million mu of mountain fields. The cultivated land is sown at will, and there is already a surplus of grain. The price of one meter is only 25 cents in national currency per 20 catties. In addition, there are a large number of special products, such as tea, cotton, camphor, bamboo, wood,楼榔, coconuts, and pomelos. In弥勒, there are more than 100,000 mu of wasteland, and in建水 and開遠, there are also 40,000 to 50,000 mu of wasteland. In addition to the continuous efforts of the provincial government, the Relief Committee, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Hu Wenhu, the Central Land Administration College, and the Zhejiang Agricultural College are all conducting separate surveys.

Promoting Sericulture

The sericulture production business is presided over by the Director of the Department of Construction, who also serves as the Director of the Sericulture Production Farm, and the technician Chang Zonghui of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The farm is located at Changpo, ten kilometers away from the provincial capital. Last year, 1,000 mu of mulberry land was reclaimed. From the spring to the autumn of this year, the reclamation and planting will be expanded to 10,000 mu, which can accommodate 200 refugees to work on the farm. Regarding the production conditions for refugees: Those who are healthy, between the ages of 20 and 40, are employed all year round, with monthly wages ranging from 9 to 12 national currency, providing accommodation, and self-catering. There is a public kitchen for workers. Refugee couples can work together. If they have one or two children, they can also be accommodated. Refugees are given two hours of lessons every night to guide self-planting mulberry and silkworm rearing. It has been actively promoted by the Relief Committee and the Provincial Government. As for tea production, Yunnan Province has the most hope. Most of Yunnan Province is located in the tropics, and it is located in重山叠岭 with a climate and soil that are most suitable for tea planting. Kunming,宜良,保山, and蒙自 all produce tea, especially the Pu'er tea in the southwest, which is famous at home and abroad. After years of careful planning by Chairman Long, the export sales are very smooth, with an annual output of 70,000担. Recently, in a certain tea mountain range in Yuxi and Yinan, wild tea trees were found. The trees are tall, the leaves are larger than the palm, and the buds are fat and the pistils are strong. Moreover, there is no cold in all seasons, and the growing time is extremely long, nearly ten months from the vernal equinox to the beginning of winter, which can be picked at any time. There is a hope of 100,000担 per year.

### Fufeng and Other Flour Mills Order Foreign Wheat, The First Batch Will Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month, Domestic Wheat is Monopolized by Japanese Merchants

Among the flour mills in Shanghai that have started work after the war are Fufeng and Fuxin in the Public Concession. Now, because the production areas of domestic raw wheat are monopolized by Japanese merchants, resulting in transportation difficulties and a sharp decline in arrivals, they have to order foreign wheat from the United States. A total of 10,000 tons have been traded. The wheels are loaded and transported to Shanghai in batches from the United States. The first batch can be transported to Shanghai by the end of this month for the mills to produce flour. As for the import of foreign wheat last year, only 17公担 were imported, worth 193 yuan. Compared with the previous year, it decreased by 430,446公担, worth 2,654,357 yuan.

### Two Aurora University Teachers Receive Papal Medal, Reward for Enthusiasm for Church Schools

According to the French Shanghai Daily, the Roman Catholic Vatican recently awarded two Gregory the Great Medals to the teachers of Aurora University in this city as a reward for their enthusiasm for teaching at church schools. It is said that the two teachers awarded this medal are Dagot, a Frenchman who also works as a lawyer in Shanghai, and Krzysinski, a Pole. However, both teachers are currently not in Shanghai. Dagot has returned to France on vacation, and Krzysinski has been recalled to Warsaw by his government.

### Old Gate Police District Chief Aires Returns Home, Retiring After 36 Years of Service

Aires, the district chief of the Old Gate Police Station in the Public Concession, has served for more than 37 years, gradually rising from a Western police officer to his current position. Now that he has reached the age of retirement, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai next Tuesday (the 10th) on the Empress of Asia to return home. Last Thursday, his colleagues at the police station held a banquet to bid farewell to Aires, and Deputy Police Chief Robertson presented him with a beautiful cigarette holder as a souvenir.

### Japanese Inspection of Foreign Parcel Post Becomes More Aggravated, Foreigners Express Great Indignation and Ask Their Consuls to Lodge Protests Again

The parcel post sent by foreigners in this city was previously illegally inspected by the Japanese and was often unreasonably detained and refused to be forwarded, which caused many disputes at the time. Later, foreigners from various countries asked their consulates to lodge protests with the Japanese, demanding that the inspection be stopped immediately, but to no avail. The Japanese still used the excuse of preventing the supply of munitions, drugs, and grain to the guerrilla army to carry out the inspection as usual. Foreigners suffered a lot of trouble and obstruction. Unexpectedly, recently, the Japanese suddenly became more aggravated. Regardless of the nationality of the people, if there are parcels to be sent to the guerrilla areas on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, they must be opened and inspected. The sender should also be subject to inquiries and interrogations by the Japanese inspectors at any time and must not disobey, otherwise the sent items will be detained and confiscated. Most foreigners are indignant about this and believe that this kind of behavior by the Japanese is a bad precedent that has never been seen in the postal inspection system of various countries in the world. They have been reporting to their consuls one after another for days, requesting them to lodge protests again.

### Overview of Important Administration of the工部局 in 1938 (2)

Leading Consul

The former Norwegian Consul General and Leading Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Or, left Shanghai in September due to his promotion to a new position. When the局 said goodbye to Mr. Or, it was said that the duties of the Leading Consul have become increasingly heavy in recent years. It is even more important for the Consular Corps and the局 to maintain cooperation on matters related to the administrative institutions of this city. The position of Leading Consul was succeeded by the Italian Consul General Mr. Naron. Before Mr. Na returned to Shanghai, it was temporarily replaced by the Portuguese Consul General Mr. Alves.

Death

The famous educator Dr. Liu Zhanen was assassinated last year. Mr. Liu once served as a member of the Educational Committee of the局, and his service was of great value. Mr. Xu Xinliu served as a director of the局 for ten consecutive years and unfortunately died in August, which is a pity. In addition, there were also Mr. Tanaka, former member of the Music Committee of the局, Mr. Wang, former member of the Public Utilities Committee of the局, Dr. Novaro, Portuguese Minister to China, Dr. Raubault, Director of the Health Department of the French Concession, Mr. Bode, Deputy Director-General of the局, Mr. Smith, former Director-General of the局, Mr. Huang Zi, former member of the Music Committee of the局, Mr. Antesen, founder of the Special Patrol of the局, and Captain Huchkins, former member of the Library Committee of the局, all passed away last year.

Mortuary

After the transportation between this port and the mainland was blocked, it was inconvenient for the bereaved families to transport coffins back to their hometowns. Therefore, some people set up several mortuaries in the concession. The residents of the Western District complained a lot about these mortuaries being located in residential areas. However, the Health Department of the局 believed that if the corpses were coffined in a proper manner, it would not be harmful to public health and would not emit any odor. After the Board of Directors of the局 discussed this issue several times in June last year, it was decided that mortuaries should not be allowed to be set up in the concession or on the roads outside the Western District adjacent to residential areas. All plans to set up mortuaries have been approved by the Works Department, which has designated certain places to be allowed to set up. However, each mortuary must be subject to the inspection and management of the局.

Slum Hygiene

The局 adopted the recommendation of the Works Department and tried to improve the hygiene conditions of the slum areas and their surroundings. Some of the minimum measures regarding drains, toilets, water sources, and garbage have been implemented jointly by the Health and Works Departments in the Western District.

Entertainment Tax

The局 has no right to forcibly collect entertainment tax, but for the sake of relieving refugees, it has sent letters to 17 theaters in the concession, asking them to voluntarily collect this donation. The licensees of each theater have expressed their agreement. Therefore, the additional donation has been implemented since January 20 last year. Later, ice skating rinks and swimming pools in the concession also charged the same donation. The total amount of this donation remitted to the局 for the whole year can be about 275,000 yuan. (To be continued)

to contract. Work has already started, but it has been delayed until now due to a shortage of building materials and is still not completed.

### A Strange Case Occurs at the Chunjiang Western Restaurant, Three Guests Chase One Guest with Guns, Liu Wanjun's Whereabouts Still Unknown

At 10 pm on the 1st of this month, a strange case occurred at the Chunjiang Western Restaurant next to the Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Around 9:30 pm on that day, four well-dressed customers suddenly came to the western restaurant. Unexpectedly, after they had just gone upstairs and settled down for less than ten minutes, one of the four suddenly

Jumped Off the Building

and fled, and the remaining three chased after him with guns. After leaving the door, the whereabouts of everyone were unknown. However, when the three rushed to chase, they also abandoned a pistol. After the incident, the owner of the restaurant reported to the police. The police chief sent detectives to inspect the scene. He believed that it might contain political relations and actively

Started Investigating

It was not until yesterday that it was learned that the person who jumped off the building and fled first was Liu Wanjun, who had previously served as the captain of a certain team of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Now Liu has changed his name to Liu Zhiheng and has been appointed by a certain party to an important position in Pudong, but he has not yet taken office. That night, two people who knew Liu invited Liu to Liu's home on Shan Zhong Road to have dinner at the Chunjiang Restaurant. Unexpectedly, before a few words, the three of them suddenly took out

Guns to Chase Liu

The police have gone to Liu's home to inquire based on the above clues, but Liu has not returned home so far, so Liu's current whereabouts are still unknown.

### The Puppet "Court" in Nanshi Has Only Three Jailers

After the establishment of the puppet "District Court" in Nanshi, its detention center for prisoners was converted from the burnt-down District Court into a prison due to limited funds. However, there was no money to hire people, so more than a dozen old beggars were recruited as guards. There were no weapons and no food for the prisoners, which was not a good situation. Therefore, most of the prisoners were transferred to the憲兵隊 for detention. In addition, the puppet "Judicial" Office in Pudong has now been merged and abolished on the 20th of this month after negotiation with the puppet "Court."

### Vagrants Commit Many Crimes, Sentenced Separately and Transferred to the French Police Station for Joint Trial

The vagrants Zhou Shifeng, Chen Fumin, Wang Fugui, Bao Shida, and Gao Yunpeng colluded with the Russian Pao Lisi to impersonate detectives from the Public Concession and the French Concession police stations. On the pretext of searching for opium, they defrauded huge sums of money from妓院 such as Miaozhen Shuyu at No. 4, Lane 726, Fuzhou Road. The amount of money defrauded in just a few months reached several thousand yuan. Later, Hua Chief Detective You Agen and Detective Chen Ruisheng of the Old Gate Police Station arrested Zhou and others and sent them to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court and announced the verdict. Zhou Yifeng, Chen Fumin, and Pao Lisi were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Wang Fugui and Bao Shida were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Gao Yunpeng was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. The lawyer of the police station, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendants had also committed the same events in the French Concession, and requested a transfer. After Judge Feng inquired with the detectives of the French police station, he approved the six defendants to be taken away by the French police station for investigation.

### Hongkou Market is Depressed, Residents Returning are Finding it Difficult to Make a Living

The Public Concession authorities are actively carrying out the opening of Hongkou. The Japanese side has agreed to try to open a part of it. Therefore, the merchants and residents living in Hongkou (the area south of Hongqiao Hong) have been returning to their old homes one after another to reorganize their shops and resume business. However, merchants and residents returning to Hongkou must first obtain a pass from the Japanese side before they can move freely. It is difficult to obtain this pass. Most of them are entrusted by Japanese people to obtain it on their behalf. There are also many who are unable to obtain the pass due to economic difficulties or having no acquaintances with the Japanese, so they have not returned for a long time. Therefore, except for the triangle field and the small vegetable market nearby, about 70% of the shops on the streets of Hongkou have reopened, but Japanese-owned shops still account for 30% of them. Among them, only 40% to 50% of the shops on the streets have reopened. The market is still difficult to prosper. After 6 pm, the shops close one after another, and the night market is very depressed.

### Not Long After the Wedding, a Young Woman Eloped, The Young Owner of a Noodle Shop Induced and Took Her Away

Wang Jilian, a farmer from Xiaotangjiazhai behind Longhua Town, moved to No. 14, Qianhujiazhai, Xujiahui Town, the home of his relatives after the Shanghai war. Wang only had one son, named Genfu, who is 19 years old and works as a mechanic in the Kangjiaqiao China Underwear Factory. This spring, Wang hired Quanmei, the second daughter of Hu Gengsheng, who planted flowers in the Catholic Church at No. 31 next door (18 years old, formerly a female worker in the warehouse of a pharmacy on Wenlin Road,) as his daughter-in-law through a matchmaker. They got married on August 13th last year. The relationship between the couple was very harmonious. Unexpectedly, Qi Zhongbing (also known as Xiaogou), the son of Qi Meihong, a Danyang native who opened a noodle shop in Xujiahui Town, seduced and bewitched her in every possible way. Recently, he instigated Quanmei to elope without a trace on the evening of the 27th of last month. Before leaving, she stole a gold bracelet, gold chain,鎖片, and gold ring (weighing eight taels). and more than 400 yuan in legal tender. Now Wang Feisheng has reported to the British and French police, requesting a strict investigation and prosecution.

### Terrorists Plan to Destroy Japanese Goods

The China Press said that last night (the 6th), firefighters and several detectives went to the Gonghexing Wharf after receiving a report of a fire at the wharf. But they saw that there was no fire there, so they investigated it. They soon believed that terrorists had planned to destroy Japanese goods, and they believed that the goods were stored at the wharf.

### Police Substation on Great Western Road Closed: Reason for Closure is That the Road Falls Under the Jurisdiction of the Concession; British Military Authorities Had the Right to Close It

The former substation of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Great Western Road, east of Columbia Road, which is an extraterritorial road in Shanghai's western district, was occupied by police sent by the "Grand Avenue Government's Puppet Police Bureau" after the westward retreat of the National Revolutionary Army during the Shanghai Battle. On the 5th of this month, British troops suddenly used barbed wire to seal off the windows and doors of the "Puppet Police Substation." It is now understood that the reason for the British troops' closure of the "Puppet Police Substation" is that the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Concession's roads, and therefore the British military authorities had the right to close it, which is not inappropriate. The order was issued by British Major General Smallwood to carry out the closure. However, all the puppet police uniforms, wooden furniture, and other assets inside were not moved.

The Continental Times reports that neither the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" nor the Japanese who protect it have lodged a protest regarding the British military's closure of the puppet police station at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road, and it is expected that no protest will be lodged. The British military authorities believe that the puppet police station is within the British defense zone outside the Concession's roads, so the British military has the right to close it without consulting any party in advance. According to reports, Major General Smallwood ordered the closure on Thursday morning, and Major Ashmore of the British garrison in Shanghai led a team of East Surrey Regiment troops to carry it out. The puppet police station was a one-story building. When it was closed, there were several puppet police officers in plain clothes inside. When the British troops ordered them to leave, they did not resist and quietly left the building. The British troops then piled the sundries outside, locked the doors, and nailed barbed wire to the windows. The entire process took ninety minutes. The Chinese and English notices posted still stated yesterday (the 6th), "Closed by order of the British military," and various sundries were still piled up on the side of the road yesterday.

### Apprentice Commits Suicide; Coroner Examines the Body

Guo Xin-kang, a young man from Ningbo, was twenty years old. He had been working as an apprentice at the Nanyang Catering Company at 28 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Recently, due to gambling losses, he suffered economic pressure and could not make amends. He had a momentary impulse and secretly swallowed Lysol at the company at 2 PM on the 6th. At about 4 PM, his colleagues discovered it and immediately sent him to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. However, he was too poisoned and the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6 PM. The hospital reported it to the police, who moved the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Funyuan branch. Yesterday, they reported it to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, for an examination of the body. His uncle, Guo A-xiang, signed a statement to claim the body.

### The Body of Victim Zhang Boyuan, a Refugee, Mysteriously Transformed Into a Female Corpse; The Coffin Turned From Black to White; Police Authorities are Closely Monitoring the Case

At a time when refugees are facing difficulties obtaining supplies and various sectors of society are conducting telethons and fundraising activities, it has been discovered that Shen Zhi-guang, director of the Fahua No. 42 Reception Center affiliated with the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, deputy director Song Mei-xi, assistant Cao Lin-sen, inspector Cai Zu-ying, Zhao Wei-lian, and others, have been embezzling refugee food and selling it for their own profit. In addition, because the refugee Zhang Boyuan, from Baoshan,

Secretly Exposed

the matter and reported it to the branch, they harbored resentment and, on December 3 of last year, subjected Zhang to private torture, causing him to die from serious injuries. The case was reported to Liu Shao-kui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession's General Inspectorate, detective Song Bing-zheng, and others, who arrested Shen Zhi-guang and others. Li Zhi-shan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court based on Articles 278, 336, and 305 of the Criminal Code for causing death by injury, embezzling publicly held property, and obstructing freedom, requesting that the court

Strictly Punish Them

The case has been heard once by the Special Court, and the details have been reported in a Japanese newspaper. In order to seek the true facts of the case and gain a clearer understanding, the police planned to find Zhang Boyuan's coffin so that the court committee could examine the extent of Zhang's injuries. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Liu and Song, the two detectives, accompanied Zhang Boyuan's son, Zhang Ai-yi, to the Pu'an Temporary Coffin Repository on Columbia Road. Zhang's son pointed out the hall where his father's coffin was placed. The detectives found that the coffin should have been black, but it had

Turned White

Moreover, the corpse in the coffin was not Zhang Boyuan, but a female corpse. The detectives were deeply suspicious. Zhang's son confirmed that it was his father's coffin without any mistake. Now, in addition to the coffin changing color, the corpse has also changed from male to female. It is unclear whether the coffin repository made a mistake in the location of the coffin, or whether there is something else going on. The police are paying close attention to the matter and are currently conducting a secret and detailed investigation, striving to get to the bottom of the truth.

### Fisherman from Qushan Island Catches a Female Dragon Fish; Its Shape is Very Strange, So They Release it Back into the Sea

According to a fisherman from Qushan Island, Dinghai County, who arrived in Shanghai, the fisherman recently led his companions to fish in the waters off Huang Dayang, Qushan Island. At that time, they caught a strange fish in their net, which resembled a wild boar. The fish's tail was golden, and its eyes were bright. However, the companions all thought it was a god and released the fish back into the sea. According to experienced net fishermen, the creature is an amphibian or a female dragon fish.

### Shanghai Race Club Charity Sweepstake Concludes; Net Donation of 2,031 National Currency; Already Delivered to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association

The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Charity Sweepstake tickets for this year were drawn as scheduled at 7 PM on the 3rd of this month and were determined according to the results of the Shanghai Race Club's Sweepstake Race on the 4th. It is reported that the Club's Board of Directors, in order to benefit the refugees more, donated all the miscellaneous expenses related to the printing of the sweepstake tickets, the winning number slips, all announcements, and the holding of the drawing, and did not deduct them from the commissions received. The staff also handled the matter voluntarily, and their enthusiasm is commendable and rare. The total number of tickets was 110,000. If all tickets were sold out, the first prize would be 8,400 yuan, based on the actual number of tickets sold, as detailed in the ticket rules. This time, the actual sales were from number one to number 75,350, including one free ticket for every 50 tickets purchased (each ticket with one number costing 20 cents), totaling 13,700 yuan. The commission was 25%, totaling 3,425 yuan. According to the regulations, 6% of the commission, or 822 yuan, was paid to the lottery ticket shops as sales commission. In addition, the printing fee for the tickets was originally 715 yuan due to the complicated procedures, but the printer, Yiwen Printing Bureau, generously reduced the price by 20% because it was a charitable cause, so the actual payment was 80%, or 572 yuan. The total expenditure was 1,394 yuan, leaving a net surplus of more than 2,031 yuan in national currency. The Club's Board of Directors yesterday entrusted Director Li Hongfa to carry a letter, a detailed list, and other items, representing the donation to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. It is said that the Association expressed its gratitude and admiration for this. Furthermore, yesterday's report mentioned that Wang Heng-dong and Lin San-he, bathhouse attendants employed by Xiaoyao Pool Bathhouse, won the first prize, which shows the excellent reputation of the bathhouse.

### Su Xin, the "Youth Corps Leader," Was Squeezed Out by Fu Xiao-an; Fu's Flattery of the Japanese Was Rewarded; He Became the Head of the "Rascal" Group

When Su Xi-wen took office as the puppet "Superintendent," in order to cultivate his cronies, he specially organized the puppet "Shanghai Youth Corps," which was very large in scope. He established "branch corps," appointed himself as "corps leader," Liu Yi-xian as the head of the civil affairs section, Du Huai as the "training section chief," Liu Xiang-sheng as the "accounting section chief," Chen Zuo-wu as the "deputy corps leader," and Tong Di-hua as the "organization section chief." Each puppet "director of administrative affairs" also served as the "branch corps leader," widely recruiting young people to facilitate their seduction. However, those with a sense of patriotism were unwilling to work for the enemy and become treacherous slaves, so they filled the ranks of "corps members" with rascals and petty traitors, calling it "training," but in reality it was just a pretense. The corps headquarters was set up inside the puppet "Superintendent's Office." Later, because Su was busy with flattering the Japanese, he appointed Su Xin, the puppet "police chief of Pudong branch bureau," as the concurrent "corps leader." After the puppet "Superintendent's Office" was reorganized into the puppet "Municipal Government," the "corps" also moved to Jiangwan. However, Su Xin was a businessman by origin, unfamiliar with politics, and achieved nothing. After Fu Xiao-an came to power, he used various means to squeeze out Su Xi-wen's cronies. More than a dozen people have been dismissed one after another. Su Xin had no choice but to resign from the puppet "Municipal Government," which Fu approved without consulting Su Xi-wen. Fu appointed himself as "corps leader." From then on, the puppet "Shanghai Youth Corps," which Su Xi-wen had founded, was seized by Fu.

### Internal Strife in Chuansha Intensifies; Xu Hong-fa's Greed Aroused; The Puppet "Town Leader" is Kidnapped

Zhang Guan-sheng, a farmer from Chuansha, in order to plunder the people's wealth last year, spent a huge sum of money, thousands of gold, to lobby Lu Tie-ying, the puppet "district chief" of Chuansha, and obtained a puppet "town leader" position, who was sent to show off on Xu Jia-lu Road, Shangchuan Road, in the town. From then on, he oppressed the common people, committed all kinds of evil, falsely accused good people as thieves, arbitrarily extorted money, and accumulated a lot of ill-gotten wealth. Xu Hong-fa, the head of the puppet army, became jealous. Recently, he asked Zhang to borrow 1,000 yuan, but Zhang ignored him. Xu Hong-fa became angry and suddenly sent the puppet "army" to loot Xu Town the other day, and accused Zhang, the puppet "town leader," of colluding with the guerrillas, kidnapping him and demanding a huge ransom. If they were ignored again, they threatened to hand him over to the Japanese army for execution. This shows the internal strife and mutual harm within the puppet regime. Petty traitors should also wake up.

### Japanese Troops in Pudong Avoid Direct Conflict; The Guerrilla Force is Strong; The Japanese Plan to Form a Puppet Army to Resist

The strength of the Chinese guerrilla force in Pudong is growing stronger day by day. The Japanese garrison troops stationed along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Chuansha railways have been repeatedly harassed and feel unable to cope. The puppet army led by Xu Hong-fa in Chuansha has fewer than 200 men, and defections are common. The Japanese regard this puppet "army" as a chicken rib, so they plan to open up another path. Under the leadership of Omura, the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai, they plan to organize another puppet "army" to be stationed in Zhangjiang, Beicai, Zhoupu, and other places to cut off direct conflict between the Japanese troops in Shanghai-Nanjing and the guerrillas, and to eliminate the threat they currently feel. It is reported that some unscrupulous people have been secretly running around for Omura, secretly recruiting for many days. After the Chinese learned about this kind of method of using Chinese to control Chinese, which is too vicious, they were unwilling to become the second Xu Hong-fa, so no one responded. The traitor has been running around for a month without being able to fulfill his mission. The expenses he received from Omura have already been considerable, and he is in a great panic. He recruited bandits from the Pudong Avenue area to fill the ranks. Once this puppet army is formed, the kidnapping and robbery in Pudong will inevitably become more rampant, and the villagers will not be able to live in peace.

### The Puppet Police Bureau Takes Advantage of its Position to Collect Money; The Method is Outstanding and Not Respectful; Cancel the "Citizen Certificate" and Reissue a Round Copper Plate

The puppet "police bureau" previously, in order to prevent guerrilla activities, ordered the civilians in the four suburban areas to obtain a kind of puppet "citizen certificate" before they were allowed to pass. Recently, it has been heard that this method will be changed again, and they plan to manufacture round copper plates and force the civilians to obtain them and hang them around their necks with strings, so that the Japanese army can easily identify them when walking on the road. After this copper plate is made, those who have the original puppet "citizen certificate" must pay 60 cents each to obtain one, and those who do not have a puppet "certificate" must pay 1.5 yuan per piece. The methods of collecting money by the puppet organization are endless.

### Strict Police Affairs in Hongkou; Gambling and Vice Concealed

Since the factories in the Yangshupu area have resumed work, the number of workers used is particularly large and the traffic is frequent, so the police authorities pay close attention to the security in that area. Gambling and vice are suppressed as much as possible within the scope of their power. Even if there are idlers, they all fear the law and conceal their vice. The previously reported situation that gangsters planned to use special forces to set up private gambling dens has disappeared because of the strict investigation by the police authorities. The report was a misrepresentation.

### Bandits Rampant in Western Shanghai; Must Still Be Handed Over to the Japanese; Foreigners Who Were Robbed Identify the Bandits; Police Continue to Dredge for Handguns

The China Press reports that yesterday it was learned that on Thursday night (the 5th), detectives from the General Patrol Room found another handgun lost by the Public Concession police in a house on Yuyuan Road. The gun was a .38 caliber automatic handgun. A few weeks ago, a Chinese police officer was robbed of the gun on Brennan Road, which was loaded with seven bullets. There have been two cases of Chinese police officers being robbed of their handguns. After an exchange of fire between the police and bandits in Fahua West Town on Wednesday (the 4th), one of the lost guns was found in Xiaobang. The six men and two women captured have been detained by the Japanese military police. They were handed over to the Public Concession Police Department at noon on Thursday. Yesterday (the 6th), they were interrogated again. They will be detained by the Police Department for about a week, and then handed back to the Japanese. The Police Department also summoned several foreigners who were robbed on Columbia Road on December 28, so that they could, if possible, identify whether the arrested people were the bandits from the robbery that day. A total of thirteen men and women are currently in custody at the Police Department. It is said that they are all members of the same gang. In addition, on the afternoon of the 5th, detectives and reserve police from the Chengdu Road police station captured seven people in the Public Concession and two people in Caojiadu.

According to another report, at about 4 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, Chinese and Western police officers from the Jing'an Temple police station, together with Japanese military police, arrested nine male and female bandits in a temporarily built wooden house at No. 420 Fahua Town, Western Shanghai. They confessed that there were three handguns, which they threw into the Fahua Port in front of the bandit den. The detectives sent people to recover one of the handguns on the spot, but the other two have not yet been found. Yesterday afternoon, the Police Department dispatched more than a dozen workers to the original location to pave the mud and install English-made water pumps to carry out the dredging work, because the river is silted up and it is not easy to find the guns in a short time.

Li Hongxing, a Shandong native and the owner of Li Hongxing Transportation Company in Mingde Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, went to the Dachina Match Company on the Enterprise Bank building on Sichuan Road in the afternoon of December 12 last year to settle accounts. At about 3 PM, he was at the bus stop at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tianzhutang Street, waiting to take the French Commercial Route 21 bus home. Suddenly, the assassin, Liu Biao (aka Wang Jinlian, aka Little Dog, 23 years old, living in a thatched shed on Singapore Road), a Jiangbei native, rushed up and pulled out a handgun,

Wanting to Murder Li

The bullet hit Li's body, but fortunately, it was not fatal. He quickly ran away and hired a car to go to the hospital for treatment. After the assassin fired the gun, he fled west. At the intersection of Zhubaoshan Road, he was caught by a Westerner, Gaul Laof (transliteration), with the help of a police officer. After being taken back to the police station, the detectives successively apprehended two suspects, Xu Zhi-cheng and Wang Jia-chang, and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The victim was transferred by the French police to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, the victim, Li Hongxing, has recovered, and the case has been

Closed After Investigation

Yesterday morning, Liao, the criminal division chief of the Second Special District Court, and Gao Yan-yan, the clerk, came to the criminal division to order the defendants to be tried. First, Yuan Jia-huang, the lawyer representing the French Concession authorities, stated the case and filed a public prosecution against Liu Biao, Xu Zhi-cheng, and Wang Jia-chang for attempted murder under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Then, detective Tao Rong-lin reported the investigation process. According to the plaintiff, the victim Li Hongxing, he does not know the defendant Liu Biao, but he has a feud with Zeng Liang-cai over the competition for pier business.

He Asks to Arrest Zeng Liang-cai

for questioning so that the process of Zeng conspiring with Liu to kill me can be understood. As for Xu Zhi-cheng and Wang Jia-chang, they are both people from my family. I was walking with Xu Zhi-cheng that day, and when Xu heard the gunshots, he shouted for the police. Presumably, Xu and Wang have no relationship. Please release them. Liu Biao confessed that Gu Jin-kui, who works as a pimp in the Yongtaichang Hardware Store on Beijing Road, gave me a handgun and a photo of Li Hongxing, telling me that he was a bad person and telling me to hit him. When I fired the gun, Gu was also nearby. When he saw me being arrested,

He Immediately Fled

I don't know Xu and Wang. Xu Zhi-cheng confessed that he does not know Liu and is a sworn brother with Li Hongxing. He accompanied Li to the match company that day to settle accounts. As they were preparing to get on the bus, someone shot Li from behind. I don't know Gu Jin-kui. I have been relying on Li for more than ten years, please investigate. Wang Jia-chang confessed that he works as an accountant for Li Hongxing, does not know Liu Biao, and does not admit to participating in the assassination. The court verified the confessions and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 17th because the case still needs to be investigated. The defendants were still remanded in custody.

### Rumors of Assassination of Zhang Hui-fang, Brigade Commander of the Chuansha Guerrilla; Bullet Hit Next to Chest, Came to Shanghai for Treatment

Zhang Hui-fang, also known as Zhang A-liu, the brigade commander of the Chinese guerrillas in the Chuansha and Shangchuan Road areas of Pudong, has more than 5,000 men under his command, and his military equipment is quite sufficient. Not long ago, he invaded the Japanese defense line along Pugaio and Yangjing, so he is most hated by the Japanese army. A notice was issued with a reward of 5,000 yuan for his arrest. During the last Japanese general offensive on Fengnan and Chuansha, in order to preserve his strength, Zhang moved his troops to the coast. However, his brother, Zhang A-mao, had his house burned down by the Japanese army. At present, they are facing each other across the Huogongtang River. It is rumored that Zhang came to Shanghai the other day on business. He boarded a small boat in disguise at the dock. Unexpectedly, he was shot by reactionaries. Zhang was hit in the chest. The assassin was arrested, and more than a dozen accomplices were also arrested and executed at the same time. Zhang was sent to Shanghai for medical treatment on the original ship.

### Police News Summary: Robbers Open Fire, Wounding Person; Traveler Dies by Suicide

Robbery

The Shanghai West area is rife with gambling and opium dens, resulting in frequent appearances of petty thieves. Last night at 8:30 PM, a Westerner's residence at No. 8 Dunxin Road was infiltrated by thieves. The owner discovered them and gave chase, but was unable to apprehend them. The owner immediately blew a police whistle. It was initially believed to be a serious incident and was reported to the police, who dispatched a patrol car. Upon investigation, the thieves had already fled.

Shen Abing, a 50-year-old man from Shaoxing, resided at No. 748 Yangjiafen Mountain, Tiantong Road, Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, Shen visited his fellow townsman He Xingzhi on the upper floor of the Yongxing Coal Shop nearby. Two robbers were in the process of stealing 15 yuan in legal tender from He Xingzhi's person, preparing to flee. Shen's sudden arrival startled them. In desperation, the robbers fired a pistol, hitting Shen Abing in the left leg. Shen immediately collapsed, bleeding on the ground, and the two robbers escaped. The police subsequently transported Shen to the hospital for treatment.

Around 10:15 PM last night, six robbers, four of whom were armed with handguns, suddenly arrived at a certain coal yard at No. 15, Lane 1039, Xinzha Road. They used threats and intimidation to rob 130 yuan in national currency before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the Old Zha Police Station, requesting their apprehension.

Around 9:15 PM last night, three robbers broke into the residence of a certain surname in No. 321 Shanxi Road. One of them displayed a handgun, forbidding any outcry. They stole cash and clothing, totaling an estimated 80 yuan.

Suicide

Chen, a 16-year-old girl residing at No. 16 Fu Fang, Huanlong Road, French Concession, committed suicide by taking poison yesterday afternoon at 3 PM due to a family quarrel. Fortunately, her family discovered her and rushed her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, saving her life.

A waiter discovered him and summoned officers from No. 31 Street Police Station, who brought an ambulance and transported him to the hospital. It is reported that a woman's portrait was found in Luo's pocket, suggesting that the suicide may have been due to unrequited love.

A single traveler calling himself Wang Baiquan, aged around 30 from Pudong, arrived at the Tianran Hotel on Zhizhong Road the day before yesterday afternoon. He was registered and accommodated in Room 315 on the third floor. Due to economic difficulties, he conceived a pessimistic idea and secretly ingested opium paste to kill himself. A waiter discovered him and reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, who transported him to the hospital. After the doctor administered an injection and stomach pumping, he was reported to be out of danger.

A guest, claiming to be Xu Huaming, aged 25 and local, arrived at the Yingzhou Hotel in Shixing Lane, Fa Da Road, around 5 AM yesterday (the 7th). After checking into Room 6 and going to bed, he swallowed Lysol to commit suicide. The waiter discovered him and reported it to the Relief Station, who rushed him to the hospital for treatment.

### Police Officer Dies After Mistakenly Taking Medicine for Dampness

### Newly Discovered Remedy for Gonorrhea Excites the Medical World

The American discovery of Pasulfamide has caused a global frenzy, with medical journals vying to publish news about it. The following excerpts are from the actual experimental reports of the most famous medical saints. This translation aims to give the Chinese people a brief understanding of what Pasulfamide is and its value in treating gonorrhea.

Dr. Keefer and Dr. Spink, professors at Harvard Medical School, used this drug to treat gonorrheal arthritis. The results showed that after 200 applications of the drug, no gonococci were found in the synovial fluid or in the affected areas of the reproductive tract. Therefore, they stated, "We have never been able to eliminate bacteria from synovial fluid in such a short period of time with other treatments."

Dr. Whitby, a famous urologist in London, commented on the value of Pasulfamide: "This drug has been proven to be the most effective drug for treating gonorrhea. Because it is not only excreted from the urine, but also deeply penetrates the blood and tissue fluids, it is believed to be the best drug for gonorrhea."

The British Medical Journal stated in the following commentary: "In addition to its other outstanding functions, Pasulfamide is now unanimously regarded as a reliable urinary disinfectant. Its characteristics are rapid efficacy, consistent excretion, and no need to rely on acidification of the urine (which is not easily achieved by the average patient, and its taste is not difficult to take)."

The "New Lede Ning," a special drug for treating gonorrhea from the Xinxing Western Pharmacy, uses this Pasulfamide as its main ingredient, supplemented with other carefully selected analgesic, digestive, and bowel-movement-aiding medicines to create tablets. The medicine is powerful, its properties are safe, and it is more suitable for the physiological differences between men and women, with careful dosing. It is truly an unprecedented gospel for gonorrhea sufferers.

### Lawyer Yin Guoji Practices Law

His office is located at No. 37 Manfu Building on Second Ma Road, and his residence is at No. 149 Bo Bai Lane, Luban Road.

Shen Xingyuan, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from the Shen family of Pudong, has a wide circle of friends. He has come to Shanghai to escape the war and is temporarily residing at his apartment on Tongfu Road. Because a Shen Xingyuan with the same name from Suzhou is using the Pudong Association to celebrate his son's wedding and has placed advertisements in this newspaper, many people have mistakenly sent gifts to his residence. After explanation, it was learned that Mr. Shen is another person.

(Chongqing Communication) This year's freshmen of national universities have been uniformly recruited and assigned to various colleges by the Ministry of Education. However, this year's admitted students mostly come from war zones and have been affected by the war in the past year, making it impossible to study with peace of mind, resulting in basic subjects not meeting the standards. In order to remedy the situation and solidify their foundations, the Ministry of Education has issued the "Remedial Measures for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Year" and ordered all colleges and universities to strictly supervise the students and appropriately increase teaching time so that they can make daily progress and meet the standards. The "Remedial Measures for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Year" are recorded below:

Sexual Health

### Health Between Husband and Wife is the Main Body of Happiness

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science, Russian Labor University

The main purpose of sexual love is procreation. In addition, it also has important activity and excitement ability for the development of the human body, the goodness of psychological and intellectual enlightenment. Regarding the good and bad of human thoughts and the strength of will, the creator has infused it with spirit to beautify it. The physiological love of animals is transformed into the most honorable and precious emotion in humans. Moreover, its power can control all other mental functions. A man and a woman progress from friendship to love, from love to marriage, and then form a family. Thus, the role of sexual love comes to fruition. This process of love is set by the creator, approved by the teaching of rites, and publicly approved by society. Therefore, the advanced spiritual love is the maintenance of human history. The greatest of human will power is love. Everything in the universe can determine one's life through love. This is indeed of the utmost importance. Energy also has a major relationship with human spirit. From a superficial point of view, although human intelligence and reasoning ability are not directly controlled by it, intelligence and measure vary depending on the strength of the person's energy. For example, if a person can maintain their virginity before marriage and live a regulated life after marriage, then that person will be able to adapt to the times and reap the benefits of their intelligence. Their mind will not be agitated, and their energy will not be dissipated and depleted. They will keep a calm mind, firm will, and always maintain vigorous mental activity, which can be used to cultivate love, create a career, and lay the foundation for their happiness.

The happiness after marriage is determined by the soundness of sexual love. So how can we prevent this sexual function from becoming pathological? In short, it is to maintain cleanliness before marriage and not develop bad habits that damage the body and mind. After marriage, avoid indulgence, lest you be swept into this unfortunate vortex and sacrifice the greatest happiness in life. With the recent progress of endocrinology, testicular essence preparations, "Male Body Supplement Kang", can be used to completely cure symptoms such as youth decline or reproductive weakness. Its success in treating premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility after marriage has reached the realm of clinical application.

Why has "Body Supplement Kang" been able to exert this amazing effect? This is because the ingredients used are extracted from the essence of young animal testicles and refined thoroughly. Essence is produced and kidneys are nourished within 24 hours. Its effect is invincible!

### Those with Chronic Coughs Should Prevent Pulmonary Tuberculosis - Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

"A chronic cough easily turns into tuberculosis." This is a warning that is known to almost everyone. A chronic cough can injure the pleura. At this time, the lungs feel stabbing pain, which is a symbol of the early stage of lung disease. But if you can try your best to seek treatment in this preliminary stage, you can often turn danger into safety. From my more than 20 years of experience, the best way to improve your health is to actively take the German lung medicine "Pulmonary Nall", which has special effects in relieving coughs and stopping tuberculosis. No matter how severe the cough is, taking "Pulmonary Nall" can completely calm the cough within three hours. It can also reduce the oxygen function of the lungs and cause tuberculosis bacteria to lose their activity. Therefore, even if there are symptoms of tuberculosis, such as hemoptysis, expectoration, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever, taking it will cure them immediately. It can also cure stubborn whooping cough and senile asthma, and can achieve success in a few days.

Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn

### When Suffering from Leukorrhea, Do Not Ride a Blind Horse Blindly: The Harm of Misusing Inferior Drugs

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctorate

... As of the end of 1938, "Kelinnong" still maintained the highest score record.

... All newly emerging gonorrhea drugs still cannot catch up and do not get the gonorrhea championship!

Gonorrhea is a disease that is fierce and difficult to cure, which makes patients feel extremely anxious and throw in miscellaneous drugs indiscriminately, hoping to be cured as soon as possible. However, they do not know that the result is counterproductive and delays the treatment a lot. In my clinical years, I have always been distressed by the lack of suitable oral drugs for gonorrhea, not to mention the word specific drugs. Most patients are ignorant and ignorant, and they see the magnificent advertisement and think that it is a new drug and abuse it. As a result, it is still the same type of goods as the original penetrating bactericidal and sandalwood oil preparations. As a gonorrhea expert, I have tried every new gonorrhea drug that is launched every year, but they have all failed. I feel that although there are many new drugs on the market, like bamboo shoots after rain, most of them are not worthy of their name.

History shows us that truth cannot be obliterated, and genuine drugs cannot be eliminated. "Kelinnong", invented by German Dr. Peter, has been popular in five continents for many years. Gonorrhea experts and VD hospitals in various countries all use "Kelinnong" as an oral drug for gonorrhea. Taking "Kelinnong" for all new and old leukorrhea in men and women, such as prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and female gonorrhea leukorrhea, will quickly and completely cure. According to a report from the Berlin Medical Research Association in December 1938, it said that the drug "Kelinnong" still maintained the highest record of gonorrhea treatment experience this year. Germany is the most advanced country in the world in medicine, and its words can be guaranteed to be a gonorrhea-specific drug "Kelinnong". I hope that gonorrhea patients will pay attention!

### What is Prostatic Leakage? - German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

The prostate gland is in front of the bladder, and there are many nerves surrounding it. Those who overindulge in self-stimulation and sexual intercourse will cause local nerve weakness and lose their control, so it is easy to leak out. According to expert research, the so-called spermatorrhea is a symptom of chronic prostatitis, such as gonorrhea, bladder disease, excessive sexual intercourse, and self-stimulation. can make the prostate gland have the possibility of developing chronic inflammation. Patients with this disease not only often have semen-like material flowing out of the urethral opening, but also have various neurological symptoms, such as decreased libido, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, kidney atrophy, back pain, headache, lumbago, dizziness, palpitation, fatigue, and terror concepts. The patient's temperament is also becoming increasingly gloomy and depressed. They often hold a pessimistic view of their personal destiny. They feel that their disease is too serious, and their mental activity is reduced. As a result, pessimism often occurs.

The first treatment for this disease is to clear the mind and reduce desires to avoid stimulation of local nerves. As for drug treatment, only taking "Ners' Spermatorrhea Tablets" has definite effects. The function of the agent is to consolidate the sperm gate, reduce the sensitivity of the erection nerves, and stop any vicious spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea immediately after taking it. It also has the effect of calming the brain nerves, so that those with habitual insomnia have ample opportunity to be cured, so its effect is more than a hundred times that of sperm-strengthening tablets. Anyone who has taken various sperm-strengthening tablets on the market without success may wish to try this product, which guarantees a well-deserved effect.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Prostatitis Reducing Fertility – As Described by Dr. Yao Juyan – Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Weakening of Fertility

In cases of acute and chronic gonorrhea-induced prostatitis, fertility is often reduced. This outcome is especially likely in cases of parenchymatous prostatitis. Gonorrheal inflammation affects a significant portion or the entirety of the prostate gland. It can cause high fevers exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, as well as extreme and frequent urges to urinate. Discomfort is experienced in the rectum during defecation or walking, and the perineum (the area between the anus and the scrotum) feels particularly tender. A hard, rough mass seems to obstruct the rectum. Sitting and standing become uneasy. If the inflammation spreads to the pelvic connective tissue, it can lead to thrombophlebitis, sepsis, and pyemia, posing a life-threatening risk.

The Only Effective Rescue

The most common manifestation is the cessation of prostatic secretion, which prevents the nourishment of sperm. Additionally, scar contracture during prostatitis can cause blockage of the testicular ducts, leading to infertility due to a lack of reproductive capacity. The only appropriate and effective treatment for this condition involves the internal administration of the gonorrhea-specific medication "Kelinong," combined with German static electricity therapy and B-type prostate massage, which are highly effective. Based on my years of accurate research, when the aforementioned parenchymatous prostatitis occurs, taking "Kelinong" can induce an anti-gonorrheal effect, directly targeting the prostate lesion, encapsulating it, and preventing the spread of gonorrhea. Simultaneously, using German static electricity and X-ray electrotherapy to enhance the bactericidal power of the medication can invariably achieve analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and diuretic effects in about four weeks. Moreover, it can completely cure the condition and restore the original function of prostatic fluid secretion. This has been repeatedly tested and proven effective by me over the past decade. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 consultation slots will be available daily, with a registration fee of only 5 jiao per slot.

### Supporting Character's Complaints

— Mr. Xiaoyu

In the past few days, on the international stage of the Asia Grand Theatre, just as the "China" and "Japan" troupes were putting on a continuous performance of martial arts scenes, two rather famous supporting characters were suddenly dismissed. It's quite strange that both of these supporting characters have names that include the character "Wei." Normally, elder male characters should be the leads, but they were singing in action plays, so it's understandable that elder male characters would be relegated to supporting roles!

The departure of the elder male character from the "China" troupe was due to jealousy. He didn't like hearing the applause for the leading martial arts actor. He insisted on singing a few high-pitched lines in a loud voice while the lead actor was turning his horse and performing the "dragging sword" trick. The stage musicians had to frantically bang the gongs and drums to create momentum and play the erhu to support his singing, but the sound of the erhu couldn't drown out the gongs, and no one in the audience listened to his "chicken eating from the pot, duck sticking its beak in" high-pitched singing. He finally left in a fit of anger.

The elder male character from the "Japan" troupe tried his best to please the lead actor. He would roll his eyes and stroke his beard to cheer on the lead actor when he was wildly twirling his spear. He would even carry the spear and lead the horse when the lead actor came on stage. It's just a pity that his parents didn't give him three heads and six arms to properly serve these lead actors with their quirky temperaments. He finally retreated knowing that he was "acting with a stone mortar on his head" (doing something difficult). He failed because he lacked ability!

But supporting characters are, after all, supporting characters. If a supporting character performs well, it certainly adds to the excitement, but their departure doesn't affect the overall situation. As long as the lead actors don't remove their official hats, the signature performance won't stop. Don't you see that a new group of lead actors has already been announced, and others have already taken over the singing?

### Starting with the Centenarian Ma Xiangbo

— Xinan

The reports in the newspapers these days about Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday are truly a cause for celebration for this national treasure. Especially since Elder Ma is a pioneer of the revolution and a forerunner of culture, and he still advocates for resistance at the age of 100, this is a sign of his noble character. Nowadays, young people often use age to determine whether someone is old and corrupt, but this is a childish perspective. In reality, whether someone is corrupt or not should not be judged by their age but by their actions. If young people indulge in pleasure, wealth, and material gain, and succumb to the philosophy of bowing down to anyone with power, ignoring everything else and engaging in opportunistic, shameless, despicable, and sordid behavior, it cannot be said that they are not corrupt. We should remember General Ma Yuan, the "vigorous old man," who was still able to travel across mountains and rivers to quell the south at an advanced age. And look at the old General Huang Zhong in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, what spirit he had! Therefore, Wang Bo said, "The older one gets, the stronger one should become, not knowing the heart of old age; the poorer one gets, the firmer one should become, not abandoning the ambition of youth." This is precisely what modern youth should learn from and emulate!

Speaking of Elder Ma Xiangbo's birthday, he was born on the 16th day of the third month of the Gengzi year of Daoguang (1840), which is April according to the Western calendar. So, in this year of the Republic of China, he is indeed a centenarian.

However, according to an old Chinese method of calculating age, Elder Ma is more than 100 years old this year. This method is used by people who are already over 90 years old and want to celebrate their 100th birthday early. They calculate each year as 12 months and then add the extra months to their age, which allows them to celebrate their 100th birthday a year or two early. According to this method, Elder Ma has had the following leap months until last year (the 27th year of the Republic):

Leap Second Month 4 Leap Third Month 5

Leap Fourth Month 5 Leap Ninth Month 10

Leap Sixth Month 4 Leap Seventh Month 5

Leap Eighth Month 3 Leap Tenth Month 1

Total 37 So, if we calculate each year as 12 months and add the 37 leap months, that's an extra 3 years and 1 month. Wouldn't that make him 103 years old this year? However, this kind of calculation is not valid, and Elder Ma, being a scientifically minded person, would certainly not resort to such tricks!

Since the Republic of China, not much attention has been paid to cultivating good customs among the people. We should know that respecting the elderly is not only a valuable expression of respect but also an encouragement for people to take good care of their health and increase their lifespan, which is a sign of a healthy and strong nation. Therefore, past dynasties have always had measures to respect the elderly and care for the young. Without going too far back, during the Qing Dynasty, those who lived to be 100 years old were given a "Centenarian Archway" to honor them, and they were also given 30 taels of silver to build the archway. In the fourth year of Yongzheng (July), Xiao Junde, a resident of Qi County in Henan, reached the age of 118. Yongzheng doubled the amount of silver given to him to build the archway. He also established a precedent: for those who reach 110 years of age, the silver is doubled; for those who reach 120 years of age, it is doubled again; and for those who live even longer, the amount is doubled according to their lifespan. In that same year, the Ministry of Revenue reported that 1,421,625 people in the provinces directly under the control of the central government were over 70 years old, and some were over 100 years old. According to the population ratio at that time, the proportion of older people was one-twentieth! It is conceivable that people's lifespans at that time were much longer than they are today.

The most remarkable sign of longevity was an event in the second month of the twelfth year of Yongzheng, when an entire family was honored for their old age. A father and his five sons had a combined age of 503 years. This was the family of Xing Dengyun from Xingning County in Guangdong Province. He himself was 102 years old, his eldest son Xing Boda was 82 years old, his second son Xing Boyu was 80 years old, his third son Xing Bojin was 78 years old, his fourth son Xing Bowang was 74 years old, and his fifth son Xing Jiabin was 67 years old. The father enjoyed a long life, and his five sons also enjoyed long lives. What a family of longevity!

I also saw that Ma Xiangbo's two nephews, one of whom is Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, is 77 years old this year. The way he walks and writes makes it hard to believe that he is an old man nearing eighty. He is still vigorous and spirited, not hunchbacked, and his feet do not falter. He has the spirit of the old hero Chu Biao. His younger brother, Mr. Zhu Jilin, is 66 years old this year and still has a graceful demeanor, not diminished from his younger days, and still looks like he is in his forties. These are all signs of longevity, and their lifespans will not be less than their uncle's!

Movie Review

### Tangled Affections

— Ruhua

“There Goes My Heart” Produced by United Artists, Starring Fredric March

Rather than calling "Tangled Affections" a "comedy," it's more accurately described as a farce. A young woman whose grandfather treats her like a "priceless treasure," leaving her with no freedom of action, finally takes a trip to New York. After disembarking and "wandering aimlessly, suffering from hunger and thirst," she meets Bridget, a department store saleswoman, and also "enters the service of the store." Encouraging noble young ladies to leave their homes and experience real life by working in a department store is certainly not a bad thing. However, the theme of "Tangled Affections" does not lie here. It uses this opportunity to entangle the "affections" of the female protagonist with a newspaper reporter, thus unfolding a grand "comedy" of entangled affections.

This typical Hollywood-style story is not presented in a Hollywood-ized way. Perhaps this style is quite suitable for the palates of general foreign gentlemen and ladies, but for Chinese audiences, this is not the best way to perform.

Director Norman Z. McLeod certainly employed many so-called "gags," such as Bill mistakenly identifying Joan's maid when he goes to the yacht to photograph her; the introduction of Bridget's character by interspersing a quarrel between her and the restaurant manager; Joan's awkwardness when serving customers in the department store; the kiss between Bridget and her lover, and the humor in that complicated name; Bill's secret photography of Joan, which never captures her true face... and finally, the union of Bill and Joan on the sandy island. These gags still require the assistance of "dialogue," but the director fails to handle the development of the entire play in a very light and lively way. The "gags" are just "gags." In comparison, the final scene is more commendable.

Fredric March is a versatile actor. He has played "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Resurrection," "The Buccaneer," and "Les Miserables." He can grasp the personalities of various different roles and bring his refined acting skills into play. However, the reporter Bill he portrays here simply cannot be developed. This is related to both the script and the director. Similarly, Virginia Bruce is also mediocre.

Patsy Kelly, who plays Bridget, is as interesting as Joan Davis in "Thirteen O'Clock." She is a lovable clown.

### After the Rain, Blue Skies

— Bao Tianxiao

The female doctor's surname was Zhang, her name was Zhang Wenqi. She was an old maid who vowed to remain chaste. She was a devout Christian and also a missionary who dedicated herself to saving people and helping those in need. Knowing Zhu Laoyuan's character, she agreed to help him. She examined Zhu Laoyuan's granddaughter and, despite being a village girl, she was clean, tidy, and clever. She was only seven or eight years old, but she answered all her questions well. Because Zhu Laoyuan only had this granddaughter, he had taught her to read, and she had already read two or three primary school textbooks. When she first arrived, she inevitably cried and missed her home, but after Dr. Zhang coaxed her, she quickly became accustomed to her new surroundings, as she was just a child. Dr. Zhang ran a women's and children's hospital, which focused primarily on obstetrics and pediatrics. In the past, Chinese midwifery relied on uneducated old women, and countless infants died unnecessarily each year, especially in rural and poor areas. Later, obstetricians and midwives gradually emerged in China, but they were mostly located in major cities and charged exorbitant fees. Remote areas had no such services. Although Dr. Zhang's women's and children's hospital was located in a large town, it was surrounded by numerous villages. Secondly, there was pediatrics. Obstetrics and pediatrics were inherently related, but their pediatrics department was more specialized and serious, with dedicated pediatricians in charge. Since the outbreak of the war, many people had fled their homes. Among these refugees, many pregnant women were nearing their delivery dates, and giving birth at this time was extremely difficult. Dr. Zhang then established a refugee maternity hospital to help these women in labor. After giving birth, some women were unable to raise their infants and abandoned them at the hospital. What could be done? Therefore, Dr. Zhang had no choice but to establish an orphanage to house these abandoned and orphaned children. Naturally, Dr. Zhang's financial resources alone were insufficient, but fortunately, many people helped. People are emotional beings, except for those who have a policy of brutal aggression. As long as your cause is righteous, everyone will be willing to lend a hand. Therefore, Dr. Zhang was able to manage financially, thanks to her enthusiasm and efforts, which earned her the support of both Chinese and foreigners. It was not easy for a woman to achieve so much.

### Shanghai Anecdotes

— Hangxie Zhaizhu

Supplementary Information on Shanghai Pictorial

The "Xinwen Bao" also published a pictorial, which began in the 19th year of Guangxu (1893) in November. The format was a single-page book, attached to the newspaper as a supplement. It was published monthly, with a separate table of contents. It is unknown how long it lasted. One copy I have seems to be the second issue, titled "Catalogue of Pictorials of the Xinwen Bao Newspaper." It begins with a preface by the former owner of Cangshan:

"The pictorial originated in the West. It is not merely for pleasing the eye, gratifying the heart, boasting of oddities, or showing off rarities. For every event, it is drawn and painted, which can increase people's knowledge. For every object, it is copied and imitated, which can aid people's research. Because there are things and objects in the human world that cannot be fully conveyed by language and words, it relies on this painting to express the shape and appearance to the fullest extent, in order to show it to everyone. Moreover, in modern times, the five continents and ten thousand countries are united as one family. Strange events and bizarre objects change rapidly and emerge endlessly. Without pictorials to supplement the omissions of daily newspapers, it would be insufficient to be called complete. Therefore, this newspaper also follows this idea. Starting from the first day of the midwinter month of Gui Si, we invite famous artists every day to carefully draw and paint, attaching two pictorials to the newspaper every day, in addition to the newspaper, to broaden the appreciation of readers. Every week of the month, it becomes a book, which can increase current knowledge and provide material for aspiring imitators. I hope that you do not view it as a plaything that undermines ambition."

"This was the motive of the "Xinwen Bao" for publishing pictorials at that time. Unfortunately, the content of the pictorials, in essence, did not live up to the claims in the preface. The selected events were still nothing more than social trivia. Even so-called national events were never seen in the first issue. In total, the first issue contained 54 pictures, and at times it reflected extremely superstitious beliefs. Its contents were as follows:

The Gates of Heaven Open, the Palaces Appear, The Envoys of Ten Thousand Countries Bow to the Crown, New Year's Greetings, Starting to Read, Farmhouse Joy, Promotion to Office, Heavenly Fortune Opens, Welcoming Spring Picture, Beating Spring Picture, Welcoming the God of Wealth, Opening Market, Hosting Guests (all printed in red) The God of Wealth Enters a Dream, The Bodhisattva Comes Out to Greet, Phoenix Carriage Performance, Certificate Issuance Ritual, Foreign Tribes Alliance, Ten Thousand Miles Long Walk, Chickens in Pairs, Strange Crab with Double Umbilicus, Dragon Guest Breaks Through, Li Paste Mad Monk, Huge Honeycomb, Shark Eats Man, Digging for Gold, Telling of Oddities, Clever Woman Adapts, Royal Cudgel Scolds Excellent Servant, Hired Woman Rides Pig, Giant Stone Flies at Night, Sunny Day Dragon Gate (all printed in black) Blowing Ascends to Heaven, Lantern Moon on the Yuanxiao Festival (all printed in red)

This is the content of the first half of the first month of the following year (1894). Apart from complimenting the imperial court, saying auspicious things, and collecting strange and bizarre events, there was nothing of substance. The painting skills were also inferior to those of the Dianshizhai." Each picture occupied half a page. The length of the core of the page was 6.5 inches, and the width was 4 inches. The middle seam was titled "Xinwen Bao Newspaper Pictorial One." The date and page number were attached below. The note below the picture line stated "Single purchase of a pictorial picture costs 4 wen, single purchase of a book page costs 5 wen." According to this, it seems that the bound issues were printed separately. Besides these, there were also the initially printed issues attached to the newspaper. It is unknown what their format was like.

Entertainment World

### The Film Industry in Nazi Germany

— Yin Yuan

Since 1933, the German film industry has found itself in a precarious situation. Films shown domestically have had to sing the praises of the Third Reich and spread the spirit of National Socialism. If film companies want to make money, they have to market their films abroad, but many countries object to the ideas of National Socialism. In 1931, Germany exported films worth a total of 59 million marks. By 1937, after the "elimination of film industry saboteurs," the export of films was worth only 7.2 million marks. The decline of the National Socialist film industry goes without saying, and the quality of German films has also declined.

One of the main reasons for the decline in the quality of German films is the expulsion of countless of the most outstanding filmmakers, directors, playwrights, and stars. The most progressive comedy star, Grünbaum, and several other Austrian film artists were imprisoned in concentration camps.

Not all of the films produced in Germany are nationalistic and militaristic. Several years ago, Germany began producing short opera films, and since 1933, there has been a trend of producing short song and dance films. The artist Hinzl raised the quality of these films. It cannot be denied that Germany has produced lovely musical plays under the new regime. However, Hinzl has now also left Germany and gone to Hollywood. The second reason for the unhealthy state of German films is the increasing political censorship and official restrictions. The number of orders and bans on German films is now so great that no one knows them all completely.

The third reason is more profound. Originally, German psychological and realistic films often showed their strength. German films were the first to create the characteristics of producing films with literary, psychological, and social themes. However, now these films cannot be produced either. The Third Reich cannot discuss serious social problems, and psychological themes are only allowed to be produced within strict limits.

Today, the spirit of cruel militarism has invaded German films, as well as many novels and short stories. But not every film has overt political propaganda. The Bavaria film studios are still shooting detective and adventure stories, but a strange phenomenon can be observed: the plots of these films are all set in other countries. Assassination, theft, violence, and merciless villains are indispensable elements in the exciting plots. But official decrees say that Germany no longer has such assassinations, which is considered fortunate. Filmmakers can use England, France, the United States, or other countries as backgrounds for filming these films. For example, several films scheduled to be produced in 1939 will use Alaska, Chile, Africa, Norway, and the United States as backgrounds. Only Japan and Italy are not used as backgrounds for wrongdoing and dens of villains. Japan and Germany have close cooperation regarding films. The film "Woman of the Samurai Path," directed by the German Dr. Finke, is the first film jointly produced by Japan and Germany. Japanese films are shown everywhere in Germany, such as "The Power of Japan" directed by Herslu, and "The Devil's Hand" produced by the German-Japanese Joint Film Company. The German government is also gradually persuading Japan to reduce the import of foreign films so that more German and Italian films can be shown. Germany and Italy are also cooperating in film production, and three major films are scheduled to be co-produced next year. National Socialist propaganda films are shown everywhere in Germany, and a film called "The Sword of Peace" is also being prepared. The content depicts "the class struggle of the Bolsheviks in other countries leading to bloody disturbances," while on the other hand, it depicts "Germany's efforts for peace."

### Casual Talk About Yangzhou Opera

— Lao Baixiang

Yangzhou has been prosperous since ancient times and is a place where outstanding people and outstanding talents live. Not to mention anything else, but taking the artists in the entertainment industry in recent times as an example, like the famous Shisan Dan and Mei Lanfang, the king of the opera world, both belong to the Liuyang city walls. Drama has a long and considerable history in Yangzhou.

Yangzhou opera originally had no scripts. The performers had no teachers, no traditions, no standards, and no rules. They sang impromptu, creating their own tunes. This artistic talent is truly divine and breathtaking. Later, those who promoted Yangzhou opera organized troupes, invited actors, selected talents, compiled scripts, and added costumes. Thus, Yangzhou opera roughly took shape and gained a status.

The Yangzhou operas in various entertainment venues in this city have undergone several reforms and are now standing on the frontline of artisticization. Speaking of its achievements, in the impression of the general public, there are also many welcoming praises. If it continues to improve tirelessly in the future, it can easily stand alongside Suzhou's Tanhuang and Siming's Wenci. However, people in Shanghai mostly regard Yangzhou opera as a type of civilized opera. Their feeling of interest in the plot and lyrics is unlike that of watching civilized opera, nor is it as easy to understand. Therefore, the development potential of Yangzhou opera is more suitable in northern Tianjin than in southern Suzhou and Hangzhou, because Yangzhou dialect and northern accents are relatively close. The bamboo used in Yangzhou opera is unique to the region. There are sheng, xiao, dizi, huqin, zheng pi, and gongs and drums. Using various instruments at once, high and low, fast and slow, in moderation and pleasing to the ear, this advantage is indeed a unique characteristic of Weiyang, which is difficult to hear elsewhere.

### Gengchun Qushe Charity Performance

— Hai

Gengchun Qushe performed at the Carlton Grand Theatre the day before yesterday to raise money for refugees. Since Xianni She captured a part of the audience at the Dongfang Theatre, Kunqu opera has gradually occupied a good position in the theater world, so yesterday's performance did not disappoint the organizers.

At a little after one o'clock, the theater was almost full. When I entered the theater, a purple velvet backdrop was hanging on the stage, with the two yellow seal characters "Gengchun" embroidered in the middle, It probably hasn't been long since the opening performance, and they were still dancing the Jiao Guan there.

Inside the theater, I discovered many actors, such as Wang Xichun, Yu Suling, Liu Binkun, etc. She and they were studying Kunqu opera. This was an opportunity for them to observe and learn. After the Jiao Guan dance was over, the entire Tieguan Tu began. The first act was Chen Baoqian's Borrowing Military Funds. His hair was already gray, but in order to participate in this charity performance, he specially shaved off his well-maintained beard. Next was Sun Junqing and Xu Lingyun's Bimu Lanjian. Junqing is a famous performer of Tanhuang. Only then did I know that he was also proficient in Kunqu opera. Lingyun played Zhou Yuji's mother, and her singing and acting were very enthusiastic. Her right arm ached as a result. The ghost scene was played by someone else. Tieguan Tu was performed until Assassinating the Tiger. The next acts were Su Huan Ji Xiao Yan and Shizi Hou Gui Chi. It was already past six o'clock when the performance ended.

The troupe was borrowed from Xianni She. I met a senior, Shi Guilin, backstage. He is the father of the late famous Kunqu actor Shi Chuanzhen (this person should be an old man in the middle, and he and Kirin Tong are the most close friends. Qilin's research on Kunqu opera benefited greatly from him. He has been in Nanjing and only came to Shanghai after the war. He joined Xianni She and also teaches opera. Wang Xichun, Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, Yu Suling, Ge Cijiang, Wang Lanfang, etc., all studied with him. I was very satisfied after watching the play. I felt that although Kunqu opera is not popular, it is not in danger of declining.

News in Brief The "Banyue Xiju" New Year's issue, edited by the Plum Blossom Hall Master and published by the Banyue Xiju Publishing House, was published today. The content is richer than before. The cover is a photo of Li Yuru and Yuan Shihai in the play "Qingmei Zhujiu Lun Yingxiong." The copperplate photos include stage photos of Sun Juxian, Xia Yuerun, Shang Heyu, Yu Shuyan, Meng Xiaodong, Li Shaochun, Zhang Eyun, Wang Xichun, Yao Shuijuan, etc. There are more than ten articles of commentary. The general distribution address is No. 10, Lane 422, Jin Shenfu Road.

### Random Jottings from the Chrysanthemum Stage in the 27th Year

— Junmei

Last year, there were quite a few trivial matters in the world of opera worth mentioning. I have, as best as I can remember, selected four topics: Hiding, Accusing, Bidding, and Writing, and will now describe them as follows:

Hiding The female Kunqu opera performer Meng Xiaodong, with her clear and moving voice and accomplished acting, often performed in Ping Opera. As soon as posters were put up for plays like "Losing Weiting" and "Releasing Zhu Lianhan," they immediately caused a sensation in the windy city [Beijing]. Last spring, due to a sore throat, she stopped performing and immediately became disheartened with her singing and dancing career. She went with other women from the former capital to a certain temple, where she chanted scriptures and worshipped Buddha, virtually becoming a nun. Meng Xiaodong is in her prime, and this sudden turn to negativity, like Hao Shouchun's abrupt retirement, is an unfortunate event for the opera world last year.

Accusing The "Little Bird" Wang Xichun, a Qin opera actress, plunged into the world of Kunqu opera and surprisingly became an overnight sensation, gaining fame from Beijing to Wuhan. Last year, she came to the isolated island [Shanghai] and, after performing at the Eden Theatre, received even greater praise. In the autumn, she suddenly accused a certain theater newspaper in court of defamation. In court, she spoke at length about the issue of "tight or loose waistband of her trousers," which was widely reported in the newspapers at the time. This, along with the incident of Mao Jianqiu and Wang Zhuangbai's over-realistic performance involving the breast, which sparked a newspaper war, created a scandal for the theatrical world last year.

Bidding Jin Youqin is an outstanding second-tier female opera performer. Her stage presence is quite graceful. Jin Shaobao, the "Old Man of the Melon Garden" from Shanghai, strongly promoted her, even giving her his residence, renamed "Qin Lou." Last summer, on Jin Shaobao's sixtieth birthday, a few close friends held a banquet at Qin Lou to celebrate, decorating the place with large "longevity" characters made of jasmine flowers, which were given to his concubine and Jin Youqin. After the banquet, a group photo was taken, called "Bidding Gold Picture." The romantic tale spread and was much talked about. Meanwhile, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Cheng Yanqiu and others busily took in disciples, so those making the pilgrimage to former capital to become apprentices came one after another. All of this was truly a wonderful activity in the opera world last year.

Writing It is common to see calligraphy by opera performers in newspapers and magazines, but the one with the most scholarly air is undoubtedly Shi Huiru. Last month, at the "Old Opera Performers' Reunion" initiated by Shang Xiaoyun, He Heyu, Cheng Jixian, Xiao Changhua, Wang Fulian, and Shi Huiru, five veteran opera performers from Tianjin, Shi Huiru performed various plays, all being young male roles. Opera fans said he wrote the four characters "Wishing You Health and Peace" on the spot, with powerful strokes and well-chosen words. Compared to Lin Shusen writing "606" when performing as a fan, one is elegant, and the other is vulgar, clearly showing a difference in taste!

### Tang Shengming's Telegram Arrives in Shanghai: Xu Lai is Safe and Sound in Changde; Sha Lu and Mingchun May Return to Shanghai

Regarding the incident of "Standard Beauty Xu Lai's Plane Crash Injuring Her Foot," which was widely circulated a week ago, the Gu Bao newspaper successively published the news. However, the reporter, having never heard of Tang Shengming owning a private plane, was quite doubtful and once visited Cao Yinyun, a close friend of Tang Shengming in Shanghai. Cao confirmed two points: First, Tang Shengming indeed did not have a private plane; second, Tang is currently the Garrison Commander of Changde and is not in Chongqing, which contradicts what was reported in the newspaper. He also asked Cao to send a telegram to Changde to inquire about the truth and wrote an article titled "Xu Lai's Plane Crash: Two Points of Suspicion," which was published in the last edition of this newspaper on the 31st of last month. Now, Tang Shengming's reply telegram has arrived in Shanghai and was shown by Cao Yinyun. The original telegram is as follows:

(Omitted above) Lai is in Changde and is unharmed. Mingchun may return to Shanghai. Ji, Dong. The telegram ends with the signature "Ji," which is Tang Shengming's courtesy name (his elder brother is Tang Shengzhi, courtesy name Mengxiao). Judging from this telegram, it can be confirmed that Xu Lai is indeed in Changde, safe and sound, and the story of the plane crash injuring her foot is undoubtedly a misreport.

### New Talk from the Opera Stage

— Yugong

The Standard Opera Troupe organized by Gu Wuwei and Lu Cuilan, husband and wife, has not been successful in southern China and has now disbanded. Gu came to Shanghai a few days ago to seek a new base. It is said that he has reached an agreement with the Gengxin Stage, where Gu will join as a shareholder and be in charge of backstage scenery, while Lu Cuilan and others will perform on stage and receive separate performance fees from the front-of-house management. The rumor that Gu Wuwei has taken over the Gengxin Stage is not true.

Zhang Yipeng, the leading martial arts actor of the Great Stage, has been performing "Journey to the West" at the theater for several years. As his contract is about to expire, he will leave when the theater closes at the end of the lunar year. The management of the Great Stage has been trying to persuade him to stay, but the decision has not been made yet. After leaving, Zhang Yipeng is determined to form his own opera troupe. It is said that he has been in contact with the Amon Grand Theatre in the French Concession.

Since hiring Feng Zihe as a screenwriter, the first work of the Golden Grand Theatre was the full-length "Good Sisters," which was a great success. The second work, "Xu Huiniang," is adapted from a section of "The Green Wilderness" and is even more brilliant than "Good Sisters." It will be rehearsed as soon as the script is finished. "Chu Overlord," which is being performed tonight (8th), is also adapted by Feng and is very different from the old play "Farewell My Concubine." Jin Suqin plays Yu Ji, Cheng Shaoyu plays the Overlord, and Li Junyu plays Han Xin.

For the sake of further artistic refinement, Yu Suyun will study opera with Chen Tongyun.

The Era Theater will stop performing on the 18th of this month and close for five days to renovate the interior before reopening. On the 18th night, there will be a cross-dressing performance, with the male impersonator Lao Niu Zhang Wenjuan playing Zhang Guilan, and the female impersonator Jiang Yunxia playing Huang Tianba. The management of the backstage has been taken over by Shen Jitang and Zhang Liansheng, Wenjuan's father, as partners. Except for Jiang Yunxia, who has left, the other performers remain the same. They are currently looking for suitable talent to replace her and are also hiring new performers to strengthen the lineup.

### Notes on Kunqu Opera Actress Wang Huichan

— Master of Songfeng Shuiyue Lodge

Kunqu opera actress Wang Huichan is the daughter of the famous zither teacher Mr. Bo Shui. Coming from a family of scholars, she is skilled in many plays. She studied under famous opera performers such as Wang Yaoqing and was highly praised as a rising star. Last year, she occasionally performed as a guest in a charity performance, surprising the audience with her talent and beauty and winning their applause. However, Huichan was flattered and became even more modest, studying hard behind closed doors to deepen her skills. Recently, she responded to the invitation of the owner of Gengxin Theatre, and all the contract terms were agreed upon, but suddenly due to a minor misunderstanding, an agreement could not be reached and the matter was dropped. Another theater happened to be reorganizing and planning to revive Ping opera, so through the introduction of Lin Shusen, Ms. Wang was hired as the leading performer. She made her debut on New Year's Eve of last year. Her specialty plays, such as "Lian Jinfeng" and "Yutangchun," are all her proud masterpieces. In recent years, I have become lazy and have not set foot in the theater for a long time. On New Year's Day evening, I was invited by my old friend Mr. Ma Li to watch. After returning, I felt moved and composed a poem to praise her:

"Rare to find both talent and beauty,
Her first appearance on stage captivates all.
Indeed, her family background contributes,
Truly, her artistry reaches perfection.
Her interpretation of the play is nuanced and steady,
Her new melodies clear and distinct.
I too, as a周..."

### Rejecting Students' Dancing

— Yang Gonghe

At a time when the nation is about to stake everything to fight for the final victory, dancing is undoubtedly an improper activity. However, the dance industry on this isolated island, although it once declined when the War of Resistance broke out, has now seen a perverted development. It is indeed something to be lamented. However, it is still excusable for those who have established families and careers to dance and relax. Students, however, are the future masters of the country. If they indulge in pleasure during their student years, their studies will inevitably become worthless, and their future will be bleak forever! Therefore, this should be most strictly avoided.

Ms. Wang Peiying, although she is currently a dance hostess at the Guotai Ballroom, deeply understands this principle. She is not as focused on money as other dance hostesses. When students ask her to dance, she always politely refuses. Recently, she even used a stern attitude to prevent a certain student from becoming her patron. Here is a record of the incident:

A student from ×× Middle School asked Ms. Wang to dance for the first time. She responded coldly, telling him that students should bury themselves in books and not indulge in pleasure. Who knew that this gentleman was shameless and continued to bother her repeatedly, forcing her to use a stern tone and severely scold him as a second step, and then avoid meeting him as a third step. Under her resolute will, the gentleman finally left in frustration.

I believe her attitude deserves praise. And I hope that all the dance stars in the dance world can follow Ms. Wang's example. In this way, even if there are some students who are willing to degenerate, they will have no way to do so. The sin of dancing can be reduced a lot by this.

### Yi Hua Miscellaneous News

Since its restoration, Yi Hua has released three films. "Records of the Film City," directed by Chen Kengran, is 80% complete; "Bi Xue Dan Xin" (Loyal Blood and Devoted Heart), directed by Yue Feng, has also been completed; and "Chu Overlord," directed by Wang Jielong, is being rushed day and night. The part of Yu Suqin has been temporarily postponed, as Yi Hua officials are considering Jin's relations with the Golden Grand Theatre. It is expected that the above films will be released successively during the Lunar New Year. The follow-up films will be "Mysterious Madam" by Wen Yimin and "Three-Part Incarnation Girl" by Fang Peilin, while "Daji," starring Diao Banhua, will be filmed at the same time.

There is no shortage of people who love film art in China, but it is not easy to make them rise to stardom and become shining stars. In the past, Lianhua worked hard to cultivate new talent. Since the rise of Yi Hua, the effort to cultivate new talent has been even greater. Yuan Meiyun, although enjoying a great reputation on the stage, owes her current status in the film industry in large part to Yi Hua. Others, such as Li Hong, Zhang Cuihong, and Lu Ming, were all created by Yi Hua. It is said that as Yi Hua begins its twenty-eighth year, the company's workload has increased, and it will work even harder to cultivate new talent. Yang Li and Yu Lin have already been given leading roles to help them progress. It is also planned to organize a new talent training class, with each director and actor responsible for their fees, so that those with aspirations can develop their talents. Readers of our newspaper who wish to serve in the film industry are welcome to apply.

### Guang Speed Skating Rink; Compiled by Hanzhen (5)

Types of Shoes

(B) Roller Skates: Purchase high-quality roller skates as well. Inferior roller skates have all four wheels fixed to the baseboard without any give. Superior skates have rubber pads. The ability of roller skates to move freely left and right depends entirely on these pads. Without them, the skates are no different from an ordinary four-wheeled cart, only suitable for moving straight ahead. The rubber pads on the front and rear wheels of both skates must be of the same thickness and softness. Otherwise, they cannot function properly. Rubber pads for roller skates vary from brand to brand. Therefore, it is difficult for those who use rental skates to show their skills. The length of the roller skates also depends on the height of the user. The distance from the center of the front wheel to the center of the rear wheel is five to seven inches for larger sizes. If the roller skates are nailed onto leather shoes, the roller skate sole should be one inch shorter than the leather shoe sole. Roller skates are more complex than ice skates. In addition to wiping them clean and adding oil, special attention must be paid to the condition of the four wheels to prevent accidents.

(C) Leather Shoes: Leather shoes must also be custom-made. If using bandages around the ankles, they must be worn when purchasing shoes to avoid the risk of the shoes being too small later on. The shoes must have flat heels. The shoelaces must start from near the throat of the shoe. Like ordinary sneakers, the shoe throat covering on the top of the leather shoe must not close when the shoelaces are tied. Because over time, the shoe throat covers on both sides of the top will gradually lengthen, they should be about an inch apart at first. The tongue of the shoe should be wide and able to cover the opening of the shoe throat. The shoe tongue should be multi-layered, with cotton padding or soft padding in the middle. The socks should be thicker than those worn normally.

Introduction for Beginners

Before entering the rink, beginners can practice various ice-skating-related exercises at home. If you have never practiced before and feel that your ankles are weak and unable to stand firmly on the thin blade of the ice skate, resulting in a lack of interest on your first visit to the rink, it is best to put on your ice skates at home and practice striding on a flat surface. The blades of the skates must be wrapped in cloth to avoid damaging the floor or carpet. Initially, the skates should not be tied too tightly. Tighten them slightly as you progress.

When first entering the rink, you will feel that the ice is slippery and difficult to walk on. As one foot tries to move forward, the other foot slides backward, making it difficult to move and creating a feeling of being unable to walk. This is because ice skating is fundamentally different from walking. Walking involves lifting one foot, moving it forward, and shifting the body's center of gravity behind that foot before lifting the other foot. Ice skating involves tilting the entire body forward from the first foot, allowing the second foot to push out and move on the ice. Then, the first foot is moved forward and lands, allowing the second foot to propel forward.

### Palace and Opera Secrets of the Former Capital (6) (8)

— Xu Muyun

When I lived in the former capital as a teenager, I heard Rong Zhifeng (Ronglu's nephew) talk about the bronze hammer that Xu Yanzhao held in the play "Er Jin Gong" (Xu Yanzhao made no great contributions to the royal family, so this hammer was probably a relic of King Zhongshan). It still exists in the world. Mr. Rong had seen it twice. It is said that this treasure is now kept in the home of a Mr. Xu in Dongjiaominxiang. This Mr. Xu is a descendant of Xu Yanzhao, and he held a high official position in the Qing Dynasty. His mansion also has a portrait of Xu Da, the founding hero of the Ming Dynasty, as well as many other relics. My ancestral home is Xuzhou, and I not only share the same surname as Xu Da, but he also served as a wise magistrate in my hometown. Ma Lianliang's newly arranged "String of Dragon Pearls" is a disguised version of "Xu Da Rebels Against Xuzhou." Because of the above reasons, I wanted to ask Mr. Rong to introduce me to the Xu mansion to appreciate these treasures. If I could get the owner's consent, I would also like to take some pictures and publish them in newspapers and books for the public to enjoy. That would be a very interesting thing. Later, because I went south in a hurry, I put this matter aside. Now, I feel very sorry about it and can only wait until I go north again in the future to complete this task.

When Duanfang first took office as Governor of Hubei, two of my fellow villagers served under him in that province. One was Huang Boyu, who had served as the Hubei Judicial Commissioner, and the other was Xu Hecheng, who was in his staff. According to these two, Duanfang was very fond of antiques and also very interested in opera. Later, when he acted as Governor-General of Huguang, he would gather famous opera performers to perform during the New Year holidays. Xia Yueheng, the elder brother of Xia Yuerun, even abandoned his career as an actor to become his martial arts constable, which shows how much he loved opera performers. Once, he obtained the wellhead into which Madam Mi threw herself in "Changbanpo." He was very proud of it, saying that this thing was very valuable to preserve. If there had been no well that buried the loyal and righteous Madam Mi, then Zhao Zilong, no matter how brave and invincible he was, would have died in the chaotic army. Imagine a million Cao soldiers trapping him at the heart of the battle, Zilong alone having to take care of both A Dou and the arrow-wounded Madam Mi. As a general, he had to give his warhorse to Madam Mi to ride, fight on foot, how could he possibly repel a million troops? As a result, the lives of these three people and a horse would have all died at the hands of Cao's soldiers. If Liu Bei had lost this ever-victorious general, then the banquet at the Yellow Crane Tower, the marriage proposal by Dong Wu, the interception of A Dou, and even the rescue of the camp and the retreat of Sima Yi by the empty city strategy, so many important and urgent events would not have had anyone else to handle and resolve. I am afraid that Liu Xuande would not have succeeded as King of Hanzhong, let alone be able to call himself emperor in Chengdu and share the world with Wei and Wu. Like Liu Chan, that little rascal, would not have been able to enjoy the glory of being a king for decades, messing things up with Huang Hao. From this point of view, the well in "Changbanpo" was indeed a treasure of Liu Bei and his son. Even Madam Mi's loyalty and Zhao Zilong's courage were all made possible by this well. Later, Duanfang was sent abroad as one of the five ministers. After returning to China, he was promoted to Governor-General of Liangjiang and brought the well to Nanjing. When he was transferred to Sichuan and killed on the way, the whereabouts of the wellhead became unknown.

### Finance: A Surge of Limit-Price Sellers; Cash Falls by Seven Yuan

Yesterday, the cash futures market fluctuated greatly. The situation was still unstable. Initially, the price dropped by ten yuan because the price of British pure gold plummeted. Later, the price once approached the 2,000 yuan mark due to a sudden surge in buying interest from securities firms. However, due to the large number of sellers with a limit price of 2,000 yuan, coupled with a certain gold shop taking advantage of the high price to sell off, and the fact that securities firms such as De Fu and Jinbang were selling off their long positions, the market suddenly lacked buyers. The price then fell sharply, eventually dropping by seven yuan. The morale of the long position holders was shaken. Trading was relatively active, with around 500 taels traded in the morning. There was no trading in the afternoon. However, since the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on trading were discovered, jewelers have been uneasy and seem to be blocking news about market transactions, which is extremely unwise.

Cash Futures Eager to Sell

Since yesterday morning, the cash futures market has been very eager to sell off. Initially, the market was sideways due to the sudden sharp rise in the price of British pure gold. However, due to the eagerness of many to sell off, the price was lowered from 1,995 yuan to below 90 yuan. At 9:30, the Qian Dui firm entered the market and bought 50 taels from a gold shop at a price of 1,987 yuan, a drop of ten yuan from the previous day's price. Then, Ran Jin bought another 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of 90 yuan (both said to be buying on behalf of Hong Kong firms). After that, Hong Kong firms entrusted a certain gold shop and a certain jeweler to absorb a large amount, causing the market to suddenly feel like demand exceeded supply. Therefore, the price rose sharply. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a cash shop on behalf of Hong Kong firms at a price of 95 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 50 taels from a fellow firm on behalf of Hong Kong firms at a price of 98 yuan, and another 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of 99 yuan, which was the highest price. In between, sellers with a limit price of 2,000 yuan were enthusiastic, so the upward momentum stopped abruptly. Gold shops also suddenly came out to sell heavily, and securities firms also sold off their long positions at the same time. As a result, the underlying trend turned weak. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a fellow firm at a price of 96 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 95 yuan, and another 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 93 yuan. A gold shop also sold 40 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 92.5 yuan, and another 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 92 yuan. Finally, a Qian Dui firm did a mutual transaction of 50 taels at a price of 91 yuan as the afternoon close. In the afternoon, because there was no foreign exchange market, morale was sluggish. It was heard that buyers were bidding 89 yuan, but there were no sellers, so there was no trading. Compared to the afternoon close, the price had fallen by six yuan. The cash shops were selling gold with their own brand for 2,000 yuan and buying it back for 1,985 yuan. The current gold standard price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was no trading.

Ornamental Gold Lowered by One Yuan

The initial selling price of jeweler's gold ornaments did not change. Later, it was heard that cash futures had weakened. At 10 am, the price was lowered by one yuan. Datonghang changed its listed price to 202 yuan, and Xintonghang changed its listed price to 200 yuan, buying back at 194 yuan.

Pure Gold Falls Even More Sharply

London, June 6th: Because the British pound rose sharply after being maintained, the price of British pure gold also continued to fall. The price fell sharply by seven shillings per ounce, reaching £7 9s 6d. The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also fell to 1,222.05 yuan. The listed customs gold also fell sharply by one cent, reaching 2 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold standard price also fell by 4.7 yuan, reaching 1,215.7 yuan.

### International Exchange Rates Suddenly Surge; Foreign Exchange Rates Go from Loose to Tight; It All Depends on Supply and Demand

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a sudden surge in international exchange rates. The price of the pound against the pound rose sharply by 3.75, and the price of the dollar against the pound rose sharply by 2.8125, resulting in a situation where the pound was tight and the dollar was loose. However, the trend in the middle was first loose and then tight, depending largely on buying and selling. Initially, the market was loose due to foreign telegrams selling off. Then, Jardine Matheson, Asiatic Petroleum, and Japanese foreign firms rushed to buy in, and the bank's buying interest improved, leading to a tighter market. Trading was quite active in the morning.

In the early morning, the London large cable, both near and far, shrank. The New York spot market still had prices but no market. The London spot gold price shrank by seven shillings. The exchange rate of the pound against the dollar rose sharply by 3.75, the rate against the franc rose by 56 centimes, and the rate against Shanghai was flat. The price of the dollar against the pound rose sharply by 2.8125, the rate against the franc rose by one cent, and the rate against Shanghai rose by five cents. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's early spot selling prices were 8 pence 515625 for the pound and 16.59375 yuan for the dollar, which was 0.015625 tighter for the pound and 0.09375 cheaper for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, the bank's buying interest was thin, and there were many telegrams pouring in from Hong Kong, Manila, and other places, causing the capital position to be too much in excess of demand for a time. Therefore, the underlying trend gradually loosened. The pound could be settled at 8 pence 53125, and the dollar at 16.625 yuan. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed price was announced, it remained flat. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it continued to fall by 75. After that, the situation gradually tightened due to the sudden surge in buying interest from Western firm Jardine Matheson, coupled with the strong buying interest from Japanese banks, and the sudden increase in settlements by Asiatic Petroleum. Moreover, banks were unwilling to sell at low prices. The bank's buying price was 16.5625 yuan for the dollar, and it was difficult to settle the pound at 8 pence and a half. Near noon, foreign telegrams became active in selling off, causing the market to return to flat. At the afternoon close, the pound was at 8 pence and a half, and the dollar was at 16.53125 yuan, with the pound being 0.03125 tighter and the dollar being 0.03125 stronger compared to the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Below are the details of the transactions that took place during the half day:

### Less Demand for Cash; Discount Rate Falls Close to the 30 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell sharply. This was mainly because the Lunar New Year holidays were over, the demand for cash was less, and the stability of the financial system was more obvious. Speculators had nothing to speculate on and released funds, causing the price per 1,000 yuan to fall close to the 30 yuan mark. There were still few who discounted cash. In the early morning, the price was low at 38 yuan. It soon fell step by step, reaching only 33 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the market felt even more unsustainable and fell further to 30.05 yuan. Finally, due to some discount buying at a low price, the price rose back to 32.5 yuan, but it was still more than 6 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Large Cables Show Mixed Fluctuations

London, June 6th: Speculators bought long-term contracts, but there were very few suppliers. The silver market was still flat. The closing price was also flat. The near-term price of large cable silver continued to shrink by 125, while the far-term price returned to the highest point of 1875. New York Silver Cables: The price of American silver still had prices but no market. Bombay Silver Cables: The spot price of Indian silver continued to shrink by four annas, the near-term price shrank by five annas, and the far-term price also shrank by four annas.

### England Continues Gold Trading; Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Decline

Yesterday, the British pure order continued to fall by seven shillings, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 2.75. Because the Bank of England restricted foreign currency and gold trading in order to maintain the pound's parity, the price of pure gold fell sharply. Speculators, after this crackdown, feared that the price of pure gold would continue to fall and that it would be difficult to rise. This measure is very beneficial to our country's financial future. Because after the price of gold rose, people hoarded cash, which hindered the promotion of legal tender and the prohibition of nationalization of gold. Moreover, some parties intentionally destroyed legal tender and sought private gain. Although foreign exchange rates were released due to foreign telegrams, banks' buying interest was still strong. The trend was that the pound was tight and the dollar was loose. Cash futures were occasionally collected by Guangdong firms, but retail sales were continuous, so the fluctuations were still small. As the price of gold fell, the foreign currency rate tended to decline slightly. There were very few transactions in the guild. Only Bao Cheng sold US dollar drafts for 1,000 yuan to Tong Feng. Yesterday's market prices were: the British gold pound fell by 3 jiao, the British gold draft fell by 5 fen, the American gold pound fell by 4 jiao, the American gold draft fell by 1 fen and 5 li, the French franc draft fell by 1 li, the Singapore dollar draft fell by 1 fen, and the rupee draft fell by 1 fen. Other currencies did not change.

### Securities Arbitrage Moves to Government Bonds Again; London Foreign Debt Market Quiet

The informal securities market saw a quiet day yesterday. Most operators were taking a wait-and-see approach, awaiting developments in the situation. Buying and selling were not active. Rumors circulated that the new Japanese cabinet's policy toward China would follow the old Konoestyle, causing increased uncertainty. However, due to the extremely low interest in foreign exchange arbitrage, many capitalists were shifting their focus to investing in government bonds. Any slight new development in the environment would surely attract a large number of investors. Yesterday morning, Tien Seng and Tung Kong were mostly buyers, while Shieh Dah was the only seller, leading to price discrepancies due to differing approaches. In the afternoon, Number Eleven was buying, while Number Forty-Six was selling, causing a slight rebound in market prices. Due to the weekend, afternoon trading was extremely light, with total transactions estimated at no more than 400,000 yuan. As a result, market prices rebounded by 2 to 4 jiao. A brief table is provided below.

Regarding stock market prices, 200 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded yesterday, with 100 shares at 35 yuan 8 jiao and another 100 shares at 36 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. There were no other transactions. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, since its reorganization the year before last, has had a strong capital base and a thriving business. After August 13th, it suffered a sudden blow, and the losses were also very large. The Hong Kong and Guangdong regions were greatly affected. However, last year, the company's management made every effort to reorganize. In the abnormal development of this city, sales were huge, mainly inland sales. With the fall of Hankou, the company relocated, so the sales and profits in Yunnan and other places have become the company's mainstay. It is said that the total profit for the 27th year reached as high as two million several hundred thousand yuan. If it can continue to develop this year, there is hope that the stock will pay dividends.

Chung Wo Industrial Co., Ltd. convened a board meeting the day before yesterday to review the account books for last year (1938) and discuss the distribution plan. The plan will be implemented after it is submitted to the sixth shareholders' meeting on the 23rd of this month for approval. The company's profit last year was 391,814.27 yuan in national currency. Adding the 517,155.16 yuan in national currency carried over from the previous session, the total was 908,969.53 yuan in national currency. After deducting the 36,000.00 yuan in national currency for underwriting commissions for company bonds, a dividend of 1 fen 5 li per week will be distributed, totaling 270,000.00 yuan in national currency (based on a paid-up share capital of 1,800,000.00 yuan in national currency). The remaining 602,969.53 yuan in national currency will be carried over to the next session.

London Chinese Foreign Debt: Market prices listed on the 6th of this month (Friday) were quiet. Only the Crisp Loan rebounded by half a pound, priced at 37 pounds. The rest remained flat. There was no telegraphic transfer of physical goods to Shanghai.

### Grain: Spot Flour Dealers Wait and See; Little Wheat Trading Due to Mutual Rejection

There was no improvement in spot flour trading yesterday. Customers were waiting and seeing. The Northern Gang, after making some purchases once the market opened, are currently shipping them. There are few new transactions. The Southern Gang is also just going through the motions. Total market transactions, excluding retail sales in this street, amounted to 8,000 bags. Customer sales were only slightly more than 10,000 bags. The mill's price for Number Two flour remained at 4 yuan 9 jiao. The market will have to wait until next week. As for exports, 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou today (the 8th).

There was not much wheat arriving yesterday. Only two to three thousand bags arrived by rail. Owners insisted on their prices, citing difficulties in shipping to Shanghai. Mills, on the other hand, were reluctant and intended to lower prices. As a result, the two sides found it difficult to reach an agreement, and transactions decreased sharply. The total market saw only 3,000 bags of wheat from North Jiangsu and Puchen sold, with Fuhsin Mill buying 2,000 bags and Fufeng Mill buying 1,000 bags. The highest price was 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. The market remained stable. Another 1,300 bags of wheat arrived from Hsinking.

### Little High-Grade Nanking Rice Arriving

Yesterday, customer demand for high-grade Nanking rice was very strong. However, apart from rice from Wuhu, Nanking rice arrivals were becoming increasingly scarce. Yesterday, the price of high-grade Nanking rice in the big market reached 10 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Special high-grade Chongbu rice was not available due to lack of stock. A small amount of stock was offered at 10 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen, but no transaction was made. High-grade Wuhu rice had also risen to 10 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen. A total of 1,500 bags were sold through customs, with prices rising by 7 to 8 fen to 1 jiao 5 fen.

### Rice Stockpiling Period Ends; Sales of Rice from All Quarters are Active

Yesterday, no national rice arrived from Hexia. Seven to eight thousand bags arrived this round, including 1,530 bags from Neihupu. Sales were brisk due to the approach of the winter storage period. Purchases by local merchants and hoarders were smooth. Sales of Baozi rice were also flourishing. The goods were sold out in an instant, and the prices continued to rise. As a result, thin Japonica rice all increased by 1 jiao. Sheyang Jian rice and Chongbu Jian rice also continued to rise by several fen, up to 1 jiao.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Wheat Bran Prices Continue to Rise

The wheat bran market continues to rise frequently. The market was still hovering yesterday morning. After people were selling, the market was excited, and the prices, under the tight shout of the cargo owners, turned open Fuhsing factory large package price of two yuan eight jiao, five points higher than the previous market. In the afternoon, the rising wind was still not a little bit but also 5 points, for two yuan eight corners and a half to close still pretty. According to people in the industry, the three-yuan mark is just around the corner. Today, there are 2,000 bags of wheat bran shipped to Shantou and 5,300 bags to Hsinking.

### Silk and Tea: Factory Silk Sold to Europe; This Year's Geng Silk May Prosper

Since the New York raw silk statistics were revealed, there was mention that last month's raw silk inventories increased by 7,000 piculs and consumption decreased by 6,400 piculs, so raw silk prices in both Japan and the United States are trending downward. The market situation has suddenly turned sluggish. Yesterday, only 20 piculs of factory silk were traded on the New York Exchange. According to Westerners in the Shanghai silk market, this year's Chefoo silk sales to the US may be significantly inferior, because last year, American people boycotted Japanese lower-grade raw silk, and purchased a large amount of Chinese white filature. However, the quality of Chefoo silk was not consistent last year, leading to an unfavorable impression among American users, which will affect this year's Chefoo silk exports. It is also said that this year's Shanghai 7-8 fen white filature silk can be quite prosperous, due to the impact of US anti-aggression and sympathy for China's war of resistance. Therefore, in terms of raw silk quality, it is hoped that Shanghai manufacturers will conscientiously be conservative and not follow the footsteps of last year's Chefoo silk. Yesterday in Shanghai, there were no transactions with American firms, and sales to England and France were still good. Dafeng, Kaili, Baiduo and other firms purchased a total of over 100 bundles of white filature, and the price increased by 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous week.

### Yarn and Cotton: Over 20,000 Bales of Yao Yi Cotton Transacted; Selling Price Increased by Over One Yuan; Foreign Cotton Rarely Transacted Due to the Fixed Silver Issue; Overseas Market Conditions Soft Due to Excessive Cotton Inventory

White-baled cotton continues to dominate the cotton business. The reason is that most of the Indian cotton purchased by various mills is continuously arriving in Shanghai. It is difficult to make the yarn bright and unsuitable for customer sales if it is not mixed with bright white cotton. Therefore, it is the biggest reason for the competition among various mills to purchase it. Recently, the Tung Yih and Chung Hsin factories have been purchasing 10-count Dafah and Golden Rooster yarn from Yunnan and Shantou in large quantities, and the replenishment of this raw material is particularly strong. Therefore, a huge amount of Yao Yi cotton, totaling 21,000 bales, was purchased yesterday, with the price increasing by more than one yuan. Sixty-three and a half of which are replenishment prices. Shen Hsin Factory slightly needs fine velvet cotton, and also purchased 200 bales of Brazilian cotton, which are used for spinning 32-count raw materials, but Japanese factories still have no intention of activity, because they have been purchasing US and Indian cotton in large quantities for days, and they have absolutely no intention of touching the high-priced Chinese cotton, so the market atmosphere is also restrained by it, otherwise the rising power would be even better. The source is still scarce. Five hundred and ten bales of Changyinsha straw bales and seven hundred and seventy-seven cloth bales arrived at the dock. There is no news of Tongzhou cotton arriving. It is reported that 12,800 bales of Yao cotton arrived and were sold out, which shows how hot the sales are. Yesterday, 530 pieces came from North Sha and 370 pieces from Baimao. Today, 545 pieces are exported to Shantou and 260 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of spot cotton traded and the market price are listed on the left.

Market prices for foreign cotton fabrics: The New York market is constantly in a state of panic. When President Roosevelt's brother's decisive message was released, people were very excited. Unexpectedly, after the budget plan was released, enthusiasm suddenly decreased. The government's budget for this year's expenses is much larger than in previous years, and the government's finances are not as able to balance income and expenditure as generally expected. That is, under the cotton loan items for several years, the national treasury has loaned as much as 650 million gold yuan. It is reported that the government intends to increase some taxes. Recently, someone in Washington suggested that the government adopt a five-year cotton industry plan to gradually sell the 12 million bales of cotton stored under the loan within this period, thereby restoring the government's financial normalcy. At the same time, it ordered the reduction of 7 million acres of cotton fields, strictly ordering that the total amount of cotton fields should not exceed 27 million acres, so that cotton production would decrease, and loan cotton could be sold at a good price. At the same time, it would not cause cotton prices to fall too sharply due to the large-scale sale of government loans. This method is very good, and the government may adopt it and provide it for discussion in Congress. However, most of the views are that it is difficult for other cotton prices to improve if government loan cotton is sold on the market, so many people are taking profits, and the New Orleans market is also selling out in New York. The market price is therefore not prosperous. Yesterday, the father fell more than ten pounds, and the Indian market fell by more than one rupee. Egypt rose by three or five pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was not very different, and the legal tender, US cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton each fell by three corners per picul, and Egyptian cotton rose by four corners per picul.

The foreign cotton transaction in this city is very active. Since China Yong purchased foreign cotton, foreign merchants are also very panicked. Foreign merchants have been meeting for days to discuss countermeasures. The 500 bales of Brazilian cotton purchased by Shen Hsin the day before yesterday, the factory did not pay a penny of fixed silver, but the foreign merchant falsely claimed that the compradors paid the money. In fact, the foreign merchants themselves are also rubbing each other from time to time. If each Chinese factory refuses to purchase for two weeks, the foreign cotton firms will abandon the saying that Chinese factories need to prepay fixed silver. Japanese factories are still the main buyers of foreign cotton, and they must purchase two or three thousand bales every day. The prices are still firm inside and outside of the country.

### Cotton Yarn Inspection is Quite Strict

In eastern Zhejiang, the authorities are more stringent in inspecting import and export goods. According to Ningbo sources, the 20-count Red Kuixing yarn produced by the Chung Tah Sheng yarn factory in the Nantong occupied area is not allowed to be imported. However, if it is produced by a certain factory in Shanghai in cooperation with Japanese merchants, it was not allowed to be imported at first, but now it is allowed to pass. I don't know why.

Cotton transactions may have a very large turn. The amount of transactions and spot market prices are listed below.

### Daily Situation is Getting Better; Cotton Yarn is Getting Stronger and Stronger; Each Jump is 5, 6, 7, or 8 Yuan Different

The yarn market is tightening, and the rising wind is getting stronger and stronger, and the atmosphere is very exciting. The atmosphere is due to the prosperity of customer sales, and the purchasing power in the south is particularly strong, and it is continuous throughout the day. Because the domestic demand in eastern Zhejiang is becoming smoother every day, the goods on the market are gradually sold out. In this active actual sales, the factory took the opportunity to sell a lot, so that the factory inventory is dry. The idea of absorption by the same industry and hoarders is even stronger. In this environment, the yarn market will of course get better and better every day. However, some old bulls who have suffered extremely high risks in the past are gradually unloading. The situation in the market yesterday morning was that a certain bank raised the price of 20-count Shuangma and collected 100-200 bales in the afternoon. With this news spreading, people were shocked and unanimously bullish. In addition, customer sales did not stop, and buying was still frequent, and the opening price jumped by three or four yuan. Then, as buyers became more crowded, the factory was unwilling to sell, and the market situation became tighter and tighter, jumping another two or three yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in the morning totaled 2,050 bales, and the transactions in the afternoon totaled 280 bales, totaling 2,330 bales. As a result, the price of 20-count Te Jin Cheng rose by 8 yuan, Shuang Di Qiu rose by 7 yuan, Tian Nu rose by 5 yuan and a half, Shuang Ma rose by 7 yuan, and Mu Yang rose by 5 yuan and a half. The price of 10-count and 16-count group yarn all rose by 3-4 yuan. The factory opened 100 pieces of 20-count Te Jin Cheng from Yong An factory, priced at 380 yuan, and 500 bales of 20-count Shuang Di Qiu from Xin Yu factory, priced at 370-71 yuan, and 150 bales of 10-count Bao Yi from Hong Zhang factory, priced at 282 yuan. Today, 680 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Shantou and 93 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.

Although the sales of Japanese yarn are not smooth, the market price continues to move forward, driven by Chinese yarn
The rally was so strong that it was pulled up by it, but the distant price at the close of the session fell back by a small yuan. The current price of 20-count Shui Yue yarn is 306.5 yuan, and the price for this month is 306-04.5 yuan. The current price of 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 304.5 yuan, and the price for this month is 304-03 yuan.

### US Cotton Weekend Statistics

New York, 7th, The one-week statistics of US cotton from August 1st to January 6th are as follows:

### Northern and Southern Goods: Those Who Like to Bite Melon Seeds Rejoice; Both Black and White are Expensive

White melon seeds from Henan are scarce because of transportation difficulties. The goods sold on the market are mostly from Luhe. There is a need for those who come from the mainland in this street. The large slices are dry and the color is good. Good goods are sold to 27-8 yuan, and ordinary ones are 22-3 yuan.

Black melon seeds in the market are still thin, so the trend is upright and beautiful. Companies such as the Guazi Company in this street absorb more, and there are also some going to export. Yesterday, Xing Pan Xu Kui seeds were sold for 34 yuan, Tushan seeds were 32-3 yuan, Dalian seeds were 24-5 yuan, and Jiaozhou seeds were sold for 65-71-2 yuan per yard. Today, there are 300 sentences of raw kernels transported to Shantou, and another 200 packages transported to Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Scallop Sales Still Dominated by Eastern Goods

The source of Yantai scallops is rare, so the bottom stock here is thin. However, most of the scallops sold in the market are probably Eastern goods, because their goods are fat, large and tender, while the national product is yellow and small. Recently, it is sold for 235 yuan, but only dots in between. It is said that Eastern goods must be sold for 280 yuan.

### Star Anise is Profitable, Indirectly Procured from Hong Kong

Star anise was once lacking in spot goods, and the market situation has repeatedly expanded. The highest price reached 115 yuan. Later, the insiders seemed to feel that there was a profit to be made, so they indirectly procured it from Hong Kong, resulting in more and more arrivals every day. It is reported that the most recent quotation is only 87.5 yuan, which has fallen by more than ten yuan compared with the former, but sales are weak, and it seems to have a tired momentum.

### Medicinal Materials: Sichuan Citrus Aurantium Offers New Products; Market Situation is Expected to Stabilize

Sichuan Citrus Aurantium, once due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of goods was almost cut off. Between September and October, each load was sold for as much as 3,600 yuan. Later, postal parcels continued to arrive, and the market price gradually returned to low. Until recently, the new goods have been seen on the market, and the source has not been interrupted. The market is currently selling for only 1,600 yuan. It has been found that procurement is still strong in various places, and its momentum is expected to stabilize.

### Piece Goods: Strict Inspection in the Mainland; National Factory Cloths Searched More Widely; Most of the Bookings for January and February are Thrown Out; Dongbi Dye Blankets are Very Popular in This Street

The situation of national cloth continues to be firm and expensive, and most of the selling prices have risen. The rising wind of thin cloth and thin twill is the most violent, but the green Hunan and Jiangxi gangs purchased in large quantities, gathered at the ports of Wen, Ningbo and Taizhou. The Shaoxing gang also purchased strongly, transshipping through Ningbo. The Zhuang customers of the Gan Nan Chang gang also purchased in large quantities, transshipping through Wenzhou. Because the inspection in the mainland is strict, the products of famous manufacturers are searched more urgently. The factory's goods bottom is empty, and the opening price is increasing step by step. Customers also bid to purchase, and thin cloth and thin twill each rose by another 1-2.5 corners per piece. Lun Chang blue cloth, printed cloth and satin rose by 1-2 corners, and color cloth and color twill from various factories also rose by 1 corner. Coarse cloth is still sold at the original price, and the spot sales are constant. The Tianjin gang has purchased more than 100 boxes of Andian blue cloth such as Butterfly brand, which has not been enough. The Ningbo and Shaoxing gangs have purchased 100 pieces of thin cloth, thin twill, coarse cloth, color cloth, and printed satin. Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui customers have absorbed more than 200 pieces of goods for hoarding and spot packaging. The transaction in this street is mainly based on booked blank cloths, and most of the fabrics for January and February produced by each factory, such as taffeta, satin, printed cloth, and twill, have been thrown out. There are few in March, and the forward price has also risen by several corners due to the sharp rise in yarn money and raw materials.

The market situation of Dongbi white goods continues to rise, step by step. Yesterday, the selling price of high-end thin cloth has exceeded 11 yuan, and the quotations for Longtou, Caiqiu and Yanghe are all 11 yuan 5 fen, which is 1 corner and 5 fen higher per piece than the previous day's price. The price of thin twill rose by 5 fen to 1 corner. The Longtou, Caiqiu, Yanghe, Laba, Lanji and other brands of thin cloth and Longtou, Feiyu, Wufu, Shuangyu, Baobei and other brands of thin twill sold by various foreign firms totaled more than 2,000 pieces by the same industry. Because the dyeing blankets in this street are becoming more and more popular, the compensation of various color cloth numbers is more urgent, and the price is gradually raised. The dyeing industry in the entire Japanese street also absorbed about 2,000 pieces of various brands of blankets. Tianjin Yanqing and other gangs each imported 100-200 pieces. It is heard that there are 1,200 pieces in the market that are mutually thrown and made by the market's thoughts and businesses. The prosperity of the market is the first day since the market opened.

The export today is 147 pieces to Shantou, and 5 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Interlayer Overcoat Wool: English Goods are the Most Expensive

Recently, because the weather is very cold, the business of Chinese-style interlayer overcoats is very prosperous, so the general foreign clothing gangs have a special interest in purchasing riding breeches, covert coatings and Choclateens.

Riding breeches

Recently, the black and white colors of No. 30 are still the most expensive, and the English-made 1005 and Kongshi No. 100 are even more popular. The current wholesale price per yard is 13 yuan in national currency. If it is not black and white, it is sold for 9.8 yuan, Kongshi for 12.5 yuan, and black and white for 16 yuan. The supply of Dong goods is still sufficient, so the rise and fall of black and white colors is only a few corners. Yongkang 1005 sells for 7.9 yuan, Yongkang for 6 yuan net, and other low-end yarn fabrics sell for 4 yuan up and down, and the market is very dull. Yihua and Zhanghua sold for 7.25 yuan each.

Covert coating

Also called camel skin brocade, it is popular because the English New Years head number goods are so sleek. Yihua and Shenzhi are second, and Dong goods have not risen much. The popular color is bald and dull. Yesterday, English-made covert coating bald and dull colors had to be sold for 14 yuan, and other colors sold for 13 yuan, which is still very lacking. Yihua goods have risen to 10 yuan (according to the initial sale of only 8.5 yuan), Dong goods Bin number is 8.25 yuan, and No. 2 is 7.6 yuan.

Choclateens

Most of the English-made first-class goods sell for 12.5 yuan, and Dong goods sell for 6.5 yuan and zero cuts for 7.5 yuan. Most of them do not distinguish between expensive and cheap colors, because their market sales are not as popular as covert coatings and riding breeches.

### Sugar Market: Over 1,000 Packages of Blue and Red Sugar Opened

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was firm. The guild allocated the market, and the spot price of 24 coarse white sand was 24 yuan 4 jiao, the price of the warehouse goods was 24 yuan 5 jiao, the price of Taikinqian Mai was 24 yuan 7 jiao, and the price of Taikoo heavy white B Mai was 24 yuan, all with no significant rise or fall. A general Chao gang opened 400 packages of ordinary Shantou red sugar, priced at 13.5-13.3 yuan, 600 packages of Chaoqing sugar, priced at 12-11.7 yuan, 112 packages of Diaoqing sugar, priced at 11.2 yuan, and the number of Shangpai Zhengmian red sugar still costs 15.5 yuan. There are not many numbers in stock, and the market may reach a high level.

### Coal: Indian Coal is More Promising

Indian bituminous coal, which was previously fatigued due to excess arrivals, had a falling selling price, but since the beginning of the year, due to the cold weather, both the mainland and this street have a taste for it, and the price has risen slightly. Fellow traders deal in bulk and zero dismantling at 41 yuan per ton, and the price of warehouse receipts is 4-5 jiao to 1 yuan different. The retail price for direct customers is about 14 yuan, which is much better than last month.

### Imports and Exports: Most of the Exports are Food

Today (the 8th), there are 600 packages of food such as beans shipped to Shantou, and 1,810 packages shipped to Hong Kong. There are also 52 pieces of soybean oil shipped to Hong Kong. As for fertilizers, 5,000 pieces of soybean cakes are shipped to Shantou, and 52 pieces of tung oil are transported to Hong Kong.

###鍛鍊我們的身體
— 君朋

——有了健全的身體才有偉大的事業——

諸位：都是未來的主人翁，所以你們大家都應該負起建國救國的責任，允其現在正是「抗戰建國的一的時候，對於鍛鍊我們的身體，實在不容一刻緩了：你不看見列强各國軍備競爭的狂熱嗎？但是他們雖然是强盛之邦，科學昌明，財力寬裕，民智發建，還是很努力地鍛鍊國民的身體，以備將來禦侮保國衛民之用。返觀祖國屢遭侵略，至今日又在抗戰奮鬭中的中國人民，却毫不注意自己的身體，我覺得非常遺憾憾，小朋友，速即覺醒呀！

「有了健全的身體，才有偉大的事業。」這確是金科玉律的話，你小看見住在上海收容所裏的許多兒童，因爲給養的不足，就有不少的兒童，爲了生病而致死，恐怕這「死亡率」的數字很可驚吧！倘使這許多死去的兒童，不受到逃難的痛苦，也許不會死掉，說不定他們都有偉大的事業，前程無量。一方面是遭到惡劣環境的原因，一方面也是自己身體太弱的緣故，病菌的侵入，完全基於身體不健全而不能抵抗病菌所致。那沒死去的兒童，便是證明他們的身體，一定是比死去的兒實强健，你們以爲如何？「强國先强種，强種要强身，强身須體育。」體育，中國提倡了好久，但是成績何在？我們記得出席世運時，歸來只有〇分，道是丟臉的事！也可以知道我國的體育太幼稚了！我們太不努力了！果然也是未經合理的倡導，和一般社會人士的忽略，佔着重大的原因。體育的功效；對於個人，可以使虛弱身體，逐漸銀鍊成强健而有爲；對於國家民族，更能建立一偭强盛的國家，健全的民族。

小朋友！你們愛運動嗎？運動是使我們的肌肉，堅實而發達，由發達而充實，由充實而健全。尤其我們小朋友，正當身體發育的黃金時代，應該特別努力！否則，如果不能獲到圓滿的發育，那末，國家民族的前途，是非常憂慮的。你們一面必須讀書，一面也要努力運動，你們的父母師長一定會前來指導的。不過，我們「讀書的時候用功讀書，運動的時候努力運動。」强國是基於强民，强健的人民，才可以負起建國救國的重大的責任，最後我們要高呼：趕快「鍛鍊我們的身體！」小朋友！醒醒吧！起來努力呀！努力呀！

### 成績單
— 淺笑

小朋友們！你們的學校快要放寒假了罷。當老師把本學期的成績單發給你的時候，你作何感想？

如果你的成績惡劣，有幾種功課不及格，你接到了成績單，羞愧得面紅耳赤，同時，對着被老師獎勵的同學，有嫉妬的心理。羞愧是應該的，你要羞愧，並且自責過去的不肯努力；但是別去嫉妬用功的同學，你自己喪失獎勵的機會啊。

如果你的成績優良，心裏很覺愉快，對於被老師譴責的同學，輕視或是譏笑。愉快是應該的，努力半載，有這樣的收穫，自然「心花怒放」。可是不要輕視或譏笑那些怠惰的同學，應該勉勵他們。

我知道小朋友們的脾氣，拿到了滿意的成績單，回到家中，往往不等家長詢問，就笑嘻嘻地把成績單給家長看。成績不好的小朋友，把一張成績單塞在書包裹，「沒精打采」地回家，不作一聲，當作沒有這件事一樣，直等家長討着看，方纔從書包裹慢慢地找出來，側着臉丟在家長的手裏。

「往者不追，來者猶可及」。「失敗是成功之母。無論那一位小朋友，要有在下學期裏格外努力的决心。現在成續好的，切勿自滿；成績壞的，快向家長老實承認過去的錯誤，更勉勵自己，求學業的進步。

### Temper Our Bodies

— Jun Peng

——Only with a sound body can we have a great career——

Everyone: You are all masters of the future, so you should all take on the responsibility of building and saving the nation. Since now is the time for "resistance and nation-building," tempering our bodies cannot be delayed for even a moment. Don't you see the craze for military competition among the powers? But even though they are strong nations, with advanced science, ample financial resources, and well-developed public intelligence, they still work hard to temper the bodies of their citizens in preparation for defending the country and protecting the people in the future. Looking back at our motherland, which has been repeatedly invaded, and the Chinese people who are now fighting in the war of resistance, yet pay no attention to their bodies, I feel very regretful. Children, wake up quickly!

"Only with a sound body can we have a great career." This is indeed a golden rule. Don't you see the many children living in the Shanghai shelters, who, due to insufficient supplies, have many children die from illness? I'm afraid the numbers for this "mortality rate" are alarming! If these many dead children had not suffered the pain of fleeing, perhaps they would not have died. Perhaps they all had great careers and unlimited futures. On the one hand, it is caused by the bad environment, and on the other hand, it is because their bodies are too weak. The invasion of germs is entirely due to unhealthy bodies that cannot resist germs. The children who did not die are proof that their bodies must be stronger than the children who died. What do you think? "A strong nation must first have a strong race, a strong race must have a strong body, and a strong body must have physical education." Physical education has been promoted in China for a long time, but what are the results? We remember that when we attended the World Games, we only came back with 0 points, which is an embarrassing thing! It can also be seen that our country's physical education is too immature! We haven't worked hard enough! It is also true that the lack of reasonable advocacy and the neglect of the general public are major reasons. The effect of physical education; for individuals, it can gradually train a weak body into a strong and promising one; for the nation, it can build a strong country and a healthy nation.

Children! Do you love sports? Exercise makes our muscles firm and developed, from development to enrichment, and from enrichment to health. Especially for us children, who are in the golden age of physical development, we should work especially hard! Otherwise, if we cannot achieve full development, then the future of the country and the nation is very worrying. You must study on the one hand, and also work hard to exercise on the other hand. Your parents and teachers will definitely come to guide you. However, we "study hard when we study, and work hard when we exercise." A strong country is based on a strong people, and only a strong people can take on the important responsibility of building and saving the nation. Finally, we must shout: Hurry up and "temper our bodies!" Children! Wake up! Get up and work hard! Work hard!

### Report Card
— Qian Xiao

Children! Your schools will soon be on winter vacation. When the teacher gives you your report card for this semester, what are your thoughts?

If your grades are bad, and you fail in several subjects, when you receive your report card, you blush with shame. At the same time, you have feelings of jealousy towards classmates who are rewarded by the teacher. Shame is appropriate. You should be ashamed and blame yourself for not working hard in the past; but don't be jealous of hard-working classmates, you yourself lost the opportunity for reward.

If your grades are excellent, you feel very happy. You despise or ridicule classmates who are condemned by the teacher. Happiness is appropriate. After working hard for half a year, having such a harvest, you will naturally "bloom with joy." But don't despise or ridicule those lazy classmates, you should encourage them.

I know the temperaments of children. When they get a satisfactory report card, they often don't wait for their parents to ask, and they smilingly show the report card to their parents when they get home. Children with bad grades stuff a report card into their schoolbag and go home "listlessly," without saying a word, as if nothing happened, waiting for their parents to ask to see it before slowly taking it out of their schoolbag and throwing it into their parents' hands with their faces turned away.

"The past cannot be追, but the future can be caught up." "Failure is the mother of success." No matter which child you are, you must have the determination to work harder in the next semester. Those who are doing well now should not be complacent; those with bad grades should quickly confess their past mistakes to their parents and encourage themselves to seek academic progress.

### New Year Celebration Party

— Huai

Ahua and Lehua's home is so beautifully decorated today! At the gate, four large flower balls swing back and forth! The national flags are also solemnly displayed. The two lanterns bought during last year's Double Tenth Festival are also hung up today! Ahua is, after all, a bit older. The five large characters "New Year Celebration Party" above the gate are written with such vigor!

The ones greeting guests at the gate today aren't the two young hosts. It turns out that beside the red paper ball is also a lively parrot! It's especially happy today, and the newly learned phrase "Guests, please come in!" is even more melodious than usual.

A group of children, five girls and two boys, are all wearing new red and green clothes, holding hands, jumping and skipping, with wide smiles, as they arrive at Ailuo's house. Pin Fang, as a neighbor, leads the six children inside. The parrot above chirps seven times, indicating that every guest should be treated equally, without favoritism.

After a while, a total of nine people, including Ahua and Lehua, are seated around a round table covered with a white tablecloth. Ahua, as the host, is elected as the chairperson and stands up. She first asks everyone to put the candies they brought in front of them. The colorful candies adorning the snow-white tablecloth make it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. As they are eating happily and talking enthusiastically, one child notices a beggar child standing at the entrance of their venue. He exclaims in surprise, and all the children in the venue turn their curious gaze towards the pitiful child. However, Ahua and Pin Fang are stunned, as they believe that in today's environment, he is the most pitiful person! So Pin Fang eagerly suggests, "Everyone, look! This child is so pitiful! I propose that we invite him to join our celebration party!" The proposal is immediately approved by everyone, and they elect the chairperson to invite him in. At this moment, a knowing smile appears on the face of the pitiful child.

Pin Fang, who is the most resourceful, suggests inviting Ahua's mother to give a speech. After going to invite her, Ahua's mother comes downstairs without hesitation. As soon as she enters the venue, she sees a child in ragged clothes among the children. She is not surprised; she understands that this must be a manifestation of their pure compassion! Then she says the following:

"Children of the world, no one is greater than you! Without adult guidance, you were able to do something so valuable! Today, I wholeheartedly approve of what you are doing! However, I have another idea to contribute to you: from today onwards, please resolve to be thrifty and save money to help children as pitiful as this one. This way, your celebration party today will be the most valuable!"

"Clap, clap, clap..." The applause lasts for more than a minute. Finally, they all raise their glasses and drink a large glass of plain water!

### Smallpox and Vaccination

— Xi Huanghui

Children, if you just pay a little attention on the streets, you will surely see posters in red and green colors advocating for cowpox vaccination pasted on the utility poles at various important locations. At the same time, according to recent newspaper reports, smallpox is prevalent in the isolated island, and the mortality rate is quite high. The authorities are closely monitoring the situation.

Smallpox is a violent infectious disease. Once a person contracts smallpox, even if they are fortunate enough to survive, they will inevitably have a face full of pockmarks. A pockmarked face is so unsightly. In fact, although smallpox gives people such violent attacks, people also give it a fatal blow in advance, so that it does not have any vitality to erupt. To do this, there is absolutely no other way but to administer cowpox vaccination.

Cowpox was invented by the Englishman Jenner. The pustular fluid from cows is taken to make a vaccine, and then transplanted into people, which can prevent smallpox. Every time people get vaccinated with cowpox, if the result is good, they can be protected from smallpox for five to seven years. However, young children should be vaccinated once a year, and after they get older, about three more vaccinations will guarantee lifelong immunity to smallpox. The benefits of cowpox vaccination are obvious without saying more here.

However, after being vaccinated with cowpox, five things must be paid attention to: (1) Do not scratch with your hands when it itches, (2) Do not damage the pustules, (3) Pay attention to the cleanliness of clothes, (4) Do not do strenuous exercise, (5) Do not take a bath within a month after vaccination.

Children! The danger of smallpox and the benefits of vaccination, I think everyone already knows. To prevent pockmarks and death, hurry up and get vaccinated with cowpox!

Children's Corner

### One Year Older Again

— Cao Honghui, Fifth Grade Student of Fuchun Elementary School

Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, it is the New Year of the 28th year again, and I am one year older. Some people in the world, from childhood to adulthood, have done great things and made a career, seeking benefits for the public and benefiting the masses. Some are silent and unknown, some betray the country for personal gain, and some become thieves. This is all due to the lack of universal education.

But what methods should be used to correct these adverse effects! We should first think about children. Therefore, we educated children should have some knowledge. When the New Year comes, we should not blindly engage in meaningless games. Moreover, now is a time of crisis. Think about the children in the war zone, who are not warmly clothed, not fed enough, and their lives are so pitiful. We children living in the concessions should think about them and what methods to use to save them? I think during this New Year, we should save the money given to us by our parents and relatives and donate it, accumulating small amounts into large amounts, and help the children in need. At the same time, we can also take advantage of this holiday to review our lessons and work hard. When we are young, we should be able to endure hardship and cultivate good habits, so that we can serve society in the future. Only then can we children live up to being one year older.

### Refuse to Accept New Year Cards

— Cao Xing, Fifth Grade Student of Bugao Elementary School

Dear children, aren't you all welcome to receive New Year cards? But I also have many classmates who sent me New Year cards, mostly to congratulate me on my happiness. But I strongly disagree with this, so I returned the New Year cards they sent me unopened. I also wrote a letter to them with the following content: Dear classmate: I have returned the New Year card you sent me. There are two reasons why I returned it to you: First, we are currently in a time of national crisis, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles. Why don't we save the money for buying New Year cards and buy cotton clothes to donate to the soldiers on the front lines, to increase their fighting spirit. Second, now is the time of frugality. Save the money for New Year cards and use it to save our compatriots in distress. This is the biggest reason why I refuse to accept New Year cards.

### Crow

— Li Feiying, Ningbo Shanghai Third Elementary School

The crow is flying in the sky. He feels that he has reached the realm of unbearable. He is surrounded by deep darkness like a curtain, so that he can't see a ray of sunlight, but his hot blood is surging in every blood vessel. He demands to break through the curtain surrounding him.

Because he feels that time is not waiting for us. We must be kind to time. We must take advantage of our youth to rush forward, decide a victory or defeat, and find a bright path. But when he thought of this, he clamored. He made up his mind, and beat his wings a few times. He stretched his neck

long. He shouted in a very clear voice, while the hot blood has not dried up, drum up the courage, shout a struggle, and move forward.

However, he exhausted the strength of his wings. He does not feel tired, he does not feel difficult, everyone hurry up and rush out of the dark curtain. He shouted again, ah, now is our time! Now is our time!

Children's Free Drawing

### Winter

— Bao Yaofang, Sixth Grade Student of Minzhi Elementary School

The north wind howls,

White snow fills the courtyard.

The poor have no cotton clothes,

But the foreign dogs wear vests;

The faces of the poor are as white as snow,

The rich have bodies weighing hundreds of pounds;

The streets are wide and no one is seen,

Only the sound of moaning is heard!

### Small Toy

— Xu Lianlian, Sixth Grade Student of Minzhi Elementary School

Dear children, I'm here to introduce a small toy to you. The toy is very simple: Just have your younger brother and sister sit on all four sides of a square table in the evening, put a small metal pot in the middle of the table, put half a spoonful of salt in the pot, then pour half a spoonful of alcohol into it, and then turn off the lights, and use a match to light the alcohol in the small pot. The firelight emitted will allow you to see each other's faces turn scary and strange. After the alcohol is burned out, turn on the lights, and your faces will return to normal again. What is the reason for this? That is completely a chemical reaction. When you go to middle school to study chemistry, you will know the principle of this flame.

### New Year Dialogue

— Xinsheng

Son: The New Year is coming! Can Dad buy me a rabbit lantern to play with?

Father: Good boy, during this time of national crisis, we should think about thrift when buying anything. This kind of unnecessary toy can certainly be saved. It's better for me to tell you some common knowledge about rabbits.

Son: Okay! Okay! Please tell me!

Father: You must have seen rabbits. They are a type of small rodent. Based on the different environments in which they live, they can be divided into wild rabbits and domestic rabbits.

Son: Oh! I used to see many snow-white rabbits in the zoo. They were very cute. Aren't those wild rabbits?

Father: Now I will start talking about the types of rabbits. Listen quietly:

Wild rabbits (see Figure 1) are a type of rabbit that lives in forests and fields. Their body color is brownish-tea and mixed with gray. Their body length is about two feet and their ears are three inches long. Their forelimbs are quite short, and their hind limbs are half a foot long, so they are extremely fast when climbing hills, but because the forelimbs are short and the hind limbs are long, and the limbs are not balanced, they are not very fast when going downhill! They hide in caves or grass during the day and come out at night to forage for tree bark, leaves, buds, and vegetables. Sometimes they harm crops. Their meat is for food, but it is not very fresh. Their fur and skin are also widely used.

Son: Are domestic rabbits similar in shape to wild rabbits?

Father: Domestic rabbits were originally domesticated from wild rabbits. Their heads and ears are shorter than those of wild rabbits, and their hind limbs are not as long as those of wild rabbits. The most common is the ordinary domestic rabbit (see Figure 2). This rabbit is found everywhere. Its appearance varies slightly depending on the place of origin. It is said that this rabbit originated in Africa along the Mediterranean Sea. Its ears are long and its eyes are scarlet red! The body color is gray, yellow, black, white, and brown. Its meat can be eaten, and its fur and skin can be used as various materials. People raise it not only for food and entertainment, but also for cultivating pathogenic bacteria for medical purposes. In addition, there is the Angora rabbit (see Figure 3), which is the most famous wool rabbit. This rabbit originated in Angora, Turkey. Its body color is brown, white, blue, black, and several other colors. Its fur is four or five inches long, soft and silky, and its appearance is extremely gorgeous. For meat rabbits, the Flemish Giant breed is the most famous, weighing from thirteen pounds to twenty pounds! The next are the Normandy, Dutch, Japanese, and Belgian breeds. The Belgian breed (see Figure 4) is commonly raised. Its shape is very similar to a brown wild rabbit. It weighs about eight pounds. Its bones are thin, and its meat is abundant and tastes quite good. It can be regarded as the top of meat rabbits. This rabbit originated in Belgium. It has a strong physique and can adapt to various climates. In England, there is a long-eared rabbit (see Figure 5). Its ears are very large and the ear width is quite wide, starting from behind the eyes and hanging down: the front part of the body is slightly lower, and the rear part is high and protruding. When stationary, the head is lowered, and the ears hang to the ground. The posture is very beautiful. Its body color is yellow, gray, brown, and other colors. The price is very expensive. This type of rabbit is a well-known type of pet rabbit. As for the rabbit breeds used for fur, the more famous ones are: Rex, Havana, Sable, Blue, Silver Gray, Silver Fox, and Pearl. The above several types are the general types of domestic rabbits.

Son: Why are rabbit's tails all very short?

Father: This is for the convenience of its climbing, running, and jumping. If the tail is too long, it will not be suitable for its short forelimbs and long hind limbs, so its tail has degenerated into a very short section. In eastern and southern Europe and western Siberia in Asia, there is a tailless rabbit (see Figure 6). Its forelimbs are almost as long as its hind limbs, its head is round, its ears are very short, and its tail is extremely short and not exposed outside the body, so it is called the tailless rabbit.

Son: Dad! You said earlier that rabbits are small rodents. What does it mean to be a rodent?

Father: Oh! It turns out that the rabbit has four incisors in the upper jaw, the two in the center are larger, and the lower jaw only has two large incisors. When it chews food, the upper jaw moves up and down, which is suitable for cutting, and the lower jaw moves horizontally, which is suitable for chewing. Its upper lip is very thick, with a longitudinal cleft in the middle that reaches the nose. This cleft has the function of grasping, which can draw food and send it into the mouth: it also exposes the incisors, making it easy to grind things. This is a unique feature of rodents.

Son: Besides being used for our entertainment and food, do rabbits have other uses?

Father: Rabbit fur can be spun into velvet yarn, and can also be woven into woolen fabrics and made into felt hats. Rabbit skin can be used to make gloves, earmuffs, shoes, as well as coats and shawls. Its uses are very wide. Therefore, there are as many as fourteen million three hundred thousand domestic rabbits raised in various countries!

Son: Dad, when will you buy a few rabbits for me to raise?

Father: Okay, when you grow up a little more, I will definitely buy them for you!

### Setting Off

— Bai Zheng

——Ming Er's Escape Record, Part 9——

As the east just began to reveal a fish-belly white color, the three small boats started their "kluk-kluk" sound, slowly moving along the center of the river like snakes. Far away on both banks, Ming Er stretched his neck, barely able to see a row of short mulberry trees and patches of vegetable gardens; the old leaves of the mulberry trees were showing a color of imminent withering, a sign of late autumn, but the vegetable leaves were all adorably green.

The boat was already moving so slowly, but Heaven was unwilling to help; gusts of headwind hit Ming Er's face. So the boatman ordered his assistant to carry the tow rope ashore. The assistant was not very tall, but his legs were thick and strong, and his chest was quite broad, showing a strong appearance. He jumped into the river, which was not very deep, the water only reaching his calves. He quickly ran forward, releasing the rope, like a kite-flying action in spring. When the rope was fully released, he carried the rope and walked forward step by step with even strides. So the small boat was a little faster than before, but the speed was very limited.

"Brother, how many days will we be in Jiangxi? Can we get there by tomorrow?" Ming Er felt that the boat was moving so slowly that he thought that even tomorrow would be too late to arrive in Jiangxi. His brother, Congming, heard this.

"You make it sound so easy. Jiangxi Province is thousands of miles away from here, I'm afraid even taking a train would be too late." His brother answered him this way. "Jiangxi Province is quite big, so what is our destination in Jiangxi? Our lives will probably change too." "Jingdezhen." "Jingdezhen, that name sounds very familiar, I remember, it's a very famous place for producing porcelain. So how do we get there?" "Didn't you hear? We plan to go to Hangzhou first, because we can take a boat or a train to get there. But I heard that taking a boat from Hangzhou is more economical, while the train is bound to be very crowded. There are so many of us, we can't squeeze on. From Hangzhou, we take a boat to Tunxi in Anhui, and then from Tunxi we take a bus to Jingdezhen, and then we take a small boat to reach our destination. Can you imagine how much trouble this is? It is said that it will take about half a month to get there." Cong Er spoke at length, finally making Ming Er understand the itinerary of this escape.

Their mother was worried about our breakfast, because when we got on the boat, it was already midnight, so we didn't buy any food. So the old lady opened her mouth to the boatman and said, "Boatman, at which small town can we go ashore to buy some vegetables?"

The boatman said very politely, "Madam. A little further ahead, there are things to buy in that town."

By this time, the sun had already risen from the east, and Ming Er's stomach was rumbling with hunger, but how could he dare to utter a word about being hungry, because no one had anything to eat! With great difficulty, they arrived at the small town. The mother asked the boatman to buy rice and vegetables. The boatman left for a while and had not yet returned, which made it difficult for Ming Er to bear. But he had no choice but to be hungry. He just stared, stared, and stared, when the boatman came back, he was overjoyed, but he still had to wash the rice and cook the vegetables. While the porridge was cooking, a burst of porridge aroma filled the cabin, making the hungry worms in his stomach seem to jump out. After waiting for a long time, the porridge was cooked, which made him even happier to jump up. He ate three bowls in a hurry, and wanted to eat two more bowls, but in fact he was not allowed, so he had to endure it.

Ming Er's younger siblings were dizzy because the small boat was swaying in the river, and also because they didn't go out often. One by one, they lay on the bed that couldn't be called a bed, which made the mother feel uneasy, and she kept asking them: "Are you feeling better now?" But they were still lying silently. This also made Ming Er unhappy, because getting sick while escaping is the most unfortunate thing.

When Ming Er first got on the boat, he looked east and west, and didn't feel lonely. Later, he became a little disgusted, and sat blankly in the cabin, only seeing the sun gradually moving from east to west, and soon it was time for lunch, and soon it was time for dinner, and it passed quickly, but one night made him miserably curl up in a long and cold night.

### Correction

In the "How to Calculate the Day of the Week for the 28th Year" section of the Children's Weekly New Year's issue, the number for May should not be 3, but 2. I am afraid that other children will be mistaken because of this, so I hereby make a correction.

### Historical Materials for Children: Children's Military Camp for Elementary School Students in Chongqing

— Qiu Wen

Children, let me report a valuable piece of news to you. This is a historical material for children during the sacred War of Resistance. Recently, the elementary school students in Chongqing, the national military center, organized a children's military camp, adhering to the teaching of "reading without forgetting saving the country." All elementary school students aged nine to fifteen have the right to freely participate in this "children's military camp." Their lives are completely in line with military education. Every child soldier has taken on a major task.

Their organization is roughly divided into four major tasks: comforting, transportation, propaganda, and maintaining traffic and air defense. The details are as follows:

(1) Comfort: The children's military camp sends a number of child soldiers to rear hospitals and wounded soldier hospitals every day to perform comforting work. They write letters home for the soldiers, read important news from the day's newspapers, and do other trivial tasks to help the nurses.

(2) Transportation: The child soldiers have the obligation to transport all comfort items sent by the people in the rear to the soldiers. They must also help with other relatively easy military transportation tasks when there are not enough transportation soldiers.

(3) Propaganda: The children's military camp sends soldiers to nearby towns and villages on a daily basis to give brief speeches, so that the general public with less knowledge can understand the significance of this great War of Resistance.

(Traffic and Air Defense): This is the most important task, which is to help the police and military police maintain traffic and air defense. When the enemy planes attack the first warning. The child soldiers must immediately prohibit pedestrians and vehicles from passing, and send pedestrians, passengers and drivers to nearby houses or air-raid shelters in a very disciplined manner. When the second warning sounds, the people on the street should disappear completely, otherwise they will be found by the officers of the Children's Military Camp and will be subject to considerable punishment.

From the above, we can see that the tasks of the child soldiers are so complicated and important. Their lives are even more serious and disciplined. They are also very kind and amiable to the people. The clothes they wear are almost exactly the same as ordinary soldiers, and they also wear symbols on their chests. The only thing missing is firearms.

Children, the elementary school students in Chongqing have taken on the work that adults do during the War of Resistance. And we elementary school students on the isolated island are still living very safely. This makes us feel ashamed to some extent! I hope that the children can quickly implement the "saving and storing money" and contribute to the country. And undertake a part of the anti-Japanese and national salvation work for elementary school students! (Translated from the English version of the Great American News)

### Snow White (Part Two)

— Celestial Grandson

This dream can be done anytime, anywhere; even when washing dishes or scrubbing floors, one can enjoy dreaming, and no one can interfere. So, although Snow White toiled away day after day, working very hard, her appearance became more and more beautiful, which was due to her optimistic nature nurtured by her dreams. Every time she looked at her tattered clothes, she would dream that they were cloud brocade garments woven from butterfly wings, and that she was embracing and dancing with a handsome young prince, as inseparable as lacquer and glue. She also dreamed of that perfect day of marriage, when she and the prince would marry and go hand in hand to the palace in the clouds, to live a sweet and happy life.

In the garden of the palace, there was a well, called the Wishing Well, said to grant your wishes if you spoke your desires aloud into it. It was very effective. So Snow White went to the well every day, lay on the edge, and spoke of her desires from the bottom of her heart, wishing for a handsome young prince to come and rescue her from this pit of suffering, and to become a happy couple with her.

One day, a handsome young prince, wandering from a faraway kingdom, passed by the palace garden and happened to hear Snow White's silver-bell-like sweet voice, as she was speaking her wishes into the well.

Hearing these words, the prince's heart stirred, and he suddenly appeared in the palace garden, attracting Snow White's attention. At first sight, they fell in love and began to cherish each other. Unfortunately, the hateful Queen saw them from the window, watching the prince and Snow White together, talking and laughing so happily, and hearing the prince call out to the princess: "The most beautiful woman in the world."

Upon hearing this, the Queen's face immediately turned pale. Filled with anger and jealousy, she gathered her long train in her arms, hurried down the seven corridors, passed through the seven doors, and went straight to her secret chamber, where she angrily questioned the magic mirror: "Mirror on the wall, please answer me, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?"

After she finished speaking, a layer of emerald green mist covered the magic mirror. Suddenly, a strange mouth opened on the mirror surface, uttering words that the Queen feared to hear most. She heard it say: "My Queen, today I have seen a young lady of peerless beauty, who is now much more beautiful than you. Her lips are as red as roses, her skin as white as snow, her hair as black as ebony, beautiful! Extremely beautiful."

Yes, it was true, Snow White was the most beautiful woman in the world!

The Queen's jealousy burned, how could she tolerate a mere girl surpassing her in beauty? So, in her venomous heart, a venomous plan arose. She immediately issued an order in a rage, summoning her huntsman to the palace. The huntsman dared not neglect, hurriedly rushed into the palace, knelt at the foot of the throne, and asked anxiously: "Your Majesty, what command do you have for your humble servant?" The Queen uttered a cold voice, saying: "I order you to take Snow White into the forest tomorrow. You must return alone. Do you understand? You must return alone. And you must do it well, without error, and when you return, you must bring her heart in a box to show me." As she spoke, she took out a jewel-encrusted box and handed it to the huntsman.

Having received the order, the huntsman felt as if a stone was pressing on his heart, unable to let it go. He thought, Snow White is gentle, lovely, and beautiful, and has committed no crime, yet the Queen cannot tolerate her and issues this vicious order, insisting that he take her life, how could one even begin to speak of such a thing!
