### The German Pocket Battleship Admiral Graf Spee Scuttled Off the Port of Uruguay: Explosions Continued to Resonate, and the Surrounding Sea Was Ablaze with Light. The Captain and All Officers and Men Were Rescued to Argentina.

Berlin: The German Führer and Supreme Commander of the German Armed Forces, Adolf Hitler, personally issued an order to Captain Langsdorff to scuttle the Admiral Graf Spee because the Uruguayan government failed to grant sufficient time for the ship to regain its seaworthiness. (Haida Telegraph, 18th)

Capital of Uruguay: The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee weighed anchor and set sail at 5:15 PM today (local time; 4:45 AM on the 18th, Shanghai time). The German steamer Tacoma followed behind. At 8:00 PM, after sailing five miles offshore, the officers and men scuttled the ship by drilling holes in the stern. Five hundred sailors boarded five lifeboats and were rescued by the Tacoma. At 10:05 PM, the ship was still afloat, emitting thick smoke. Then, three explosions occurred, and the ship gradually sank. One hour later, it was completely submerged. At that time, the Tacoma and two Argentine warships were nearby, while the British battleship Renown (32,000 tons), the aircraft carrier Ark Royal (25,000 tons) with 60 aircraft, the cruisers Achilles (7,000 tons) and Ajax (6,800 tons), and the French battleship Dunkerque (26,500 tons) were waiting in battle formation in the distance. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

Capital of Uruguay: It was previously reported that the captain and all officers of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee had perished. However, it is now known that they were all rescued by the Argentine cruiser Libertad. The 500 sailors were divided among five lifeboats, with some rescued by the German steamer Tacoma and others by the Libertad and other Argentine ships, and taken to the capital city, where they disembarked under searchlights. In addition, many private vessels and the British cruiser Cumberland also participated in the rescue. At that time, the Admiral Graf Spee had not yet completely sunk, and continuous explosions occurred within the ship. The surrounding sea was covered in oil, burning brightly and illuminating the area like daylight. Several British and French warships were anchored in the distance, easily discernible by the firelight. Thousands of people gathered on the shore to watch. Several British aircraft circled above the Admiral Graf Spee but did not drop bombs. Only after the ship had completely sunk did they return to the British ships. Soon after, the British and French ships departed. At that time, the remaining fire at sea was still raging, but the Admiral Graf Spee had sunk to the bottom of the sea. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

Capital of Uruguay: The scuttling of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was an unforgettable sight. When the ship sank in shallow water, the oil it carried spilled out and ignited, illuminating several miles of the sea as if it were daytime. The fire raged on the water, and explosions thundered underwater, as the flames spread to the powder magazine even though the ship was submerged. At 9:30 PM (Greenwich time), the flames were completely extinguished, and no trace of the ship could be seen at sea. (Reuters, 18th)

New York: The New York Times today published a dispatch from a correspondent in the capital of Uruguay, reporting details of the scuttling of the Graf Spee. It stated, "Standing on the roof of a hotel, I saw Captain Langsdorff and other officers standing solemnly on a steamboat, watching the sinking of the ship and raising their hands in salute. As the sun was setting, casting a crimson glow across the sky, the captain pressed an electric button at the end of a long rope, which was connected to a mine in the powder magazine. Less than ten minutes after the button was pressed, the entire ship erupted in flames, and explosions followed one after another, lasting for over an hour until the ship had completely sunk and the explosions ceased." (Reuters, 18th)

New York: According to Uruguayan Navy Inspector General Rear Admiral Schroder, Captain Langsdorff of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and several officers have traveled by speedboat to the capital of Argentina. The German steamer Tacoma has also transported the crew of the Admiral Graf Spee to Argentina, escorted by two Argentine warships. (Haida Telegraph, 18th)

New York: The captain and crew of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee, fearing detention by Uruguay, are now traveling to the capital of Argentina on two tugboats. It is said that they hope the Argentine government will treat them as survivors of a sunken ship. (Reuters, 18th)

New York: According to the New York Times, the captain of the German ship Tacoma has been arrested for leaving the port of Montevideo without permission. It is reported that the crew members of the German ship Graf Spee who transferred to the Tacoma when the ship was scuttled are now all under detention. (Reuters, 18th)

### German Ship's Officers and Men: 36 Dead, 59 Wounded

Berlin: Last night, the German side initially acknowledged that a total of 36 crew members of the Graf Spee died during the battle with three British cruisers. According to a German news agency, the German headquarters has received a report stating that 36 people died in the battle, 6 were seriously injured, and 53 were slightly injured. (Reuters, 18th)

Capital of Uruguay: The self-scuttling of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee this afternoon has shocked the world. According to eyewitnesses, 31 sailors who were seriously injured in the previous naval battle landed here this morning and were taken to the hospital for treatment, 12 of whom were on the verge of death. It was evident that the ship was preparing to depart. Around noon, a Havas correspondent drove a motorboat to within 100 yards of the ship and saw that all repair work had been completed, and all workers had left the ship. Fuel and food had also been fully loaded, further confirming that the ship was about to set sail. Then, after 5:00 PM, the ship was indeed seen sailing out of the port, but unexpectedly, it was scuttled five miles offshore. It is reported that the Admiral Graf Spee, the Admiral Scheer, and the Deutschland were sister ships, all known as 10,000-ton pocket battleships. The purpose of Germany building these small battleships at the time was to comply with the Treaty of Versailles, which restricted the country's warship tonnage to no more than 10,000 tons. Therefore, on the one hand, the armor thickness was reduced as much as possible to reduce weight, and on the other hand, various weapons were installed as much as possible. The ship was equipped with six 11-inch caliber cannons (each shell weighing 330 kilograms) and eight 6-inch caliber cannons. It was equipped with a diesel engine and had a maximum speed of 26 miles per hour, with a range of 10,000 miles. These types of battleships were weak in defense but strong in attack power. The Admiral Graf Spee's defeat by British ships this time was due to this. Since the outbreak of the war, there have been rumors of German pirate ships appearing in the Atlantic, but the whereabouts of the Admiral Graf Spee remained a mystery until three British cruisers, including the Ajax, engaged it in battle, confirming that the ship was indeed in the South Atlantic. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

### British Ship's Officers and Men Killed in Action: 68 Dead, 28 Wounded

London: The Admiralty has announced that in the battle between the British cruiser Exeter and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee on the 13th of this month, 5 officers and 56 sailors were killed, and 3 officers and 20 sailors were injured. On the British cruiser Ajax, 7 sailors were killed and 5 were injured. The British Embassy in Argentina has specially dispatched a temporary hospital ship to accommodate the wounded officers and men. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

The German Pocket Battleship Admiral Graf Spee (10,000 tons)

### German Statement: Mission Accomplished

Berlin: Last night, the official side issued a lengthy statement, stating that for several months, the Admiral Graf Spee and several other warships had been engaged in commerce raiding in the Atlantic, repeatedly achieving success, sinking a total of 50,000 tons of enemy ships and completing their mission of attacking and searching on the sea lanes. These warships were not dispatched to engage enemy warships but to prevent enemy merchant ships and disrupt enemy transportation. In addition to sinking enemy ships, inflicting direct damage on the enemy army was also part of their mission. For several months, the result of this strategy has been that the enemy navy has been greatly constrained. The British navy was forced to weaken its domestic fleet to protect traffic in the South Atlantic. They knew that these 10,000-ton pocket battleships were built under the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, and their tonnage, gun positions, and speed were insufficient to compete with the latest British warships. However, the Admiral Graf Spee bravely accepted the challenge, not only fighting outnumbered but also damaging three of Britain's newest cruisers. The British do not acknowledge this disparity in strength and accuse the German ship of fleeing. It should be known that cruisers are much faster than pocket battleships, so how could the Graf Spee have fled? If there was a flight, it must have been by the fast-moving British cruisers, certainly not the German battleship. The Graf Spee had on board one British merchant ship captain and seven sailors, because the ship had been sunk by the Graf Spee. After arriving at the port of Montevideo, the British prisoners were released, and they expressed gratitude for the treatment and actions of the German captain. When the German sailors who died were buried, they automatically sent representatives to participate in the funeral and presented wreaths. The British propaganda organs have fabricated lies and denied the facts. The achievements of the Graf Spee in maritime commerce raiding cannot be denied by lies. The German leaders have strengthened their determination because of the ship's success. (Haida Telegraph, 18th)

### Roosevelt: Closely Watching

New York: Regarding the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee incident, President Roosevelt remained in contact with the State Department all day yesterday. When news of the ship's scuttling arrived, the President did not express an opinion. This surprised those close to the White House, but no one commented on it. It is reported that the countries of the Americas intend to have the President of Panama send notes to both Britain and Germany, protesting their infringement on the neutral zone of the American continent. This move is not expected to change due to the scuttling of the Admiral Graf Spee. Brazil is advocating for a strongly worded protest, while other countries have expressed opposition. In addition, the countries of the Americas may draft a second resolution to notify the European belligerents of the measures that the countries of the Americas should take in the event of similar incidents in the future. (Havas News Agency, 16th)

Capital of Uruguay: The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled five miles off the coast of Uruguay. Prior to this, the diplomatic activities of envoys from various countries here were extremely busy. British Minister Drake delivered a note to Foreign Minister Guani in the morning, the contents of which have not yet been disclosed by the authorities. Foreign Minister Guani immediately forwarded it to Army Minister General Campos and engaged in discussions with him. Afterwards, he invited envoys from various American countries to hold a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the issue of British and German warships fighting within the "neutral zone" of the American continent. It is reported that this meeting was initiated by the Brazilian ambassador. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

Capital of Argentina: Argentine Senator Melo, who represented the country at the Pan-American Conference in Panama this past October, stated that the naval battle between three British cruisers and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee on the 13th of this month within the "neutral zone" of the American continent constituted a violation of the "neutral zone." Therefore, the governments of the countries of the Americas should protest to both Britain and Germany. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### The German Ship and the Sun Sank Below the Horizon at the Same Time

Capital of Uruguay: The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled at 7:56 PM last night (local time). It is said that Captain Langsdorff chose this time to scuttle the ship so that it would sink below the horizon at the same time as the sun. (Haida Telegraph, 18th)

### Welcoming the Burmese Delegation's Visit to China

A delegation from various circles in Burma, led by co-leaders U Ba Lwin and U Myint Thein, flew from Rangoon to China on the 13th of this month to inspect the situation of China's resistance and reconstruction. They have been receiving enthusiastic welcomes and hospitality from Chinese officials and civilians in Chongqing for several days. It is believed that the vibrant and magnificent new atmosphere of the rear will leave a deep and lasting impression on the members of the delegation. Since Burma became a British colony in 1885, for more than 50 years, it has been under the jurisdiction of the British Governor-General of India. It was only two years ago that it obtained the separation of India and Burma and autonomy. Its situation and circumstances are deeply concerned by the Chinese people, who are seeking liberation through resistance. Therefore, the arrival of the delegation this time is undoubtedly a rare and valuable friendship, similar to the visit of Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru to China four months ago.

Burma is also an ancient country in Asia, with a history of more than 2,000 years. It has always had close relations with China. From a vertical perspective, since the Yuan Dynasty's operations in the southwest, there have been continuous relations with the Burmese kingdom of Pagan at that time. Transportation between China and India was once opened at that time, and Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty even strongly warned the border generals in Burma not to invade Burmese territory to protect trade between Burma, India, and China. The Ming and Qing dynasties sent envoys and tributes continuously until the end of the Qing Dynasty. From a horizontal perspective, the Burmese, who make up the largest majority of Burma's population, are closely related to some tribes in Sichuan and Yunnan in terms of race, and belong to the so-called Tibetan-Burmese system together with the Tanguts of Kham and Tibet. Their languages ​​also belong to the same system. Although there are not many overseas Chinese residing in Burma today, there are still about 300,000, accounting for one-fortieth of the total population of Burma. Especially since the completion of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, known as a "great engineering project of the modern world," this spring, the relationship between China and Burma has become even closer. On the one hand, China has gained an important international route in addition to the northwest and Yunnan-Vietnam lines, and the belief in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance has also increased with a new and powerful guarantee. On the other hand, the status of Burma will also increase in importance because the traffic from the Indian Ocean to China will be shortened by 2,000 nautical miles. In the future, when the Yunnan-Burma Railway is completed and linked with the planned West China Railway network to form an artery running through the Asian continent, its effectiveness will be equivalent to the Chinese Eastern Railway, which is now being seized by the Japanese puppet regime. Even after the completion of China's anti-war mission, it will be of great benefit to the future and prosperity of Burma. Therefore, the enhancement and strengthening of friendship between China and Burma is not only logically natural but also a matter of extreme urgency at the moment.

However, this friendship is unfortunately deeply envied by the aggressors in the East. Since Burma gained autonomy, the political situation has often been turbulent and unstable. According to the report of the local riot investigation committee this spring, the reasons include the animosity between the Indian and Burmese ethnic groups and the political movements of monks, among other things, but at least one reason has not been emphasized by the report, and that is the conspiracy of the Japanese. In a colonial political framework, frictions and animosities are inevitable, which is an opportunity for ambitious aggressors. Since the completion of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, this kind of incitement has become more active and overt, and it is dedicated to provoking and alienating the feelings between China and Burma, creating rumors, and launching politically motivated strikes. Fortunately, the local government handled it properly, and no major disasters occurred, but it also cast an unpleasant shadow on the unstable political situation in Burma. After the outbreak of the European War, British strength in the Far East was constrained, and Japan's southward expansion conspiracy became more active, and Burma is undoubtedly also a target that the Japanese warlords have set their sights on. According to reports yesterday, just at the same time as the delegation visited China, a major Japanese spy case was cracked in Rangoon. In the documents seized from the arrested Japanese, Masami Kokusho, it can be seen that the Japanese are not only coveting Burmese oil and preparing to immigrate on a large scale but also are doing their best to organize groups to carry out sabotage conspiracies. We believe that destroying Sino-Burmese transportation and friendship will also be a major part of its main tasks. In his speech to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. U Ba Swe, a member of the delegation, mentioned the economic sanctions against Japan that the All-Burma Youth League has been working hard to promote for the past two years. This expression of justice and friendship is truly admirable. We earnestly hope that it can continue its past achievements and strive forward; but what we cannot but briefly advise the delegation is that, in addition to the above tasks, it should be doubly vigilant, carefully guard against all the conspiracies of ambitious aggressors, and put the Sino-Burmese friendship and the tragic situation and hard fighting of China under brutal aggression before every Burmese people, so that any attempt to alienate and incite has no place to use its tricks.

After the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese were looking forward to the past of the previous Great War, and still hoped to act as the guardian of the Far East colonies for the British Empire, so as to blackmail the British in exchange for recognition of the so-called "New Order in East Asia." The above-mentioned conspiracy against Burma obviously also has this kind of coercive effect to some extent. Little did they know that this European War is not only different in nature from the previous World War, but also the Far East situation is quite different from the past: First, the main stabilizing force in the Far East today is China, whose war of resistance is becoming increasingly victorious, not Japan, whose strength has been exhausted by aggression; Second, during this period when Britain and France cannot look after the East, the United States' Far East policy is becoming more active and will never condone ambitious countries from acting wantonly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans; Third, what Britain has always been most worried about is the threat to India. Now that Singapore has been built into the second strongest fortress in the world, it is more than enough to defend India, Burma, and the Malay states. For these reasons, Britain and France can do their best to cope with the European situation, and there is no need to rely on Japanese assistance in the Far East. The Japanese efforts are futile. Naturally, at the same time, the wartime colonial policies of Britain and France must also strive to be lenient and reasonable in considering extraordinary tasks, so as to eliminate unnecessary disturbances and avoid giving aggressors an opportunity to take advantage of. As for the masses of the colonies, they should deeply understand their own position and the correct way to obtain true freedom and liberation, and fortunately not be lured by sweet words, so as to become the puppets of those with other ambitions. The result is nothing more than rejecting the tiger and letting in the wolf, and they themselves will fall into the dark abyss. The events of the Donghak Party in Korea 40 years ago are a tragic warning. Now China is engaged in a heroic war of resistance for national independence and freedom, which is undoubtedly where the bright future of the weak Asian nations lies. The international status of Eastern nations has been improved over the past 20 years due to the resurgence of Turkey; the victory of China's resistance war will inevitably bring stability to the turbulent Far East and help all Asian people regain their glorious happiness. The delegation from various circles in Burma has come to visit China, which is engaged in the war of resistance, with full of enthusiasm. All Chinese people, in addition to gratitude, cannot help but admire their vision and understanding. The delegation stated in Chongqing that its plan to visit China had gone through many considerations, which shows the hardship of this trip. This is enough to make those countries that do not hesitate to befriend the aggressors to slander the patriotic actions of overseas Chinese feel ashamed.

The friendship between China and Burma will surely become more profound because of the delegation's visit, and the security of East Asia will surely increase with the guarantee of China's friendly relations with all peace-loving and righteous neighbors. This is the self-confidence of the Chinese nation, and it is also what we want to express to the Burmese people in addition to welcoming the Burmese delegation.

### German Minister and Ship's Captain Protest to Uruguay: Claiming Not to Have Been Given Sufficient Time to Stay

Capital of Uruguay: The German Minister to Uruguay, Dr. Langmann, today lodged a protest with the Uruguayan government, claiming that the Uruguayan government's failure to allow the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee sufficient time to anchor in Montevideo was in violation of international law. In addition, the ship's captain, Langsdorff, sent a long letter to the German Minister to Uruguay, first stating that the ship could not be completely repaired within the short period of time designated by the Uruguayan government in the port of Montevideo, but solemnly declared that the ship's combat power had not suffered serious damage. He continued, "Although I do not agree with the Uruguayan government's views and reasons, I will still respect the time limit set by the government, but since the government is unwilling to respect the Hague Convention, which grants our ship sufficient time for repairs so that it can replenish its seaworthiness, I am unwilling to hand over our ship to the country to be controlled by it. Under these circumstances, I have no choice but to destroy our ship near the coast and try my best to rescue the crew to land." In his letter, Langsdorff expressed his admiration for the kindness and affection of the Uruguayan people but regretted the Uruguayan government's lack of understanding in ordering the ship to leave the port at 8:00 PM last night. It is reported that "Uruguayan government officials knew that the Graf Spee's kitchen and oven had been damaged, and the ship would not be able to make a long voyage without immediate repairs. I cited Article 17 of the Hague Convention, which states that neutral countries may allow warships of belligerent countries to dock in their ports and give them sufficient time to carry out repairs so that they can be seaworthy, and cited the precedent of the British cruiser Glasgow docking in a neutral South American port for four weeks in 1914 to carry out repairs, requesting the Uruguayan government to allow it to dock for two weeks so that the Graf Spee could restore its sailing ability. The government commissioner could come in person to inspect it and would be convinced that the Graf Spee's hull had been damaged and that repairs were necessary," (Haida Telegraph, 18th)

### American Newspapers Say: Not Heroic

New York: The American newspapers have commented on the self-scuttling of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, saying that this is a great victory for the British Navy and a major blow to the morale of the German Navy and the people. The naval affairs reporter for the New York Times declared that if this decision was made by the German leader Hitler, it was a preliminary step in admitting defeat and that he had initially recognized his defeat, which was only just beginning, but this was not acceptable to the country's public opinion. As for the Uruguayan government, although it was under great pressure from Germany in diplomatic terms, it was still able to respect international law and deal with it with a firm attitude, which is commendable. The New York Tribune stated that even if this decision was made under the surveillance of enemy ships, it was not heroic. The Admiral Graf Spee, which was used to commemorate Admiral Graf Spee, fought bravely against British warships during the last European War and eventually died for his country. The fate of the Admiral Graf Spee this time is like this. What glory is there to be said for it? The captains of the British cruisers were intelligent and brave, which is a manifestation of naval strength. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### English Newspaper Reports That This Is a Shameful Affair

London - Today, all British newspapers extensively discuss the German decision to scuttle the Graf Spee rather than be detained or risk battle. The naval correspondent of The Times stated that Admiral Spee was renowned for his bravery, hence the ship was named in his memory. However, the Graf Spee's fate is far from the glory that the namesake was meant to commemorate. Accepting detention would have been perfectly justifiable. The German merchant ships' motto "sink rather than surrender" is understandable because whether scuttled or surrendered, merchant ships ultimately do not belong to Germany. However, applying this motto to the Graf Spee seems to lack both sense and value. The Times also quoted a British naval authority who stated, "To destroy one's ship rather than compel the crew to fight is more disgraceful than accepting detention. It is unexpected that the Germans would choose such an inglorious end." The Times further commented that the Germans have always been a brave nation, and this would never have happened in the old German navy. Looking at the overall situation that has brought shame to Germany, one can see that the actions of British ships are admirable, and they demonstrate the vitality of their nation to the world. (Reuters, 18th)

London - The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee's self-scuttling is being commented on by various newspapers here. All agree that the ship's demise is extremely shameful. It is recalled that when the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Rawalpindi was recently sunk by another German pocket battleship, the Deutschland, in the waters off Iceland, the British captain, knowing that strength was unequal, still fought to the end. Compared to the attitude of the Graf Spee's captain, he falls short. The Daily Mail reported that the Graf Spee's self-scuttling is clear evidence of the superiority of British naval power. Germany has always been proud of the Graf Spee, but its demise is shameful. The captain's decision was made on the orders of Hitler, but it is almost certain that he and the entire crew would have preferred to go down fighting. (Havas, 18th)

### German Cruiser Sunk By British Submarine Navy Department Announcement

London - The Admiralty has issued a communiqué stating that the British submarine HMS Ursula sank a 6,000-ton German cruiser on the 14th of this month in the Elbe Estuary. The name of the ship is unknown, but it is known to be of the same class as the German cruiser Königsberg, equipped with nine 6-inch guns. Six destroyers were escorting it at the time. (Havas, 18th)

London - The German cruiser Königsberg displaces 6,000 tons, has a crew of 671, and has two sister ships, the Karlsruhe and the Köln. All are armed with nine 5.9-inch guns, six 3.5-inch guns, twelve torpedo tubes, and have a speed of 32 knots and a range of 5,000 miles. (Reuters, 18th)

### British Ship Sunk By Plane More Sinking Occurrences

The Hague - The British ship Serene was bombed and destroyed by two planes yesterday. The crew members have all boarded lifeboats and are heading towards the British coast. (Haitong, 18th)

The Hague - The British ship Anubo (1,100 tons) struck a mine and sank near the northeast coast of England. All seventeen crew members have been rescued. (Haitong, 17th)

London - According to the German news agency Amsterdam, the British ship Anbel (1,160 tons) sank after hitting a mine yesterday. The crew encountered danger. (Reuters, 18th)

### Another Norwegian Ship Sinks

Oslo - The Norwegian ship Sterlingham (460 tons) sank in the eastern waters of England today, likely due to hitting a mine. Another Norwegian ship, Finland, upon hearing the news, immediately rushed to rescue. Two crew members were rescued, and the captain's body was recovered. The remaining eight crew members have perished. (Havas, 18th)

The Hague - The Norwegian ship Thordis has run aground on the northeast coast of England. The crew has been rescued. (Haitong, 18th)

Stockholm - The Swedish ship Osses has sunk in the Thames Estuary after hitting a mine. The captain and eight crew members have encountered danger, and the remaining eleven crew members have been rescued. (Haitong, 18th)

### Another German Ship Intercepted By British Ship And Scuttled The Total Is Now Twenty-One

London - The ship Antiocha (3,106 tons), belonging to the Hamburg America Line, was intercepted by a British warship in the North Atlantic yesterday. The crew, unwilling for the ship to be captured by the British, immediately scuttled it. Since the beginning of the war, the total number of German ships scuttled by their own crews has reached twenty-one. (Havas, 18th)

Berlin - The German freighter Olangchen sailed from Australia to Chile when the European war broke out, using wood as fuel and making several sails to navigate because the ship was unable to refuel in Australia after unloading cargo in New Zealand. According to the shipping company, the Olangchen sailed 1,507 miles with sails and 3,319 miles with engines before reaching Chile, entering a Chilean port on November 12. (Haitong, 18th)

### Captain of Bremen Gives Radio Speech

Berlin - Captain Ahrens of the Bremen gave a radio address in Berlin yesterday, stating briefly that he was deeply grateful for the German people's warm welcome to the Bremen and its crew. The Bremen's safe return has proven that British hegemony in the North Sea has been destroyed. (Haitong, 18th)

Berlin - German submarine fleet commander Rear Admiral Dönitz declared that the three months since the outbreak of the Anglo-German war have proven that so-called British maritime hegemony is nothing more than that. In the World War, Germany only "cautiously used" submarines, and Britain was already on the verge of collapse because its communication with all countries was completely cut off. After gaining this experience, Britain only actively engaged in weapons to resist submarine warfare after the war, but the past three months have proven the ineffectiveness of Britain's countermeasures. The statement that the strength of submarines is not fearful is inaccurate. The escort system is most imperfect. The speed of escort vessels must be the slowest, and the cost is enormous. In the last war, the Allied countries mobilized 3,000 warships to counter 78 German submarines. How uneconomical is that! It must be known that the effectiveness of submarines is multifaceted. In addition to attacking enemy ships, they can also lay mines and carry out long-range reconnaissance. Britain is definitely unable to cope with the success of German submarines. (Haitong, 18th)

### Japanese Ship Sanyo Maru Checked and Released

London - The Japanese ship Sanyo Maru, carrying German goods, was the first Japanese ship to be inspected by the British. It was detained in a contraband control port for 24 hours and then released. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Japanese government had previously guaranteed to Britain that the payment for all German goods loaded by the Sanyo Maru had been cleared before the British implemented the plan to detain neutral ships carrying German goods on November 27. Therefore, when the ship arrived at the contraband control port, the British had to verify whether any of the German goods loaded were not guaranteed by the Japanese government. According to previous implications from Tokyo, if the British confiscated the German goods carried on the Japanese ship, Japan would consider retaliatory measures. Therefore, the inspection of the Sanyo Maru has attracted much attention in many quarters. (Reuters, 18th)

### Hua Army Has Not Yet Adopted a Full-Scale Offensive Spokesperson of the Military Council Talks

Chongqing - Recently, the Japanese side has frequently publicized that the Hua army has adopted a (Winter Offensive). In order to clarify the situation, the reporter paid a special visit to the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who replied as follows: The Japanese army is publicizing that the Hua army has launched a (Winter Offensive). In fact, the Japanese army is frightened, so it shows a strange phenomenon of panic when the Hua army launches a slight attack. The Hua army has not yet taken a full-scale offensive because the time has not yet come. However, it is monitoring the Japanese positions, holding back the Japanese army, and not allowing them to have any time to withdraw for adjustment and rest, and will sacrifice all the invading armies in China within the current positions, that is, use the current positions as their burial place. Therefore, whenever there is an opportunity, it will take advantage of it to attack anytime and anywhere. This is determined by the fact that when the Japanese army in China, North China, and Central China, etc. is withdrawing and changing defenses, the Hua army only selects a few points to attack severely. However, the Japanese army made a big noise about it, and the fragility of its front-line troops was also exposed. Wherever the Hua army attacks, the Japanese army often abandons its armor and artillery and flees. Moreover, a large number of Japanese officers and soldiers voluntarily surrendered to the Hua army. On the east bank of the Xiang River, only in terms of the number of artillery pieces captured by the Hua army, 14 mountain guns have been captured. Other spoils of war are too numerous to list. This shows that the signs of the Japanese army's decline are even more obvious. (18th)

### Details of Air Combat off the German Coast

Berlin: Twenty British aircraft attempted to intrude into the German coastal defense line on the afternoon of the 14th, engaging German aircraft in fierce combat. Detailed information was released last night, stating that several German "Messerschmitt" fighters were patrolling the German coast at low altitude due to bad weather. Suddenly, a squadron of fighters encountered a squadron of the latest British "Wellington" bombers and immediately attacked. According to a German pilot who shot down an enemy aircraft, he was ordered to attack the enemy aircraft and shot down two enemy aircraft after two minutes of combat. Several others were also severely damaged. After the British aircraft were scattered, the German fighters attacked them separately, shooting down a total of ten enemy aircraft.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Tells U.S. Ambassador of Plans to Open the Yangtze River; Lifting of Blockade Between Nanjing and Shanghai in Two Months; Nomura and Grew Held a Three-Hour Meeting Yesterday

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Nomura met with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew on November 4th and December 4th to hear the U.S. side's intentions regarding the adjustment of Japanese-American relations. At the same time, in order to break the difficult relationship between the two countries since the U.S. announced the abolition of the Japanese-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Japanese side carefully considered the U.S.'s major concerns in China. After research by relevant Japanese authorities, it was believed that Japan's intention to build a new order in China was not to establish a large-scale closed-off area of domination, so it absolutely respected the major economic rights and interests of third countries. If smooth relations with third countries could be established, Japan would not hesitate to remove all outstanding issues within the scope of the fundamental policies of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, Foreign Minister Nomura informed Ambassador Grew of Japan's determination to change part of the blockade of the Yangtze River. At 3:30 p.m. on the 18th, he met Ambassador Grew for the third time at the Foreign Minister's official residence. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Nomura stated that the Japanese government was concerned about the stability of East Asia and world peace and would not change its fundamental intentions. The China Incident was also gradually coming to an end, and Japan was determined to save China from its semi-colonial state and assist in the construction of a new Asian China. In this regard, third countries should recognize the overall situation, understand Japan's true intentions, and cooperate in the construction of a new China, because excluding third countries would be detrimental to world peace. In order to show its sincerity, the Japanese Empire will prepare to lift part of the blockade of the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Nanjing in two months under certain conditions. The remaining issues regarding the blockade of China's inland waterways are also being considered for a gradual lifting of the blockade. At the same time, he explained in detail the history of Japan's blockade of the Yangtze River and stressed that the Japanese Empire was willing to make significant sacrifices to remove all obstacles and earnestly hoped that the American people would understand Japan's true intentions. Ambassador Grew replied that the U.S. government and people, based on treaties with China, hoped to respect China's sovereign rights based on legal principles and protect its territory. They also hoped for an open door and opportunity based on American ideals. The Japanese government's decision to lift part of the blockade of the Yangtze River was in line with the long-standing wishes of the U.S. government and people, and they were pleased, etc. Afterwards, the two sides exchanged sincere opinions on Japan's sincerity in building a new order and he departed at 4:50 p.m. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 18th)

London: People here have unanimously welcomed the news that Japan plans to reopen the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. However, those in the shipping industry with interests in the Far East said that they were unwilling to make any criticisms regarding the effects of this decision by Japan before they understood how the various "restrictions" and "conditions" for the reopening of the Yangtze River announced by the Japanese side would be implemented. It is said that this reservation is natural because, based on their experience, the Japanese side uses military necessity as a pretext for implementing restrictions, and their intention is to eliminate foreign trade by this method. If this reopening of the Yangtze River, as promised by the Japanese, can truly foreshadow a gradual restoration of foreign trade when it is implemented, everyone believes that the result will greatly improve British-Japanese relations. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an announcement today stating that the Japanese government is willing to open the Yangtze River below Nanjing. The announcement stated, "The blockade of the Yangtze River was originally due to military necessity. However, recently, navigation restrictions in the Yangtze River below Nanjing have been gradually lifted, while retaining certain restrictions to maintain public order and military operations." The announcement considers the meeting between Nomura and Grew today to be important, "containing a spirit of construction" and sufficient to break down the barriers between the United States and Japan. In addition, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared, "It is regrettable that some people believe that Japan has the ambition to dominate trade in China, as 'the Japanese government has no intention of excluding the economic activities of third countries in China.' The fact that Japan does not wish to continue the action of blockading the Yangtze River and the Pearl River can be proven by the facts." (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington: Regarding the Japanese announcement that it is currently preparing to reopen the section of the Yangtze River from the estuary to Nanjing, diplomatic circles here believe that this is related to the issue of revising the trade agreement between Japan and the United States. It is said that the U.S. firmly insists that if the Japanese side wishes to show its sincerity, it should act, and empty talk is useless. It is generally believed that Japan is striving to obtain a new understanding with the United States, but has not made any progress, so it is now trying its best to make the United States feel Japan's sincerity, which is why it has made this announcement. However, it is still impossible to predict whether this announcement will have the effect of making the American public feel Japan's sincerity. A certain expert on the Far East commented to a Reuters reporter today, "What we want is still for Japan to show its faith through actions. If its announcement is merely an announcement for a long time and contains the loopholes of 'military necessity' that have become a habit, then we will continue to harbor doubts about Japan. However, if Japan gradually loosens the restrictions imposed on foreign trade on the Yangtze River until now to fulfill this announcement, then we will naturally change our difficult-to-release doubts." (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations; Molotov Raises the Issue of Outstanding Debts on the Chinese Eastern Railway

Tokyo: During the meeting between Togo and Molotov on the 15th, Commissioner Molotov replied that the Soviet authorities were prepared to conclude a long-term Soviet-Japanese fishery treaty under certain conditions. However, the "certain conditions" mentioned by the Soviet side all related to the request for compensation for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet side demanded that Japan mediate with Manchuria so that "Manchukuo" would pay the last installment of 5.9 million yuan for the Chinese Eastern Railway. If "Manchukuo" did not pay, then the Soviet side would demand that Japan fulfill its guarantee obligations. However, regarding the loans related to the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet side also had a debt of 5.6 million yuan. Now, the Soviet side does not recognize 4.3 million yuan of the debt and demands that "Manchukuo" pay a huge amount of 4.67 million yuan. The Japanese government believes that this request from the Soviet Union is difficult to accept. Furthermore, the request for compensation for the Chinese Eastern Railway is not related to the fishery issue. Now that the Soviet Union has raised it, it is impossible for the Japanese side not to suspect its malicious intentions. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Tokyo: Regarding the Soviet Union's willingness to sign a long-term fishery agreement with Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently awaiting news from Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun and other newspapers all said that the fishery negotiations will also be held simultaneously in Tokyo and Moscow. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

### Rice Being Transported to Shanghai Still Being Intercepted; Shanghai Rice Prices Apparently Relaxed but Actually Firm; Only Medium-Quality Rice Being Sold, Still at Good Prices

Yesterday, sources from the mainland were still being intercepted by certain parties around Shanghai's suburbs, such as Minhang, Qibao, and Hongqiao, preventing them from entering Shanghai. This has two effects: (1) Increasing the difficulty of food supply in Shanghai, forcing those responsible for security to negotiate with them. Therefore, although they express their willingness to cooperate with the authorities in the concessions to eliminate the rice panic and even offer to supply large quantities of rice, in reality, not only is it empty talk, but they are also intensifying their actions, detaining rice boats bound for Shanghai for over ten li. Therefore, rice merchants in the concessions should quickly stabilize rice prices and refrain from hoarding and monopolizing, to avoid inciting rice looting incidents. The general public should also be patient and wait for the authorities in the concessions to suppress rice prices to benefit the people's food supply. Do not allow rice looting cases to occur repeatedly, giving them an excuse to create further complications and fall into their trap. (2) It is heard that two or "three" foreign firms are taking advantage of the predicament of rice merchants who are unable to advance or retreat to buy the intercepted rice at low prices, taking it for their own use and plundering the Chinese people's food supply to satisfy their insatiable demands. Among the Chinese, there are still those who cover up and deny this, deceiving the public, and it is truly unknown what their intentions are. As for the situation in the market yesterday, since the rice looting panic spread rapidly, most rice shops were unwilling to stock up and closed their doors. Only small stalls conducted minor transactions. As a result, the rice market has been virtually suspended for two days. Yesterday, both the British and French concessions, considering the link between food supply and security, on one hand, advised shops to open for business and, on the other hand, strictly implemented security measures, sending a large number of detectives and armored vehicles to patrol the vicinity of rice shops. The rice looting panic was thus suppressed. The best way for rice shops to prevent rice looting is to suppress rice prices. Therefore, the number of customers in the market gradually increased. The early morning market was still sparse, but later, people began to purchase one after another. Sellers were also eager to sell, and prices were all in accordance with the limit prices, without any private deals. However, in general, existing stocks were mostly purchased at prices above 40 yuan, and sellers were still unwilling to sell them easily. As a result, good-quality rice was scarce, and only some cheaper medium-quality rice and thin paddy rice were sold. The remaining goods were all those not subject to limits, such as Saigon rice, which saw busy trading of no less than one or two thousand bags, with prices initially opening at 35 yuan plus commission and closing at 36 yuan. Broken rice was priced at 30 to 31 yuan. The total volume of japonica rice and thin paddy rice traded was only six or seven hundred bags, with Kunshan medium japonica priced at 40 yuan, and Qingpu high-quality thin paddy rice priced at 40 yuan, 39.5 yuan, and Fengjia thin paddy rice priced at 38.5 yuan and 38 yuan, with price fluctuations of one yuan or so. The remaining goods were not traded. Based on this situation, once trading begins, it can gradually return to normal within a few days.

Nearly a thousand bags of customer-grade indica rice arrived yesterday, and various places are rushing to load more rice. Rice en route is still arriving one after another. However, the price of subsequent shipments differs from the limit price. In addition, japonica rice and pointed rice are being blocked from transportation, and the price of foreign rice is high. Market sentiment in Shanghai has suddenly improved. In addition, shops in the city have slightly increased their stock in response to the end of the rice looting panic. Therefore, market conditions have improved by about 50 cents. In the general market, high-grade indica rice opened at the limit price of 33 yuan, while medium-grade opened at 32.5 yuan, with a difference of two or three yuan, resulting in a lack of formal transactions.

The price of foreign rice is still arriving in Shanghai in an endless stream. However, foreign prices are high, making it unprofitable to place new orders. In addition, foreign rice is not subject to limit prices, so market sentiment in Shanghai has suddenly improved. Saigon rice opened at 35 or 36 yuan, and the price in the later market rose by another 30 or 50 cents. En route goods were only priced at 42.5 yuan in the early morning, but had risen to 43.2 yuan by the afternoon.

Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai: The Taikoo Company's Haikou ship arrived from Hong Kong on Sunday with 13,353 bags, which have been completely unloaded. Another 677 bags were transferred to Qingdao on the same ship. In addition, the company's Suzhou ship arrived directly from Saigon with 24,463 bags, which were imported yesterday afternoon and are currently being unloaded.

### Flour Transactions Limited to the Local Street; Wheat Remains Firm

Although the flour market is at the beginning of the week, transactions are weak. This is because the rice market panic in recent days has dampened the spirits of those engaged in the grain business. Sales from visiting merchants have also stalled due to high prices, resulting in a bleak market. Only retail transactions are taking place on the local street. The total volume of transactions in the market is estimated to be about 30,000 bags. Grade 2 flour remains at the original price of 8.7 yuan, with repossessed goods being even higher than the factory price by 20 or 30 cents. In addition, 500 bags of flour were transported to Siam today.

The wheat market has also seen little progress. Only a few thousand bags arrived in the past two days, and although factory demand is strong, it is hesitant to buy at a small scale. Sellers are unwilling to compromise due to high production prices. As a result, the total transaction volume is estimated to be about 3,000 to 4,000 bags, with a selling price of 14.7 or 8 yuan. Extra high-grade goods still require 15 yuan.

### Oil Market: Potential for Tight Supply of Raw Soybean Oil Remains

The soybean oil market is soft, slightly weaker than last week. However, the underlying situation is not too bad. Although the overall situation is affected by the fear of one's neighbor's misfortune, the potential for drastic changes is still lacking. This is because people see that there will be no smooth arrival of sources this winter, and the base stock is also depleted, resulting in a firm market. Yesterday, only 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at 110 yuan, 200 cans of Jiangbei canned soybean oil were traded at 106 yuan, and 16 barrels of barrel oil were traded at 105 yuan.

The raw oil market is expecting prices to rise but is currently falling. Transactions included 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 75 yuan, an order for 300 pieces for delivery in three or four weeks at 79 yuan, and 1,400 cans of Jiangbei canned oil at 97 yuan. The destination for the canned raw oil was through agents in Hong Kong, while the rest was for the local market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Peanuts and Bean Cakes Transported to Southern China

Today, a large quantity of miscellaneous grains was transported to Southern China, including 1,310 bags of soybeans and 1,240 pieces of bean cake transported to Xiamen, as well as 390 bags of raw peanuts and 3,000 bags of soybeans transported to Hong Kong. In addition, 200 bags of soybeans were transported to Tuiluo.

### Finance Good Impression of the Foreign Exchange Market, Exchange Rates Continue to Loosen

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC listing remained uneventful. The unofficial British-American exchange rate continued its loosening trend, mainly due to the recent successive victories of the Chinese army on all fronts, coupled with widespread rumors of the recapture of Nanchang, hopeful news of a successful Sino-American mega-loan, and a foreign news report suggesting that a certain party is about to open the Yangtze River. This point, regarding export trade, is expected to bring changes, potentially impacting the exchange market. As a result, traders entered the market, many selling. Throughout the day, the market initially opened flat, with the Hua Hsing Bank first selling, quickly followed by speculators. The market immediately showed slight firmness, but frequent settlements for spot coal, cotton, wheat, tobacco, etc., briefly shifted it to stability. Around 11:00 AM, the Hong Kong telegram caused market congestion, and the market loosened again. In the afternoon, it continued to loosen, with the British pound once reaching a high of 4/7 1875, and the US dollar also firming to 7.75. There was a strong bearish sentiment, amplified by the Hong Kong telegram and aggressive selling from the yarn merchants, etc. Later, the Wing On and Yien Yieh Banks seized the opportunity to buy low, resulting in a slight rebound, closing at 4/6 875 and 7.6875, respectively. As a result, the British pound weakened by 0.09375, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.05625 compared to the end of last week. Although there were some forward transactions, the trend remained similar to the spot market, and one expert observed that, given the current influx of remittances from overseas Chinese, the prospects are quite optimistic.

Market Momentum: Supply Exceeds Demand

Early in the morning, both the London large-denomination and the American bank prices were closed, with no telegrams received. London raw gold remained fixed. The exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar strengthened by 0.0075 against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai currency, and strengthened by 0.0625 against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's opening, the spot selling prices were 4/5 9375 for the British pound and 7.53125 for the US dollar, with no changes compared to the end of last week. After opening, the Hua Hsing Bank first sold, and speculators followed suit slightly, stabilizing the market with a slightly firm tone. It is estimated that spot British pounds were sold to foreign banks at 4/6 09375 and 625, and spot US dollars were sold at 7.5625 and 59375. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax also showed no increase or decrease. Subsequently, spot settlements in the foreign firms’ sector were frequent, leading to a return to flatness. It is estimated that foreign banks such as Chase Manhattan Bank settled spot US dollars at 7.5625, and January US dollars at 7.4375, and February US dollars at 7.375 and 2125. At the same time, a Chinese bank also settled January US dollars at 7.5 with a foreign bank. Around 11:00 AM, telegrams from Hong Kong came flooding in, supply exceeding demand, and the market showed a slight loosening again. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British pounds to MacGregor & Co. and other foreign firms at 4/6 625, and sold spot US dollars to foreign firms and foreign companies at 7.59375. At noon, trading was sparse and stagnant. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were still 4/6 625 for the British pound and 7.59375 for the US dollar, with the British pound weakening slightly by 0.03125 and the US dollar firming slightly by 0.0625 compared to the morning opening.

Hong Kong Again Had Selling

Later, due to widespread bearish rumors, and telegrams from Hong Kong, etc., again caused aggressive selling, with speculators such as yarn merchants also competing to sell off. In addition, American commercial banks had a weak appetite, so the market gradually loosened. The British pound rose from 4/6 65625 to 71875, and the US dollar rose from 7.65625 to 75. Later, HSBC and Wing On, etc., seizing the opportunity to buy low, were happy to absorb, and the situation rebounded slightly. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4/6 6875 for the British pound and 7.6875 for the US dollar. Central bank's British pound for this month was 4/6 671875 and US dollar 7.65625, and January British pound was 4/6 65625 and US dollar 7.5625. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the current British pound weakened by 0.09375, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.15625.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops

Hong Kong, 18th - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot and futures British pound remained unchanged. Spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625, to 24.5625. Spot Shanghai currency fell by 2 yuan, to 323 yuan. Spot Japanese currency weakened by 0.0025, to 104.5 yuan. At 10:20 AM, spot Shanghai currency continued to fall by 1 yuan, to 322 yuan.

Shanghai currency was 0.25 yuan, to 105.5 yuan. "Joint banknotes" on the unofficial market were cheaper by 0.025 yuan, to 94.5 yuan.

### Widespread Bearish News, Gold Market Plunges

Yesterday's spot raw gold market, with a worsening environment, saw a growing downward trend. This was mainly due to the recent frequent reports of Chinese military victories, coupled with news of the recapture of Nanchang in the afternoon, and talk of a successful Sino-American mega-loan. As a result, foreign exchange loosened, and spot raw gold plunged by 44 yuan. The market was chaotic at the initial opening. At 9:30 AM, the difference between the high and low prices reached as much as 35 yuan. One price was 4,175 yuan, and the other was 4,140 yuan, both serving as the opening price for the day. This caused a dispute between buyers and sellers, each holding their ground. After mediation by fellow traders, a compromise was reached to resolve the issue. However, having two prices at the opening is only seen in this black market. Shortly after, the securities firms continued to sell, dropping further to 4,135 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange stabilized, Hong Kong firms bought over 200 taels, and the noon closing price was 4,145 yuan. In the afternoon, the downward trend expanded due to widespread bearish news in the market, and the foreign exchange market simultaneously strengthened. In addition, the securities firms and others helped Tianjin firms sell, and many floating profits were cut short. The price once plummeted to a low of 4,088 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rebounded slightly, it also rebounded to close at 4,117 yuan. Total transactions for the day were around 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops quoted 5 yuan less, while customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Raw Gold Plunged 44 Yuan

From this morning, with each bar (ten taels), the market was chaotic at the initial opening. At the 9:30 AM opening, there were two prices at the same time, with a difference of as much as 35 yuan. One was for 40 taels sold by a silver shop on behalf of a Hong Kong firm to a gold shop, at 4,175 yuan. The other was for 50 taels sold by a securities firm to a money exchange shop, at 4,140 yuan. Both served as the opening price. Compared to the end of last week, the former was 14 yuan higher, while the latter was 21 yuan lower. Shortly after, the securities firm again sold 20 taels to a gold shop, at 4,135 yuan. Due to the slight loosening of foreign exchange, the foreign exchange suddenly reported stability, prompting money exchange shops, etc., to buy cheaply, and the market stabilized slightly, rebounding by 24 yuan. A money exchange shop bought 10 taels, at 4,159 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange market loosened again, and floating profits were quickly settled. In addition, the securities firm resumed selling, dropping by 17 yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop, at 4,142 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop bought around 100 taels, rising by 6 yuan, and bought 40 taels from a securities firm, at 4,148 yuan. At noon, the money exchange shops and silver shops sold to each other, retreating to 4,142 yuan. Nearing the close, a silver shop’s buying momentum revived, vigorously buying over 200 taels. However, sellers did not weaken, only raising the price by 3 yuan. The silver shop bought a total of 130 taels from the money exchange shops, etc., all at 4,145 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was 4 yuan lower, with the initial transaction of 10 taels done by gold shops, at 4,141 yuan. Subsequently, due to numerous bearish news in the market, coupled with the foreign exchange market strengthening, and securities firms and a money exchange shop selling on behalf of Tianjin firms, while floating profits were also being cut short, the price plummeted by 53 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange shop, at 4,088 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange softened slightly, and certain money exchange shops frequently bought, it rebounded by 30 yuan. The securities firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange shop, at 4,110 yuan. Subsequently, the gold shop sold, dropping again to 4,112 yuan. Nearing the close, a silver shop came to buy dozens of taels, rising by 5 yuan. The silver shop bought 20 taels from a gold shop, at 4,117 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the end of last week, it fell by 44 yuan. After closing, sellers were still eager, but buyers did not dare to take over. Even at 10 yuan lower than the closing price, there were still no takers. The entire day's fluctuation was 87 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold shops’ own brand gold was several yuan higher than raw gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.

Gold Jewelry Quoted 5 Yuan Less

Gold jewelry in silver shops was initially exchanged at 420 yuan per tael at Dah Tong Hang. By 3:00 PM, it was quoted 5 yuan less. As a result, Dah Tong Hang revised its quote to 415 yuan. The quote for new shops was the same as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by around 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fell More Than They Rose

Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold pounds was very abundant, and the market price was weak. Customers, money exchange shops, etc., actively sold British and American gold bills, and the market price fell sharply. US dollar bills fell to 13.17 yuan in the morning and had already fallen into the 13 yuan range by the evening, at 12.99 yuan. Hong Kong "franc bills" had ample supply. Singapore and Dutch bills had very little demand, and their prices were also weak. Canadian bills followed the US dollar bills, falling rapidly. Japanese gold bills had continued strong demand due to profit-taking by customer groups, and the market price rose sharply, with the evening price being 1.0317 yuan. Korean bills were also firm, with the evening price being 1.11 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 1.3 yuan, British gold bills fell by 0.5 yuan, American gold pounds fell by 1.2 yuan, American gold bills fell by 0.33 yuan, Hong Kong bills fell by 0.02 yuan, franc bills fell by 0.001 yuan, Singapore bills fell by 0.05 yuan, Dutch bills fell by 0.2 yuan, Annam bills fell by 0.02 yuan, Canadian bills fell by 0.2 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities, Smooth Progress on the Front Lines, Government Bonds Surge by More Than One Yuan

Yesterday's securities market, due to smooth progress in the war, triggered short covering and long positions being added, and the market price suddenly surged upwards by more than one yuan. This was the most seen after more than a month of brewing. This upward trend was partly due to the shift in the current situation, and partly due to the supply and demand of chips, with no relationship to fundamental issues. Most of the buying and selling yesterday involved old parties covering shorts or selling off, with few new parties taking long positions. The scope of market fluctuations gradually expanded. Tian Sheng Da Feng Ten and Xin Fu, etc., bought a significant amount, while Chang Ji and Yong Kang sold a significant amount. The market rose by about half a yuan before noon, and people's sentiment turned upwards. In the afternoon, Xin Fu, Shun Lian Yi, and Da Tong all bought, and Class C bonds quickly left the 8 yuan range, and the situation was quite good. The selling parties were mostly Run Li Hao. The opening today should continue to rise. Yesterday's market prices all rose, with gains ranging from 0.79 yuan to 1.13 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded, with a price of 40.075 yuan per share.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Brokers Association was extremely firm throughout the day, and prices did not change much. General interest has once again focused on rubber stocks, and buyers appeared immediately when prices rebounded. Industrial stocks tended to be firmer in the afternoon, presumably due to rumors that the lower reaches of the Yangtze River might be reopened. Overall, the market situation was unremarkable, and transactions were not very large. This was probably due to the approaching holiday season.

### Yarn, Abundant Inventory, Sluggish Yarn Market, Double Horse Falls by Ten Yuan

The yarn market continued to decline, and the upward trend has stopped. This is because although the overseas cotton market is firm, the upward momentum is peaceful, and temporarily in a state of hovering. Local demand in this city is inherently light, and sales channels are narrow, so the market situation is softening. Therefore, when the overseas cotton market's upward force is certain, the local yarn market will also become sluggish. However, in terms of raw materials, there should be no major decline. However, with abundant inventory, general hoarders and traders are heavily stocked, and with the arrival of the Gregorian New Year, if customer demand does not develop, market prices may fluctuate for a period of time.

The morning opening of the current yarn market was dull and listless. Overseas cotton was still rising at 7-8 points, but there were very few buyers in the market, and sellers increased instead. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 740 yuan, down 2 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, with the foreign exchange flat and weak, the momentum became even more relaxed. At the same time, actual sales were stagnant and unchanged, and the market situation gradually declined, falling directly to 732 yuan at the close. The statistics for transactions in half a day show a total of 1,060 bales. The market prices for 20-count Bianma yarn fell by 10 yuan, Tiannu yarn fell by 9 yuan, and Shuang Diqiu yarn fell by 9 yuan. Today, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 195 pieces to Xiamen, 170 pieces to Hong Kong, 955 pieces to Siam, 3 pieces to Saigon, and 20 pieces to Djeruk. The amounts bought by various customer groups are listed below:

Hong Kong: 225 Inland: 35

Traders: 820 Total: 1,060

### Prices Enter High Territory, Cotton Market Turns Quiet

Cotton trading has become more subdued, due to the firm overseas cotton market, but the upward momentum has weakened, and the local cotton yarn inventory is too thick, and prices have entered a high territory. However, it is still cheaper than overseas cotton, and with the Lunar New Year approaching, general cotton merchants are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting for changes before deciding. With this in mind, the cotton market may be affected by people's sentiment and tend to loosen slightly. However, factories have a little appetite, but trading between traders has decreased significantly, so the market price is dull and listless. From northern Jiangsu, a total of 6,989 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived in two days, 1,732 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 830 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Beishi cotton: 164.50 Shanghai advanced 1,000 bales

Tongzhou cotton: 172.00 Shenxin advanced 300 bales

Huocao bales: 163.00 Also: 500 bales

Tonghua American type: 197.00 Xinyu Advanced 300 pieces

Jijiao cotton: 74.00 Also: 300 bales

Nantai: 167.00 Tongcheng Advanced 1,000 dan

Tonghua: 167.00 Trader advanced 200 bales

Also: 18.00 Also: 100 bales

Another news item: overseas cotton prices. The New York cotton market is becoming more stable. Yesterday, due to active spot trading and purchases by overseas merchants, and due to poor weather reports in cotton-growing areas, and partial short covering, the closing price rose by more than ten points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than ten rupees. Liverpool and Egypt were closed.

Shanghai foreign cotton: Yesterday, due to the loosening of exchange rates, trading was slightly more active. However, due to the excessive surge in overseas cotton markets, there were only sporadic spot transactions. Those who sold were all traders who had earned large profits and wanted to profit. Transactions from foreign firms were very quiet. Japanese manufacturers have also been quiet for a long time. American cotton has arrived in Shanghai one after another recently, and a huge amount will arrive at the end of this month. The cotton market yesterday, with the US dollar at 7.625, converted to the factory price as follows:

20-count American middling: 240.65

Also: Lower grade: 23.30

32-count Also: 247.65

Also: Lower grade: 141.55

42-count Also: 35.15

Also: Lower grade: 243.30

600 pieces of Indian cotton, shipped from Kedah by the British Company Tiara Wa (transliteration), arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th).

### Silk and Tea: Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Rise Sharply, European Funds Escape, Storing Silk in America

The Yokohama silk market experienced an unusually sharp rise this morning. Spot prices were 2,200 yuan, up 60 yuan. The afternoon close was 2,210 yuan. Near-term futures were 2,200 yuan, and the afternoon close was 2,295 yuan, up 125 yuan compared to Saturday morning. Long-term futures were 2,190 yuan, and the afternoon close was 2,279 yuan, up 109 yuan. It is predicted that New York will also rise accordingly.

The local silk market has also risen sharply, but silk trading is very limited. White silk at grades 7 and 8 was priced at 6,100 yuan, up 1,150 yuan compared to the beginning of the month, which can be described as an unprecedented phenomenon. Chefoo silk has also risen sharply, estimated to be up by about 400 yuan. A total of 70 bales were traded yesterday.

The recent rise in the silk market has been driven by competition between Japan and the United States, and the extent of firmness seems endless. However, actual sales in New York have not increased significantly. Examining the reasons, it can be divided into the following three points: (1) the continuation of Japanese and American merchants' influence on us; (2) the trend of hoarding caused by the escape of European post-war floating capital to the United States; (3) the decline in Japanese silk production this year, that is, one of the characteristics of Japan due to the war affecting production procedures. Domestic silk prices, in addition to the exchange rate relationship, are only following the trend in this current wave.

### Piece Goods, Counter-Offensive Victories, Zhejiang and Jiangxi Demand Revives

With the recent counter-offensive victories in Xiang and Gan, demand from Zhejiang and Jiangxi has revived. Demand from the Nanyang area remains strong. As a result, although Eastern cloth has fallen due to selling by hoarders, domestic cloth remains stable. British merchants Ewo and Jardine Matheson have increased prices, with coarse cloth and bleached cloth each rising by about half a jiao per piece. Nearly 100 cases of Fire Wheel bleached cloth were opened, priced at 17.5 yuan per piece. Transactions on this street included over 500 pieces of white cloth, bleached cloth, dyed cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants bought over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, striped cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. Fujian and Guangdong merchants bought 50-60 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants bought over 100 cases of colored cloth and colored twill. Nanyang merchants bought over 6,000 pieces of bleached cloth, printed cloth, and colored cloth. According to a letter from the Da Yuan Textile Co., Ltd., "The price of 17.75 yuan per piece for Da Yuan brand fine cloth produced by the company, published in the market price column on the 16th (Saturday), is slightly incorrect. It has been found that the factory sold 1,000 pieces of Da Yuan brand fine cloth to Bao Da Xiang in this city that day, with a selling price of 19 yuan per piece, which differs by 1.25 yuan from what was published." It is specially published here to correct it.

Eastern cloth: Yesterday, with sluggish sales to customers, there were more sellers than buyers in the market, and the market continued to decline. White cloth, Dragon Head Fine Cloth, opened at 21.4 yuan per piece in the morning, and once fell to 20.085 yuan. The closing price rose slightly, to 20.095 yuan. Compared to the end of last week, it fell by 0.6 yuan per piece. Dragon Head Fine Twill was 19.9 yuan, down 0.45 yuan per piece. Transactions were not many, and the situation was very soft.

Exports: 310 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 19th, 40 pieces to Xiamen, 160 pieces to Siam, 60 pieces to Saigon, 70 pieces to Djeruk, and 45 pieces to Yantai.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Remain High

Yesterday, the sugar market remained tight. The association's listed prices: 24 crude sand white, spot goods, outside warehouse, 59.5-59.6 yuan. Taikoo Car White B mark, Western warehouse goods, 60-60.3 yuan. HX mark, Western warehouse goods, 58 yuan, Eastern warehouse, 57.5 yuan. H mark, Car Red, 45 yuan. Dutch red MP mark, 46-46.5 yuan. Domestic sugar also remained firm. Zhang Diao was opened at 108 bags, 45 yuan. Special Gao Mian red was 80 bags, 48.5 yuan.

### Japanese Military Authorities Claim: The Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Will Be Opened, Restrictions Are Very Harsh, Foreign Merchants Do Not Value It, Opening Is Not Confirmed, Only Lip Service

Regarding the Yangtze River shipping, it has been stagnant since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Since last winter, when the Japanese army arrived in Wuhan, the Zhejiang shipping on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been completely monopolized by the Japanese. The British and American countries believe that the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have no military status, and the suspension of merchant ships of various countries has had a profound and significant impact on trade with China. The Japanese side, in view of the seriousness of the attitudes of various countries, has repeatedly declared that it is considering opening the Yangtze River. However, due to various concerns on the part of the Japanese side, no concrete expression has been made. Yesterday, the Japanese suddenly announced that it was preparing to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River downstream of Nanjing, but it still did not explicitly state the exact date of its opening. According to foreign sources, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River downstream of Nanjing have a very weak relationship with European and American business with China. The Japanese side still does not want to open the area downstream of Hankou, and the Japanese declaration proves that the date of opening the area downstream of Hankou is far away, making European and American business with China feel that the future is bleak. The news from all parties is recorded as follows:

Japanese Authorities Issue Statement: Shanghai, 18th - The Allied Press reported that since the outbreak of the China Incident, the Japanese army has blockaded the Yangtze River for absolutely necessary military operations. However, the third countries have repeatedly requested the Japanese authorities to open the Yangtze River. In view of the recent situation, the Japanese authorities have gradually decided to ease the situation, and decided to open the Yangtze River downstream of Nanjing, subject to certain restrictions, within the scope of not hindering public security and combat operations, and to prepare for the formulation of customs inspection and navigation rules. The press department of the Japanese Army Headquarters in China and the press division of the Chinese Fleet jointly issued the following statement at 2:00 p.m. on the 18th: The absolutely necessary closure of transportation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for combat purposes has gradually eased. In view of this fact, the Japanese land and naval authorities stationed in China have decided to proceed with preparations to open the Yangtze River downstream of Nanjing within the necessary restrictions to maintain public order and combat operations.

No Definite Date for Opening: The English-language Great American Evening Post said that the Allied News Agency reported today (18th) that the Japanese Fleet and Army Headquarters in China issued a joint communique at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (17th), stating that the Yangtze River, which had been closed for absolute military needs, has gradually eased in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Japanese land and naval authorities, in view of this, and in order to adapt to this situation, have decided to proceed with various preparations to reopen the Yangtze River below Nanjing, but must be restricted by military needs and methods to maintain peace and order. According to the communique, the Yangtze River waterway, which has been blockaded since August 1937, will not be reopened on what date, and general ships will be allowed to sail.

The Scope of Various Restrictions Is Very Broad: A reporter from Dazhong News Agency inquired about the opinions of qualified parties in the foreign business community here last night. According to reports, the signs of the Japanese army's measures to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River can be determined from the perspective of the restrictions adopted by its military authorities. The scope of the restrictions can even be expanded to include medical supplies, and resources needed by the Japanese army will also be prohibited from export.

Not Allowed to Be Optimistic About the Future of Opening: According to well-informed sources, the Japanese-controlled Nanjing puppet "Reform Government" is likely to formulate regulations on import and export trade on the Yangtze River, so that the severe restrictions suffered by foreign countries are like those in Tianjin. Therefore, although the news of the opening is quite happy, it is not easy to be optimistic about the future.

The British Side Has Not Received Any News: The reporter then asked Sir Philip Ten, the British Consul-General in Shanghai. According to reports, no formal notice has been received from the Japanese side regarding this matter. Only read the news from the evening newspaper and expressed the hope that the news was correct. A senior official at the Shanghai Office of the British Embassy also said last night that he had not received a formal notice.

### The Ministry of Finance Responded to Three Organizations, Transferring Securities and Currencies in the Shanghai Market, Sent a Letter to the Bank of China to Issue Supplementary Vouchers and Fractional Vouchers, and Asked the General Office of the Four Banks to Exchange Yuan Vouchers, The Saying That Supplementary Vouchers Have Been Shipped to Shanghai Is Not True

After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Exchange Associations jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting the adjustment of supplementary currency vouchers in the Shanghai market, the Ministry of Finance received a reply yesterday, saying, "Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, Money Exchange Association, I have read it all. After checking the shortage of supplementary currency vouchers in the Shanghai market, it has been approved one after another, and the Central Bank will print fractional currency vouchers. In addition to sending another letter to the Central Bank to quickly issue the printed fractional currency vouchers and supplementary currency vouchers as appropriate, and sending a letter to the General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, instructing the banks to quickly transfer one-yuan vouchers to the Shanghai market to facilitate adjustment, I am hereby informed, Ministry of Finance, Yuan Yuqian Yin." The New Sound Agency reporter learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank that the rumor that the bank had shipped a batch of supplementary vouchers and opened the box yesterday to exchange them was absolutely untrue. Yesterday morning, because a newspaper published the news, more than 300 people went to request the exchange. After the bank explained that the report was inaccurate, they dispersed.

### The Banking and Financial Industries Agree to Advance Funds to Order Rice; Rice Hoarding Should Be Immediately Stopped; Rice Merchants Should Voluntarily Further Reduce Rice Prices; The Court Earnestly Admonishes Rice-Snatching Offenders; The Adjustment Association Plans to Fundamentally Resolve the People's Food Crisis

The banking and financial industries' trade association agreed to the request of the People's Food Adjustment Association to advance funds to order foreign rice, and held a joint meeting at 11:30 AM yesterday at the association's fifth floor on Hong Kong Road. Those present included Wu Yunzhai, Wang Boyuan, Pei Yunqing, Xu Jiqing, Pan Jiufen, Wang Shaoxian, Wang Zihou, Zhang Zhuyu, Zhu Sensheng, Qu Jigang, Ye Fuxiao, Hu Xian, Jin Zongcheng, and others. Kui Yanfang of the People's Food Adjustment Association was also in attendance. Chairman Wu Yunzhai commenced the meeting, followed by Kui Yanfang reporting on the establishment of the association, requesting the banking and financial industries to provide financial assistance to order foreign rice from abroad and transport it to Shanghai to alleviate the people's food shortage. Discussion then began, and the motion to advance funds to order foreign rice was passed on the spot due to the matter being related to the adjustment of the people's food supply. The details regarding the method of advancing funds will be discussed further. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. Furthermore, it was learned that the first batch of funds advanced by the banking and financial industries to order foreign rice is tentatively set at 500,000 National Currency. Those wishing to entrust the ordering of foreign rice must pay a deposit of twenty yuan per bag, with the remaining amount being advanced by the banking and financial industries.

Adjustment Association Rice Ordering Proposal: The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association held a meeting at 10 AM yesterday at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club, announcing its establishment. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiqing, Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, Wang Yuqing, Zhang Jiguang, Wu Yunzhai, Lu Gaoyi, Li Wenjie, Kui Yanfang, Hu Yongqi, Cai Renbao, and others.

(5) The date of the first board of directors meeting was resolved to be December 20th (Wednesday) at noon. (The association's purpose is omitted.)

The Court Admonishes Rice-Snatching Offenders: Since certain speculators disregard the people's suffering, only knowing to fill their own pockets, and hoard rice, causing rice prices to rise daily, even exceeding forty yuan, resulting in serious impact on salaried workers and the poor, the Public Concession’s Bureau of Works has exhausted all efforts to unite various sectors to suppress rice prices, but has ultimately been unable to make them rapidly decline. Thus, recently, numerous rice-snatching incidents have occurred. The police authorities have had to adopt protection policies for legitimate rice merchants. Between 10:45 AM and 11:45 AM on the 16th of this month, within the Chengdu Road police precinct, (1) Xiangshun Rice Store at 14 Chongqing Road, (2) Sanmao Rice Store at 125 Chengdu Road, (3) Yuansheng Rice Store at 191 Dagu Road, and (4) Xiangxing Rice Store at 64 Rugu Road all experienced large numbers of poor people rushing in to snatch rice. Fortunately, the Chengdu Road police received reports and immediately ordered a large team of detectives to rush to suppress the situation. The rice stores did not suffer any losses, except that Sanmao had forty bags of flour, valued at 500 yuan, stolen. At the time, the police arrested Wang Shigen, Qi Zhilong, Ka Rongheng, Chi Xiaomei, Liu Jinkang, Wang Zhipin, Wu Shanliang, Gu Youshan, Jiang Qingyun, and the woman Wang Qian, a total of ten people. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police initially prosecuted them for disturbing order and robbery. Under questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, the defendants all gave evasive answers and denied snatching rice. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian then amended the prosecution articles, accusing them of snatching, and stated his opinion, saying that the fact that the defendants snatched rice had been proven by police officers and was undeniable. However, after examining why the defendants acted in this way, the reason was none other than the high price of rice, the inability to purchase rice, and the desperation of hunger. The situation was still pardonable. Furthermore, the defendants had no prior criminal records and were not without excusable circumstances. He requested the court to impose a lenient sentence. Judge Fu, after reviewing the report, sentenced the ten defendants, including Wang Shigen, to three months imprisonment each, with a two-year suspended sentence. After the sentencing, he admonished the defendants, saying that regarding the high price of rice affecting the livelihood of common people, the court and the Public Concession authorities were currently making their best efforts to lower it. Although they resorted to snatching rice due to the inability to purchase it, they should know that such actions were sufficient to disrupt social order. Although the court sympathized with their plight, it was difficult to maintain social stability without giving a warning. However, after examining that they had no prior criminal records and that several family members depended on them for their livelihood, the court imposed a light sentence of three months imprisonment, and granted a two-year suspended sentence. However, if they did not repent after being released and engaged in such actions again, the court would have no way to pardon them. For the sake of maintaining order, they would have to be severely punished. Furthermore, at 9 AM on the 16th, a rice-snatching incident also occurred at Shenchang Rice Store at 200 Kaifeng Road. White rice valued at approximately 175 yuan was stolen. The police arrested two suspects, He Xihan and Chen Yinglong, and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Under questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for theft. Judge Zhong Qing declared He and Chen not guilty due to insufficient evidence. After these snatching cases occurred in the French Concession, the French police sent detectives to arrest poor male and female civilians who had snatched rice, including Zhou Deshan, Wu Gaolin, Chen Tingxiang, Fu Baolin, Jin A'gen, and others (for snatching from Dingtai Rice Store at 128 Pushi Road), and Li Wenrong, Hu Wanqiao, Yang Xiaolouzi, Shi Youfu, Yu Bingnan, Liu Jinliang, He Xushi, Ma Qinshi, Chen Hanshi, Zhao Lishi, Wang Heshi, and Lu Luoshi (for snatching from the rice store at 1269 Haig Road). Furthermore, Li Yuntang was arrested for stabbing a shop assistant's finger with a small knife while snatching rice at a rice store at 191 Gansidong Road at 10 AM on the 16th. Yesterday afternoon, they were separately sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer Yao Zhaodi filed public prosecutions in batches for the crime of snatching and presented the case. The investigating detectives then reported the circumstances of arresting the defendants, and stated that the rice store owners only reported to the police when the incidents occurred. When the defendants were arrested and the accusers were summoned for investigation, they all refused to come, so they were even less willing to come to the court to testify today. After Judge Sun Pengwei's interrogation, the defendants all admitted to snatching rice. As a result, the court sentenced the defendants, who were all ignorant first-time offenders, to imprisonment for two to three months each, and granted them suspended sentences and released them. However, regarding the last defendant, Li Yuntang, due to his act of injuring another person's body, the court had to summon the accuser to testify and ordered a postponement for further review. Li was returned to custody. If the accuser refused to appear next time, an arrest warrant would be issued. As for the rumors that various rice stores in the Concession had stopped operating, the responsible authorities have denied this news. The rice stores in the Concession have always been protected by the police and have continued to operate as usual.

Order to Resume Operations and Reduce Rice Prices

The Shanghai Rice Merchant Association dispatched Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Qu Zhenhua, and three others to the Public Concession Bureau of Works again at 10 AM yesterday to meet with Deputy Director H.E. He Dekui, requesting the Concession authorities to earnestly protect rice merchants. Deputy Director He agreed to do so and said that he had notified the police department. At the same time, he ordered the three representatives to convey to all rice stores that they should resume operations as usual to maintain the people's food supply, and hoped that they would voluntarily reduce rice prices to the extent possible. It is heard that the Rice Merchant Association will immediately convene a meeting to convey the intentions of the Concession authorities.

Continuous Imports of Foreign Rice: Recently, imports of foreign rice have been continuous and numerous, as repeatedly noted in the newspapers. Most of the foreign rice comes from Hong Kong. It has been a long time since rice was directly shipped from Saigon to Shanghai. It is now known that the Qiongzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, carrying over eight thousand one hundred bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong and one thousand and two bags shipped directly from Saigon. Furthermore, the Suzhou wheel imported yesterday had fourteen thousand four hundred and sixty-three bags shipped directly from Saigon, which are currently being unloaded. The Haikou wheel, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 17th), carried thirteen thousand three hundred and fifty-three bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which have already been unloaded. Another six hundred and seventy-seven bags are scheduled to be shipped to Qingdao on the same ship today.

Police Readiness Prevents Rice-Snatching: At 1 PM yesterday, over two hundred poor people suddenly gathered in front of Tongfa Rice Store on Annan Road in the Common Concession, intending to snatch rice. The store, seeing the situation was not good, urgently telegraphed the police, who dispatched a red police car. After the general public was dispersed, they again crowded in front of the Huasheng Flour Mill on Hartung Road, opening the store door, but were blocked by the inner iron door, so the factory did not suffer any losses either. Currently, in order to prevent rice-snatching, various rice stores are keeping their doors tightly closed.

### Mail Between Shanghai and Hong Kong: Implementation of Inspection

Since the outbreak of the European War, the Hong Kong government authorities have begun inspecting all types of mail. It is now known that recently, mail sent from Shanghai to Hong Kong, or mail sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai, is being inspected in Hong Kong. In recent days, mail arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong has been opened and inspected, and affixed with a signed strip with the English words "Opened Censor Hongkong." However, the Hong Kong authorities are extremely meticulous and swift in this regard, so postal delivery between Shanghai and Hong Kong is still very convenient.

### The Bureau of Works' Debt is Thirty Million: Seems to Seek to Increase Taxes: Finance Director Moore-Chiueh Indicates That Temporary Loans Also Amount to Over Ten Million

The English-language *North China Daily Mail* states that upon reading the Public Concession Bureau of Works' report, it is certain that in the spring of 1937, Shanghai already knew of the danger of war, and that the Nationalist government abruptly took economic measures, withdrawing silver from the Chinese silver market. As a result, the legal tender was to be severely tested in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bureau of Works still incurred debts in the first half of 1937, the number of which reached 33,695,368.71 yuan at the beginning of this year. After the outbreak of the war, another 14,780,360 yuan was "temporarily borrowed." The loans borrowed successively were mostly US dollars and British pounds for convenience, converted into legal tender and recorded in the Bureau of Works' financial accounts. However, the Bureau has a different explanation for the deficit financial situation. According to Bureau of Works Finance Director Moore-Chiueh, who told reporters this morning (the 18th) that if the Bureau of Works could borrow legal tender-denominated loans from the public with low interest rates, it would never borrow foreign currency loans. The Bureau of Works' debt at the beginning of this year totaled 33,695,368.71 yuan, including municipal bonds denominated in foreign currency and converted into legal tender. The foreign currency overdraft from banks at the beginning of this year was 843,993.87 yuan. In addition, there were temporary loans of 14,780,360 yuan. No other figures can be obtained for these loans and their interest within the current fiscal year because the exchange rate of legal tender will fluctuate again. The current figures are based on the financial report made at the beginning of this year. Due to changes in the foreign exchange value of legal tender, the financial situation of the Bureau of Works will generally change. The Bureau of Works has not borrowed from the public since the outbreak of the war in 1937, but in the past two years, the Bureau had to borrow foreign currency loans from private individuals to meet the Bureau's special debts, such as the overdraft of 843,933.87 yuan from banks. Under the current circumstances, the Bureau of Works cannot borrow funds due to extremely high interest rates. Speculators make huge profits by trading foreign exchange, and these people are only prepared to lend foreign currency at high interest rates. Even when the situation was more favorable in previous years, it was still difficult for the Bureau of Works to borrow legal tender loans. However, the interest rates on loans borrowed in the past few years were lower. According to him, it is often quite difficult for the Bureau of Works to borrow funds at present, and the interest rate of at least seven percent will place an almost unbearable burden on taxpayers. However, suspending borrowing to wait for a more favorable situation will not increase the burden, only taxes will be temporarily increased. The Bureau of Works' huge debt, totaling 33,695,368.71 yuan, includes the 6% loan of 1926 of 6,713,286.71 yuan, the 5% loan of 1934 of 10,404,700 yuan, the 5.5% loan of 1936 of 7,577,400 yuan, and the 5% loan of 1937 of 9,000,000 yuan. The temporary loans totaling 14,780,360 yuan include the British gold loan of 335,000 pounds borrowed from the Public Concession deposit account, converted to legal tender of 50,050,000 yuan, the US dollar loan of 510,000 yuan, converted to legal tender of 3,264,000 yuan, and another loan of 1,466,360 yuan. In addition, there is an overdraft of 843,993.87 yuan. At the end of the current fiscal year, these figures will be completely changed due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange value of legal tender. Reporters also learned this morning that the Bureau of Works previously sold the Electrical Affairs Department to the Shanghai Power Company, obtaining 81,000,000 taels, which have been used to repay the Bureau's previous loans and various debts. According to the Electrical Affairs Department sales agreement, the Shanghai Power Company first paid 36,348,200 taels, which the Bureau used to fully repay its long-overdue debts. According to a Bureau of Works official, after the Shanghai War broke out in 1937, the Bureau of Works' deficits and debts were made up for by the installments paid by the Power Company. In subsequent years, the payments from the Power Company were used for the Bureau of Works' development, such as road construction and other public works.

### Chiang Kai-shek's Former Wife, Ms. Mao, Dies Tragically: Unfortunate Incident During Japanese Aircraft Bombing of Xikou; Wuling School Buildings Also Slightly Damaged

The English-language *North China Daily Mail* states that according to reliable news received late today (the 18th), Chiang Kai-shek's divorced wife, Ms. Mao, died in the Japanese air raid on Fenghua, Zhejiang last Tuesday. It is said that at the time, Ms. Mao believed that Japanese aircraft would concentrate their attacks on Chiang's new mansion, so she and her relatives went to Chiang's old residence several miles away to seek refuge. Although a strong underground bomb shelter had been built in the new mansion, it was flooded. Ms. Mao immediately decided to go to the old residence to seek refuge. The Japanese aircraft involved in this bombing numbered six, flying low and not encountering anti-aircraft fire. Everyone believed that after the Japanese aircraft pilots saw someone escaping into Chiang's old residence, they dropped several bombs, destroying the house and killing Ms. Mao. Wuling School, established by Chiang Kai-shek, was also bombed and slightly damaged. Chiang's new mansion and Wuling School are both located in Xikou, a few miles from Fenghua. It takes an hour to get there by car from Ningbo. Ms. Mao was slightly older than Chiang Kai-shek and married him thirty years ago. After divorcing in 1927, Chiang Kai-shek married Ms. Soong Mei-ling in Shanghai. However, Ms. Mao still lived in Chiang's new mansion. Occasionally, when Chiang Kai-shek and Madam Chiang were present, she would move into the old residence. However, she respected Chiang Kai-shek as before and prepared his favorite dishes to entertain him. Ms. Mao was a devout Buddhist. When her son, Ching-kuo, returned from the Soviet Union with his wife and child, Ms. Mao was very pleased and spent money to put on a three-day opera in the temple to thank the gods. Chiang Ching-kuo is now the Deputy Commander of the Jiangxi Pacification Headquarters, training new recruits. When the war broke out and Ningbo was repeatedly threatened, Chiang Kai-shek and his son both asked Ms. Mao to leave Xikou and go inland, but Ms. Mao refused, resulting in a tragic death.

### The Detained *De Yao* Wheel: Legal Resolution to be Sought: Release Has Not Been Obtained After Much Negotiation

Since the Portuguese merchant vessel *De Yao* was detained by the Japanese side, much time has passed. The shipowner has requested the Portuguese consulate to negotiate with the Japanese side several times, but release has not been obtained. To seek an early resolution, they will conduct negotiations with the Italian merchant firm Yihua Foreign Firm, which was entrusted to operate the ship. However, Yihua Foreign Firm has consistently given no substantive response, making progress extremely difficult. It is heard that the shipowner authorities have now prepared a report of the circumstances and are prepared to resort to law if necessary, so that the original property rights can be returned as soon as possible.

### The Japanese and Puppet Governments Plan to Control Vegetables Again: Threatening Citizens' Livelihoods: Three Puppet Markets to Be Established Next Month: Local Goods Merchants Prepare to Switch to Other Businesses

The puppet "Municipal Government," with the consent of the Japanese side, is attempting to newly control vegetables and fruits in the Shanghai market. Although they have made various efforts, and three months ago even intercepted vegetable vendors in Pudong, Hongqiao, and other places, forcing them to sell their produce at the "Hongkou Vegetable Market," they ultimately failed to achieve any large-scale success due to criticism from all sides. Now, this plan is about to reach the stage of realization. The "Shanghai Vegetable and Fruit Central Wholesale Market," hosted by the puppet Municipal Government, has established a preparatory office a few days ago, issuing declarations and outlines of operations, preparing to realize its intentions.

Three Markets: It is heard that the "Market" is hosted by the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. The "Market" addresses are divided into the following three locations: (1) Zhabei General Market (Four Lines Warehouse below the New Garbage Bridge); (2) Sixteen Pupu Branch Market; (3) West Shanghai Branch Market (Caojiadu). The "Market" business types are divided into (1) Vegetable and Fruit Department (including vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, and other similar products); (2) Bird and Egg Department (including bird and poultry eggs and other similar products); (3) Salted and Dried Goods Department (including dried goods, canned salted meat, and other similar items). However, the West Shanghai Branch Market will only have a Vegetable and Fruit Department.

Cash Auctions: The organization of the puppet "Market" consists of (1) wholesalers (i.e., brokers), (2) intermediaries (i.e., agents), (3) accessory merchants, and (4) vendors. The operating method adopts the principle of cash transactions and auctions. Wholesalers, intermediaries, and accessory merchants must pay deposits and market usage fees to the puppet "Market." Wholesalers trade goods with intermediaries through auction, taking a commission of 10% (1/10 of which must be paid to the market). The puppet market even intends to force the local goods and fruit merchants in the Sixteen Pupu and Laozha Bridge areas to organize a "Wholesaler Association" within December of this year to participate in the puppet market's trading, and must pay a deposit of less than 20,000 yuan to the "Municipal Government."

Profiteering from Within: As this control organization is about to be realized, some people are trying to profit from it. The so-called "Central Enterprise Company" has organized on Jilu Road, specializing in attracting and inducing local goods merchants in the Sixteen Pupu and Laozha Bridge areas. However, most of the local goods shop owners and managers are deeply aware of the righteousness and are not deceived. Therefore, they specialize in attracting lower-level partners and shop assistants. It is heard that many have fallen into their trap. According to a gentleman in the local goods industry, the local goods industry is now facing unprecedented double difficulties. It must be forced to participate in the "Market" and is also subject to the constraints of the secret activities of the so-called "Central Enterprise Company." It is still difficult to speculate whether the "Company" has obtained the consent of certain parties. Therefore, some local goods merchants are preparing to switch to other businesses. The exterior of the Four Lines Warehouse has been renovated, losing its historical traces of being riddled with wounds. However, the internal layout has not yet been completed. The date of the formal realization is definitely in mid-next month.

### Strike at the Bie Fa Printing Factory

The Gongshang Bie Fa Printing Factory at 400 Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai, has had a very prosperous business on weekdays. It has more than one hundred workers. Due to the high prices and difficult living conditions, it submitted two requests to the management on the 11th of this month: (1) The increased cost of living allowance for July should be recognized as an increased formal wage; (2) Request the management to increase rice subsidies, based on a rice price of 20 yuan, at five dou per person per month (if the rice price is 40 yuan, then a subsidy of 10 yuan per person). The management was scheduled to reply yesterday morning. As they failed to reply by the deadline, at 3 PM, labor representatives asked the management for a reply. The English manager, Cell, actually used violence, injuring worker Xiong's face, and telegraphed the police to detain Xiong. Upon hearing the news, all the workers were outraged and went on strike. On one hand, they sent three representatives to explain to the police, asking them to release Xiong. On the other hand, they sent three representatives to continue negotiations with the management. As of 9 PM, the matter had not been resolved.

### Japanese Side Restricts "Citizen Certificates": French Consul Met With Miura Yesterday: Will Discuss Methods to Facilitate Entry and Exit: Restriction Due to Someone Selling Them

After the opening of Xin Kaihe, entry and exit to Nanshi was still convenient. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side suddenly prohibited residents holding "Citizen Certificates" from October, November, and recently from entering Nanshi the other day, so those who did not know the details beforehand were all barred outside the French Concession border of Xin Kaihe. The outline of the situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the reporter from the News Agency will continue to record the various details.

Thousands Were Blocked in the Past Two Days: Yesterday was the eighth day after the opening of Xin Kaihe. Because the Japanese side suddenly did not allow residents holding new Citizen Certificates to pass through that place the other day, at one point no fewer than several thousand people were blocked at the Sino-French border, wandering around anxiously, not dispersing until late at night, hoping that the Japanese side would revoke this ban and allow them to enter Nanshi safely. By yesterday, it was rumored that the Japanese side would announce the resumption of normal passage in the afternoon, so those who had been blocked the other day went to try again, but the result was still being barred and returning silently.

French Consul Baudézon Visited the Japanese Consul Yesterday: After the implementation of this restriction on "Citizen Certificates," there were many who lingered at Xin Kaihe, unwilling to return immediately. Women and children all stood in the cold wind, looking quite melancholy. Father Jacquinot de Bésange, the founder of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, felt that it was inconvenient for traffic for these people to gather on the roadside and on the streets, so he held discussions with French Consul General Baudézon yesterday morning to discuss solutions. It is heard that Baudézon also had a considerable discussion with Japanese Consul Miura regarding the restriction. There is currently no concrete solution.

There is Another Story Behind the Sudden Restriction by the Japanese Side: The reason why the Japanese side suddenly did not allow residents holding "Citizen Certificates" from October, November, or December to pass through the entrance to Nanshi was that the other day, an old woman holding a recently issued Citizen Certificate went to Nanshi. When passing through the Japanese military police checkpoint, the old woman asked the Japanese military police officer whether she could enter with it. The military police officer found the old woman's question strange, so he questioned her in detail. The old woman then said that she bought it for three yuan, so she did not know whether it was real or fake, and asked if she could enter Nanshi. For the sake of caution, she asked this question. The military police officer then reported the information to the Japanese side, believing that there were incidents of selling "Citizen Certificates," so they quickly added restrictions and were investigating. However, this statement cannot be confirmed at present. It is only heard that the French authorities are now actively discussing a reasonable solution with the Japanese side, so that citizens traveling there in the future will be safe and secure, and will not repeat this incident.

### The Japanese Side Forcibly Uses Military Scrip in the Northern District: Its Value is Slightly Lower Than the Japanese Yen: Notices Have Been Posted on Buses

The English-language *North China Daily Mail* states that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai, in an attempt to continue to undermine the depreciating legal tender, have announced that starting next year, only the new Japanese military scrip will be allowed to circulate in the northern district of the city, in addition to foreign currency, Japanese yen, and Huaxing currency. The notice of this measure was first posted on public buses running in Hongkou and Yangshupu last week. Soon, shopkeepers and merchants in the area also received the same notice. It is reported that the Japanese side stipulates that the value of the new military scrip will be slightly lower than the Japanese yen.

Recently, there have been reports of unscrupulous merchants engaging in smuggling along the Kunming-Guiyang war zone, coastal and riverine areas. Local competent authorities and checkpoints have been instructed to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities and to punish them according to the regulations, without any leniency. According to Article 6 of the said regulations, those who are found to have directly sold smuggled goods to aid the enemy will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

### Two Chinese Detectives Released, Received by Deputy Chief Inspector

Sun Peihe and Xu Jianbi, two Chinese detectives of the Public Concession, were detained by Japanese military police on the 19th of last month while performing their search duties at the intersection of Rue Robert and Penang Road, and handed over to the "Shanghai West Branch of the Local Court" for interrogation. After nearly a month, the puppet "court" announced their release after the trial on the afternoon of the 16th of this month.

### A Man Was Shot Dead on Rue Chappon Last Night; Five Bullets Hit Him, Dying on the Spot; Two Passers-by Were Wounded by Stray Bullets

Near the Dashin Dance Hall on Rue Chappon, at around 8:35 PM last night, a man wearing a black woolen suit, a long camel hair overcoat, and a light gray woolen hat, about thirty years old, was walking south along Rue Chappon when suddenly five or six burly men rushed towards him. The man, seeing this, seemed to want to avoid them, but it was too late. He was shot by them with seven or eight gunshots in total. The man was hit by five bullets in the chest and immediately fell to the ground and died. The murderers, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, fled into the crowd. At that time, there was a great uproar, and the order was disrupted. Two passers-by were hit by stray bullets. When the Chinese and Indian policemen from nearby posts arrived after hearing the shots, the murderers had already disappeared. They immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched patrol cars and armed detectives to search for them, but no clues were found.

At that time, Chen secretly reported to the police station and secretly investigated the whereabouts of his beloved son from all sides. After waiting for ten days, he received a letter from the bandits, asking Chen to negotiate alone at a teahouse in Pudong. When the time came, Chen invited three others to go with him, so the bandits did not dare to show up for negotiations. Until a few days ago, through Chen's friend Fu Xiangtang (from Zhenjiang, 54 years old, currently a shop assistant at Tianfa Bathhouse on Rue du Consulat), he got some clues from all sides. He made an appointment to meet at Dongfang the night before (17th).

In order to help young people who have dropped out of school, the Ministry of Education, in addition to establishing the Central Vocational and Technical College and establishing 15 specialized courses in various universities, has specially established a university preparatory class in Baisha, Jiangjin, Sichuan, with a total of eight classes. It also ordered Northwest Associated University, Yunnan University, and Guangxi University to each set up one or two preparatory classes, which began enrolling students in the spring of this year. After the study period expired in August and the trial implementation began, it has been quite beneficial for the training of students' basic subjects.

### Misinterpretation and Rumor-Mongering

— Jia Qi

"There is no such thing as not being the truth in the world." This sentence seems quite ridiculous, but as long as we look at it with the objective perspective of a "carefree school," we can know that it is "correct." Public opinion is public opinion, and private opinion is private opinion. Who is willing to admit that their own reasoning is wrong?

Since one does not admit their own mistakes, then when others come to criticize you, you have to argue with them to determine who is right and wrong. Therefore, in this situation, those who hold the truth naturally strive for justice, while others who hold false arguments also shout and desperately, or pretend to be benevolent and righteous, or make wild claims, or even use force to oppress the other party, always trying to make their own arguments stand.

Taking advantage of the other party's weakness to attack is of course the best thing. For example, if you say something wrong or do something wrong, instead of debating the issue, you say something irrelevant, followed by sarcasm and abuse, and then propagandize that you are about to collapse, all of which make you unable to stand your ground. However, attacking the other party's weakness is not always possible. You have to see it accurately and grasp it firmly. If the other party deliberately sells a "flaw," then it's bad. A counterattack can be more harmful than attacking the other party. If you hear the wind and think it's rain, and you accidentally see a term or an article that seems to be in line with your own temperament, regardless of the author's original intention, you add your own meaning to it and make a criticism, "Look, your articles and slogans are all our meaning!" This is completely a misinterpretation, but you don't realize it and are self-satisfied, which is really ridiculous!

In fact, if the other party has no weaknesses, then how do you attack? In order to make everyone believe in your own arguments, you have to create a rumor that is unfavorable to the other party. It is absurd and unbelievable to chase shadows, and even to spread ghost stories when there is no wind or shadow. Today you say that their internal affairs are collapsing, tomorrow you say that they are unreliable, and the day after tomorrow you say that they are not working. But the other party is like this today, like this tomorrow, and still like this the day after tomorrow.

As for the tricks of rumor-mongering, this is basically a kind of "partial talent." To put it bluntly, the better the skill, the better, of course, but the skills of those who distort the true meaning will also become "clumsy," and those who simply stick to the old tune and want to cover up people's eyes and ears are even more "stupid."

Attacking by taking advantage of the other party's weakness and attacking by spreading rumors are not related. The former is opportunistic justice, while the latter is simply a rogue tactic and is not worth mentioning. However, some people, when attacking by taking advantage of the other party's weakness, also make a misinterpretation, which is even more rogue. If I can't find a weakness, I might as well misinterpret it. If there is no misinterpretation, I might as well create a rumor. Finally, I hide this literary means and pull out a hairy hand to harass for a while. You have to believe it even if you don't believe it. This is the real "victory means"! This is also what is called "truth."

Misinterpretation and rumor-mongering are the last resort, but we must also guard against their last move. Our literati must not think that it is "none of my business." Not only has misinterpretation and rumor-mongering been proven by examples, but the harassment of hairy hands must also be tasted. "Literature and art" is not a transcendent thing, and everything in the world is closely related!

### They Are Five People

— Qian Taisheng

Sergeant Liu Kuizhong was ordered to search for remnants near Shangliu Lake in Gao'an. He led four shrewd and capable brothers, blowing the crisp autumn breeze, and headed straight for Shangliu Lake.

The sound of mountains and water rumbled under their feet. Passing through bamboo forests and climbing over high mountains, a gust of wind blew, and the red leaves on the maple trees rustled down. The sun leaked out its red face from the top of the mountain, and the distant mountains and forests were as green as a painting.

Liu Kuizhong was basking in the sun, going up and down the mountains, crossing bridges and wading through water, walking very fast. After only walking a dozen or twenty miles, his body was sweating profusely. In this area, the common people had all run away. Even if there were houses, he couldn't find a sip of tea.

After running another ten miles, Liu Kuizhong ordered his four brothers to rest in a pavilion on a small mountain. Although it was autumn, the heat of the sun forced everyone to sweat.

Suddenly, a wisp of thick smoke rose four or five miles away. A brother stood in front of Liu Kuizhong and saluted:

"Report! A fire is starting five miles ahead. I'm afraid there are enemy troops."

"What's that place called?"

"I heard it's called Liujia Village."

"Okay, let's go!"

The brothers carried their gear and went down the mountain at a forced march. After walking more than four miles, they could already see the billowing smoke swirling in the air. A group of × soldiers, about forty or fifty in total, were laughing and talking as they held torches and set the houses on fire, causing the smoke and fire to spread.

"Brothers, hide!" Liu Kuizhong gave the order to fight. "Give me the light machine gun. You four attack from four directions, leaving a wide road open, which I will guard myself."

The five of them found hiding places and slowly crawled over until they were only about one hundred meters apart before they could see clearly that several corpses were lying at the door of the burning house. Some were headless, and some had their arms cut off. Fresh blood was still flowing out. They were all dressed as civilians.

Liu Kuizhong and his four brothers' hearts were filled with anger. He made a throwing gesture to his four brothers from a distance. A series of hand grenades were thrown from several different directions within a distance of several tens of meters to one hundred meters. In the explosion circle sealed off by the fierce firelight hand grenades, several people fell down. They didn't even have time to pull out their pistols and fell to the ground without even a groan.

They saw that there were people in all directions, and they only heard four gunshots and hand grenades flying around. Where could they run? Only the mountain road in front was still silent. The one or twenty who were still alive rushed to that road in a hurry.

Liu Kuizhong guarded the road, hiding behind a large tree. He loaded fifty rounds of ammunition. He saw one or twenty people rushing towards him and cursed:

"Damn you! You've come at the right time!"

This group of people approached Liu Kuizhong's machine gun muzzle from a distance of one hundred meters to fifty meters—ten meters—until twenty meters. The machine gun fired, and a burst of fire swept out, hitting the heads of several people like a hornet's nest. Several people behind wanted to turn around, but Liu Kuizhong was so good that he held the machine gun in one hand and threw a hand grenade in the other:

There was only a "Bang—!" sound, and it was completely destroyed.

By the time the four brothers rushed over to help, Liu Kuizhong was rubbing his hands, and the matter was over, done cleanly.

These five people solved fifty people, an average of one to ten. Before they left, they all wore × army helmets, leather shoes, military uniforms, and military flags, and they had dozens more ×× Type 13 rifles on their shoulders. On the way, they more cheerfully sang war songs:

"Our hearts are war drums, our throats are bugles! We wave grenades and fight our way out!"

These five people were basking in the sun, but their heads were cool, happy, and refreshing. They swaggered back to camp.

### A Note on White Papers—Random Notes on a Trip to the Southwest

— Jin Ye

In the morning, when the sky was still hazy and the east was gradually showing a fish-belly white, people were starting their necessary work one after another. The streets and alleys were filled with people heading towards mountain caves, the suburbs... The atmosphere was quite tense, but there was no panicked attitude.

But some people still remain here, especially civil servants who have their own cars. As soon as the lights come on (alarm preparation signal) and a strange sound roars (alarm), they can get on the cars. Therefore, in general, they still bury their heads in their work, ignoring the alarm. Next are the parasites who take the bus. This group is still small. Perhaps their psychology towards the alarm is slightly different from that of the real workers. After a long time, it is natural for them to take the bus. Next are the people who truly cherish their homes. Among them are vendors, small shop clerks, apprentices, and some staggering elderly people. They have to wait until the lights come on to reluctantly leave their homes, taking one step and looking back, walking with iron-blue faces.

As soon as the preparation signal comes on, the whole city is active.

Crowds: men, women, old and young, truly a powerful torrent.

Liucheng after the air raid is at least still. If you haven't left and you see this situation, you might shout, "Ah! How desolate."

But I believe that people with experience will definitely understand that at that time, everyone's blood-stained hearts were filled with the same belief—the spark of action needed.

Naturally, if the troublesome period from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. passes (as indicated by experience, this is when the "cruel crows" are most likely to come and act wantonly), then those who have not retreated automatically will have one less trouble. However, are they grateful for this? No, on the contrary, they offer one:

"Damn it! Why didn't they come today! Ghosts!"

And the people who went out early in the morning are now returning one after another. Liucheng becomes active again!

The cityscape also returns to normal: the shopkeepers who just returned are checking and arranging the goods, and the chimneys of every house are also emitting wisps of smoke, and everyone is preparing their meal! In the evening, although people understand that there will be alarms tomorrow, they are not willing to sacrifice the rights of this night, so when the lights come on in the evening, they are still bustling and lively.

Indeed, life in Liucheng is still dynamic, just as I once said to my companions here: Our life is a guerrilla life. "Crows" are coming, sorry, we're not hosting, we're leaving; "Crows" have left! Sorry, no send-off, we're back. But we also don't let our guard down on the "crows." When they come, we also have to attack them with anti-aircraft guns!"

Liucheng, like our other cities, is always active.

December 4, in Liuzhou

### Autumn Thoughts

— Ye Yihang

Autumn is in the distant sky and clouds,

Autumn is in the thin mist of early morning,

Autumn is a house of sorrow.

Let your thoughts cross the white clouds,

Towards that distant horizon.

I want to know some familiar laughter,

Or hear the news from my hometown.

But I don't believe this ethereal story:

Saying that swallows will send letters

To Wang Xie in distant places.

Especially in the deep autumn season.

How will I miss you!

Faintly seeing off countless sunsets and dusks,

And facing the scraping west wind. A burst of

Fallen leaves fluttering

At dusk

A flock of wild geese circles in the moonlit night.

Thinking of being separated by thousands of miles:

You, for the eternal life of the motherland,

Gallop across the vast wilderness,

Braving rain, snow, and wind

Lifting up a day of revenge.

I think it's snowing in the north now!

Snowflakes

Like falling leaves in Jiangnan.

But I think you won't feel cold,

But I am aroused by a desolate sorrow.

Treasure yourself while you are still young!

There should be no more sad thoughts in the deep autumn.

I want to rekindle the fire of life,

In the dark place in the long night,

Compare the length of days with the devil

### Brief News from the Theater in the Old Capital

— Gong Ji

Chinese opera has always emphasized sitting in class, so for the past thirty years, the Fu Liancheng Troupe has held the reins of Chinese opera. The number of people who have graduated and become famous and are well-known in the north and south is countless. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the troupe's establishment. It is planned to edit and publish a special commemorative book of the troupe's history. On the 29th and 30th of last month, a grand reunion of famous actors who had graduated from the troupe was held at the Xinxin Theater in Beiping. On the evening before the performance, all the graduated famous actors were invited to a banquet at Xilaishun, which was a grand occasion. It is said that the surplus from the ticket sales will be used to edit the 35th anniversary commemorative book. The program for the troupe's reunion this time was originally scheduled for the first night, with Tan Fuying and Mao Shilai jointly performing "Zhuliang Village," and the final piece was "Lianhuan Tao" performed by Hou Xirui, Ye Shengzhang, and Gao Shenglin. The third-to-last performance was "Sijie Village," with the martial arts actors Yang Shengchun, Luo Lianxiang, Jiang Shisheng, and Su Fu each playing Yu Qian, and the martial arts actresses Qiu Futang, Fang Lianyuan, Zhu Shengfu, and Shi Shishan each playing Bao Jinhua. Later, at Tan Xiaopei's suggestion, it was said that Shengchun could not fully demonstrate his talents in this play, and it was decided that Shengchun would add a performance of "Centipede Ridge" after "Sijie Village." The program for the second day was "Sitting in the Building to Kill the Daughter-in-Law" performed by Ma Lianliang and Xiao Cuihua, the final piece was "Yellow Crane Tower" performed by Ye Shenglan and Li Shengzao, and the third-to-last piece was "Kaisanbao" performed by Xi Fufu and Liu Lianrong. There was also "Youlong Xifeng" performed by Li Shifang and Ye Shirong. The excellence of the performances and the prosperity of the audience on both days were unprecedented in the old capital for decades. Would Zhou Lang, who has a passion for beauty, also drool with envy upon hearing about it?

Master Hongdou, Fu Siyuan, is a decadent prince of the Manchu Qing Dynasty who has been living in Shanghai for many years. It was reported a month ago that he had packed his bags and returned north, stayed in Tianjin for a short time, and then came to Ping City. On the evening of the 25th of last month, his old friend Gu Shenfu hosted a banquet for him at his humble residence in Lumi Cang. Liu Ge'en first initiated the singing with "Little Change Startled the Banquet," and Master Hongdou responded with three songs including "Returning to Camp to Play the Garden" and "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune." All the people present were experts in opera, and they all agreed that the master's singing style was unparalleled in the world. However, after singing "Tianbao," how could those who heard it not feel sad? This is also an anecdote worth noting in the theater world.

Yan Jupeng is also a descendant of the Eight Banners aristocracy. He came to Shanghai to perform in the summer and gained a great reputation. Experts believe that among those who have recently learned from Tan, Yan is the leader of the scholarly school. Not only are his singing style and stage presence excellent, but also his dignified and graceful bearing is a model for all, which is unmatched by ordinary people. After Yan returned to Ping, he performed at the Jixiang Theater in the Dong'an Market. A few days ago, he and his daughter, Ms. Yan Huizhu, jointly performed "Qi Shuang Hui." Yan played Li Qi himself, and it was a beautiful story on the stage for a real father and daughter to play a fake father and daughter.

### News from the Film Industry

— Yuan

It is said that "The Saint" is a very popular detective novel abroad, so "The Saint" films are also being continuously produced. The role of The Saint is played by George Sanders, and Louis Hayward, "The Man in the Iron Mask," has also played it once. However, after being brought to the screen, the "Saint" films, because the plot and structure are all the same, except for the Saint showing off his agility, the tense scenes that a detective film should have are all portrayed from the side due to the protagonist's personality. Therefore, the Shanghai audience does not welcome such detective films.

After Ann Sothern was appointed as the "Oops" girl, she suddenly became very popular, but the several works she starred in that have been shown in Shanghai, starting with "Conga Wildcats" co-starring with Dick Powell, to "Maisie Was a Lady" currently showing at the Grand Theatre, all seem very ordinary; her future may be limited to "Oops."

Everyone knows that the newly opened Dahua Grand Theater has obtained the premiere rights for MGM's productions in Shanghai, but the Cathay Theatre, which is under the jurisdiction of the Asia Film Company, is also showing an MGM film, "Christmas Carol." Some people say that this is a demonstration against Dahua, but according to the author's knowledge, this is the last film produced by MGM that will be shown in Asia Cinemas.

Eileen Dare's skating skills, in terms of age, may have the hope of surpassing Sonja Henie in the future, but under Hollywood's production policy, she is required to perform a hula dance (there is such a scene in "Silver Skates") to win the "appreciation" of the audience, which is a very dangerous future.

Shirley Temple's "The Little Princess" is said to be another work that promotes civilization.

(24) Scripture Recitation

The supporters of "Scripture Recitation" are mostly middle-aged or older women with limited literacy. The themes are mostly stories about encouraging good and punishing evil, such as "Liu Xiangnu" and "Mulian Monk"; there are also scripts similar to ballad singing, such as "Pearl Pagoda" and "White Crane Picture."

Recently, radio has become quite popular, shifting from "solemn" to "humorous."

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden: Several Patrons from the Banking Industry

— Xu Muyun

I once watched his "Killing the Fisherman's Family," with Shang Xiaoyun as Guiying, Rui Debao and Qian Baosen as Li Jun and Ni Rong, and Wang Fushan as the tutor. Hang Zihe played the drums (I don't remember if the Qin player was Zhu Jiaokui). Speaking of this supporting cast and the stage setting, only Shu Yan uses it now. Unfortunately, that day was just like watching a movie (silent). I couldn't hear a single word, but in a few poses, I could still vaguely imitate Shu Yan's expressions and gestures, which was already very difficult for him. Just imagine, with his subtle voice, even if he goes bankrupt in the future, he still won't be able to make money by selling his art. So, what is there for Shu Yan to worry about? Therefore, Shu Yan can teach him as much as he can without any hesitation. However, good art is truly fascinating. People say "opera fans," "opera fans." If they hear really good opera, and the singer can explain it in detail and repeatedly guide them, it will be even more fascinating, making you infatuated with his beautiful melodies, the longer the time, the deeper the obsession. For this reason, this banker goes to Shu Yan's house every night without being able to control himself, firstly to listen to him practice his voice at night, and secondly to ask him about drama. However, Xiao Yu's temper is too strange. Everyone has to climb along his pole. For example, if he is very happy today, as soon as he sees you enter the door, he will say, "Let's not leave until dawn today!" (This "de" character is empty, which is commonly used by people in Beiping, seemingly like the Shanghai word "that's great.") No matter how important things anyone in this house has to do tomorrow, you can't leave. You have to accompany him until dawn before you can leave. If you secretly leave first, then you have offended him, and the next time you come, he will give you an impossible task. (163)
