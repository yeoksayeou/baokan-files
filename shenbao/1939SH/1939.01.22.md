### Policy Explanations by Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Still Clinging to the Delusion of Conquering China by Force, Attempting to Create a New Order in the Far East and Claim Hegemony, Exerting Utmost Intimidation and Enticement Towards European and American Powers

Tokyo: The Japanese Diet has resumed its session today. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita both delivered speeches. Hiranuma's speech focused on domestic affairs, stating that the government will continue to respect the rights of political parties and has definitively abandoned the rumored policy of forming a fascist unified party. Arita's speech focused on foreign policy, stating that Japan is prepared to invite Britain, the United States, and other powers to share in the benefits of East Asian prosperity, but these powers must recognize Japan's hegemonic position in East Asia. Arita also warned France and the Soviet Union not to continue supporting China, or Japan would take retaliatory action.

Key Points of Arita's Speech

The key points of Arita's speech can be divided into the following: (1) Japan is determined to persist in its resolution to establish a new order in East Asia. This new order is based on the cooperation of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," and its further development and prosperity will benefit the entire world. (2) Within China and "Manchukuo," Japan will impose certain restrictions in areas that are directly related to Japan's national defense, but these restrictions will be kept to a minimum. (3) Japan is prepared to link the East Asian economy with other parts of the world to promote the prosperity of all mankind. (4) If the transport of military supplies to China through French Indochina continues, Japan will take appropriate countermeasures. (5) Japan hopes that the "new Chinese government," which will soon be established, can cooperate with Japan to resolve the Sino-Japanese War. (6) Japan will continue to fight against the Comintern, as its goal is not only to communize China but also the entire world. (7) Although the Zhanggufeng Incident has come to an end, current relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are tense due to the Soviet authorities in North Sakhalin continuing to interfere with the oil, coal, and fishing rights of the Japanese. The fishing dispute is a serious issue for both sides, and the tensions remain.

According to Arita, "Regarding the China Incident, Japan's basic policy and determination were explained in detail in the statement of November 3rd last year. The Japanese government firmly believes that the new order in East Asia is necessary not only for the survival and healthy development of Japan, China, and 'Manchukuo' but also for the peace and happiness of the entire world. Although the Japanese government has repeatedly explained these points, there are still unfortunate misunderstandings abroad, and some believe that Japan's goal is to close the door to China. Of course, certain restrictions and regulations must be imposed on matters directly related to the national defense and economic development of China, Japan, and 'Manchukuo,' but these regulations will be kept to a minimum. As for military supplies transported to China via French Indochina or other countries, the Japanese government has repeatedly stated to the governments of these countries that Japan will take appropriate action when necessary." Arita also stated, "Fortunately, since the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, there have been relatively effective preventive measures against the dangerous actions of the Comintern." He also said, "Although relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are extremely tense, the Zhanggufeng Incident was fortunately resolved without leading to an irreparable situation, which is gratifying." Finally, Arita also stated, "The Japanese government hopes that all relevant countries will understand Japan's true intentions and cooperate with Japan in its work to create a new order in East Asia."

Hiranuma's Bombastic Statements

(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichir≈ç delivered a speech in the Upper House today, with all cabinet members and the diplomatic corps present, declaring, "Japan, in the midst of the war against China, has just celebrated its second New Year, and feels that its situation has reached an extreme of difficulty." Hiranuma continued to state that the cabinet will brave all difficulties and continue to implement its policy towards China, regardless of the cost. Hiranuma emphasized that only when China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" are united will there be lasting peace and stability in East Asia. This union is the new order that will replace the old order in the Far East. Japan is determined to eliminate all forces that do not understand this principle and advocate continued resistance against Japan. On the other hand, it welcomes those who understand this principle to participate in the work of building a new China and establishing a new order in East Asia. Internationally, Japan is particularly willing to cooperate with countries that fully recognize the current situation. Hiranuma continued, stating that although Japan has achieved some military victories, it is still far from its ultimate goal, and there are countless difficulties ahead. Therefore, the government and the people should unite, and the national education system should also be based on a new foundation to promote the national spirit. The most important tasks in the future are to build the strongest military and develop the economic power of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." The most urgent task at present is to implement the National Mobilization Law and carry out domestic reforms. Finally, Hiranuma requested the Diet to pass the various laws and bills proposed by the government. (Haitong, 21st)

American Expression of Doubt

(Washington) Although official circles here have welcomed Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's statement today that Japan has no intention of closing the door to China, they are extremely skeptical of its sincerity, as American merchants in the Japanese-occupied areas of China are frequently dissatisfied with Japan's discrimination against American business interests. Furthermore, similar statements were repeatedly made when "Manchukuo" was annexed, but the facts did not match the words. Therefore, the guarantee of an open door policy towards China will inevitably repeat the "Manchukuo" incident. As for the statement that retaliatory action will be taken against countries supplying China with military supplies, it is nothing more than empty threats. To counter this threat, the United States would do well to fortify Guam. (Associated Press, 21st)

### War Situation Report by Army Minister Itagaki

(Tokyo) Army Minister Seishiro Itagaki delivered a speech in the Diet today, discussing the recent situation of the Sino-Japanese War in detail. He said that the Chinese army has concentrated 170,000 troops west of the Pinghan Railway, preparing to launch guerrilla warfare north of the Yangtze River. South of the Yangtze River, between Changsha and Nanchang, there are 300,000 troops, mostly central army troops. Itagaki stated that General Chiang Kai-shek is currently working hard to establish close contact with the generals in the southwest. Guangdong Province in South China currently has 200,000 Chinese troops, and Guangxi Province has 150,000 troops. Itagaki further estimated the Chinese troops in Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, saying that there are 210 divisions, of which 85 divisions belong to the central army, totaling 1 million troops. Itagaki also said that the northwestern provinces of China are currently receiving constant supplies from Moscow and will gradually be dominated by communist forces. He emphasized that the Japanese army will continue to be stationed in China, and its task is "not only to eliminate the anti-Japanese Chiang Kai-shek government but also to establish a country of peace and order." Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai followed Itagaki and delivered a speech, stating briefly that the war against China requires not only the mobilization of the army and navy but also the mobilization of the entire Japanese people. The future of Japan and East Asia depends entirely on this, so the entire Japanese people should unite and firmly believe in the final victory of the Japanese army. (Haitong, 21st)

(Berlin) Japanese Army Minister Itagaki recently gave an interview to the Tokyo correspondent of the Nazi Party's newspaper "Attack," stating that the dispute between China and Japan has a special nature, and the war may last for ten or even twenty years. Although General Chiang Kai-shek has a large number of troops under his command, all equipped with sufficient firearms and ammunition, after the most important military supply line in South China was cut off by the Japanese army, Chiang's strength will inevitably weaken day by day. As far as the current situation is concerned, the military supplies purchased by China can be transported into China through two routes: British Burma and Soviet Turkestan. "However, these routes are very long, and transportation is therefore very slow." As for Japan, there are still 2 million young men prepared to join the army in times of crisis or when new disputes arise with foreign countries. At present, the Japanese army is operating smoothly in China, and the economic reconstruction of the occupied areas is also being carried out actively. Japan's position with regard to the Soviet Union is therefore becoming more and more stable. As for whether the Japanese army will operate in North China in the coming months via Zhangjiakou and Baotou in China, or advance to West China to cut off the Sino-Soviet transport line, or operate in South China, it has not yet been determined. Moreover, China is rich in resources and can provide huge quantities of food everywhere. I have not seen that Japan has any need to rely on the Anglo-Saxon countries financially. "What we need is only time. Although we do not reject foreign investment in the new China, we do not require it." When the United Kingdom and the United States lend money to General Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese side has made a great fuss about it, but the Japanese government does not pay much attention to it. (Havas, 21st)

### Japanese Budget Proposal Submitted to the House of Representatives: Diet Function Lost, Members Silent as Cicadas

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government submitted the following two proposals to the House of Representatives on the 21st: (1) the general budget proposal for revenue and expenditure for the 14th year of Showa and the budget proposals for revenue and expenditure of various special accounts for the same year; (2) two proposals for concluding national treasury burden contracts required outside the budget. (21st dispatch)

(Tokyo) The result of today's House of Representatives meeting is that the members have unanimously cast a vote of confidence in the government's plan and expressed their full cooperation. However, the current Japanese Diet can only approve the government's work, and the function of the parliament has long been lost. Even the members who used to oppose the government's policies are now silent as cicadas, not speaking, and no one has expressed any opinion on the largest budget proposal in Japanese history. At the same time, the government is currently doing its best to focus public opinion on the issues of industrial revitalization of domestic affairs, the increase in national debt, and the recent decline in foreign trade. The total budget amount that Japan should have the Diet pass this year is as high as 9,000,000,000 yen, most of which is used for the war against China. This budget is 6.8% higher than last year's budget proposal, which means an increase of 3,694,000,000 yen. Among the budget proposal, many items are related to military affairs, such as military relief expenses, wartime industrial expansion expenses, air defense expenses, aviation personnel training expenses, veterans' subsidies, expenses of the Asia Development Board, subsidies for colonial enterprises, etc. As for the expenses of ordinary departments, they have all been greatly reduced due to the war against China, such as flood prevention expenses and rural revitalization expenses, which are only 9.8 million yen. From this, one can see the financial constraints. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Various Political Parties Reorganize Their Ranks

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The 74th resolution assembly reopened today. Various political parties held party conventions yesterday to reorganize their attendance. The government side decided on the draft speeches of the prime minister, finance minister, and foreign minister to the assembly on the 17th. (21st dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The routine cabinet meeting was held at 10:30 a.m. on the 20th. First, Finance Minister Ishiwata explained and decided on the general budget proposal for revenue and expenditure for the 14th year of Showa and the budget proposals for various special accounts to be submitted to the assembly. Opinions were exchanged on countermeasures for the assembly. The meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m. (20th dispatch)

### Former Interior Minister and Finance Minister Appointed as Government Advisors

(Tokyo) According to announcements here, former Interior Minister Suekichi Masao, who resigned along with former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, has now been appointed as an advisor to the Hiranuma Cabinet. Former Finance Minister Ikeda Shigeyaki and Seiyukai leader Shima Toshio have also been appointed as advisors. (Haitong, 21st)

### Japanese Ambassador to France, Sugimura, Returns to Yokohama

(Hong Kong) Yokohama dispatch: Japanese Ambassador to France Yotaro Sugimura and his wife returned to Yokohama at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th and immediately took a car to Keio Hospital. (20th dispatch)

### Japan's Foreign Trade Suffers Large Import Surplus

(Hong Kong) The Japanese Ministry of Finance announced the following preliminary figures for foreign trade in mid-January: exports of 69,654,000 yuan, imports of 91,955,000 yuan, and an import surplus of 22,301,000 yuan. (20th dispatch)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Announces Closure, Resolves to Invite Member States to Review China's Proposal

(Geneva) The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council closed today. The General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution inviting member states‚Äîespecially those related to the Far East‚Äîto discuss and review the proposals of the Chinese delegation. This proposal was submitted to the Administrative Council by Dr. Gu Weijun at the end of this week. (Associated Press, 21st)

(Paris) Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the League of Nations Administrative Council recently passed a resolution today stipulating that member states should consult with non-member states, namely other countries directly related to the situation in the Far East, in order to consider the issue of assistance to China. In essence, this means advocating that the actions of member states should be aligned with the actions of the United States. Responsible figures here have attached great importance to this upon hearing the news, stating that the US, British, and French governments have just sent identical notes to Japan regarding the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington. The Administrative Council's passage of the above resolution at this juncture is tantamount to giving prior approval to the actions that the US, Britain, and France may take in the Far East in the future. (Havas, 20th)

### Gu Weijun Transferred to Head of Foreign Affairs: No News from the Embassy in France

(Paris) The Chinese Embassy here has no knowledge of the rumors from Tokyo that Chairman Chiang has appointed Ambassador to France Gu Weijun as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dr. [Gu] will return to Paris from Geneva on Sunday. (Reuters, 23rd)

### International Aviation Fuel Tariff Conference: Guo Taiqi Appointed as Representative

(Chongqing) Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has been appointed as the Chinese representative to the International Aviation Fuel Tariff Conference. (Reuters, 21st)

### No Result from Negotiations on Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Dispute

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch from Moscow: Negotiations on the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement have yielded no results. The Soviet government has scheduled an auction of fishing grounds for March 15th. The Japanese side has requested that the Soviet Union maintain the status quo and make changes after the fisheries negotiations are completed. However, the Soviet government has refused to consider this any further. (21st dispatch)

### Britain Continues Loans to China to Stabilize Chinese Currency: Successful Negotiations in London, ¬£3 Million to Be Delivered Soon

(London) According to the financial reporter of the Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, China and Britain are in negotiations for Britain to allocate ¬£3,000,000 in loans to China to maintain the stability of the legal tender's exchange rate. These negotiations are nearing completion. "It is known that the British government's economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, assisted the Chinese government in stabilizing its currency before the outbreak of war between China and Japan, so it is expected that Britain will lend to China under the current circumstances." (Havas, 21st)

(London) After the Daily Herald published news that the British government was preparing to lend China a large sum of ¬£3,000,000 to maintain the stability of the legal tender's exchange rate, British officials neither denied nor confirmed it, merely stating that Britain's financial assistance to China was under consideration. Political circles said that this was completely separate from Britain's granting of commercial credit to China. Regarding the commercial credit loan portion, after the British Parliament previously passed the Export Credit Guarantee Act Amendment, it granted a batch of loans totaling ¬£500,000 to China. At the same time, it stipulated that several batches of commercial credit loans would be granted to China at the end of December last year for the purchase of trains and goods other than military supplies. It can be seen that Britain is granting credit loans to China on the one hand for the purchase of British goods, and lending funds to China on the other hand to support the legal tender. The two should be carried out simultaneously. Britain would rather assist China economically in this way than take any economic action directly against Japan. However, the proposal to take economic action against Japan is not entirely impossible. Political circles believe that the British government should wait for a more suitable opportunity and take action when it can exert the greatest effect. In other words, if the Japanese government's attitude towards the economic interests of European and American countries in China remains unchanged and ignores the notes of the US, Britain, and France, then Britain will be forced to reconsider its current attitude. (Havas, 21st)

Editorial

### Prospects of the War Situation

Today, China's only way out is resistance. All kinds of nonsensical fallacies are insufficient to shake the self-confidence of the entire nation. It is excessive to think that one or two fragile individuals, confined to their own shortsightedness and intimidated by the enemy's deep penetration, should make frivolous worries and harbor unreasonable doubts. In fact, the authorities have long had definite plans for military measures, such as the designation of war zones in various places, the allocation of troops, the intensification of popular mobilization in the rear, and the launching of extensive guerrilla warfare. These have clearly indicated to us practical methods to pre-emptively dig graves for the Japanese army to be buried in. Even speaking from a military perspective, if one examines the Japanese army's sudden invasion of China after the Lugouqiao Incident, exhausting all its efforts to drive and trample, and pouring out its entire force, for eighteen months, with tens of thousands of bones exposed over thousands of miles, what has it gained besides a few transportation lines in some plains areas and a few false organizations mimicking loyalty for show? Those who harbor excessive doubts, if they pay a little attention to the facts, can they not be awakened?

When the August 13th War broke out, the Japanese army claimed that it would approach China with its lightning-fast power, which should be able to destroy everything. However, even a small place like Shanghai was stubbornly resisted for nearly three months before it fell. After the fall of Nanjing, another half year passed, and the Japanese army exhausted its efforts to attack from the north and south, and repeatedly reinforced, only to capture the empty city of Xuzhou. Even then, it could not avoid the huge defeat at Taierzhuang. Since then, there were the Jinpu and Jinghu railways on land for the transportation of its left and right wings, and the Yangtze River in the middle was its only gateway for invasion. It claimed that it could break through Poyang Lake and capture Wuhan in short order. However, the invasion along the Yangtze River was blocked step by step and frustrated layer by layer. Unable to advance on the front, it harassed Fujian and Guangdong in the south and Shanxi and Suiyuan in the north, hoping to obstruct resistance with multiple forces and achieve its goals by chance. However, even after five months, it only managed to break through Guangzhou with the help of naval cover, and then Wuhan automatically declared a planned withdrawal. At the same time, China's plan for full-scale resistance also transitioned from the first stage to the second stage, with even stronger preparations.

Since the withdrawal from Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese army has resorted to all kinds of tricks to seek a quick end to the war. On the one hand, it launched a fierce offensive, hoping for unexpected gains. In the north, it launched a five-pronged attack on the Yellow River in an attempt to directly attack Shaanxi and control the northwest. In the south, it repeatedly probed the West River and harassed Beihai, hoping to penetrate Guizhou and Yunnan and cut off China's foreign transportation in the southwest. In the center, it used Wuhan as a base to attempt to peer west into Sichuan, plot south into Hunan, and enter Henan and Luoyang in the north, in a vain attempt to clear the Pinghan and Yuehan railways to threaten Chongqing. Other actions, such as increasing troops on the Nanchang-Jiujiang line and harassing southern Anhui, were all aimed at diverting attention in all directions in order to take advantage of opportunities and loopholes. However, after more than three months, which is not a short time, the Japanese army has not only made no progress but has also revealed a state of great embarrassment. In the north, the various forces that attacked the Yellow River were defeated. After the Chinese army recovered the counties of Jipu, Daling, Xiangning, and Lishi, it has even approached Linfen. With the threat to the Datong-Puzhou Railway, those who previously shelled Tongguan across the river had to retreat. In the south, those who attacked west did not cross Sanshui; those who attacked north did not cross Conghua; in the Dongjiang area, Huiyang and Zengcheng were long recovered, and Dongguan and Shilong have been captured, so Guangzhou may be taken in the near future.

In the center, the western offensive could not cross Jingshan; the northern offensive could not cross Wusheng; the southern offensive was more fierce, but it still could not cross the Miluo River to the south, and only lingered between Yuezhou and the Xinqiang River. Those on the Nanchang-Jiujiang line have not been able to cross the Xiu River to the south, let alone hope for Nanchang. Those in southern Anhui have not been able to shake Xuanzhou and Shezhou, let alone talk about western Zhejiang. Looking at the recent situation, the Japanese army is like a rat in a bag and a bird in a net. How can it escape its final tragic fate?

The Japanese army's scheme to seek a quick end to the war failed, and the Konoe cabinet collapsed. His successor still made bold statements, saying, "Prepare for a hundred-year war." The Chinese nation is resisting for self-defense and has already disregarded years and generations. Those who boast with grand words should also examine the situation between themselves and us, and not assume that China has a few fragile individuals and generalize the whole.

### Fierce Local Battles in Guangdong Province; Japanese Transportation Lines Mostly Cut Off; Chinese Army in West River Recaptures Makou

(Hong Kong) The various units of the Chinese army are still firmly entrenched, adapting to the long-term war of resistance, making Japanese advances difficult. Therefore, the Chinese army maintains the initiative and moves freely. They are doing their best to maintain the transportation lines throughout the areas controlled by the Chinese forces. For example, trains from Guilin can directly reach Jinhua. Guerrilla forces are used to constantly sabotage the Japanese-occupied areas. Although the Japanese army has recently launched attacks in Guangdong, Shanxi, Hubei, and eastern Henan, they have made little progress. The situation in central Hubei has stabilized. Local fierce battles in various areas of Guangdong Province are still intense. Elite Chinese troops have cut off Japanese transportation between Conghua, Zengcheng, and Dongguan. Developments in the war situation are expected in the coming days. (21st, 8 PM Special Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in the West River has recaptured Makou. Fierce fighting is still ongoing between Jinli and Jiujiang. The Japanese troops who invaded Chibo a few days ago have been forced to retreat towards Guanyao after being counterattacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops at Juntian on the Yuehan Railway have also retreated to Xinjie. There is fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces between Huaxian and Shiling. (21st, Express News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to news from South China received here, the Japanese army is actively reinforcing the Northwest River area. They are also concentrating many warships at Weizhou Island in the Gulf of Tonkin. This clearly shows that the Japanese army's attempt to invade Guangxi Province is imminent. According to foreign observers, the prelude to a major war in South China will begin within a few days. At that time, the Japanese army will attack in three directions. One will land in Beihai, advance north along the highway, and invade southern Guangxi, cutting off communication between Guangxi and Vietnam. Another will advance along the West River, invading Zhaoqing and Wuzhou. The third will advance north along the Yuehan Railway, or move in a roundabout way, to invade eastern Guangxi and threaten the rear of the Chinese army in southern Hunan. In the East River area, they will adopt a feigned attack to contain part of the Chinese army's strength. (21st, Express News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Regarding the widespread rumors of a large concentration of the Japanese navy near Beihai, the official report issued by the Chinese side today has confirmed it. It is said that Japanese warships and Chinese land-based artillery have engaged in fierce artillery battles. The Japanese navy has repeatedly tried to land but has been repelled. (21st, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Guilin The war situation in the Guangdong area has been fluctuating. In recent days, the Japanese have suddenly launched fierce attacks on various Chinese positions. The current situation in various regions, according to telephone reports from the front lines, is as follows: (1) Five to six hundred Japanese soldiers from Zengcheng attacked a certain company of a certain battalion of a certain regiment of the Chinese army at Daguan'yin the day before yesterday. After fierce fighting all day, the Japanese suffered casualties reaching one-quarter of their strength. After holding out until last night, the Japanese soldiers fled back to Zengcheng. The Chinese army suffered dozens of officer and soldier casualties. (2) The night before last, a certain Japanese regiment attacked a certain Chinese battalion near Lianglongxu. After fierce fighting until Shenshi (3-5 PM), the Japanese army added more than eight hundred soldiers and used more than ten aircraft to assist in the battle. The Chinese army, suffering heavy losses, retreated to the vicinity of Huaxian to hold its ground. (3) More than four hundred soldiers of the Japanese Takahashi Unit launched a surprise attack on a certain regiment of a certain Chinese division. An encounter battle occurred near Gaodiaodian. By last night, the Japanese army had reinforced with seven or eight hundred more soldiers and a small artillery unit. The Chinese army, outnumbered, shifted its position and held out against the Japanese army until Xushi (7-9 PM). The Chinese army then launched a counterattack at night, fighting fiercely until dawn. The Japanese forces, unable to withstand the pressure, collapsed and fled. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than one hundred casualties, and the Chinese also suffered considerable losses. (20th Dispatch)

Haikou A total of eleven Japanese warships, including one aircraft carrier, continued to arrive at Weizhou Island on the morning of the 17th. There have been no unusual movements. (21st Dispatch)

Wengyuan The Japanese troops who successively departed from Sanshui for Henggang and Langang were attacked along the way by Chinese self-defense forces. They retreated to Sanshui on the 17th. The Japanese troops at Tanbu also withdrew to Wuwaiwei on the 19th. (21st Dispatch)

Sihui According to a certain officer who has just arrived here from the front line, the Japanese troops in Huaxian are determined to attack the area of Juntian, Yinzhan'ao, and Chibainiqi. They are dispatching lightly armed cavalry and infantry equipped with sharp weapons to launch surprise attacks on the Chinese positions in an attempt to probe their strength and achieve their reconnaissance objectives. However, due to the solid defenses of the Chinese army, they were unable to advance and have now retreated to Jiangcun and other places one after another. The Chinese army is currently advancing along Chibainiqi, seeking opportunities to attack. (21st Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to news received here this morning, the fighting near the Yuehan Railway is unusually quiet. Both sides are actively adjusting their formations. The area from Juntian in Guangdong Province, through Huaxian, to Conghua is a busy area for military transport and frequent troop movements. On the West River front, the Japanese army attempted to cross the river near Sanshui to establish contact with the Japanese army on the Yuehan Railway, but they have been repelled by the Chinese army. (21st, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) It is reported that the commander of the Japanese naval forces in South China, Saltazawa, has been transferred to another post due to disagreements with the army commander, Ando. The vacancy will be filled by Lieutenant General Toyota. (21st, Express News Agency Dispatch)

### US Government Sends Personnel to China to Study Guerrilla Tactics; Dr. Luo Delivers Speech in Sweden, Asserting China's Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance

(Chongqing) According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 20th, Dr. Luo Mingyuan, a Canadian inspector of the International Red Cross Society in China, who recently visited Sweden, told reporters, "The current Chinese War of Resistance has entered the stage of guerrilla tactics. Within three years, China will use these tactics to secure a certain victory. Because of the excellence of Chinese guerrilla tactics, the United States government has sent military officers to China for research. If Japan wants to spread its military power outside the occupied cities, it will not be able to achieve its goal without a large number of troops." (20th Dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Attacking Jingshan Repelled

(Yichang) (1) Three to four hundred Japanese soldiers who rushed into Jingshan City were defeated by the Chinese army on the night of the 19th and fled eastward. (2) The Japanese soldiers entrenched in Sunqiao retreated towards Jingshan after several hand-to-hand combats with the Chinese army and are now being besieged by the Chinese army.

It is reported that fierce fighting has already occurred in that area, but detailed reports have not yet been received. (21st, Express News Agency Dispatch)

Fancheng The comprehensive situation in central Hubei in recent days is as follows: From the 14th to the 16th, seven to eight hundred Japanese soldiers attacked Sanyangdian, but the area, surrounded by mountains on all sides, was not captured. The Japanese suffered three to four hundred casualties. Pursued by the Chinese army, the Japanese then suffered more than one hundred deaths in Pingba. After this defeat, the Japanese shifted their attack to Jingshan on the 17th and 18th. At that time, the Chinese forces in the area were weak and were broken through by the Japanese army. Yesterday, they launched a counterattack against the Japanese army from the Sunqiao direction. With the success at Jingshan, the Japanese continued to attack westward. The two sides fought fiercely in Sunqiao. The Japanese initially had a fierce momentum but were defeated after repeated attacks by the Chinese army and retreated to Jingshan. Currently, part of the Chinese army has surrounded Jingshan, and part has rushed into the city, engaging in mixed warfare with the Japanese army. The Japanese army in central Hubei currently has a total of five regiments. (20th Dispatch)

Fancheng The Japanese soldiers attacking Jingshan were reinforced with one regiment on the 17th. They fought fiercely with the Chinese army at Guanyin'ya.

### International Anti-Aggression Congress Calls for Upholding Justice; Urges Cooperation Between Britain, the US, Russia, and France; Actively Support China and Stop Japanese Aggression

(Geneva) Sir Cecil, the president of the International Anti-Aggression Congress and a famous British politician, and Mr. Cote, the French Minister of Aviation, issued a statement this afternoon on the issue of China's application to the League of Nations Council, saying that in the name of the International Anti-Aggression Congress, we call on governments and public opinions of all countries in the world to work together to ensure that all countries' sacred obligations to China can be fully and completely implemented. China is now fighting not only to defend its right to exist, but also to defend international law and international morality. Therefore, China is also enduring all sacrifices for universal world peace. China now asks the countries with the highest prestige in the League of Nations, such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, to cooperate sincerely with the United States, take concerted action, fulfill the promises that the League of Nations has given to China in the past, and provide China with financial and moral assistance. This cannot be considered a demanding request. As for the United States, although it is not bound by the League of Nations Charter, as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty and deeply concerned about the situation in the Far East, it should act in concert with the member states of the League of Nations to assist China. Britain and the United States have already granted export credit to China. We hereby call on other governments to provide similar financial assistance so that China can strive for self-defense, and at the same time prohibit the shipment of military supplies to Japan and refuse to import Japanese goods to curb Japan's destruction. If the governments of all countries can take the above measures, it will not only end the war sooner and prevent countless lives from being lost, but also ensure that the legitimate interests of all countries in the Far East can be preserved.

### Italian-Yugoslav Talks; Yugoslavia Refuses to Join Anti-Communist Pact

Belgrade, Yugoslavia Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinoviƒá, recently went hunting near Berje City. It is reported that the Italian and Yugoslav ministers held talks on "various important issues of mutual concern." According to well-informed sources, the main topics were issues of rapprochement and even the reorganization of the Danube River countries under the leadership of the Italian government. The Italian side not only made every effort to bring Yugoslavia and Hungary together, but also advised Hungary not to be too hasty in its desire to "restore its former territories" from Romania, so as not to disturb Yugoslavia, Romania's ally. The Yugoslav side is prepared to make some concessions in the cultural sphere to the Hungarian minority in the country, but any request aimed at amending the current borders, even on a very small scale, cannot be tolerated by Yugoslavia. Moreover, although Yugoslavia is willing to improve relations with Germany, it also wishes to maintain good relations with Western democracies and continue to base itself on the Balkan Entente. Any ideological struggle should be avoided and it is not intended to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. (20th Havas Dispatch)

French Chamber of Deputies Debates Foreign Policy: All Parties Unanimously Advocate Resolute Resistance to Aggression

(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies continued to debate foreign policy this afternoon. Deputies from all parties, from the right-wing Republican Union to the left-wing Socialist and Communist parties, unanimously advocated a firm stance against the totalitarian states, not only in the Mediterranean but also in Central Europe and even in the Far East. A summary of the main points of the deputies' speeches follows:

Socialist Deputy Blanc asserted that Japan's invasion of China in Asia threatened French Vietnam, and Italy's occupation of the Spanish Balearic Islands threatened French North Africa. Therefore, France should adopt a policy of resistance in all areas to protect its national security. Republican Union Deputy Henriot, while advocating sending a representative to Burgos, Spain, advocated "firmly rejecting" Italy's "natural aspirations." Radical Socialist Deputy Goutte, the former Minister of Aviation, stated that the Spanish government forces were essentially fighting to defend French freedom. He did not believe that Italian troops would quickly withdraw from Spain, as Italy could use these troops to establish hegemony in Spain, completely cutting off France's freedom of communication with North Africa. Regarding the Central European issue, most deputies believed that France should rely on Poland to resist Germany's eastward expansion and criticized the government for failing to fully utilize Poland's potential. Foreign Minister Bonnet immediately interjected to defend this, saying that before Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck held talks with the German leader earlier this month, he informed him of the matter and reiterated that the friendship between France and Poland was the foundation of his country's policy. "The French government shares this sentiment," he said. Radical Socialist Deputy Goutte then continued to speak, emphasizing the importance of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact and urging the government to take all measures to resist Germany. The Chamber of Deputies then decided to continue the debate on foreign policy on the 24th of this month, when Foreign Minister Bonnet will deliver a speech outlining the current foreign policy.

New Fourth Army States it Will Not Interfere with Local Administration, Claims No Independent Economic Policy

Continued from the special correspondent Belden dispatch of the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post." The New Fourth Army's position in Anhui and parts of Jiangsu provinces differs from that of the Eighth Route Army in the North. The area is not as vast as that in which the Eighth Route Army operates. Moreover, the New Fourth Army is only one of several armies in the region. It has no independent economic policy, does not control local government policies, and has no administrative power. The opinion of the New Fourth Army's generals is that the Anhui provincial government should be reorganized because the Anhui provincial government, headed by General Liao Lei, is located north of the Yangtze River, while departments such as education are south of the river. Orders issued by the provincial government on the north bank may take two or three months to reach the various departments on the south bank. Therefore, they believe that the north and south areas of the river should be divided into two provinces to meet current needs. The New Fourth Army does not interfere with the administration of local governments. When mobilizing the people, the local government takes the lead, and the New Fourth Army assists. Of course, the army must cooperate with and protect the local government. There is little chaos in Anhui Province. Local governments of the Republic of China exist everywhere, but they often move due to the war situation. If the New Fourth Army recaptures a place, it will invite local gentry to form a temporary local government, which is managed by the provincial government. The county magistrate is appointed by the provincial government or elected by the people. The New Fourth Army does not have its own independent economic policy, but it feels that it must resist Japanese goods and help establish cooperatives to relieve the suffering of the people. Wherever there is a need, it is customary for soldiers to help farmers cultivate the land. Because the New Fourth Army does not have a base like the Eighth Route Army, it has no income. The income of the local government depends entirely on land taxes, in accordance with the regulations of the National Government. Guerrilla forces can levy taxes on the spot, but the New Fourth Army hopes that the government can correct this practice because it will affect the war of resistance. Although strict precautions are taken in the areas managed by the Republic of China, Japanese goods still flow in. Small vendors in the countryside carry Japanese goods such as soap and towels for sale. Japanese merchants affix Chinese or foreign trademarks to Japanese goods and sell them as imitations. The New Fourth Army believes that the best way to resist Japanese goods is to thoroughly organize the people. The people in the Yangtze River basin have a higher culture and a more comfortable life, so the people can be organized to assist in the war of resistance. Even the old and weak can make shoes or cook for the soldiers. If the staff who organize the people work hard, they can immediately organize 90% of the people. According to the New Fourth Army, they have so far organized 50% of the people in the area. Both the New Fourth Army and the Third War Area Headquarters say that the Japanese army has recently abused military currency in an attempt to undermine legal tender, and that the Japanese army in China can obtain supplies without spending a penny. Today, the Japanese side stipulates that one yuan of legal tender can be exchanged for seven jiao of military currency. If the Japanese army uses this worthless paper money to buy a pack of cigarettes for one jiao, they still have to receive nine jiao in change. In fact, the Japanese army not only gets a pack of cigarettes for free, but also "steals" nine jiao of legal tender from the shopkeeper. Shopkeepers who suffer this loss can only close their shops, and people dare not sell goods anymore.

According to the leaders of the New Fourth Army, the application of guerrilla warfare is a form of revolutionary struggle and is implemented through revolutionary activities. Therefore, without revolution, the development of guerrilla warfare is not great. There are many precedents for guerrilla warfare in Chinese history, but they all lacked a social foundation and political guidance, and thus all failed. Guerrilla warfare can develop in the following two situations: one is in a place where the masses are mobilized, and the other is in a place where transportation is difficult. Guerrilla warfare has two tasks, and it takes two forms in the development of the revolution. First, guerrilla warfare occurs due to political instability or mass uprisings, such as peasant uprisings. The armed masses develop into regular troops. These masses are initially irregular guerrillas or troops, and then develop into regular troops, such as the Red Army, which was developed from rebellious peasants. Second, guerrilla warfare is also produced when regular troops fight against the enemy, in order to assist the regular troops in combat. For example, during Napoleon's expedition to Russia, when the Russian regular army withdrew from Moscow, the peasants rose up to organize and cut off the French army's transportation lines, and when the French army withdrew, they assisted the regular army and attacked, causing heavy losses to the French army. This is another example of guerrilla warfare. During the Russian Revolution, the revolutionary army first developed guerrilla warfare in the east to contain the advance of the Japanese army, and the main force of the revolutionary army then drove out the European enemy in the west before returning east to drive out the Japanese army. It is a mistake to say that guerrilla warfare is useless, but it is also a mistake to rely entirely on guerrilla warfare to win the struggle for national survival. It is true that guerrilla warfare causes the people to suffer temporarily, but the reason for this is that the Japanese army invaded China. Therefore, the people's resistance and the engagement in guerrilla warfare are due to the brutal behavior of the Japanese army. The invasion of China by the Japanese army threatens the rights and freedoms of the country and the people. If the country loses its independence, the Chinese people will also lose their independence. The Chinese people must pay the price of temporary suffering in order to obtain ultimate freedom. Therefore, the people understand that this is not only a question of present suffering, but also a question of permanent enslavement. Therefore, China must pay the price of victory. The suffering it endures can make the Chinese people know what they are fighting for this time. The Japanese army may separate the Chinese people from the guerrillas in the future, but most people understand the importance of their cooperation with the guerrillas. Just as during the American Revolution against England, the American people also suffered terrible suffering. They also knew that they could reduce their suffering by being protected by England, but they understood even more that they had to pay a price for independence. Therefore, they were willing to endure this suffering, and so are the Chinese people. The Japanese army will inevitably be transferred to the rear in the future and try to eliminate the guerrillas. If the Japanese army really does this, then one of the tasks of the guerrillas can be realized, which is to attack the enemy in the rear and stop them from continuing to advance. The New Fourth Army understands that the Japanese army will concentrate its attack in the future and drive them away, so it has planned how to resist for a long time and is committed to organizing the masses everywhere. This battle is a national war, not a civil war. The Japanese army cannot concentrate its forces on one point. The guerrillas are assisting the regular army in combat. If the Japanese army tries to withdraw and pursue the guerrillas, the regular army will follow and attack. Moreover, in the future, positional warfare will become less valuable, and regular troops will also be able to be transferred to the rear of the Japanese army and take the offensive. On the eve of my departure from the headquarters of the New Fourth Army, Xiang Ying told me in English: "We have many shortcomings. Our strategy is poor, and our mobilization of the people is not satisfactory, but we all understand these two points and are eager to improve and overcome them. Please tell our foreign friends that they should understand the correct work of guerrilla warfare, because guerrilla warfare has its limits and is not omnipotent. However, the guerrillas are an army that guides and assists. If we want national progress, we must fight for it ourselves, otherwise there is no hope of victory. National unity is the guarantee of victory; without it, we cannot win. We also hope that our foreign friends understand that their interests in China are closely related to China's strength in the war of resistance and cannot simply expect China to protect foreigners."

Kunshan Forcibly Resumes Public Utilities, Pandering to the Japanese Army and Facilitating Exploitation

Kunshan Correspondence: Since the arrival of the puppet magistrate Wang Youzhi, he has colluded with one or two unscrupulous gentry to advocate the restoration of the local area, vigorously whitewashing peace. He is even attempting to forcibly restore existing public utilities such as rickshaws, electricity, and telephones. The reason for this is nothing more than currying favor with the Japanese army. Restoring electricity, purportedly to facilitate security in the urban area, is actually because the Japanese army is stationed at the foot of Ma'anshan, a remote area where gunshots ring out every night. The Japanese army is troubled by the darkness and unable to cope, so restoring electricity is meant to please the Japanese. As for restoring telephones, news from the surrounding villages can be communicated, allowing the Japanese army to control the city effectively. Therefore, like electricity, it is a necessary facility for the Japanese army to defend against guerrilla attacks. Regarding rickshaws, the business was originally handled by two companies inside and outside the city, with a total of 150 vehicles. However, after the outbreak of the war, all of them were lost. After searching everywhere, only 35 vehicles were found, all dilapidated and incomplete. In order to maintain their capital, the two companies have been gradually purchasing parts and tires to enable them to operate and struggle to survive. However, the puppet government has limited them to 50 vehicles, eliminating as many damaged ones as possible, and stipulating that rickshaw taxes will be collected starting this month; otherwise, new merchants will be solicited to take over. This is because the puppet government is using this to exploit merchants.

Jiangtai Ship Encounters Danger: Significant Loss of Mail, Passengers Survive Unharmed

Xinghua Correspondence: At 8 PM on the 9th, the Jiangtai ship, sailing from Shagou to Taixian, encountered heavy ice in the river while passing Dongdoukou in this county, breaking the tow rope. The ship sank, and the passengers cried for help. Upon hearing the cries, a motorboat immediately approached and towed the ship, temporarily averting the crisis. All the crew members were focused on rescuing the people, and suddenly, due to carelessness, a fire broke out in the engine room. The passengers on the ship were caught in double jeopardy. Fortunately, nearby lumber yards heard the news and used rafts to reach the ship, allowing the passengers to board the rafts and reach the shore unharmed. However, the towboat was lost, and it is said that postal packages and muskrat skins worth up to 10,000 yuan were lost.

After the opening of the dams, the county government noted that the field embankments had collapsed and were submerged, making it difficult to recognize the navigation routes for ships. To facilitate ship navigation and prevent accidents, the county government ordered all shipping companies to install markers along the navigation routes to provide guidance and prevent danger, to be completed within five days. Upon receiving the order, the shipping companies have begun to comply.

Qiaoqi Town, Jiangyin, Attacked by Guerrillas: The Town Becomes a "Dead City"

Jiangyin Correspondence: Since the occupation of various towns and ports by the Japanese army, the people have suffered greatly. Guerrilla forces remain active in the countryside. On the morning of the 19th, a company of guerrillas attacked Japanese troops in Qiaoqi Town, more than 20 miles from the city. The Japanese troops were outnumbered and took refuge in the iron shop of Xu Xiwu in Dongjie. The guerrillas attacked from Dongmu Bridge across the river and flanked from the north of Hua Mountain. The two sides fought for about an hour before stopping. The number of casualties is not yet known. Qiaoqi Town has now become a "dead city," and wealthy families have fled one after another.

Shantou Actively Training Women to Serve as Women's Team Leaders in Various Villages; Seventh Batch of Eligible Young Men Sent Off

Shantou Correspondence: On the 8th of this month, three Japanese aircraft flew over Shantou, Chenghai, and Chaoyang, conducting reconnaissance along the coast, but did not drop any bombs. The Chaoshan area has now become the rear of the Dongjiang military operations. The military and civilians are united, actively preparing for war, and striving for final victory. Hu Mingzao, the Administrative Commissioner of the Fifth District, and Mayor He Tong went to Qujiang last month to assume their duties in the provincial committee. The provincial government appointed Zheng Feng as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and Zhang Yushao, the County Magistrate of Chaoyang, as the Mayor of Shantou. Zhang arrived in Shantou on the 12th and was sworn in on the 15th. The People's Self-Defense Command of each county was ordered to disband at the end of last year. The self-defense forces were reorganized into guerrilla forces to consolidate national defense and maintain social order. The security teams, conscripts, and volunteer police were also re-allocated. The supplies and expenses are raised by each county to assist the regular army in guarding the territory. The Jiejang Social Training Corps Headquarters recently recruited the second class of women's cadre training class. From January 5th to 20th, applications can be submitted to the County Government Social Training Corps Headquarters. Applicants must have graduated from high school or above and completed collective training, or have graduated from the Guangzhou Women's Police Training Class, or have graduated from the Guangdong Eighth District Cadre Women's Training Institute. When registering, photos and certificates must be submitted. The examination will be held at the County Women's Middle School on January 21st. The quota is 50 people. Those who pass will receive two weeks of training, with meals and books provided by the government. After graduation, they will be assigned to various villages to serve as women's team leaders. Liang Hanzhao, the County Magistrate of Yangyang, serves concurrently as the commander of the Corps. In the Chaoshan countryside, military training for young women has become increasingly widespread.

As for the adult male conscripts, in addition to those incorporated into the self-defense guerrilla forces, they are all obliged to perform military service. The order to select new recruits for the seventh batch has been issued, requiring the heads of each district and township to complete the register of conscripts before January 8th. Before the 15th, the‰øùÈï∑ (local leader) will forward the register to the county government. Numbers are pre-assigned in the register. The head of the police station in each district will personally supervise the lottery at the township office. Conscripts who are drawn, regardless of who they are, cannot evade military service or hire someone to replace them. Those who commit fraud will be punished according to military law, without leniency. During the New Year, the villages held send-off ceremonies for the new recruits, and the sound of firecrackers could be heard everywhere. The counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou have sufficient self-defense forces, as well as sufficient manpower and material resources to assist the war of resistance at the front, which is a gratifying phenomenon.

Guanzong Temple:
The temple is located in the south gate of Yin County. On the 15th, at 1:05 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the Zhaike bedroom next to the Eight Corners site. The fire spread rapidly.

A total of nine Zhaike bedrooms, five grand halls, five reception rooms, five abbot halls, ten new and old Buddha halls, five precepts halls, five front halls, and five toilet and kitchen rooms were destroyed. Only the Great Buddha Hall was preserved. Three believers escaped from the fire, suffering burns. The abbot of the temple, Zeqing, is currently in Hong Kong raising funds.

Xuesai Temple:
The temple is located in Xikou, Fenghua. It was built in the Yuan Dynasty and has a history of more than 500 years. At about 7 PM on the 13th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the Hall of Heavenly Kings, spreading very quickly. By the time the temple monks noticed, it was too late to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after about two hours. The Hall of Heavenly Kings was completely destroyed, and the old monk guarding the hall, Deben, also died in the fire. The abbot of the temple, Master Taixu, is currently in Chongqing. The temple has sent a special telegram to report the incident.

Jiangxi Department of Education Establishes Junior College with a Limited Study Period of Two Years, Specializing in Basic Arts and Sciences Courses

Since the outbreak of the war, many universities in the country have moved to the northwest and southwest provinces, causing high school graduates from Jiangxi province to have to travel far to various places to study, which is both expensive and inconvenient.  The Jiangxi Department of Education plans to establish a junior college within the province this year, with a limited study period of two years, specializing in basic arts and sciences subjects to prepare students for future admission to the third and fourth grades of universities. If this plan is realized, it will not only facilitate students' access to higher education and reduce their financial burden, but also attract scholars from the country to Jiangxi, benefiting the development of Jiangxi's culture.

Overview of the School: Dongya Institute of Physical Education

The private Dongya Institute of Physical Education in this city was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China, and has been in existence for twenty-two years. At first, it rented private houses on Fangxie Road as school buildings, and then purchased a base on Caojie Street, Luban Road, to build its own school buildings and a vast playground. In order to facilitate students' practice of water sports, a swimming pool was specially built on the site, making it the earliest physical education school in the country to have a swimming pool. Diligence and hard work have led to upward progress. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the high school physical education normal department was added. In the nineteenth year, the Ministry of Education approved the establishment of a specialty department. In the twentieth year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education approved the registration. Since then, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate, and recognized it as excellent, giving subsidies. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs also believes that it is being managed conscientiously and has allocated funds to subsidize the physical education normal department to encourage it. Since then, the school authorities have become more motivated, not only in terms of equipment, but also in terms of the selection of teaching materials, the improvement of teaching methods, and the active training, all striving for progress. Since the outbreak of the war, adhering to the principle of cultivating talents, it has moved into the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road in the French Concession and continued to operate.

Unified Public Bonds Due at the End of the Month: Bank of China Prepares for Payment, Financial Industries Show No Indication. Shanghai Bond Market Stabilizes After Support.
Following the Ministry of Finance's order to change the payment method for Unified and other public bonds to full payment in Chongqing and six installments in Shanghai, the Bankers' and Money Dealers' Associations are unwilling to comment due to the lack of official orders. However, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to prepare for payment. After market support, the bond market has stabilized. The details are as follows:

Shanghai Prepares for Installment Payments
The Chongqing headquarters of the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has ordered that the principal and interest due on the Unified Public Bonds expiring at the end of January and the Rejuvenation Public Bonds expiring at the end of February be paid in Chongqing. However, for the convenience of Shanghai bondholders, Shanghai will make six equal installment payments. The branch has notified the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai office of the Central Trust Bureau to take note. All these institutions have prepared everything and are scheduled to start payments on January 31. As for installment payment forms, they are being printed urgently. If bondholders wish to entrust someone to collect funds in Chongqing, they must pay the remittance fee between Sichuan and Shanghai, which is reportedly 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and are subject to exchange restrictions.

Exerting Efforts to Stabilize Market Prices
The Shanghai Bankers' and Money Dealers' Associations have not received orders from the Ministry regarding payments in Chongqing and have therefore not made any statements. However, the committees have conducted informal research and hope that the Ministry of Finance will maintain the original method of interest payment or at least provide remittance fees. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday that the two associations will decide on a plan after officially receiving orders. Until then, they are unwilling to comment. They will also no longer facilitate overdrafts on bonds guaranteed by customs duties, as they have only seen reports and have not received orders, so they decline to express their opinions. However, they fully understand the Ministry of Finance's efforts to maintain creditworthiness.

Attitude of Bankers' and Money Dealers' Associations
Since the Ministry of Finance announced that it would no longer facilitate overdrafts on customs-guaranteed bonds, rumors have been rife in the informal securities trading market in Shanghai, causing the price of various Unified bonds to fall. Now, because of the Ministry of Finance's determination to maintain creditworthiness, public confidence has gradually increased, and bond prices have rebounded. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the market yesterday that powerful parties have been working hard to maintain prices and prevent further declines. It is also reported that the seventh principal repayment of Unified Public Bond Series A and the fourth principal repayment of the first issue of Railway Construction Public Bond Series Three, as well as the third principal repayment of the second issue of bonds, will be drawn by lot in Shanghai at 10:00 AM on February 10.

### Absolute Navigation Ban in Dinghai and Xiangshan; Fisheries Transportation Problem; Separate Transportation by Special Vessels
The Ningbo Defense Command has recently received an order from the headquarters of the √ó Group Army, absolutely prohibiting all approved and registered vessels on the Shanghai-Taizhou-Wenzhou or Ningbo-Taizhou lines from docking at Dinghai, Shipu, or Xiangshan. Only the Libao and Tianbao vessels are allowed to operate. As for the fisheries transportation problem in the area, fishermen and merchants can hire special vessels, which must be submitted to the Ningbo Defense Command and forwarded to the headquarters for approval before being allowed to sail. These vessels are limited to carrying fish and may not carry other goods.

The Municipal Council Decides to Form a Committee to Review Salary Increase Disputes; Taxpayers to Consider Calling a Special Meeting After Audit Results Are Released
The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the Municipal Council decided last night (the 20th) to form a committee to investigate the salary increase for senior officials of the Council. The speed with which this measure was taken is surprising. However, it is still unknown who the committee members will be and whether they will be puppets of the Council. According to the Council, the committee has not yet been fully formed, and it does not want to announce the names of those who have already agreed to serve until the committee is established. Sources on the other hand say that those who have agreed to serve on the committee include Mr. Paulsen, the Danish Far East General Manager of the Great Northern Telegraph Company; Mr. Hawkins, the British manager of Butterfield & Swire; Mr. Stewart, the British Deputy Manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; and one Chinese banker whose name has not yet been determined. Although it is lunchtime and Saturday, the staff of the Municipal Council's General Office are still working, and it is believed that the announcement of the committee's members will be released soon.

The "Da Mei Bao" reports that the Municipal Council has recently been criticized from all sides for the salary increase for senior officials. The Council's Intelligence Office issued a statement last night (the 20th) announcing that it would invite the business community to form a committee to review the matter, which is clear evidence that the Council is paying attention to these criticisms. The statement concludes by saying that the members of the proposed committee are expected to be announced soon. Sources on the other hand say that the selection of committee members may be completed early next week. Taxpayers are still very angry about the large salary increase for senior officials. However, since the Council has decided to have the business community review the dispute, it is believed that taxpayers will wait for the committee to release a public statement before considering calling a special meeting.

The exact amount of the salary increase will be announced by the Council. Sources close to the responsible parties say that the salary increases for the five department heads of the Municipal Council will increase expenditures by 130,000 to 150,000 yuan per year. The salary increase for Mr. Fessenden, who will resign as Director-General on June 30, is of course not included in this figure. However, the total amount of the salary increase and its total amount cannot be accurately determined. Compared with the fund salaries implemented from July 1, 1937, after an 8% salary reduction in 1937, it is expected to increase by about one million yuan. However, compared with the salaries earned by Council employees from January 1 this year, it is expected that the increase will not exceed 400,000 yuan. Compared with the basic salaries earned by employees after the 8% salary reduction was lifted, the majority of foreign employees in the Council's departments have received an increase of 15%. However, compared with the current salaries received by employees, the increase is very small.

Compared with the basic salaries before the 8% salary reduction in July 1937, the increase is only 3%. Because Council employees had an 8% salary reduction in 1937 and a 12% salary increase in the form of allowances last August, the Council has announced that these allowances will be cancelled when the new salary increase plan is implemented. In short, as far as low-level employees are concerned, what the Council has done is, at most, to increase their allowances from 12% to 15%. Compared with the December salaries of low-level employees, the actual increase is only 3%. When Chinese employees received their salaries this month, their salaries also increased slightly. According to information received yesterday, the salaries of Chinese employees hired by the Council increased by 15% compared with those earned in 1937. However, the allowances set in August will be cancelled. The salaries of Chinese employees who are not hired by the Council increased only slightly by 4.5%. A spokesman for the Chinese Ratepayers' Association told reporters yesterday that the association has not made any statements on this matter and has not called a special meeting to discuss it. It is still uncertain whether this dispute will be raised and discussed at the association's next regular meeting. The spokesman also said that he has no information about the matter and has not received any complaints about the salary increase so far.

The Guerrilla Squad in the Western Suburbs Achieves Victory in a Surprise Attack in Beixinjing; British Troops Are Temporarily Deployed; The Situation in Western Shanghai Is Tense
In recent days, guerrilla forces in the four suburbs of Shanghai have launched attacks, causing the Japanese troops stationed there to be unable to attend to everything and to be exhausted and in a miserable state. The night before last (the 20th) at around 2:00 AM, a fierce battle between guerrilla forces and a small group of Japanese troops was discovered along the Suzhou Creek in Beixinjing. The gunfire was intense, and bullets flew in all directions. The British defense forces east of the railway in western Shanghai were temporarily deployed to strengthen their defenses and cut off traffic on all bridges west of the railway. As a result, a small group of Japanese troops suffered 19 deaths and injuries. By the time a large unit of Japanese troops arrived to reinforce them, the Chinese troops had already left victorious. As a result, the situation in the western Shanghai area was tense yesterday, with Japanese troops patrolling constantly and conducting extensive searches in the countryside.

British Patrol Vessel Cruises Between Nanjing and Wuhu; Short-Term Cruise; Returns to Shanghai Next Month; HMS Suffolk Returns to England Today
The "Continental Daily" reports that the British vessel Mosquito, a British Yangtze River patrol vessel that sailed to Shanghai from the Yangtze River last week, is scheduled to leave port this morning (the 21st) to return to Nanjing. It is expected to patrol between Nanjing and Wuhu. According to the current plan, the Mosquito's departure from Shanghai is only a short-term cruise, and it is expected to return to Shanghai before the end of next month. The British vessel Suffolk is scheduled to set sail at 11:30 AM on Sunday (the 22nd) for Hong Kong and the Philippines and then return to England for a complete inspection and repair of the hull. It is expected to rejoin the fleet stationed in China in September.

Zhejiang Eastern Cargo Vessels; Sailing Procedures; Loading Must Be Designated; Sino-Italian Further Reduces Freight Rates
The Tenth Group Army Headquarters recently announced the approval of 48 foreign vessels to operate on various lines in eastern Zhejiang. However, this approval only refers to registration. To officially sail, separate loading approval procedures are still required. To reduce the burden on passengers, the Sino-Italian company decided to further reduce freight rates by 10%, and all fares will be collected at 40% of the original rate. The details are as follows:

Separate Approval Required for Special Vessel Voyages
The Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities re-registered foreign vessels, approving a total of 48 vessels. The approval of these vessels is only for registration purposes. In addition to the regular vessels operating on various lines, other special vessels loading cargo on the Shanghai-Ningbo line must have the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Adjustment Association designate which local products to load, obtain a certificate, and then submit it to the Defense Command for forwarding to the Tenth Group Army Headquarters for approval before they can sail. For example, the Moufu, Kaibo, Deping, Ende, and Xinxiangtai vessels have all been designated to load local products such as silk, cotton, and paper, so they have been able to sail one after another. If the designated cargo is transported, they must stop sailing and may not continue to sail. The Xinan vessel of the Weilihan Company did not understand these procedures and thought that registration approval would allow it to sail, so it was detained in Ningbo. Although the Taikoo and Jardine vessels have been approved for registration, many have not yet joined the fleet.

Sino-Italian Company Further Reduces Freight Rates
Since the Italian-owned Sino-Italian Shipping Company's Ende and Deping vessels were approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities to sail to Ningbo to load local products for export, they have reduced freight rates for passengers by 50% across the board to reduce the burden on passengers. The Ende vessel joined the fleet on the 13th, and the Deping vessel joined the fleet on the 17th, both operating according to the 50% freight rate method. Passengers have benefited greatly. Because many local products from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces are exported through Ningbo, and there is an abnormal demand for various goods transported from Shanghai to Ningbo, the company's Ende vessel is scheduled to make its second voyage from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then to Ningbo tomorrow, and it will reduce freight rates by another 10%, collecting according to 40% of the original rate.

Japanese Cultural Aggression Takes Another Step; Coveting the Film Industry; Inducing with "Cultural Cooperation" as Bait; Companies Understand the Greater Meaning and Refuse to Be Moved
Japanese aggression against Chinese economy and culture has always been extremely ambitious. After the war, the destruction of China's economic lifeline and cultural undertakings has become more intense, intensified, and unscrupulous. Recently, they have coveted the film industry operated by the Chinese. Tokyo has sent so-called cultural figures and many writers, together with representatives of the film industry, to Shanghai to actively engage in activities, luring film companies with the beautiful name of "Sino-Japanese Film Cultural Cooperation." In addition to the copy of "Camellia" produced by the Daguangming Film Company being purchased by the Japanese Toho Film Company and transported to Tokyo for screening, they have also sent Chinese traitors to contact film merchants in various ways, attempting to engage in production and shooting in the form of "cooperation." However, the film production industry in this city has adhered to the principle of "clearing the fields" since the war and has struggled with the environment. The Japanese conspiracy to covet the Chinese film industry has long been clearly understood, and they will never be moved by any enticements or threats. They are righteous and resolute, and the Japanese attempt to persuade them will obviously fail.

More Than 30 Foreigners Travel to Hankou on a Japanese Warship Yesterday

There have been several cases of foreigners traveling to Hankou on Japanese transport ships, but none as many as this time.

You have a broad understanding of history and are optimistic about changes in times. You are wise and courageous in taking and giving, and your reputation is renowned. You assisted the dynasty and showed your glory. The mountains, seas, forests, and swamps, the government treasury is full. You are rich and generous, accumulating and able to distribute. The old, young, disabled, and those with illnesses, disasters, floods, and droughts, you are always involved and always in charge. You take great care of the lonely and the poor, saving countless lives. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, hundreds of millions of people were displaced. You embraced their suffering and never refused hard work. There were no corpses exposed on the road, and no crying hunger in the house. Your love shone everywhere, and your nectar spread far and wide. Your merits reached the dust, and your wisdom was awakened early. You developed a Bodhi heart and saved all living beings. You circulated the classics, spreading them far and wide. You participated in temples and decorated them magnificently. You were sick on the vast sea, lonely and unhappy on a deserted island. You felt sad when you saw the times and your words were painful when you left. Your enlightenment was a sleep, and the long night was long. Your legacy and teachings will last forever. The passing of a person is a devastation to the country. China and foreign countries mourn and people on the road shed tears. You are a senior and virtuous elder, with all five blessings prepared. With respect, we create a statue and revere your virtuous and dignified demeanor. With sobbing words, we respectfully offer a cup of wine. May you enjoy this offering!

In order to avoid disputes between customs personnel and postal personnel over refusal or return of goods, the Shanghai Postal Administration specifically sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs personnel stationed at the bureau to handle customs clearance yesterday through the bureau's Joint Mailing Group for Small Parcels, stating: "Dear Sirs, In order to avoid disputes between the two parties over refusal or return of goods, please closely cooperate with the postal personnel on the following points during customs clearance." The bureau also formulated three points that both parties should pay close attention to, including: (1) Instructing the senders to submit the customs declaration to the inquiry office of this group for stamping to prove whether it can be mailed; (2) "Medicine" parcels must be limited to those containing all medicines.

Japanese Side Refuses to Relinquish Seizure of the Northern Bund of the China Merchants Bureau; Although the Other Three Bunds Have Been Released One After Another, the Weilihan Company Has Not Yet Taken Over
After the transfer of the property rights of the Chinese state-run Shanghai China Merchants Bureau to the American Weilihan Company, in addition to the Jinliyuan Wharf at the 16th Pu, which was renamed Roosevelt Wharf and resumed operations long ago, there are still four places: the Xin Bund in Pudong, the Hua Bund, and the Zhong Bund and Bei Bund in Hongkou. Because they were occupied by the Japanese army, with some troops stationed there and the rest piled with military supplies, the Japanese side has agreed to completely relinquish the four bunds after repeated negotiations by the Weilihan authorities for more than a year. The Marines from the Xin Bund in Pudong have all withdrawn, and the four wharves have also been towed away. The goods on the Hua Bund and Zhong Bund have also been moved away, and the Japanese flags that were hoisted on the flagpoles of all three bunds have also been removed. Only the Bei Bund has not been moved. The military supplies piled inside have not been moved at all, and the Japanese flag on the flagpole is still hoisted every day. It is reported that the Japanese side is temporarily unwilling to relinquish the Bei Bund, so there are still obstacles to this negotiation. In order to achieve the complete recovery of the four bunds, the Weilihan Company has not sent personnel to take over the Xin Bund, Hua Bund, and Zhong Bund, which were released by the Japanese side first.

The National GovernmentÂæµrecruits Shoes and Socks; If It Is Inconvenient to Prepare, Donations Can Be Made in Cash

### German Government's Economic Control: A Startling Development Expected, National Bank President and Vice President Replaced, National Economy to Become Wartime Structure

(London) Yesterday, Hitler suddenly ordered the dismissal of Schacht, the president of the German Reichsbank. People here are deeply concerned that Germany will once again take "startling" actions in Europe. Schacht's dismissal is considered a setback for the so-called "centrist faction" of the Nazi Party, at least in the economic sphere. Foreign diplomats are deeply concerned that German policy will be dominated by "extremists," posing a new danger of war for Germany and Europe. According to observers with informed sources here, Dr. Schacht believed that Germany's self-sufficiency policy had already reached its limit. It is said that he expressed to Hitler that Germany should liberalize its trade policy and allow private individuals to have the opportunity to revive domestic and foreign trade. Schacht's suspension is regarded as an indication that the highest authorities of the Nazi Party rejected this "neutral policy." Furthermore, they intend to make Germany's economic system a wartime structure. However, the official statement explaining the reasons for Dr. Schacht's dismissal claims that there are no disagreements on economic or financial policies. (February 21, Associated Press)

(Berlin) Following the dismissal of Schacht, President of the German National Bank, Vice President Treacy and Director Hoess were also dismissed today. The government will appoint Berlinmann, a member of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as Vice President. (February 21, Reuters)

(Berlin) Following the appointment of Minister of Economic Affairs Funk as President of the Central Bank, well-informed sources here recently stated that Germany's finances will undergo major developments. Reorganization of foreign debt and expansion of credit are both expected. Regarding the reorganization of foreign debt, Dr. Schacht's previous retention as President of the Central Bank was due to Germany's need for a talented financial expert to negotiate with foreign creditors. Now that he has been dismissed, it indicates that Germany no longer expects foreign financial assistance and will begin to reorganize its existing foreign debt. (Note: Germany's total foreign debt amounts to 1,263,000,000 marks.) Minister Funk delivered an important speech in Leipzig in February of last year, stating that "foreign creditors must make sacrifices." This shows that the German authorities have been determined to reorganize foreign debt for some time. As for expanding credit, Chancellor Hitler, in a letter to Minister Funk yesterday, ordered him to raise the necessary funds to meet financial needs. This is completely contrary to the principles upheld by the former President of the Central Bank, Dr. Schacht, which opposed the issuance of various long-term and short-term public bonds and insisted that budget revenue and expenditure must be balanced. This is one of the reasons why Dr. Schacht could not continue to serve. In addition, Dr. Schacht's talks with Mr. Rublee, the representative of the International Committee for German and Austrian Refugees, regarding the emigration of Jews, failed to achieve any results, which is another reason for his dismissal. (February 20, Havas)

(Paris) French newspapers view the dismissal of Schacht, President of the German National Bank, as a major gamble, namely sacrificing key figures in the German financial world to promote military expansion. It is predicted that the first result of the change of president will be inflation. The "Order" newspaper published an article by Mr. Bertina, stating that Schacht's departure is a warning to Britain and France. Although Germany has gained something in Central Europe, its economy is not relaxed. In order to obtain a surplus, Germany's Central European policy will inevitably expand and improve. (February 21, Reuters)

### New Bank President Funk: Known for his Anti-American Stance

(Washington) Today, a senior official at the State Department here stated that Funk's appointment as President of the German National Bank is a slap in the face to the United States. Other officials also said that Funk is known for his deep hatred of the United States. The general criticism from officials at the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding Schacht's dismissal is that this change has no real impact on U.S.-German trade, as Schacht had long become a puppet, and Germany had been using various methods to reduce trade with the U.S. However, they predict that although Germany is striving to reduce its purchases from the United States, various necessities such as cotton, oil, copper, tin, and phosphorus, due to Germany's urgent need, will still need to be purchased from the United States. (February 21, Reuters)

### Schacht's Dismissal: Reasons Still Strictly Confidential

(Berlin) Various circles in Berlin are now trying to find out the reasons for the dismissal of Dr. Schacht, President of the German National Bank. The authorities are still keeping it strictly confidential. Butler met with Schacht yesterday morning and expressed his gratitude for his loyalty to the Third Reich, and Schacht's appearance or attitude did not indicate that he knew he would be dismissed yesterday. On the other hand, according to informed sources obtained by Reuters, the reorganization announced yesterday had been discussed at a meeting of the German cabinet, at which Schacht was also present. Various circles have realized that this change is the result of any differences in dealing with German finance and economy. Officials insist that the only real reason for this move is to unify national financial and economic control, as announced. (February 21, Reuters)

### German Reply to Britain: Insists on Submarine Equality, Britain Notifies the U.S. and France According to Naval Treaty, Plans to Ensure Maritime Traffic

(London) Regarding Germany's request, based on the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase the total tonnage of submarines to be equal to the total tonnage of British submarines, and, based on the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase the number of 10,000-ton cruisers built from five to seven, the British government had previously notified Germany, requesting that this plan be implemented slowly to avoid causing a naval arms race. The German government has recently submitted a reply, the content of which is said to insist on the original claims. The British Foreign Office and the Colonial Office are currently studying it together and, in accordance with the provisions of the 1936 London Naval Treaty, are sending a copy to the governments of the United States and France. According to naval sources, Germany's move to increase the total tonnage of submarines is sufficient to threaten the maritime traffic of the British Empire, and the government will definitely build eight high-speed submarine defense ships as soon as possible to cope with the situation. (February 20, Havas)

(Washington) Germany's newly built 10,000-ton cruiser "Seydlitz" is said to be equipped with eight 8-inch caliber guns. U.S. naval sources are quite uneasy upon hearing this, saying that if this is true, it is a violation of the naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States in 1936 and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1937 (all of which stipulate that the caliber of cruiser guns should be 6 inches). As a result, the signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty should invoke the guarantee clauses to deal with it. The cruiser construction plan stipulated in the U.S.'s current shipbuilding program should be revised. (February 20, Havas)

### U.S. Defense Plan in Guam: Roosevelt Fully Agrees, Opposition in Congress

(Washington) President Roosevelt stated here today that he strongly supports the Vincent Bill, which approves the construction of a naval base in Guam. However, the Vincent Bill only approves various plans and does not allocate funds. The current plan for Guam requires approximately $5,000,000, including improving the airfield and building new naval barracks. He also expressed his hope that the American people would not be misled by the propaganda and commentaries of general Japanese newspapers, as Japanese commentaries only attack the U.S.'s defense plans in the Pacific. Regarding the defense of Guam, it is mentioned in the Hepburn Report, along with fourteen other emergency plans, requiring a total of $600,000,000. The President also stated that the U.S. has not formally discussed the defense of Guam with Japan, but is prepared to discuss it with the Japanese side. He did not indicate when. At the same time, Mr. Vincent said that public discussions on the bill may not begin until next week. (February 21, Associated Press)

(Washington) President Roosevelt told reporters that he strongly supports the proposal to allocate $5,000,000 to improve the defenses of Guam, but explained that the improvement of these defenses is not intended to build fortifications on the island. President Roosevelt also solemnly stated the difference between approval and actual allocation of funds, saying that approval does not mean that the plan will definitely be completed, and that changes in the world situation may cause the entire plan to be abandoned. President Roosevelt believes that the U.S. is now focusing on improving the defense of Guam in order to make it a possible basis for negotiations with Japan on the Pacific issue. (February 21, Reuters)

(Washington) Today, the Navy Department's proposal to establish defenses on Guam has been opposed by Congress. Establishing defenses on Guam may only be a diplomatic gesture toward Japan. Yesterday, the Navy Department Committee recommended establishing a submarine and air force base in Guam. The island is only 1,200 miles from mainland Japan, so Japan is very opposed to this matter. (February 21, Associated Press)

### Continued Progress in Spanish Rebel Offensive, Only 26 Miles from Barcelona

Lleida: The Nationalist army entered Igualada last night and is now only 26 miles from the metropolis of Barcelona. The Nationalist army is eagerly advancing eastward in the province of Barcelona and claims to have occupied seven towns in the northern section of the front line. (February 21, Reuters)

### Atrocities by Italian Troops in Spain: 200 Women Massacred

Barcelona: Representatives of Spanish women's circles recently sent telegrams to Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, Mrs. Roosevelt, the wife of the U.S. President, the wives of the presidents of Argentina, Mexico, and Chile, the Duchess of Atholl, former Member of the British House of Commons, Lady Simon, the wife of Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lady Eden, the wife of the former Foreign Secretary, stating: "When the village of Santa Coloma de Gramenet in our autonomous region of Catalonia was recently captured by the 'Littorio' division of the Italian army, 200 women were brutally massacred. This horrific atrocity is another crime of the invaders. All of us in Spain are deeply saddened. We hope that women all over the world will know about it. We are sending this special telegram to request that you lodge a strong protest against this massacre." The signatories include Mrs. Tarruella, the wife of the Foreign Minister of the Republican Government, Mrs. Valencia, the wife of the Minister to Sweden, Mrs. Conte, a member of Congress, "La Pasionaria," a famous Communist member of Congress, and Mrs. Narganes, a Socialist member of Congress.

(February 21, Reuters)

### British and French Fleets Conduct Exercises Separately in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, France Sends Senior Official to Oversee East Africa

Gibraltar: The ships of the French Mediterranean Fleet are currently conducting exercises off the coast of North Africa, while the ships of the Atlantic Fleet are conducting exercises in the Atlantic Ocean. The British Home Fleet will also sail to the Mediterranean for exercises within days. According to informed sources here, Vice Admiral Darlan, Chief of the French Navy Staff, is scheduled to arrive in this port on the cruiser "Bertin" on the fifth of next month for an informal visit and to meet with Vice Admiral Forbes, Commander of the British Home Fleet. (February 20, Havas)

(Paris) The government has recently appointed General Le Gentilhomme, the former commander of the French forces in Vietnam, as the commander of the French forces in Somaliland, East Africa. This is the first time the government has sent a general to be stationed in Somaliland. (February 20, Havas)

### Chongqing Evacuates Residents to Avoid Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Aircraft, No Troops Allowed to Be Stationed in the City, Military and Police to Assist in Air Raid Relief

(Chongqing) Many government agencies here are gradually moving out of Chongqing City in order to comply with government policy and evacuate most of the city's residents to avoid being bombed by Japanese aircraft. Schools have been ordered to move to the countryside. (February 21, Reuters)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing telegram: The authorities ordered that no troops be stationed in the urban area of Chongqing by the military and police agencies of Chongqing, and that the military and police with tasks should assist in air raid relief at any time. (February 21, Special Telegram)

(Chongqing) Most Chongqing residents mistakenly believe rumors that Japanese aircraft will destroy major cities in the Chinese interior, causing widespread panic. The police today issued an order stating that anyone spreading such rumors will be severely punished. Since the Japanese aircraft attack on January 15, hundreds of housewives among the wealthier refugees here have been taking refuge in nearby mountain hot springs and other places every morning, returning home only in the evening. (February 21, Associated Press)

(Chongqing) City government officials here are now implementing measures to protect citizens from harm by Japanese aircraft. According to statistics, one-quarter of the residents have left here, and residents are migrating elsewhere every day. Many shops have closed their doors, and there has been an increase in military police on the streets. The National Relief Commission has now allocated 10,000 national currency to help the poor leave here, under the auspices of the city government, to prevent casualties. Banks have been ordered to change their evening office hours from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., as air raids occur near noon. It is said that the government is considering a proposal to move schools away from here, but it is practically very difficult due to the lack of housing outside the city. Last week, the Japanese side threatened the wealthy refugees here that they would destroy inland cities, and they have moved to hotels in nearby resorts to avoid Japanese air raids. (February 21, Associated Press)

### Czech Sympathy for China's Resistance

(Chongqing) According to a student who recently returned from Prague, the Czech people have always sympathized with our country's resistance against the Japanese invaders. Even the "Bohemia Daily," run by Germans in Prague, has consistently maintained its impartial opinions. When we lost Guangzhou and withdrew from Hankou, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Japan's Peace," exposing Japan's ambitions and stating that Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek had also telegraphed to continue the resistance. China deeply knows that its resistance to date has always been for its own freedom and has no other political effect. Chinese culture is the mother of all Eastern culture. In the future, continuing the war, although the opposing weapons of the two sides are disparate, the pure spiritual strength on China's war money will definitely be controlled. Recently, the newspaper published a commentary entitled "China's Second Phase of Resistance," believing that British and American credit loans to China, in addition to their military and financial value, also have political significance, that is, Britain and the United States can act in unison in the Far East, because Britain and the United States do not want Japan to guarantee their interests in China alone, but must force Japan to respect the Nine-Power Treaty and China's complete independence and territorial integrity. Japan's attempt to entice various countries to recognize the Peiping puppet organization has failed. (February 20 telegram)

### Japanese Military Strength in Amoy Increasingly Empty

(Fuzhou) The southeastern coast of Fujian is peaceful. Only one or two Japanese aircraft occasionally fly between Guangdong, Amoy, and Taiwan. Japanese warships in Jinmen and Amoy have decreased significantly, and the Japanese military strength on the isolated island is increasingly empty. They occasionally fire shells towards the Chinese coast as cover. (February 18 telegram)

### China's War of Attrition: Defeat Japan Within the Year: Prophecy of French Witches

(Paris) According to the "Le Petit Parisien" newspaper, there are three famous French witches, namely Madame de Thebes, Madame Vidiƒá, and Miss Jos√©sa. These three witches regularly predict international changes for the year for "Le Petit Parisien" at the beginning of each year, many of which have been remarkably accurate, such as last year's Europe escaping a major war and the major fire in Marseille, France. According to Miss Jos√©sa's prophecy, in 1939, China's war of attrition can exhaust Japan's national strength and defeat it. According to Madame Vidiƒá's prophecy, on April 19 and October 28, 1939, there will be internal strife in France, resulting in a victory for the right wing. The Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis will still be the demon king of the world, starting with Italy in the spring in Alsace, and then Germany will also launch something in the summer, and world peace will be in danger. Poland will abandon France and befriend Germany, and at the end of the year, it will be surrounded by its enemies. Two more countries in Europe will be reduced to vassals of their powerful neighbors. According to Madame de Thebes' prophecy, the Daladier government will encounter two violent revolts, and there will be fires and bloodshed throughout France. Germany and France will become friendly, but Italy will take a "foolish" action in March, and the civil war in Spain will continue. (Quick News Agency)

### Southwest Headquarters Releases Overview of the War Situation

(Guilin) The Southwest Headquarters released the following overview of the war situation in the Southwest on the morning of the 19th:

Southern Anhui Front: In the Yiwu area, more than 2,000 Japanese troops occupying Xuanwu launched a fierce attack on the Huakou Division's positions in early March, with the fighting in the northwestern suburbs of Yicheng being the most intense at that time. After the Chinese army inflicted a serious blow on the Japanese army, they retreated to the vicinity of Xiajiadu, south of Xuancheng. Both Chinese and Japanese sides suffered slight losses in this battle. Also, a unit of the Chinese army ambushed Guihuashu, had contact with the Japanese army, killed many Japanese soldiers, and seized a lot of booty. On the 5th, the Chinese army added a fresh force and attacked Tuanshan. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated to Jiulishan after a slight resistance. The Chinese army immediately took advantage of the situation to pursue and capture Xuancheng, and recovered the key points of Jingting Mountain and Tuanshan. A unit has been searching and advancing towards Zhoucun and Wangcun. In the Qingyang area, the Huakou Division sent a powerful force to attack the Japanese army at Dongrong Bridge, encountered more than a hundred Japanese soldiers at Yecun, and gunfire broke out for a while, with extreme intensity. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and fled to Dingjiaqiao. Seeing the defeat of the Japanese army, the Chinese army immediately tracked and pursued them fiercely.

Guangdong Front: In the Conghua area, on the morning of the 11th, more than a thousand Japanese troops, combined with infantry, cavalry, and artillery, under the cover of aircraft, advanced on the Hualuogang position of the Chinese army from Taipingchang, Shangsangkeng, and Datiancun. The Chinese defenders calmly fought back, and the Japanese army was unsuccessful. On the 12th, more than a thousand Japanese troops were found in the vicinity of Maoerling Jindong, southeast of Conghua, advancing north. They used artillery to bombard the Hualuo Wuo and Dafuding areas in order to cover their infantry's attack. However, due to the strong Chinese forces, it was just a show of force. At present, they are still confronting the Chinese army in the Xiaoshidong and Shuangfengshan areas. In the Sanshui area, the Chinese guerrillas in this area have been very active recently. In order to consolidate their rear and prepare for rear-area warfare, the Japanese army did not hesitate to use large-scale forces to carry out sweeps, but in fact, the Japanese army was exhausted and tired of running around. As for the Qiongdong area, on the 11th, four Japanese warships and two converted fishing boats were found, carrying more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, attempting to land, but were repelled by the Chinese defenders.

Hunan-Jiangxi Front: In the Yueyang Linxiang area, the Chinese guerrillas have been active in all directions in recent days, and have achieved great results. The enemy is extremely panic-stricken and is trying to build fortifications on both sides of the railway between Puqi and Yuezhou in order to deal with the crisis. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army in Taolin, Yuezhou, planned to join forces to attack the Chinese guerrillas. Fierce fighting took place in the area east of Yuezhou for two hours. Later, in order to maintain the strong combat effectiveness of the blade, the Chinese army voluntarily withdrew to a favorable location to control it, taking the opportunity to strike the Japanese army.

Western Jiangxi Front: The war on the Nansun Line is quite calm. The Japanese army is now actively rushing to repair the railways and highways. The Japanese army repairing the north bank of the river constantly shells the Chinese army's positions on the south bank, attempting to contain and disrupt the Chinese army's purpose. The Japanese army in Baicha Zhelin has slightly increased in recent days and carried out a blind firing at China on the 14th. The Chinese army suffered no losses, but the Japanese army troops are still trapped in their positions and dare not attack. (February 19 telegram)
