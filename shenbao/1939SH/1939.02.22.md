### The National Political Council Unanimously Resolved to Wholeheartedly Support the Government in Implementing the Second Phase of the War of Resistance National Policy, Insisting on Supporting the Established War of Resistance Policy to the End, and the Great Righteousness Demonstrated in Chairman Chiang's Declaration. The Government Should Order the Military and Civilians Nationwide to Unanimously Obey. After Nine Consecutive Meetings, More Than Eighty Proposals Were Passed. The Congress Closed Yesterday.

(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council held its sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth (final) meetings on the afternoon of the 19th, the morning and afternoon of the 20th, and the morning of the 21st. All councilors in Chongqing and all senior officials attended. Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and Recording Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu, among others, were present. Because all the proposals had been discussed extensively, the atmosphere remained extremely enthusiastic. The following is a record of the proposals that were passed:

Proposal to Support the National Policy of Resistance

During the sixth meeting held on the 19th, the following three proposals were discussed together: (1) Councilor Chu Fucheng and 23 others proposed that the Council should solemnly declare and reiterate its support for the national policy of resistance at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. (2) Councilor Wang Zhuoran and 24 others proposed to firmly support Chairman Chiang's rejection of the Konoe Statement. (3) Councilor Lin Zuhan and 20 others proposed to support Chairman Chiang's stern condemnation of the Konoe statement and to take it as the sole standard for the national policy of resistance in the future. After discussion, when put to a vote, all councilors present stood up and passed the resolution. The resolution was solemn and moving. The full text of the resolution is as follows: The resolution to support the "Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction" passed by this Council at its first session and the "National Policy for Maintaining Prolonged Resistance" passed at its second session were powerful expressions of national will and unity, and it was already well known at home and abroad that we must be determined to abide by them together. On December 22nd of last year, the former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe issued a statement in an attempt to realize his ambition to dominate all of China and monopolize East Asia. Chairman Chiang, with his insight into his treacherousness, issued a declaration on December 26th of the same month, refuting the statement and demonstrating the determination of our government and people to maintain the established national policy. The declaration was righteous and firm, and the whole country admired it. When the members of this Council were scattered in various places at that time, they were greatly inspired after hearing this wise and great declaration. At this meeting, Councilor Chu Fucheng and 23 others proposed that the Council should solemnly express and reiterate its support for the national policy of resistance. Councilor Wang Zhuoran and 20 others and Councilor Lin Zuhan and 20 others proposed to support Chairman Chiang's declaration refuting the Konoe statement. The purposes of these proposals are the same. After joint discussion, it is now solemnly resolved that the established policy of resistance must be supported to the end. Our nation should wholeheartedly support the government in implementing the second phase of the national policy of resistance. Our government should order the military and civilians nationwide to obey the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang in his declaration of December 26th of last year, strengthen their confidence, unify their steps, and be of one heart and one mind from beginning to end, so as to restore the integrity of our territory, sovereignty, and administration, and complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction.

(8) Councilor Wang Baozhen and 32 others proposed to organize a large-scale border service corps to investigate border conditions, unite border residents, develop border areas, and increase the strength of the war of resistance. (9) Councilor Li Yuanding and 24 others proposed that the government should carefully select county magistrates, improve their treatment, determine their tenure, and strictly supervise them in order to improve county administration and benefit the war of resistance and national reconstruction. (10) Councilor Zhang Junli and 23 others proposed that a large sum of money should be allocated quickly to relieve the flood-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu. (11) Councilor Dong Biwu and 26 others proposed to strengthen the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and promote the spirit of the people to benefit the war of resistance.

Resolutions on Economic and Financial Affairs

(1) Councilor Zhang Jianming and 32 others proposed four suggestions for actively promoting the construction of the southwest, and requested the government to adopt and implement them. (2) Councilor Zou Taofen and 20 others proposed to abolish the increase in postage for books and printed matter in order to popularize education and increase the strength of the war of resistance. (3) Councilor Xirao Jiacuo and 22 others proposed to pay attention to the issue of commodity prices and food in the rear to prevent crises. (4) Councilor Gao Xibing and 21 others proposed to merge all agencies into economic construction agencies in order to centralize the research information from all parties and formulate a design for the entire national economic construction during and after the war. (5) Councilor Li Zhongxiang and 22 others proposed to regulate food in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and consolidate the foundation of the war of resistance. (6) Councilor Wang Shiying and 19 others proposed to improve the economic institutions in the war zones in order to enrich the strength of the all-out war of resistance. (7) Councilor Chen Xihhao and 26 others proposed to establish an economic policy in the war zones to benefit the war of resistance and maintain people's livelihoods.

Resolutions on Education and Culture

(1) Councilor Gao Xibing and 22 others proposed to compile a history of the war of resistance as soon as possible in order to value wartime literature. (2) Councilor Zhang Yi and 21 others proposed to put the opinions on the format of compiling war history to a public vote. (3) Councilor Liu Xinqing and 22 others proposed that the central government's funding for compulsory education should be doubled year by year according to the original plan in order to promote compulsory education in the war zones and rear provinces. (4) Councilor Liu Hengjing and 22 others proposed that the central government should increase funding for general education and culture when compiling the next fiscal year's national budget in order to actively promote national education.

(6) Councilor Chen Shi and 21 others proposed to urgently rescue youth in the occupied areas to prevent them from being used by the enemy. (7) Councilor Huang Jianzhong and 21 others proposed that senior high schools should be divided into arts and science departments, and the arts department should be divided into two groups, A and B, in order to improve the level of students. (8) Councilor Wang Zaoshi and 19 others proposed to establish comprehensive cultural work to adapt to the second phase of the all-out war of resistance policy. When this proposal was presented, Councilor Wang Zaoshi stood up and spoke, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the concentration of newspapers and publications in the rear and large cities, and the lack of cultural food in the front. Councilor Huang Yanpei also said that there are currently 14 newspapers in Chongqing, and 80% of their content is completely the same, and it is too uneconomical to concentrate publishing in one place. (9) Councilor Wang Liming and 22 others proposed to eliminate traitorous texts and strengthen the people's belief in the victory of the war of resistance. Councilor Chen Shouming and 23 others proposed that the central government should widely print various foreign propaganda materials to facilitate overseas propaganda.

At the eighth meeting held by the third session of resident councilors on the 20th, the list of elected members of the third session of resident councilors was recorded as follows: Kong Geng, Xirao Jiacuo, Zhang Junli, Li Zhongxiang, Lu Qian, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaoyan, Tao Baichuan, Ma Liang, Fan Yushui, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Jiazhen, Deng Feihuang, Zhang Lan, Liu Hengjing, Liu Xumo, Wang Shiying, Hu Shiqing, Dong Biwu, Li Huang, Jiang Yong, Fu Sinian, Shen Junru, Xu De, Qin Bangxian.

Councilor Qin Bangxian was elected to fill the vacancy. (Dispatch of the 21st)

### The Congress Held a Closing Ceremony Yesterday

(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council, which opened on the 12th, held nine plenary sessions, passed more than eighty resolutions, and achieved good progress and satisfactory results. After the ninth session at 10:00 AM on the 21st, a closing ceremony was held. President Kong of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Zhang Qun, Central Committee members Ye Chucang and Wu Tiecheng, and councilors Zhong Rongguang and Hu Yuan, among others, totaling 133 people, attended. Speaker Chiang led the attendees in performing the ceremony as usual, and then delivered a closing speech. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly. Next, Vice Speaker Zhang and Councilor Zhang Yi delivered speeches on behalf of the councilors. The audience applauded and welcomed them. The meeting was then adjourned. The ceremony was solemn and grand. The closing speech of Speaker Chiang is recorded as follows: Closing speech of the Third Session of the National Political Council. Vice Speaker Zhang and fellow councilors, the Third Session of the National Political Council is being held at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. Domestic and foreign countries are paying close attention to the progress of our meeting. Over the past ten days, we have all discussed the major plans for the country and the nation in a proactive spirit. When I attended the meeting, I expressed my sincere expectations for this session, and I am fortunate that everyone accepted them. The spirit of sincere unity and harmonious cooperation in this session can only be expressed approximately by the two idioms "gathering of talents" and "harmonious and solemn". Seeing this scene, I have increased my confidence in the future of our nation and the inevitable victory of the war of resistance, and I feel infinitely gratified. During this meeting, the responsible officials of the various ministries and commissions of the government have worked together and made detailed reports. The government has obtained our cooperation. At the same time, all resolutions and suggestions have focused on the urgent needs of the second phase of the war of resistance, and have been concentrated on several specific and constructive points. The number of proposals is not large, but the content is very rich. In particular, many proposals are based on practical experience in participating in the war of resistance, contributing the hardships and joys of personal experience, and putting forward many practical opinions that can benefit the government's implementation. Since the government and this Council are so closely connected, sharing the same hardships and difficulties, I am confident that we will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resisting the war and building the country, and complete our mission of resisting the war and building the country. Now that the Third Session is closed, although the meeting is closed, our work as colleagues to serve the country will not rest for a day. I believe that as long as this Council continues to exert this proactive spirit, openly and honestly assist the government, and do what we should do in a down-to-earth manner, not only can the government obtain a lot of assistance, but it will also enable the people of the country to accept this spirit and work together to strive to strengthen our strength to defeat the enemy, and lay the foundation for national construction after the war. In the history of China's political system, this Council will certainly occupy an important and glorious position. The historical mission of this Council is to establish the foundation of democratic politics, especially the foundation of true democratic politics. I have already mentioned this point in my opening speech at the first meeting. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Three Principles of the People, and the ultimate goal of his Principle of People's Rights is democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a strong country. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on the basis of public opinion, and must take the interests of the people as their interests and the views of the people as their views. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of people's rights is to create a country owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. There is no difference in principle between ancient and modern times, and between China and foreign countries. We are now resisting the war on the one hand and building the country on the other. To achieve victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction, we must not rely solely on military force. We must mobilize the spirit of the people and organize the people who have already been mobilized. The sum of the spiritual will and strength of the nation will be the backing of the soldiers at the front and the driving force for development in the rear. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military strength, we must mobilize the strength of the people and, more importantly, gather public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Assembly resolved to convene the National Political Council last year was that, on the one hand, it hoped that the true public opinion of the nation could be concretely expressed through our councilors, so that the government could understand the people's suffering and know the people's hopes as the basis for policy implementation. At the same time, it also hoped that our councilors would represent the people in participating in the major plans of resisting the war and building the country with their status, prestige, experience, and actively contribute our talents and experience to assist the government and guide the people. Then, every action of the government can respond to the people's hearts, and every word and deed of the people can support the government. The success or failure, honor or disgrace of the government is the success or failure, honor or disgrace of the people. The government and the people work together to fight the war, and national construction will be effective. From the process of the formation of this Council, we can know that whether or not China can defeat the enemy and achieve national independence and freedom is certainly the responsibility of the members of this Council, but on the other hand, whether or not China can create a truly democratic political structure during this difficult period of the war of resistance and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country is also the responsibility of our fellow councilors.

### Chairman Lin's Speech on the Opening Day

(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council held its opening ceremony at 8:00 AM on February 12th in Chongqing. A plaque with the words "Love, Unity, and Sincerity" was hung on the stage of the auditorium, with the flag of the Kuomintang and the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the center. The interior and exterior were simply and solemnly decorated. Government officials Kong, President of the Executive Yuan, President Sun, Vice Presidents Zhang Qun, Ye Chucang, Zhen San, Ministers He Yingqin, Weng Wenhao, He Jian, Zhang Jiaao, Central Committee members Ding Huaifen, Lu, Li Wenfan, He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, and 116 councilors including Li Yongxin, and Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu were present. After the music was played, Speaker Chiang led the attendees in performing the ceremony as usual. First, they observed three minutes of silence for the national war dead and the compatriots who died in the disaster. Next, Secretary-General Wang Shijie announced that 116 people had arrived for the Third Session by the time of the opening, which was more than the legal quorum. Then, the Speaker delivered an opening speech (the original text is in another article). After the speech, Secretary-General Wang Shijie read Chairman Lin's speech as follows: "The most important thing about building a republic is the people. Moreover, those who are virtuous and outstanding are superior to the masses. To express their aspirations and feelings is the voice of the people. In the face of great difficulties, it is especially important to provide assistance. A meeting is held to lead the people of the country. Mutual trust and cooperation depend on sincerity. Resisting the war to strengthen the country is a matter of great importance overseas. Assisting in the revitalization and stability is the key. Joint efforts are needed to support the building together. Be aware of the difficulties and dangers, open up the road to the future, eliminate the invaders, and with one heart and one mind, China will be forever strong. Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen." Next, Councilor Hu Yuan, on behalf of all the councilors, delivered a speech welcoming the new Speaker (the speech is omitted). Then, Vice Speaker Zhang Boling delivered a speech, recounting the difficult situation the country has encountered, but will eventually overcome it. He said that he deeply believed that the country and the nation would be able to turn danger into safety. Vice Speaker Zhang repeatedly explained his views, which were enough to enhance the Chinese people's belief in the war of resistance. After the speech, the audience was excited. In addition, there were many congratulatory telegrams from overseas Chinese and various parts of the country to Speaker Chiang on his inauguration and the opening of the Third Session (the speeches are omitted). The meeting was then adjourned after a group photo. (Dispatch of the 19th)

(Chongqing) At the meeting on the 12th, two telegrams were passed, one to comfort the soldiers at the front and the other to comfort the people in the war zones, and both were sent immediately. (Dispatch of the 18th)

### Original Text of Speaker Chiang's Opening Speech

The following is the original text of Speaker Chiang's opening speech at the Third Session of the National Political Council: "Vice Speaker Zhang and fellow councilors, the National Political Council is holding its Third Session today. I have been ordered by the government to assume the position of Speaker of this Council. In front of the national dignitaries and veterans, I am aware of my shallowness and feel very apprehensive. However, the country is in such a difficult situation that you gentlemen have come from afar with sincere hearts to face the great difficulties of the country and the nation together. I am very moved by this spirit. Since you have come with a spirit of responsibility, duty, and shared security, I dare not fail to encourage myself with one heart and one mind, faith and loyalty. I hope that during this session, I will listen to your great opinions and work together with you to complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country. Although this Council has only been established for eight months, it has already made great contributions to the country. During the two sessions, you have put forward many constructive suggestions on many current domestic and foreign issues. Among them, there are two things that I cannot forget. The first is the resolution to safeguard the national policy passed by the two sessions of this Council. At its first session, this Council passed a resolution to support the "Program for Resisting the War and Building the Country." At its second session, it passed the "National Policy for Maintaining Prolonged Resistance." These two resolutions not only unified the hearts of the people of the country, united the will of the country, and strengthened the strength of the government and the people, but also clarified international views and eliminated all the enemy's rumors and discord, and the conspiracies and tricks to suppress us with spirit. This is most gratifying. The second thing is that in addition to striving to participate in the meetings, many councilors are also engaged in the practical work of resisting the war and building the country outside the meetings. Whether in the war zone or in the rear, there are our councilors who have achieved remarkable results in their efforts to brave dangers, overcome difficulties, and persevere, giving the people of the country a powerful inspiration and letting them know that we not only contribute opinions, but also bravely put them into practice. In particular, many councilors have not spared their efforts to go to the front to inspect military discipline and comfort the soldiers fighting, and although they have been injured, their spirit has remained unwavering, which is even more admirable. Now that the war of resistance has entered its second phase, the responsibilities of our national government and people are even greater, and the responsibilities of this Council are also correspondingly increased. The first phase of the war of resistance laid the foundation for victory. The task of the second phase of the war of resistance is to concentrate and exert all our strength from the front and the rear, and even in the occupied areas, to strive for final victory and success in national construction. In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spirit and matter were equally important. In the second phase of the war of resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of matter. To exert the strength of the war of resistance, we must not only invigorate the spirit and concentrate the spirit, but also focus on spirit and use matter. We must first raise the strong and enterprising spirit of the people of the whole country before we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and complete the mission of resisting the war. After the war of resistance entered the second phase, the enemy was already in a dilemma militarily, and was becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more at a loss every day. Recently, the enemy has focused on political malpractice, fabricating facts and sowing discord among the people, with the aim of first subduing our spirit and disintegrating our spirit, and then conquering the entire nation. To break this conspiracy, in addition to continuing to focus on military affairs and material things, we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance. We should not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit and will of the whole country. We should not only launch the spirit of the whole country, but also organize the spirit that has already been launched, and use the organized spirit to exert the organized manpower."

Editorial

### These Three Days

During these three days, there have been no significant unexpected changes at home or abroad.

Our newspaper has been on a three-day break for the winter holiday, and today we resume meeting with our esteemed readers. Because a newspaper serves as the ears, eyes, and voice of society, it should be open for observation and communication day and night, year-round, without interruption. Especially when the world situation is difficult and changes rapidly. Although this three-day break was a last resort, we, as journalists, feel uneasy and deeply ashamed. Fortunately, there have been no major unexpected changes at home or abroad during these three days, which is the first thing we should tell our readers upon our return. As for general developments, there are many things worth recording, which will be chronicled in the news section. Among them, some are particularly worth mentioning.

Starting from the near and moving to the far, let us first talk about Shanghai. These three days mark the end of the business year for all industries in Shanghai. Looking back at the entire year, despite the disruptions to transportation turning Shanghai into a virtual island, the population has surged due to people seeking refuge. Furthermore, abnormal supply and demand have led to rising prices. As a result, at the end of this business year, not only have there been no reports of bankruptcies among businesses in Shanghai, but there is a sense that every household is making a profit. Therefore, in the context of Shanghai as a whole, there is a significant degree of abnormal prosperity and decline, while for the business community, it can be described as an unprecedentedly bountiful year, which is worthy of extensive coverage. At the same time, within these three days, there has been an unusually high number of assassinations in Shanghai, half of which occurred within the concessions and half in areas beyond the reach of the concession police, and none have been solved.

In China: The most noteworthy aspect of politics is the convening of the National Political Council in Chongqing. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech as concurrent speaker, providing incisive and detailed instructions on the past and future of the resistance and nation-building. The full text of his speech is published in the newspaper. It is refined, profound, and extensive, and cannot be captured in a few words. What touches us most deeply is his encouragement to the people to mobilize the entire nation spiritually through words and deeds. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, any talk of total mobilization in any field has become a cliché. The actual achievements are highly questionable. The underlying problems are not just one aspect, but upon closer analysis, one can find a dual personality everywhere as the root cause. What is dual personality? What one hears them say suggests one person, but what one observes them doing suggests another. In public, they are one person, but in private, they are another. When criticizing others, they are one person, but when holding themselves accountable, they are another. The Chinese people have a saying that one should not dismiss a person's words because of their character. When listening to eloquent speakers, one should only consider whether their words align with truth and our own views, without asking what kind of person they are. This is indeed an excellent attitude for diligently seeking truth. However, the resulting drawback is that when one questions their eloquence and examines their actions, one not only finds that their words lack sincerity and fail to move people, but also fundamentally doubts whether what they are eloquently saying is indeed the truth. Is this not why spiritual mobilization since the war of resistance has been superficial and impractical? Chairman Chiang has achieved his greatness through self-discipline, perseverance, and practical action. Now, he is again encouraging people to combine words and actions. This is aimed at addressing the current malpractices. The National Political Council has made many important resolutions, the content of which is yet to be announced. Among them is a resolution to establish a special committee dedicated to reviewing the actual effectiveness of previous resolutions, which is the key to political discussion. As for military affairs, although there have been skirmishes on various fronts every day for the past three days, there have been no large-scale battles. What is most encouraging is that the Chinese Air Force has repeatedly achieved successes, even winning air battles in Lanzhou and Changsha. This at least proves that China's reconstruction of its air force has achieved some success, and what has been demonstrated recently is indicative of this.

Internationally: Within these three days, Germany and Italy have not engaged in any openly shocking actions. The Spanish Civil War is difficult to mediate, but not hopeless. Britain's attitude toward the international situation, through its peaceful actions, demonstrates a certain strength. France is strengthening its defenses in Vietnam and East Africa. Public opinion in the United States is gradually becoming clearer and more hardened. Soviet Russia is silent, but it is gradually distancing itself from the great vortex of the world situation and becoming more detached. In addition, the Netherlands is strengthening its military, Northern Ireland has stated that it cannot remain neutral when Britain goes to war with foreign countries, and Britain and France have successively formally informed the Secretariat of the League of Nations that while they will adhere to the arbitration protocols for international disputes in peacetime, they will no longer be bound by the protocols when the overall situation changes drastically and war breaks out. Although these events cannot be regarded as extremely important developments, they represent, either directly or indirectly, a certain part of their attitude toward the current international phenomenon, and indirectly contribute to stabilizing the international situation. The International Anti-Aggression Conference is being held in London and has resolved to support China against Japan. This has no direct relationship with the actions of various governments. However, China's international trajectory is favorable, like a sharp angle advancing rapidly, while Japan's international isolation is becoming increasingly profound, as can be seen at the Anti-Aggression Conference.

The outline of domestic and international developments during these three days is roughly as described above. In short, all developments are moving toward the watershed between right and wrong, good and bad, benefit and harm, and the distance to the final decision is getting closer and closer. Using organized materials to eliminate aggressive enemies and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war is undoubtedly the most arduous and greatest task and mission in Chinese history. The provisional national representative conference last year decided to convene the National Political Council with the aim of concentrating the nation's strength to overcome unprecedented national difficulties and gathering the nation's will to establish the foundation for nation-building. We can say that the greatest contribution of the National Political Council to the country lies in promoting our unified national spirit and enhancing our inherent national morality. The responsiveness of this spirit and morality extends directly to the people in every province and county, and to every sector of culture, economy, and profession. It can inspire the spirit of shared hatred against the enemy and unwavering perseverance, and inspire the national confidence in the bright future of the nation. As the war of resistance enters its second phase, I believe that strengthening the spirit, focusing the spirit, and leading the national spiritual mobilization with our public discussions and actions should be the central focus of this conference. To unite the national spirit, we must ensure that all people establish a common morality for themselves and a firm common belief in the nation. And every individual can strive, struggle, and sacrifice based on this common moral concept and common national belief. What is this common morality? It is sacrificing the individual self for the greater self. What is our common belief? It is the Three Principles of the People. What is the goal of realizing this belief? It is the highest political ideal of our Chinese people, the world of great harmony. The Book of Rites says, "When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. Talented and virtuous people are selected, and good faith and harmony are emphasized. People do not care only for their own parents and children, so that the elderly are cared for, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled are all provided for. Men have their occupations, and women have their homes. People hate to see goods lying unused on the ground, but they do not necessarily hoard them for themselves. They want to exert their efforts, but not necessarily for their own benefit. Therefore, conspiracies are prevented, and thieves and rebels do not arise." This is truly the goal of our nation-building. Achieving this goal is when the people of the whole country share happiness together, and it is when the Three Principles of the People are truly realized. Gentlemen, today we are shedding blood and sweat in the war of resistance on the one hand, and exhausting our wisdom and efforts in nation-building on the other. The new country that our leader Sun Yat-sen wanted to build is to achieve the state of great harmony described in the Book of Rites. The three points mentioned in the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session: Sincerity, purity, and strengthening unity; Contributing ability, freedom, and life to the country, and actively striving; Concentrating all time and energy to implement construction, political construction, and economic construction—these are, of course, for the war of resistance, but also for nation-building. What we focus on is not only the present, but also the distant future. Since our Chinese ideal of nation-building is a state where everyone does not selfishly reserve their efforts, does not selfishly protect their own bodies, and works diligently and helps each other in peace and happiness, our starting point must be sincere and pure, with shared interests, and truly achieving a world that belongs to all. Our efforts must be active, not passive. At the same time, our strengthened strength must be used to expedite all construction related to nation-building. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session not only hopes that all party members will do so, but especially hopes that all compatriots in the country, especially social leaders, will unanimously accept and implement it. Gentlemen, our councilors are all social leaders with rich knowledge and experience. The government, on the one hand, concentrates national talent with the sincerity of "selecting the talented and virtuous" to share the responsibility of the country. At the same time, it hopes to use the four words "emphasizing good faith and harmony" as the foundation for uniting the nation's strength. Therefore, what I sincerely hope from all fellow councilors is that everyone first establish mutual trust and common faith, be open and honest with each other, and create an attitude of harmony and kinship, like brothers and sisters. There is nothing that cannot be spoken frankly, and there is nothing that cannot be understood together. On the one hand, you should collect public opinion as much as possible and earnestly represent public opinion to promote and develop public welfare, knowing everything and saying everything, so that there is complete mutual understanding, integration, and communication between the government and society, without the slightest obstruction. On the other hand, I also hope that you will, with a broad and compassionate mind, implement what our predecessors called "not caring only for their own parents and children," integrating the interests of one person, one family, one village, and one place into the interests of the whole country and the entire nation. We must extend the heart of kinship to respecting the elderly, caring for the poor, and helping our suffering compatriots, and alleviating the country's difficulties. We must extend the heart of loving our own children to loving all the youth in the country, nurturing all the youth in the country, giving them good role models, and guiding them to the path of sincerity, purity, and common struggle for the country, in order to consolidate the long-term life of our nation. If our councilors can lead the country with this spirit, I dare say that "the war of resistance will be won, and the nation-building will be successful." The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of great harmony, will also be realized. In order to specifically illustrate my personal hopes, I will not hesitate to repeatedly put forward two points of view. I believe that after these two points are fully realized, the contribution of our Council to the current war of resistance and nation-building will be even greater, our spirit of sharing national difficulties will be even more evident and bright, and the spirit of our national sages, talents, and leaders can be uplifted, the will of the government and the people can be connected, and the strength of the government and the people can be concentrated. This kind of effect is more than ten times greater than raising the spirit of bravery and sacrifice of the officers and soldiers at the front. What are the two points of hope that I am talking about? First, this conference must fully demonstrate an active spirit. The establishment of our Council is different from the parliaments of ordinary countries. Our organization, spirit, establishment environment, and process are all unprecedented in the history of world politics, and our achievements in the past two conferences, avoiding the common habits of ordinary parliaments as much as possible, are even more something we can be proud of in the world. Now, the work of resistance and nation-building is even more urgent. In order to save time and increase efficiency, I believe that we should go a step further, reduce unimportant proposals as much as possible, and focus more on active, constructive, and practical suggestions and discussions. I remember that at the last conference, a case concerning the method of reviewing original drafts was discussed for a long time, consuming valuable time during the war of resistance. Today, you must all understand that our government is a revolutionary government, a responsible government, and a government that fully relies on public opinion and justice. As long as it does not violate the interests of resistance and nation-building, the government has no reason to restrict the rights of the people. Therefore, every member of our Council does not need to overthink personal interests and freedoms, lest they neglect the overall interests of the country. Today, we must maximize our initiative and avoid the passivity that we have been infected with for thousands of years. Our past national character, such as suspicion, friction, prevention, and confrontation, is all biased towards passivity, which not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consumes much useful energy and hinders much progress, and even delays national affairs. We only see the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties, not because of military incompetence, nor because there was absolutely no patriotic and people-loving sages, but because everyone cherished their own ideas, established their own factions, were selfish and self-serving, and had divergent opinions, which made it impossible to unify the spirit and disperse the will and strength. Looking at the partial interests as higher than the overall interests of the nation, today's compatriots must set a good example for the people of the whole country and future generations, and must replace passivity with activity, replace destruction with construction, and replace suspicion and rejection with mutual assistance and unity. Therefore, this term of our work should focus more on suggestions for all practical plans and methods in the later stage of the war of resistance, and should especially promote the spirit of public loyalty, national unity, and common defense against foreign aggression. All discussions and suggestions should be filled with initiative. Second, this conference should fully promote the spirit of sincerity, purity, mutual trust, and common faith. The country has reached this point today, and if we sit idly by and do not save it, who will save it? The interests of the country and the nation, if we do not cherish and protect them, who will cherish and protect them? We must integrate the individual and the country into one person's strength, and make it become the country's strength. The individual's will must obey the country's will. The country must first gain freedom, and then the individual can truly enjoy freedom. Everyone puts the interests of the country and the nation first, and extend it to others, believing that the people of the Republic of China have the conscience to love their country. With common faith, there must be mutual trust. How can we achieve sincerity and purity? Being willing to sacrifice for the interests of the country and the nation is sincerity. Having no other distracting thoughts outside the country and the nation is purity. We are not afraid to die for the country, let alone other things. We all stand on the interests of the country and the nation, and our publicity must be for the country and the nation, our actions must be for the country and the nation, and even our thoughts must be for the country and the nation. We must make sincere efforts in ourselves, but we must strive purely for the country. We must absolutely believe in each other in people and affairs, and then we can generate common strength to deal with common enemies and accomplish our common aspirations. The people in charge of the government today, if not for the future of the country and the nation, would never be so willing to work hard and bear the burden. If you are not for the future of the country and the nation, you would not work so hard to share the national difficulties. Therefore, the understanding between the government and our councilors is consistent, and the goals are also consistent. We have a common faith in the future of the country and the nation, and we have mutual trust in each other. This can break down all barriers, eliminate all prejudices, and achieve a degree of affection, sincerity, and pragmatism, helping each other in times of difficulty and danger. As long as we rely on this sincerity, any difficulties can be overcome, and any undertaking will be successful. The two points mentioned above are very ordinary thoughts, but the hopes are very sincere. Since the war of resistance, Zhongzheng has been entrusted with a heavy responsibility, and his spirit and will are always connected with all of our colleagues. Now that he has taken over as the speaker of this conference, he has more opportunities to contact you. We can further work together, learn from each other, and share the responsibility in this important mission of resistance and nation-building. I really feel grateful and happy. However, I ask myself to be foolish and clumsy, and I am afraid that I am not enough to live up to the expectations of my colleagues. In the future, if there are any shortcomings in Zhongzheng's personal views, or any mistakes or faults, or inconsistencies in words and deeds, or any insincerity or dishonesty, or inability to fulfill his duties, I hope that you will not hesitate to teach and correct him at any time, so as not to betray this position. Zhongzheng relies only on this foolish loyalty and red heart for the country and the people, and is willing to share weal and woe with everyone, share honor and disgrace, be of one heart and one mind, and carry through to the end, in order to fulfill our mission to resist the war and build the nation, and to answer the expectations of the government and the people of the whole country.

### The British Government Is Considering Continuing Economic Aid to China; British Businesses Operating Inland China Shipping Do Not Recognize Japan's Right to Control

(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Mr. Burke inquired as to what financial measures the government plans to take to aid China, in accordance with the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last September. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied, "This matter is still under consideration, and it is inconvenient to make any statements at this time, which I deeply regret." Mr. Burke then declared, "If the government can take any action in this matter, it will receive the greatest support from the House and the people of the whole country." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that the British government is currently considering a plan to stabilize the value of China's legal tender. Furthermore, due to the establishment of the law expanding the authority of the Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Board of Trade, new trade facilities can be granted to China. In short, the British government will continue to implement its policy of assisting China within the bounds of the law. If Japan becomes embroiled in a serious dispute with France due to the occupation of Hainan Island, the British government will take even tougher measures in accordance with the Anglo-French cooperative policy to deal with it. Regarding the proposal to retaliate against Japan by economic means, no one expressed dissent at yesterday morning's cabinet subcommittee meeting, but a decision was not made to take immediate action. It is generally believed that while the situation in Europe is not yet stable, Britain should proceed cautiously in the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, several members inquired about the expansion of the narcotics trade controlled by Japanese forces in the Shanghai area and various parts of North China occupied by Japanese forces. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied that the information he has received does not indicate any significant changes to the situation described on December 22 of last year. However, he believes that the Japanese authorities may now be aware of the dangers that accompany the development of the drug trade and may be trying to deal with them. A member also asked about the investigation regarding the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company, which I have already reported as completed. Mr. Butler replied that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Phillips, reported that the company is still operating its business but has encountered some difficulties and is currently being reorganized to become a subsidized enterprise of the companies initiated by the Japanese government. The British authorities have protested to the Japanese authorities, stating that the British government does not recognize Japan's right to impose any control measures on British ships operating inland China shipping.

### Democratic Nations Should Cooperate to Stop Japanese Aggression; Anti-Aggression Congress Passes Resolutions; Zhang Pengchun Believes China Will Win the War of Resistance

(London) The Executive Committee of the World Anti-Aggression Congress today passed two resolutions. The first advocates that all countries should: (1) prohibit the shipment of munitions to Japan; (2) establish an international agreement to boycott Japanese goods; (3) the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union should genuinely cooperate to assist China and stop aggression, and refuse to supply aggressor nations with money or other war necessities. The original text stated, "If the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can genuinely cooperate at this time, it will not be difficult for China to win the war against the aggressor as a result of its heroic resistance." The second is related to the Spanish Civil War, stating that although the World Anti-Aggression Congress wishes to see an early end to the fratricide among the Spanish people, it opposes placing any pressure on the legitimate government of that country to force it to surrender unconditionally. Peace-loving nations should establish an agreement to guarantee the following: (1) respect Spain's political and economic independence and sovereignty; (2) immediately withdraw foreign combatants and prevent foreign forces from controlling Spain; (3) after the cessation of hostilities between the parties involved in the civil war, no Spaniard should be mistreated for their political views during the war. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

(London) At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Anti-Aggression Congress held in London today, a letter from Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was read, expressing gratitude for the material and spiritual assistance given to China by the Congress, and declaring China's determination to continue the war of resistance. The meeting was attended by sixty representatives from seventeen countries. Zhang Pengchun addressed the audience, stating that China has always been confident that final victory will belong to China, and this confidence is now even stronger than at the beginning of the war. Events in the Far East and Europe are interrelated. The concessions made during the tense situation in Europe last September led to the Japanese attack on Guangzhou. The occupation of Hainan Island is another new blow to Britain and France, as the island is a strategically important point that can be used to attack Hong Kong, Annam, and the Philippines. Japan will now use Hainan Island as a base for its air force and submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### China Rebuilding Air Force

(Chongqing) According to official sources, the expansion and reconstruction of the Chinese Air Force in 1939 is now actively underway. When the war began 19 months ago, China had only 300 front-line aircraft and 1,200 combat personnel. During the war, the strength of the Air Force has been damaged, making it necessary to rebuild it. According to Mr. Qian Dajun, Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission, the goals of rebuilding the Air Force include (1) increasing the number of front-line aircraft to 500, (2) training more aviation talents, and (3) building more airfields in the interior. In addition, the principles are (1) maintaining a front-line aircraft count of 500, (2) replenishing them monthly as needed, (3) restoring and increasing manufacturing capacity, (4) increasing the efficiency of repair work, (5) providing rigorous training to aviation personnel, (6) building more and better airfields, (7) consolidating the ranks of senior aviation personnel and improving the entire administration of the Aviation Commission. Also, when the war began, the Japanese sent 200 aircraft to China, which had increased several times by the end of last year, totaling 826, including 330 in North China, 120 in Guangdong and Fujian, and 376 in Central China. To date, the number of Japanese aircraft operating in China has increased to 1,200, accounting for 60% of the total strength of the Japanese Air Force.

### Japanese Forces Withdraw from the Yangtze River Basin; Now Fewer Than 200,000 Troops

(Chongqing) Japanese forces in the Yangtze River basin have recently made large-scale withdrawals. People from all walks of life in China are puzzled as to why. It is now known that the withdrawn Japanese forces have gathered in the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong in North China and are now engaged in suppressing guerrilla forces in North China. There is currently fierce fighting in central Hebei Province, with Japanese forces attempting to encircle General Lu Zhonglin, chairman of Hebei Province, and the troops of Generals Zhang Yingwu and Sun Lianzhong. According to reliable sources here, there are now fewer than 200,000 Japanese troops in the Yangtze River basin. Japanese forces have abandoned many cities and towns between Beijing and Hankou, so Huangmei in eastern Hubei and Hukou below Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province are now back under Chinese control. It is reported that Japanese forces have also withdrawn from the entire area east of the Ping-Han Railway in northeastern Hubei Province. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### No Traces of Japanese Troops in Daqi Territory

(Wuyuan) Over three hundred Japanese troops from Baotou attacked Huaxinminbao Xiaonao and other places on the 13th of this month.

### The Soviet Union Actively Enhances National Strength, Aiming to Lay a Foundation for Resistance Against Japan, Industrializing the Far East Region, Pursuing a Policy of Appeasement Towards Germany and Italy

(Moscow) Observers here recently declared that, for several months, Soviet Russian foreign policy has undergone significant changes. While the principle of collective security has not been publicly abandoned, it has leaned towards a policy of appeasement towards the omnipotent nations of Europe. Towards Japan, it has adopted a relatively tough stance, but without resorting to severe measures. Instead, it is intensifying industrialization and land reclamation policies in the Far East region to enhance national strength and lay the foundation for resistance. For example, coal production must be doubled, and 75% of planned iron smelters will be located in the Far East region. Once the Third Five-Year Economic Plan is implemented, most factories will be moved from the Soviet Russian mainland to Siberia. Furthermore, the Soviet Russian authorities are demanding the full recovery of thirty Japanese fishing grounds in the coastal strategic zones of the Primorsky Krai. They will also restrict Japanese business operations in the area, such as the North Sakhalin Japanese Oil Company. Such measures will be promoted in an orderly manner. However, the Soviet Russian authorities are also well aware that their navy is not yet a match for Japan, so they do not want to completely expel Japanese fishermen from Soviet Russian territorial waters to avoid retaliatory actions by the Japanese navy. As for Japan in the eyes of the Soviet Union, due to the uncertainty of when the Sino-Japanese War will end, Japan has no remaining strength to take large-scale military action against Russia. The occupation of Hainan Island by Japanese forces is seen as an echo of Germany and Italy, threatening France and Britain. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(Moscow) The recent changes in Soviet Russia's foreign policy are clearly due to the various developments in the international situation. This has also been mentioned by local radio stations and newspapers. It is claimed that since the Munich Agreement, the actions of France and Britain have effectively released Soviet Russia from its obligations. Since then, Soviet Russia has been completely free in dealing with various international issues and is not subject to any constraints. If war breaks out in Europe, Soviet Russia can stay out of it, similar to the situation of the United States not being drawn into the vortex. At the same time, no matter how Soviet Russia and Germany get along, the Soviet Russian side will never ask its neighbors to take sides between Russia and Germany. In other words, those countries can maintain friendly relations with both Russia and Germany simultaneously. In addition, regarding the plan of Finland and Sweden to build fortifications on the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea, Soviet Russia will not raise any objections. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### British Foreign Policy Changes, Promoting Relations with the Soviet Union, Minister of Overseas Trade Visits Moscow, Politically Significant

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, will visit Moscow and other places in the second half of March to implement the British government's desire to increase and strengthen relations with other governments, and will pay special attention to the possibilities of trade relations. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently announced in the House of Commons that the Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, is scheduled to visit Moscow in late March. Well-informed sources here say that this trip is of great political significance, but official circles say that this trip is only intended to adjust the commercial agreement signed between Britain and the Soviet Union in 1936. When Hudson goes to Moscow, he will be accompanied by the Director of the Economic Department of the Foreign Office, Ward King (currently in Berlin), to visit the Nordic countries en route, to discuss the adjustment of British commercial relations with those countries, especially the issue of increasing British exports. In short, Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, has made many efforts to promote relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Hudson's visit to the Soviet Union is indeed a signal of Britain's political and economic reconciliation with the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Hudson, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, will travel to Moscow and other northern European capitals in late March. Currently, Hudson and Stanley, the Minister of the Department of Overseas Trade, are preparing to go to Berlin to discuss British-German trade relations. It is rumored that Hudson will also visit Poland and Finland. The current plan is to go from Berlin to Warsaw, then to Moscow, and return home via Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The main purpose of this trip is to persuade industrialists from various countries to purchase more British-made products. Recently, the Department of Overseas Trade has received complaints from manufacturers and chambers of commerce, referring to British-Soviet trade as one-sided. Hudson will now draw the attention of the Soviet authorities to this request. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### British and German Economic Talks, Seeking to Ease Trade Competition

(Berlin) Ward King, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, has arrived in Berlin to conduct economic talks between Britain and Germany. These talks will continue until the arrival of Stanley, the British Minister of Overseas Trade. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

(London) Financial and economic circles here generally believe that Germany's economic situation is extremely difficult, food is particularly scarce, and the people are suffering greatly. Although the country is expanding its political influence everywhere, it is not enough to alleviate the economic situation. If the country's current economic policy is not changed, a serious crisis will soon arrive, without a doubt. Some people in the country also deeply know that isolation is not a good plan and are willing to promote economic relations with other countries. This can be seen from the country's commercial negotiations with various countries and the upcoming visit of a delegation from the British Confederation of Industries to Germany. It is hoped that the future negotiations between Britain and Germany can strengthen the power enjoyed by these people, and that Germany can abandon its dumping policy and establish an agreement with Britain to avoid mutual competition in the world market. Otherwise, Britain is prepared to implement a dumping policy and use Germany's spear to attack Germany's shield. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### British-Soviet Reunion, Russian Embassy in London Hosts British Political Leaders

(London) Maisky, the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Britain, hosted a banquet at the embassy last night for British Foreign Secretary Halifax, and invited Liberal Party leader Churchill and many others to accompany him. British political figures paid close attention to this reunion. A few hours before the banquet, Prime Minister Chamberlain had just announced in the House of Commons that the Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, would soon visit Moscow. It is generally believed that this is a manifestation of efforts to strengthen British-Soviet relations. (Haitong dispatch, 21st)

### Soviet-Polish Trade Agreement Established, Based on the Most Favored Nation Principle

(Moscow) After weeks of negotiations, the Soviet Union and Poland signed an agreement here on the 19th to adjust all economic relations between the two countries, including a commercial treaty, a goods exchange agreement, and a clearing agreement. The Soviet representative signing the agreement was Mikoyan, Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade, and the Polish representative was Lichovski, Chairman of the Commercial Negotiation Delegation and Ambassador to the Soviet Union. This agreement is the first general economic treaty concluded between the two countries based on the most-favored-nation principle. It includes several basic provisions regarding the exchange of goods and shipping. Regarding the exchange of goods, the agreement has expanded the volume of trade between the two sides. The Soviet Union mainly exports cotton, cotton yarn ends, furs, apatite, tobacco, manganese ore, asbestos, pencil lead, etc. to Poland. Poland exports coal, iron, zinc, cotton fabrics, cotton textile machinery, leather, and trace elements to the Soviet Union. The clearing agreement stipulates that the payment of prices and other matters should be resolved by the Polish Accounting Institute with the consent of both parties. (TASS dispatch, 20th)

### British House of Commons Debates Defense Budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Requests Issuance of Huge Amount of Public Debt, So That Military Build-Up Plans Can Be Completed on Schedule

(London) When British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon moved in the House of Commons today to pass a bill to increase the government's defense borrowing power to 800 million pounds, the two-day debate on defense in the House of Commons began. Simon said that this borrowing power not only involves the army, navy, and air force, but also includes air raid prevention and food storage. The British military build-up plan is intended to be completed within five years, and according to the original estimates, it will cost about 1.5 billion pounds. In the first three years, a total of 1.25 billion pounds is needed for the army, navy, air force, and civil defense. It is now estimated that defense spending will be 406 million pounds by the end of March 1940, of which 274 million pounds will be compensated from national income, and the remaining 130 million pounds will be taken from debt. He felt that the fiscal year 1939-40 will be a period of great economic development and one of the most substantial progress. It is estimated that defense spending in that year will be 580 million pounds, of which 230 million pounds will be covered by taxes, and the remaining 350 million pounds must be paid for by debt. In the first three years of the 1.25 billion pounds of defense spending, a total of 700 million pounds will be covered by taxes, and the rest must be financed by debt. The government has decided that there are sufficient reasons to raise debt to finance the military build-up plan. The financial resources required for defense are greater than what taxes can bear, and this point is probably generally recognized by the people of the country. Since the military build-up plan must be completed within a limited five-year period, it would seem unfair to clear all the expenses within five years. However, the people of the country must express their willingness to bear it year by year, so there is a proposal to increase the government's borrowing power so that it can be repaid gradually by tax revenue year by year. The estimates of the army, navy, and air force will be released in a few days. He estimated that 230 million pounds could be allocated from tax revenue, and the remaining 350 million pounds should be raised by debt. The people of the country must know that the number of defense expenditures actually includes civil defense. In the period from 1932 to 1935, the country had witnessed a prosperous trend, so the burden taken from the people in 1931 could be reduced a lot. In the past three years, the British people have increased income tax three times, totaling one shilling more per pound. In addition, there is a temporary defense tax, which will be fully harvested in the next year. We are born at this time, just in time for the opportunity to bear this burden, but we must not lose our current responsibility, nor can we incur the condemnation of future generations. All the repayment terms of the debt are clearly stipulated. When an administrative department is allowed by the National Assembly to issue public debt, an annual interest of 3% will be borne by the department until the end of the five-year period, after which the principal and interest will be paid to the Ministry of Finance in 30 installments.

Simon then put forward the following proposals: (1) To increase the borrowing power approved by the 1937 Defense Public Debt Act from 400 million pounds to 800 million pounds; (2) To redefine the definition of defense so that the debt raised can be used for civil defense and to fund the necessary goods preparation fund. Simon continued that civil defense is becoming an increasingly important part of the entire national defense today. It is regrettable that the world has used such huge sums of money for this purpose instead of using it to promote peace (loud cheers from the audience). If general disarmament is achieved, it will definitely improve the situation, but if we still have to bear this burden, then we should at least know that other countries also feel that the burden is no lighter than ours. We should also know that our country, with its financial resources and other sources of benefits, as well as the characteristics of the British people and their belief in democracy, will definitely be able to take on difficult tasks. Labor Party Dalton, representing the opposition Labor Party, moved a formal amendment to reduce the borrowing power by 100 million pounds, saying that the total amount of defense spending was too high and unprecedented in peacetime. If this money is used on the assumption that a great war will occur, then there should be protection measures for those who stay in the country to engage in production. He hoped that the government would declare to the House of Commons that it would not reject the House of Commons' request to allocate funds to build deep bomb shelters. The Labor Party had no reason to trust the government's defense plan. Liberal Party Shelley, representing the opposition Liberal Party, said that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that we are using this huge amount of money due to the German threat. Now that we have used this huge amount of money, we should strive to ensure that when the threat comes, we are prepared. The issue of the future expeditionary force will definitely become a very big event. In terms of the army, what we are facing now is even more serious than what we had before the last European war, because we now know that Germany's peacetime army is about one million people. Although we are using this huge amount of money in the country, it is still a major issue whether we will send our troops to join forces with the European army. He felt that continuing the military build-up may not be able to promote the most complete security possible, and it seemed appropriate to make extra efforts in the area of collective security. Simon's remarks on raising defense funds were well received by all parties. Many people believed that there would be no further increase in income tax in the next year. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Italy Increases Troops in Libya, Clearly Contradicting the British-Italian Agreement, British Members of Parliament Question the Undersecretary of State Who is Almost Unable to Cope

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, many members of Parliament questioned the Undersecretary of State, Butler, who seemed almost unable to cope, as to whether Italy's repeated increase of troops in its North African Libyan territory contradicted the British-Italian agreement. He first said that since the 8th of this month, the Foreign Office had not received any reports of Italy increasing its troops in Libya. Until recently, the Italian government had notified British Ambassador Sir Payne that, in order to maintain the security of Libya, it would send 30,000 more troops to the area for defense. Once the official departure is made, the British government will be notified in accordance with the military intelligence exchange measures contained in the British-Italian agreement. Henderson, the opposition Labor Party member of Parliament, then asked, "Italy's repeated increase of troops in Libya contradicts the British-Italian agreement." Butler again answered with ambiguous words, "The Italian government has promised to reduce the number of troops stationed in Libya to 30,000, which should not be considered a violation of the British-Italian agreement." Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, immediately declared, "According to the British-Italian agreement, this number of troops stationed should have been reduced. Now Undersecretary of State Butler says so, is it that this agreement must be implemented at a later date?" Butler replied, "Regarding this matter, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano made a commitment to the British government in a letter dated April 16 of last year. This promise has actually been fulfilled." Major Attlee said again, "Then the so-called reduction in the number of troops is a temporary measure, and it can still be increased afterwards, is that the case?" (All members of the opposition party laughed upon hearing this). Butler replied again, "The Italian Foreign Minister's letter does not involve the permanent application of this level." At this point, Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, also asked, "After the government added 30,000 troops to Libya, is the number of troops stationed there the same as the original number before the British-Italian agreement was signed? In other words, is it the same as the number of troops before the reduction?" Butler replied, "Yes, that is indeed the case." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### With British and French Cooperation and Mediation, the End of the Spanish War is Not Far Off, The Two Countries Will Soon Recognize the Franco Regime, French Officials Have Cordial Talks in Burgos

(London) The Times diplomatic correspondent said on Sunday that when Britain recognizes the Franco government in the future, former Air Force Minister Swinton may be appointed as the British ambassador to Burgos. According to the newspaper's Paris dispatch, Paris believes that the Spanish armistice treaty is expected to be established at the end of this month. It is rumored that Western countries are currently requesting General Franco to give assurances that (1) he will not join the Anti-Comintern Pact, (2) he will not form a close alliance with Italy and Germany, and (3) he will not allow British loans to be transferred to the treasuries of Germany and Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

(London) Regarding the issue of recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government, well-informed sources here recently declared that the current situation should not be delayed. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the current diplomatic negotiations, the British government will recognize the Nationalist government as the legal government within this week. The reason why it has not yet been implemented is to wait for the negotiations between French right-wing Senator Pétain and the Nationalist government to come to an end, and to satirize the Republican government to make it understand that the Nationalist government will be recognized sooner or later. It is better to surrender unconditionally. As for the issue of amnesty for Spanish political prisoners, although Britain and France have repeatedly made representations, General Franco has not yet publicly promised guarantees. At this time, the only thing that can be hoped for is that the Nationalist government will make vague promises, stating that it does not intend to take advantage of the victory to severely punish dissidents politically. Such promises will have no binding force, but Prime Minister Chamberlain can report to the House of Commons that the authorities of the Spanish Nationalist government will definitely not go too far. Then, in legal terms, recognition can be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Burgos French right-wing Senator Pétain, bearing a mandate, came here and held talks with General Jordana, the National Government's aide and foreign minister, as well as the heads of the European, cultural, and political departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for a total of six hours yesterday afternoon. According to well-informed sources, the atmosphere was originally very gloomy when they started talking, but it improved by evening. According to well-informed sources, the talks were limited to the issue of establishing diplomatic relations and did not involve the issue of mediating the domestic war. Pétain has already reported the process and his impressions to Foreign Minister Bonnet via long-distance telephone today, and will submit a written report to the Foreign Minister tomorrow. He will continue to meet with General Jordana on the 22nd of this month, or he may return to Paris the next day, which is not certain. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Japanese Troops Invade Cliff, Battle Situation: Self-Defense Corps and Strong Young Men Rise Up to Resist Japan; Leizhou Peninsula Greatly Threatened

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong, after occupying Hainan Island on the morning of the 10th, have continued their aggression for several days, not ceasing due to protests from France and England. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army used transport ships to carry 5,000 soldiers, assisted by more than 20 gunboats and three large squadrons of aircraft, first landing at Haikou City. Chinese troops were stationed in Haikou, and the Xiuying Fort had returned fire, bombarding the Japanese ships, but ultimately were outnumbered and the fort was too close to the coast, resulting in it being controlled by Japanese warships and aircraft. The Chinese troops, for strategic reasons, then moved to a new position. After the Japanese army landed in Haikou, they advanced southward, pushing into the hinterland, dividing into three routes to attack Ding'an, Chengmai, and Wenchang. Until the 13th, several thousand Chinese troops and local forces on Hainan Island were still guarding the Fuhai Highway (from Qiongshan County Fucheng to Haikou), intercepting the enemy step by step. At the same time, heavy troops were stationed in Anren, south of Qiongshan County, to protect the Chengmai-Ding'an line, and the situation is still stalemated. After being blocked, the Japanese army has dispatched planes for several days to bomb cities such as Wenchang, burning civilian houses and causing civilians to flee to the interior. It is heard that the Japanese army has landed one division and two marine corps in Haikou over the past three days. The Chinese troops in Ding'an front are now under the command of Wang Yi, commander of the Hainan Island Garrison, and Yun Zhenzhong, deputy commander. Wu Daonan, commissioner of the Ninth District Administrative Inspectorate, has also mobilized local armed groups to cooperate with the regular army. Currently, the self-defense corps and strong young men teams from Ding'an, Wenchang, Nada, Jiaji, and other counties and cities have been dispatched, no less than 80,000 to 90,000 people. The authorities have ordered the coastal officials of Hainan Island to completely destroy the roads within three days, and all food must be moved to the interior. When the Japanese army landed in Haikou on the morning of the 10th, in order to contain the Chinese troops, they sent a part of their troops, protected by several ships, to forcibly land at Yulin Port (belonging to Yaxian County) at the southern end of Hainan Island. This was discovered by the Chinese local forces, who met them with a head-on attack. The Japanese army's attempt to seize the port was actually because there were huge salt fields near the port, and they intended to take the opportunity to loot salt, but the salt had been transported away by the Chinese troops in advance, and considerable forces were stationed at the port to guard it. Therefore, the Japanese army tried to land at Yulin Port twice that day, but both attempts failed.

Hainan Island is geographically isolated from the mainland, north of the Leizhou Peninsula, separated only by a strait. The coastal areas are all plains, with no natural defenses. The central mountains run vertically, making it defensible and attackable. The island has a population of about 3 million, with the Li ethnic group accounting for three-tenths, known for their bravery and combativeness. Strategically, the defending troops are bound to abandon the coastal counties, but even if the Japanese army has landed, it will face significant difficulties in defense. The Wuzhi Mountain area in the center is mostly plateau, with mountain caves reaching 5,000 feet above sea level. Furthermore, with the defense works that the Chinese army has long operated, the Japanese air force will likely have difficulty exerting its power. After the coastal residents fled the war zone, they have now moved to the mountainous areas. Hainanese people residing in Hong Kong have formulated relief measures for the refugees yesterday, immediately establishing the Hainan Island Refugee Relief Association, and sending telegrams to Hainanese people overseas and inland to donate funds for relief, while purchasing food and chartering ships to provide assistance. At the same time, they have also telegraphed the China Relief Council to allocate funds for assistance.

The Japanese army has stated that occupying Hainan Island is a base for invading the southern part of Guangdong Province and the border of Guangxi, strengthening the blockade of South China's international transportation routes. The French fleet has paid close attention and sailed to Haikou to investigate the actual actions of the Japanese army. The authorities of the Chinese troops in southern Guangdong are actively deploying defenses in preparation for any eventuality. The Qinlian area is the only way to enter Guangxi. In addition to building defensive works, elite troops from Guangdong and Guangxi have been added to guard every section, and mechanized units have been transferred to annihilate the enemy. The highway from Qinxian to Nanning has been destroyed in sections, and the defense is very thorough. After Haikou on Hainan Island was occupied by the Japanese army, the Leizhou Peninsula on the opposite shore was greatly threatened. Xuwen and Haikang counties protrude into the sea and are threatened by the enemy on both sides. Yesterday, it was reported that Japanese warships were cruising in the waters of Haian Port in Xuwen, and the county authorities have made war preparations. However, according to general observation, although the Leizhou Peninsula is connected to Hainan Island, it is still worrying. However, because the northeast of the peninsula has the French Guangzhou Bay, if the Japanese army invades the Leizhou Peninsula again, it will lead to direct conflict between Japan and France, creating more diplomatic complications. It is expected that after the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, Xuwen and other counties may be able to survive temporarily. However, this is a theoretical speculation, and it cannot be applied to those who are crazy about militarism. (February 14)

### The Japanese Army in Yangxian Shao Attempted to Invade East, But Failed; They Immediately Withdrew After Suffering Heavy Losses, But Wasted a Lot of Ammunition

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou and its subordinate areas of Xiannvmiao and Shaobo have been attempting to invade eastward for days. On the 13th, two trucks departed from Yangzhou, loaded with 60-70 Japanese soldiers, four cannons, and 18 boxes of shells, heading to Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. The Japanese army in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo also purchased a large amount of food and supplies, actively preparing for an eastward invasion. On the morning of the 14th, Yangzhou sent over 100 more Japanese soldiers to Xiannvmiao, joining the original garrison there, totaling about 400 soldiers. They then divided into three routes to set out. The first route advanced from Xiannvmiao to Zhangwanggou. At the same time, the Japanese artillery in Xiannvmiao fired dozens of shells from Henan, covering the advance. They arrived at Zhangwanggou around 11:00 AM. The Chinese troops there, in order to avoid the real and attack the empty, had already gathered at a certain location. The Japanese army attacked an empty camp and immediately withdrew, burning down a bathhouse and a temple in the town and looting a large amount of food such as chickens, ducks, and pork. The second route, with over 200 soldiers, set out from Xiannvmiao at the same time, attempting to invade Zhuanqiao. They arrived at Sanguantang, about three miles away from Zhuanqiao, and, knowing that the Chinese troops were prepared, did not dare to act rashly. Around 3:00 PM, they all withdrew. The third route, with over 100 soldiers, carrying four small steel cannons, set out at 6:00 AM to harass Dahanzitou. Dahanzitou is more than ten miles northeast of Xiannvmiao. The Japanese army had suffered a great defeat there by the guerrillas, so this time they planned to vigorously "suppress" this guerrilla force. However, the guerrillas had already dispersed into smaller units, and the Japanese army's attempt completely failed. They then conducted a large-scale search in the area and set fire to the Doutian Temple, withdrawing around 1:00 PM. In total, the Japanese army gained nothing from this operation and wasted a lot of ammunition. After the Japanese army withdrew to Xiannvmiao, they immediately set up a cannon and a small steel cannon at the east and west ends of the town, guarding against a Chinese counterattack.

### Fierce Battle in Wuzhen; Chinese Troops Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack; Rumor Has It That the Japanese Army Has Collapsed and Retreated

Tongxiang Correspondence: After Wuzhen, which belongs to Tongxiang County, was occupied by the Japanese army some time ago, the various Chinese troops were concentrated outside the Zha Shan, etc., and reorganized and redeployed by the captain Zhu. Together with a friendly army division, they repeatedly contacted the Japanese army in the four suburbs. Due to their weak forces, the Japanese army only relied on fortifications to resist stubbornly. It is reported that the Chinese troops began a general counterattack on the 17th, and the battle was fierce. The sound of gunfire did not cease from morning to night, which was unprecedented since the anti-Japanese war in western Zhejiang. According to those who fled from there, the casualties on both sides were heavy, and corpses were scattered everywhere. By dusk, the Japanese army was unable to hold on and retreated towards the south fence. There were also more than 20 Japanese motorboats in Baimatang, about two or three miles away from Wuzhen, fully loaded with soldiers, seemingly sailing from Jiaxing to reinforce Wuzhen.

### Japanese Warships Harass Dinghai; Open Fire and Bombard the Coastline

Dinghai Correspondence: Two Japanese warships arrived in the Qianjiang River area of Datoutou, in this county, at noon on the 17th. After dropping anchor, they removed the gun covers. At 1:00 PM, they opened fire and bombarded the coastline, firing a total of eleven shots. The Chinese side suffered little damage. The Japanese warships retreated immediately after the shelling.

### The Puppet Tax Office in Kunshan Was Destroyed; But the Traitors Still Suppress the Peasants

Kunshan Correspondence: The Kunshan puppet county government has long coveted the enormous amount of over one million in taxes from the entire county. But since the opening of the collection counter last year, the income has been very small. Recently, on the proposal of Xie Anbo, the director of the puppet tax office, a large number of puppet officials were sent to various villages to urge the collection, in the hope of increasing revenue. Ma Ziliang, the puppet tax director of Jia Hong, is a local rogue and a disciple of Lu Ruifu, the chief tax collector of the puppet tax office. He held an important position in the tax office before the war. This time, he was appointed as the director of the puppet tax office in Chajiahama, and he is in fact Xie's henchman. After Lu arrived in Cha, he forced the collection of taxes and desperately urged the collection. Whenever villagers were unwilling to pay taxes, he ordered the puppet police to arrest them, acting lawlessly and recklessly. Under this tyranny, the general weak villagers dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. However, the more severe the oppression, the stronger the resistance. A few days ago, Jin A'mei, Jin Bingsheng, and other villagers near Zhen gathered more than 300 villagers and destroyed the puppet tax office and the puppet self-defense group. All the puppet officials and puppet self-defense team members fled in all directions. After the villagers achieved their goal, they then drove the puppet Baozhang Yu to the scene of the incident and set fire to the house of Fang Ya, who initiated the rent resistance. Because the puppet Baozhang acted as a tiger's paw, helping the puppet office to urge the collection, he deserved to be punished. Later, the puppet director Ma Ziliang rushed to report to the puppet chief collection office and dispatched more than 100 puppet police officers to arrest Jin Bingsheng, Jin A'mei, etc., and tortured them cruelly. It is heard that the two have been secretly executed recently, but the peasants are still firmly resisting the payment of taxes.

### Lingdong Church Appeals to the United States to Ban the Shipment of Munitions and Gasoline to Japan

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese air force indiscriminately bombs churches, hospitals, and schools, and even forcibly occupies the charitable and educational institutions run by the American Baptist Church in China. The business that Americans have painstakingly operated in various parts of China for nearly a hundred years has almost vanished. The Lingdong Baptist Church has sent letters to the American General Assembly reporting the actual situation and requested the US government to prohibit arms dealers from selling munitions and gasoline to the aggressors. Recently, the Lingdong Baptist Church has received a reply from Dr. Howard of the General Assembly, stating that he has notified all church pastors and members in the United States to urge the US government to effectively implement the ban on the transportation of munitions to Japan. The churches here are very pleased to hear the great sympathy from all over America. Because the planes, bombs, and gasoline used by the Japanese air force are mostly purchased from American arms dealers. If strictly prohibited, disasters in the interior of China can be reduced, and the future of world peace will also benefit a lot.

There are 72 foreign households here, with 136 men and women, all of whom sympathize with China's resistance to Japan. Unless absolutely necessary, they will not leave the country. Among the foreigners, the British account for the most, with 58 British men and 10 women, 16 American men and 11 women, 9 German men and 2 women, 7 French men and 4 women, 1 Russian man and 2 women, 3 Dutch men and 1 woman, 2 Norwegian men, 3 Swiss men and 1 woman, and 1 Portuguese man. The foreigners here are able to live and work in peace.

### Golden Gate International Exposition Opens in San Francisco; President Roosevelt's Speech: Upholding Democracy, Criticizing Dictatorship, Promoting Good Neighborliness and American Security; Besides Resisting Aggression, He Abhors Resorting to Force

(San Francisco) President Roosevelt delivered a radio address today at the opening ceremony of the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, criticizing dictatorial systems, saying that the American countries have established a model of international unity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance, which can revive trust in the hearts of the worried and uneasy, and can elevate democracy far above dictatorial cruelty. The US President then issued a radio address at the opening ceremony of another venue in Tampa, Florida, expounding the US foreign policy, saying that we want to promote the freedom of trade and travel, and the exchange of human cultural life by various legal means. We do not want to expand our land, nor do we covet our neighbors. We are willing to cooperate with anyone who faithfully proposes any suggestions for disarmament. Besides dealing with aggression, we abhor resorting to force. However, we must tell the world that the democratic government system in the Western Hemisphere, which has the consent of the governed, must be maintained. (Reuters, 18th)

(San Francisco) At 8:00 AM this morning, as soon as the gates of the Golden Gate International Exposition opened, thousands of people rushed in to participate in the exhibition. A total of thirty-six countries participated in the exhibition. China was absent due to military difficulties. The "Treasure Island" where the venue is located will be converted into a Pacific aviation base in the future. (Reuters, 18th)

### Receiving Ominous Intelligence From Overseas; The US President Worries About the European Situation; It Is Said That the Totalitarian Countries Will Use Terror Tactics; Or Will Shorten the Period of Naval Review

(New York) It is heard from official circles that President Roosevelt will shorten his period of naval review because he has received reports on overseas developments. It is rumored that the totalitarian countries may use aggressive terror tactics instead of the usual diplomatic methods in order to make further demands. When President Roosevelt met with reporters on the way to Key West, he said that because the international situation is unsettling, he may return to Washington before March 3rd or 4th. From this, it can be seen that President Roosevelt had already indicated that he might have to return to the capital early. As for the nature of the reports received by President Roosevelt, it has not yet been announced. However, according to what United Press International has heard, overseas developments are quite possible, not just something that may happen. (Reuters, 18th)

(Washington) It is rumored that President Roosevelt received intelligence about developments in Europe, so he will reduce the period of the naval review and return to the capital early. Key figures in Congress said that they did not know whether President Roosevelt had received intelligence. The State Department was relatively inactive, but it was said that President Roosevelt may have exchanged phone calls with the ambassadors to Britain and France, and thus obtained special intelligence. (Reuters, 19th)

(London) The meaning of "ominous news from overseas" mentioned by President Roosevelt when he met with reporters in Key West is unclear to the world. London is paying close attention to the news that President Roosevelt is going to Key West to observe the US naval maneuvers and may return to Washington early. However, political circles do not know the details of what special intelligence President Roosevelt received that caused him to make this statement. (Reuters, 19th)

### German and Italian Newspapers Ridicule and Criticize

(Berlin) Since US President Roosevelt issued a mysterious report, saying that because he had received disturbing news about the European situation, he might shorten the period of visiting the naval exercises and return to Washington early, the "Berlin Evening News" here recently responded, saying, "The European situation here is as usual, we have not found any new serious developments." "It is also heard that various American news agencies telegraphed their European branches from New York, inquiring about the source of the news, but so far, there is no sign of a crisis in Europe." The newspaper said, "Why should President Roosevelt be so worried about Europe? In fact, Europe has nothing to do with Roosevelt, and he does not need to bother his mind and worry about it." (Haitong, 21st)

(Rome) All the newspapers here published President Roosevelt's remarks that he might shorten his trip. A political observer said that if the US president really made the statement that he might have to change his plan due to ominous overseas intelligence, then he was just playing a drama. According to non-official sources, people chatting in clubs now hold the view that there will be developments soon, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will be the first to act after the election of the new pope. An editorial in the Stampa newspaper said that there is a growing impression that the two Anglo-Saxon nations have decided to use strong methods and have a disapproving attitude towards the totalitarian countries. (Reuters, 19th)

### Japanese, German, and Italian Aggressive Ambitions; Pittman Launches a Major Attack; Saying Nurturing Them Will Lead to Trouble

(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address this afternoon, attacking the totalitarian countries with very strong language. He said, in brief, that the totalitarian countries all want to dominate the world, and the American people are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend the ideals they believe in. "Because the American people cherish these ideals so deeply, they value them even more than their lives." "If all our countrymen sincerely want to prevent the United States from being dragged into the vortex of war again, then the only way is to promote an active policy, that is, to use powerful means to safeguard its interests in the 'whole world.' The so-called appeasement policy, 'not only nurtures trouble, but also violates morality.'" "Life is only a few decades, and death is only once. Rather than enduring humiliation and lingering on, it is better to sacrifice for the ideals they cherish. In other words, even if it means dying a few days earlier for Christian dogma, justice, and freedom, it is worth it." After such an impassioned speech, Pittman went on to directly attack the head of state, Hitler, saying, in brief, "Hitler's eastward policy was originally intended to occupy the Ukrainian region to reach Siberia. If anyone suspects that I am exaggerating, please read Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf' and they will suddenly understand. As for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, we will not criticize him for the time being, although there are things that must be exposed, that is, he has completely militarized Italy and has a strong force at his command, and because of the international situation, it has evolved into the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis. As for Japan, its ambition lies in dominating the Asian continent and the Pacific islands. Combining the goals of these three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, is to prepare to control Latin America. As far as the current situation is concerned, the intrusion of these countries into Latin America is not a major issue, because if Germany and Italy can control Europe, and Japan can control Asia, then they can proceed to plot Latin America. It is far away from now, but the situation is like this, and the signs are obvious, so we should prevent it as early as possible. Who says it is not appropriate?" The saying goes, "Prepare for a rainy day, be prepared for trouble." This is what all rational people must feel the same way. (Havas, 20th)

### British Newspaper Discusses the Japanese Army: Laborious But Ineffective

(London) The Manchester Guardian stated that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the initiative has always been in the hands of the Japanese army. Now, for the first time, it has shifted to the Chinese army. Since the successive fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, the Japanese army has been in a laborious but ineffective state. The soldiers are tired and frustrated, and the officers are confused and at a loss. People may think that now is the time for the Chinese people to work together, but in reality it is not necessarily so, because the territory is too vast and the transportation is inconvenient. Chinese soldiers can match Japanese soldiers, but the officers are inferior. China's greatest hope lies in the organization of large-scale guerrilla warfare, and, when necessary, the arming of farmers and villagers. The guerrilla movement will spread further in the future, and the Japanese will not be able to stop it. A year later, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army may gladly accept any peace conditions that can be secured. (Reuters, 21st)

### Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman Chiang's Radio Address: Past Work Suited the Needs of the War of Resistance; Should Work Harder to Rebuild the Spirit of National Construction

(Chongqing) Amid the celebrations of the Lunar New Year by the residents of Chongqing, government agencies, due to the national crisis, continue to work as usual despite the holidays. This year's Lunar New Year's Day happens to be the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang gave a speech on the great significance of this movement on the radio last night. (Reuters, 19th)

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang broadcasted a speech on the 18th for the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. The full text is recorded below.

Fellow countrymen across the country, today is the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. We will thoroughly review the achievements of the New Life Movement in the past five years, and compare them with the situation of the country and the nation in the past five years. First, we feel that the five years have passed very quickly, but our efforts for the cause of restoration have not really reached the level we expected. The spirit of our compatriots is still not fully invigorated, and we have not achieved the point where everyone can do their best and fulfill their duties. But at the same time, we also feel that the seeds sown five years ago have after all produced considerable results. Due to the awakening of the New Life Movement, the inherent moral spirit of our nation has shown enthusiastic and strong manifestations at any time and any place during the year and a half of the War of Resistance. Our country, up and down, has been encouraged by all kinds of facts, has adhered to the national self-confidence, and has embarked on the road of national construction and restoration. Both the spirit and the cause have shown that they are progressing step by step. In particular, we feel that in the War of Resistance, due to the changes in the national life and the contact with the wartime environment, the various lifestyle changes that the New Life Movement wants to achieve, such as speed, certainty, simplicity, and neatness, can mostly be achieved smoothly without prompting.

The general public has been tempered from reality and learned from action, and has realized the true meaning and value of the New Life Movement. Therefore, we can promote the New Life Movement in the future with half the effort. We can use the power of propaganda from the past in words and texts to promote practical actions. In a nutshell, we should base ourselves on the existing achievements, expand the scope of efforts, follow the trend of the natural evolution of the national spirit, and lay the foundation for the bright, progressive, and modern life of our nation in this extraordinary period of the War of Resistance and National Construction. In the past year, the work launched by the New Life Movement Headquarters, such as organizing battlefield service groups, consoling wounded soldiers and front-line soldiers, improving the lives of strong young men, advocating thrifty movements, and launching student summer rural service, have all been suitable for the needs of the War of Resistance, and have also been warmly supported by the compatriots. The women compatriots, under the organization of the New Life Movement, enthusiastically participated in work related to the War of Resistance, which is a further sign of the mobilization of the whole people. These achievements are not easy to obtain in peacetime, but if the preliminary foundation was not established before the war, there would not have been such gains. (To be continued)

### The Shooting of Japanese People; Not Related to Politics; The Shooter Seems to Be Korean; The Motive Is Likely Jealousy

(This newspaper's special news this morning) Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from a certain Western newspaper asked a senior officer of the Public Concession Police Department about the shooting of three Japanese people in front of the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road on Sunday, which injured a Japanese woman, what was the motive of the case? According to the officer, the case does not have any political nature. According to other sources, the shooter seems to be a Korean. Even the driver of the car that the Japanese people were riding in at the time said in his testimony to the police that he thought the shooter was a Japanese or a Korean. According to very reliable speculation, the injured person is a dancer who speaks English very fluently. Judging from the circumstances, the shooting must have been out of jealousy of a former lover of the dancer. It is also remembered that at a meeting of the Japanese newspaper industry in the city on Sunday evening, when a reporter mentioned the woman's profession, the chairman of the meeting immediately said, "We don't need to listen to this anymore. According to the investigation by the Japanese military police, someone is trying to distort the facts, so there is no need to finish the question." From this point of view, the truth of the case can also be understood.

### The Japanese Side Employs Coercive Tactics Again, Planning to Exert Pressure on the Concessions, Even Claiming They Will Disregard Treaties, the Concession Authorities Must Devise Appropriate Measures

Tokyo, 21st, Reuter - According to today's Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese military conference held in Shanghai has decided to use force when necessary to eliminate anti-Japanese terrorists in the Public Concession. Tokyo, 21st, Reuter - Minseito party member Oyama, during a meeting of the House of Representatives today, raised an urgent question regarding the situation in Shanghai, and expressed condolences for the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Reformed Government" Foreign Minister, in the Japanese-occupied area on the evening of February 19. Oyama's questions included the following:

(1) Does the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council lack the ability to maintain order, or does it have the ability but lack the sincerity to do so? (2) Is there any indication that the assassins from the Chinese government are colluding with the Municipal Council authorities? (3) If treaties and laws cause hesitation, can the right of self-defense override all treaties, and does the Japanese side intend to exercise this right of self-defense? (4) Does the Japanese side intend to expand the cleansing operations to the Public Concession and the French Concession? In his reply, Prime Minister Hiranuma stated that the Shanghai Public Concession, which has always been considered a safe area by the general public,

has repeatedly experienced terrorist demonstrations, which has begun to give the impression that the Concession is merely a base for the terrorist activities of lawless elements. If this is the case, the issue of taking measures to safeguard peace and order in China must be fundamentally reconsidered. We cannot ignore the secret activities of the Chinese government and the Communist Party in the Concession. The government has instructed the local authorities to take appropriate and effective measures. In summary, nothing can prevent the exercise of the right of self-defense. Foreign Minister Arita then declared that the government is

closely monitoring the development of the situation within the Shanghai Public Concession. Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, had already requested the Public and French Concession authorities on February 10 to severely deal with illegal and radical elements. If the situation does not improve, fundamental measures must be taken to safeguard law and order. Naval Minister Yonai stated that regarding the future maintenance of peace in the Shanghai Public Concession, it is necessary to implement a thorough reform. He is very willing to take

the most effective measures. Yonai expressed his personal opinion that the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council lacks sincerity. If this continues, he believes it is necessary to take effective self-defense measures. According to Japanese sources, both the Minseito and Seiyukai parties are extremely concerned about the continuous emergence of terrorist incidents in Shanghai. It is said that the Diet supports the use of force to suppress terrorists in the Public Concession. Japanese newspapers have expressed great indignation towards the situation in Shanghai. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun strongly urges the "Reformed Government" and the Japanese government to

exercise the right of self-defense to crack down on illegal elements in the two Shanghai Concessions, saying that these elements are engaging in terrorist demonstrations exclusively against Japanese and pro-Japanese Chinese, without being punished. The newspaper also lamented the death of Chen Lu at this time, and expressed the Japanese people's anger at the Public Concession authorities' inability to control illegal elements. It also stated that when the two Concession authorities receive Japanese protests, they invariably respond with prepared answers, but fail to implement effective methods to curb terrorist activities. Although the two Concession authorities have made every effort to protect the people of the Third Party, they pay little attention to

the dangers faced by the Chinese and Japanese. The same situation exists in the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. The factions of the Chinese government and the Communist Party are now engaged in activities against Japan and the new Chinese regime, without being punished. Their bases are located in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, and the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. The new Chinese regime and the Japanese government should exercise their right of self-defense because the Public Concession and the French Concession authorities cannot protect the lives of the Chinese and Japanese, and have lost their defensive capabilities. The Asahi Shimbun also

expressed a similar view, stating that more than twenty terrorist cases have occurred in the two Shanghai Concessions, and not a single perpetrator has been brought to justice, which is extremely regrettable. The two Concession authorities lack the ability to restrain illegal elements or prevent their secret activities, and their actions of colluding with these people in an attempt to aid the Chinese government have now been criticized. According to the Japanese side, their protest letter to Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, had long anticipated the occurrence of the current terrorist cases. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Shanghai Japanese authorities have decided to take steps to deal with this shocking situation. The Japanese government should take stringent measures to eliminate anti-Japanese terrorists in the two Shanghai Concessions.

### Investigation into Salary Increases Report Accepted by Municipal Council, To Be Implemented from March 1st, Salaries of Heads of Departments Reduced Accordingly

The Continental Daily reports that the Municipal Council held a special meeting yesterday (20th) at noon to discuss the report made by the special committee of business representatives investigating salary increases within the bureau. It was subsequently resolved to accept the report, and it was announced that the points listed in the report would be implemented from March 1st. Regarding this, the Municipal Council's announcement stated that the bureau intended to

implement the committee's report as soon as possible, and that the relevant heads and deputy heads readily agreed without waiting for notification. Therefore, the changes recommended by the special committee will be implemented from March 1st. The salary increases given to the heads of departments by the Municipal Council this year will be gradually reduced, with the exception of Philip, the Chief Secretary, whose salary of 2,500 yuan remains unchanged, as Mr. Philip

also holds the position of Commissioner-General. As for the salaries of other department heads, they will all be gradually reduced, with a minimum reduction of 900 yuan and a maximum of 1,300 yuan. For example, a certain department head who received a basic salary of 2,250 yuan in December last year and 4,392 yuan in January will receive 3,057 yuan according to the new plan set by the special committee. The special committee's recommendations regarding the salary increases for

foreign and Chinese staff employed by the Municipal Council in Shanghai with employment contracts have not been changed. At the same time, the committee's recommendation regarding the bureau's regulation that retirement pensions are only calculated based on basic salary has also not been changed. According to the Municipal Council's salary increase plan, the estimated annual

increase in expenditure would be 700,720 yuan, while according to the committee's recommendations, the annual increase in expenditure would be 720,600 yuan, which is nearly 20,000 yuan more than the bureau's plan, because the basic salaries of other foreign employees will be increased by 15% according to the committee's recommendations.

### Gunfight Occurs at Haimen in Eastern Zhejiang, Chinese Troops Valiantly Retaliate, Haimen Suffers No Losses, Population Evacuated, Jiaojiang Completely Blockaded, Shanghai-Taizhou Navigation Severed

Since Japanese warships concentrated in the Hezhou Bay, attempting to land, they have been shelling Haimen since February 18th. The Chinese troops retaliated. Haimen has suffered no losses. Order is very good. The evacuation of the population has been completed, and important defense works have been built. Shanghai-Taizhou shipping has been forced to stop, while Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes are operating as usual. Details are as follows:

The Course of the Battle of Taizhou Bay

In the Taizhou Bay area of eastern Zhejiang, after Japanese warships concentrated in an attempt to land, on February 18th, two Japanese warships approached the blockade line and dispatched four small boats carrying more than a hundred naval personnel, attempting to land at the Haimen pier. At that time, the Japanese warships first shelled Haimen, and our local garrison immediately retaliated, and waited for the Japanese small boats to approach the pier before opening fire to stop them. The Japanese navy, seeing that the shore was heavily guarded, immediately fled back to the Japanese warships. The gunfight lasted for about two hours before stopping. There was no gunfight all day on the 19th. From 6:00 AM on the 20th, two Japanese warships outside the blockade line suddenly opened fire, and the gunfight between the two sides stopped at 9:00 AM. On the morning of the 21st, Japanese bombers flew to Taizhou, but did not drop bombs. The Japanese warships did not move.

The Jiaojiang Blockade is Completely Deployed

A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese warships

in Taizhou Bay (i.e., Jiaojiang) shelled Haimen, with the shells landing in the "North Bank" villages of Haimen. We suffered no losses, only destroying a few civilian houses, and there were no deaths or injuries. As for the population in Haimen city, the authorities have completed the evacuation, so order is very good. However, heavy troops are stationed on both sides of Haimen and Jiaojiang, and the defense works have been completed and are very solid. The blockade line has been completely blockaded, prohibiting all ships from entering or leaving. The buoys of the anchored ships outside the blockade line have been automatically destroyed. Defensive items such as mines have been placed within the blockade line. If the Japanese army attempts to land, the local garrison is determined to strike hard.

Six Japanese Warships off the Coast of Zhejiang

Due to the war in the Taizhou area and the blockade of Jiaojiang, the Shanghai-Taizhou route has been completely cut off since February 18th. The last ship to leave Haimen was the Shantai of the Portuguese company, Zhengde. The British company Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng arrived in Shanghai from Haifang, passing through the waters outside the mouth of Taizhou Bay, and saw six Japanese warships. However, the weather in the area was extremely bad, and the Japanese army's attempt to land would inevitably be greatly affected. In addition, the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes are still open. The Portuguese company, Merrill's Meda, sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Portuguese company, Zhengde's Shantai, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow. The Italian company, Yihua Shipping's Baoli, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. The American company, Huamei's Tanglu, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 26th.

Japanese Warships Once Shelled Dinghai

Dinghai (i.e., Zhoushan) was once landed on by Japanese warships in the past. After the gunfight in Haimen, the situation in Dinghai has become tense again, prohibiting all ships from docking at Dinghai. Local militias and police are stationed, and martial law is declared. At 11:00 AM on February 18th, three Japanese warships sailed to Dinghai and fired more than a dozen shells towards the head of Zhushan Gate before fleeing. However, the local police and militia did not retaliate. The shells all landed in the wilderness, so there were no losses. Although the situation on the island is tense now, the local area is as peaceful as usual.

### Japanese Consul General Protests to Municipal Council Regarding Terrorist Incidents, In Addition to Verbal Statements, He Will Also Submit Written Material, Municipal Council Maintains Security Based on Its Previous Position

Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, previously blamed the Concession authorities for failing to take strict precautions against the repeated occurrence of "terrorist incidents," and once visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, to make verbal representations. The Concession authorities then clarified their position, pointing out that the occurrence of "terrorist incidents" mostly occurred outside the Concession's jurisdiction, and that the Japanese side's failure to completely return police powers to the Concession was the main reason. Therefore, it was believed that the representations made by the Japanese side were not entirely consistent with the facts. However, recently, during the Lunar New Year period, cases of traitors being killed have continued to occur, and the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet "Reformed Government," and the wounding of two Japanese people in front of Guanshengyuan, have made the Japanese and puppet sides even more uneasy. Therefore, Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, for the second time on the afternoon of the previous day (20th) to make another verbal warning. The Japanese Consul General believes that the continuous occurrence of these "terrorist incidents" is the complete responsibility of the Concession authorities for failing to take serious measures. It was decided that the above demands would be submitted in writing. He then took his leave. It is now heard that the Municipal Council has decided to maintain its previous position and implement the spirit of cooperation among police personnel to deal with everything. The so-called written notice from Japan has not yet been delivered as of last night.

The Continental Daily reports that Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday (20th) afternoon and made a verbal protest regarding the "recent continuous occurrence of violence." According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, speaking to reporters last night, Miura told Fessenden that the Japanese authorities were seriously observing the recent continuous occurrence of violence in the Public Concession, and that the Municipal Council must bear full responsibility for these acts of violence. The spokesman's official statement ended by saying that Miura reserved the right to make a written detailed report on these unexpected events. In response to questions, the spokesman said that in his position, he could not say whether the Japanese authorities would deploy armed patrols on Nanjing Road. Regarding the rumor from a Shanghai correspondent of a certain Tokyo newspaper that the Japanese authorities are currently considering taking direct action in the Public Concession and searching suspicious locations, in his position, he could not say whether it was true. A reporter asked whether the Police Department had asked the Japanese authorities to notify the Police Department if any Japanese groups wanted to enter the Public Concession, especially during

Chinese holidays and festivals. The spokesman replied, "We have not received this information, so we do not know about it." A reporter asked whether Chen Lu, a puppet official of the Nanjing puppet regime, notified the Public Concession Police Department when he arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, the day before he was fatally wounded in an assassination attempt at his residence on YuYuan Road. The spokesman was also unable to answer. According to inquiries last night,

Chen did not notify the Police Department when he came to Shanghai, and it is believed that Mr. Chen was unaware that the Police Department had made this request. It was also confirmed last night by a senior official of the Police Department that the Public Concession authorities had asked the Japanese authorities to notify the Police Department when Japanese groups wanted to enter the south bank of Suzhou Creek. The Public Concession authorities had made this request to the Japanese authorities repeatedly, but the Japanese side did not respond. According to a Domei News Agency report, yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Continental News Extra edition stated that

the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai were quite indignant about the sniper attack on four Japanese people on Nanjing Road and the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet Nanjing government. They are currently demanding that the Japanese military authorities take action by force in the Public Concession. The Japanese expatriates also plan to hold a mass meeting to urge the Japanese authorities to take drastic action to deal with the terrorist incidents. The Japanese expatriates are even more indignant because "innocent and defenseless women," namely two Japanese female dancers, were also subjected to the terror of the sniper attacks.

### Refugees Request to Return Home for Spring Planting, Shanghai International Relief Committee Dispatches Father Ba, etc., to Plan

The Shanghai International Relief Committee has achieved considerable success in its relief work for refugees since its establishment after the "August 13th" incident. It has been found that the three shelters, namely the First Shelter on Masnan Road, the Second Shelter on West Ames Road, and the Sixth Shelter on North Henan Road, house a total of nearly ten thousand refugees. Pan Da, Feng Shiguang, and Guan Ganzhong are responsible for managing the shelters, supervising the entire staff of the three shelters, and constantly working hard without sparing any effort. Therefore, the education and production work of the refugees in these three shelters are outstanding, and they serve as models for refugee shelters in Shanghai. It is learned that the International Relief Committee, in order to further promote refugee production, is not only establishing various production works in the shelters, but also paying close attention to refugees returning to their hometowns for spring planting. Moreover, many refugees in the refugee shelters under the committee have recently requested assistance to return to their hometowns for spring planting. Therefore, the 35th Standing Committee meeting of the committee decided to dispatch Maris, Li Guiyong, and Father Ba to form a committee (and authorize the addition of members) to formulate measures and estimate the food and travel expenses for refugees on the way, in order to provide assistance for them to return home.

### Li Guojie Assassinated Yesterday, Li Walking with Friend on Xin Zha Road, Suddenly Shot Dead by a Strong Man with Four Shots

Li Guojie, Zi Weihou, from Hefei, Anhui Province, was the eldest grandson of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang. He was 60 years old and lived at No. 1030 Qinyuan Village, Xin Zha Road, Public Concession. In 1931, Li served as the manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but Li was by nature muddleheaded and fond of corruption. During his tenure, not only did he fail to achieve anything, but he dared to collude with his associates to steal and sell state assets, mortgaging the four wharves with a value of as much as 30 million yuan, thereby losing national sovereignty. His crimes were heinous. After the case was exposed by the National Government to the ministry, Li was transferred to the court. After repeated trials, it was determined that Li's scandalous record was obvious and he could not escape.

He was brought to justice and sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for five years. At that time, all sectors of society paid close attention to this case and unanimously condemned him, and the newspapers also carried detailed reports, which readers, if not forgetful, should be able to recall one or two things. After Li was released from prison, he moved his residence from No. 1005 Xiafei Road to his current residence. However, his actions still did not show any self-reflection. He liked to associate with unscrupulous people. After the National Army withdrew to the west, the general villains ignored national interests and shamelessly served the outside. When the puppet "Reformed Government" puppets took the stage, it was rumored that Li was also among them,

itching to move and thinking of plotting for the position of puppet "Minister of Industry," but it ultimately failed. However, Li's close relationship with the puppet organization puppets has not been interrupted. At about 4:05 PM yesterday, it was learned that Li was walking out of his friend's place and walking along Xin Zha Road with his friend, talking and walking. When they reached the intersection of Gordon Road, a strong man suddenly jumped out from the roadside, drew a box gun, and fired four or five shots at Li in succession. Li Guojie was hit by four shots in the body, one in the left eyebrow, one in the waist, one in the abdomen, and one in the leg. He immediately

fell to the ground. Blood flowed like a river. The strong man, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left calmly and disappeared. By the time the police arrived after hearing the alarm, Li was already barely breathing and his life was hanging by a thread. So they summoned an ambulance and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but because the injuries were in vital parts, he died at 5 PM. The police are now investigating.

### The Japanese and Puppets Advocate Ceasefire, Establish "China Revival Society," and Issue Absurd Declaration

Since the Japanese invasion of China, its domestic finances have tended to collapse. The people and the army are extremely afraid of our long-term war of resistance, and war-weariness is growing daily. Therefore, the Japanese are in a hurry, and have colluded with Wang Jingwei to advocate peace negotiations, which have been unanimously condemned by the Chinese people and have failed. Later, they created an atmosphere, hoping that Wu Peifu would call for peace, but Wu firmly rejected them. Recently, the Japanese have instigated the puppets of the puppet "Reformed Government" to form the "China Revival Society" to engage in advocating a ceasefire and advocating pro-Japanese anti-communism. They issued a declaration on the 19th, the content of which was absurd and ridiculous, and all who saw it sneered.

### All Agencies Purchasing Foreign Goods Should Entrust to the Trust Bureau, Now in a Period of Controlled Foreign Exchange, Private Firms May Not Purchase on Behalf

The Ministry of Finance issued a public letter Yuku Zi No. 5614 on January 9, 1939, to various agencies, stating: "It is found that the Central Trust Bureau was established in accordance with the order of the National Government to engage in trust business. All government or public agencies purchasing goods and materials should entrust the bureau to handle them uniformly. In February of the 25th year, an order was issued by the Executive Yuan and then by the National Government for compliance. Now, in the period of long-term resistance against Japan and controlled foreign exchange, the purchase of various equipment from abroad should be entrusted to the bureau for overall planning and verification. In the future, if your department needs to order equipment and other items from abroad, please entrust the bureau to handle them in accordance with the case, and do not order from private firms, in order to comply with the law. In addition to sending letters separately, a corresponding letter is issued for reference and handling, and to transfer to subordinate agencies for compliance.

### Shanghai All Circles Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy, Leaders Express Gratification, and Hope to Contribute Funds and Devote Efforts to Greater Performance, Promote National Spirit and Assist

The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang yesterday notified all important public groups in Shanghai that it had recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, stating, "The Shanghai Municipal Party Department and all groups that were transferred have been informed. Sharing the same hatred of the enemy, it has become more solid after a long time, and is very gratifying. Now the victory of the war of resistance is more assured. Shanghai is the focus of Chinese and foreign attention. I deeply hope that you will contribute funds and devote efforts to greater performance, so as to promote our national spirit and contribute to the effort. This is our earnest hope." Following this, the corresponding telegram letter was delivered, and it is hoped that you will refer to it. In the future, we also hope to encourage each other to work hard to support the war against the enemy, and live up to the earnest expectations of the leaders, which is the most important thing.

### Ningbo Local Goods Allowed to Be Exported, Shipping Active, Yongsheng Loaded with a Large Batch of Cotton, Moufu and Others All Went to Load Goods

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route was approved for direct shipping, the connection between the city and the mainland has become much more convenient. The goods transported from Shanghai are unobstructed. However, the export of goods from Ningbo is still restricted. The industries have sent telegrams requesting that local goods be allowed to be exported to facilitate regulation. It is now heard that a military agency has approved five types of local goods, namely tea, cotton, cotton yarn, local paper, and fresh eggs, to be temporarily allowed to be exported. It is also learned that the Yongsheng has been loaded with a large batch of cotton from Ningbo and will arrive in Shanghai today. Moufu of Jardine Matheson was originally planned to return to Shanghai on the Lunar New Year and then stop for repairs. Seeing that Ningbo local goods are allowed to be exported, and cargo transportation will be prosperous, the repairs have been postponed for two weeks and went to Ningbo the day before yesterday. Taikoo's New Beijing and Sino-Italian Deping sailed to Ningbo empty the day before yesterday to load cargo to Shanghai.

### The Shanghai Commercial Association Accepts the Wuhai Bank Settlement Case, Appoints Executive Member Pei Lingqing, And Works with the Accountant

Shanghai Minhang Wuhai Commercial Bank, due to the impact of the war, could not adapt to the receipt and payment, in accordance with Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, prepared a balance sheet, a property catalog, a list of creditors and debtors, a settlement plan, etc., and applied to the Shanghai Commercial Association for settlement. The Shanghai Commercial Association accepted it according to law, and appointed Executive Committee Member Pei Yunqing to preside over the handling together with accountant Wang Haifan, and sent a letter to the First Special District Local Court for review.

### Surge in Japanese Banknote Issuance, Meager Currency Reserves, Inflation Crisis Imminent, Yen Value Poised for Dramatic Fall

According to a report in the *Continental Daily News*, citing a dispatch from the Domei News Agency, the Tokyo government has decided to increase the legal maximum limit for banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan from 5 billion yen to 2.7 billion yen. At the same time, the maximum limits for banknotes issued by banks in Japanese colonies will also be raised. The Bank of Chosen will expand from 60 million yen to 160 million yen, and the Bank of Taiwan will increase from 30 million yen to 80 million yen. Since the commencement of the

Sino-Japanese War,

the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan have been repeatedly increased through various means. The banknotes circulating in mainland Japan and its colonies have continuously increased, forcing the Tokyo government to repeatedly alter the laws and regulations governing the reserve requirements for banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan. In the last year before the war, i.e., 1936, the

Banknote Circulation

amounted to 1,865,760,000 yen. After two years of war, by the end of 1938, this amount had increased to 2,858,600,000 yen, an increase of several hundred million yen. During the same period, the banknotes issued by the Banks of Chosen and Taiwan also increased significantly. The total amount of banknotes issued in Japan and its colonies increased from 2,057,200,000 yen to 3,119,000,000 yen during the war, an increase of over 50 percent. This kind of

Japanese Banknote

circulation expansion is mainly due to the enormous expenditures incurred by the Tokyo government in its operations in China. To offset the ever-increasing amount of domestic war bonds, the Bank of Japan has had to increase its banknote issuance. However, the Japanese people have been unable to absorb these war bonds, which are still held by the Bank of Japan and the two aforementioned banks. According to the accounts published by the Bank of Japan, it can be seen that current

Government Deposits,

bank deposits, discounted securities, and advances on foreign bills of exchange all decreased in amount between 1937 and 1938. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan's holdings of government bonds increased from 829,073,000 yen to 1,841,407,000 yen, an increase of over 1 billion yen, or 125 percent. The increase in the Bank of Japan's holdings of government bonds is

perfectly consistent

with the increase in the banknotes issued by the bank.

The issuance of banknotes is sharply increased based on the new national debt issued in the form of public bonds and not digested, which is obviously called inflation. Not long ago, the use of the term "inflation" was forbidden in Japanese newspapers, but recently Japanese economic newspapers have been unable to deny the existence of inflation. "Oriental Economist," Japan's most reputable

economic publication,

stated in its February issue, "From this, it can be concluded that Japan is currently undergoing a period of evident inflation, so the government and the people must strive to curb the inflationary movement." Japanese newspapers are trying to refine the theories of the financial world, beginning to discuss two different types of inflation, as the Japanese call them:

Harmful Inflation

and Harmless Inflation. Of course, Japanese newspapers claim that what is happening in Japan today is harmless inflation and that this type of inflation does not have the disadvantages that are usually associated with harmful inflation. Of course, this is pure nonsense. Inflation is inflation and has nothing to do with logic. In short, the extreme meagerness of Japan's currency reserve stands in stark contrast to Japan's excessive military spending. Raising the

maximum limit

for banknote issuance is, in other words, reducing the gold reserve backing for banknote issuance. At the beginning of this war, Japan's gold reserve was 49 percent. Early last year, it was reduced to 40 percent, and at the end of last year, it was reduced to only 20 percent, before slightly increasing to 24 percent. This means that since the outbreak of hostilities, Japan's gold standard has been reduced by half. The inevitable result of all this is that the value of the yen will continue to fall sharply.

### Head of French Concession Police, Fabre, Returns to Post

The French-language newspaper reported on the 21st that Fabre, head of the French Concession Police, returned to Shanghai on February 18 aboard the French mail ship *President Doumer*, accompanied by a number of people, including Biffin, Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy.

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Returns to Shanghai

According to the *Continental Daily News*, British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who had been visiting North China and meeting with British officials and businessmen in Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao, returned to Shanghai aboard the British warship HMS *Bee* at 11:00 AM on Sunday (the 19th). The Royal Navy's 10,000-ton cruiser HMS *Dorsetshire* also arrived in Shanghai at the same time as HMS *Bee*, docking at the British naval pontoon, replacing the British warship HMS *Cardiff*, which had been stationed in Shanghai.

### Kuling Foreign Residents to Descend the Mountain Today; First Batch Totals 45, With 20 More to Remain Temporarily

According to the *Continental Daily News*, the local U.S. naval authorities received a final message from Kuling yesterday (the 20th) stating that 45 foreign residents of the mountain were scheduled to descend the mountain tomorrow (the 22nd), meaning that 20 foreign residents would remain in Kuling. As of yet, no information has been received regarding these 20 people. With the foreign residents scheduled to descend the mountain tomorrow, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday that the Japanese authorities have agreed to further extend the deadline again. If they

cannot descend the mountain

tomorrow, they will have to wait until February 25 to depart. Of the 45 foreign residents, nine are American. The exact number of people of other nationalities was not known as of yesterday. Of the 20 foreign residents remaining on the mountain, nine or ten are American. Commander Jaffe of the U.S. warship USS *Wake*, and Commander Stanford of the British warship HMS *Gnat*, who ascended the mountain three days ago,

returned to base

on Sunday afternoon. They are scheduled to re-ascend the mountain yesterday to make final preparations for the 45 foreign residents and assist in their descent. It is reported that they will travel to Shanghai aboard the *Wake* and the *Gnat*. Otherwise, the two gunboats will dock in Jiujiang, and after the foreign residents arrive, they will be transferred to a Japanese warship and transported to Shanghai. The summary closing period of 1938 saw Shanghai industries safely navigate the year-end due to the stable financial market and the distorted development of industry and commerce in the post-war concessions. Companies, firms, factories had started the year's business yesterday, while most had to wait until after today (the fourth day of the first lunar month) to resume operation. Members of the Money Trade Association and the Money Exchange Association, including money shops such as Hui Hua, Yuan Heng Li Zhen, and Fu Lu Shou Xi, have started reporting to the two associations, ready to start business tomorrow. Both associations have scheduled annual meetings to discuss new business policies after listing. It is reported that the Money Trade Association will meet on March 3, while the Money Exchange Association will wait for the decision of the executive committee. New account books used by all industries after the year-end closing have been decided to uniformly affix stamps at 40 cents per book in accordance with the government's promulgated stamp tax law for extraordinary times. If old account books continue to be used, stamps will also be affixed at 40 cents per book to maintain national tax revenue.

### Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to National Political Council, Vowing to Endeavor in National Resistance Based on President's Sincere Instructions

The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, in response to a telegram from the National Political Council expressing sympathy for the people in the occupied areas, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, on behalf of the citizens, sent a return telegram to the Council, expressing its determination to endeavor in national resistance based on President's sincere instructions. The text is as follows: To Speaker Jiang, Deputy Speaker Zhang, and all Councilors of the Chongqing National Political Council: As the second phase of the War of Resistance begins, at a time when our final victory is in sight, your Council is convening in the new capital to deliberate on national affairs. The news has spread, and all within the seas are rejoicing. We are especially moved by your telegram of sympathy. Although the people of Shanghai are in enemy territory, living in the tiger's den, the more dangerous the situation, the more courageous we become, and the more bitter the hardship, the more steadfast our resolve. When flags are raised, our hearts think of the Han; when flags are changed, righteousness does not submit to Qin. With the fellowship of those in the same boat, we contribute to alleviate the suffering of our local compatriots. With ardent patriotism, we donate funds to support the national treasury. Although the government cannot exercise its functions, the people obey national laws and accept the leadership of our Party, consistently from beginning to end. In the future, we vow to endeavor in the national resistance to the end, based on the President's sincere and pure instructions. Though Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin. The people of Shanghai wish to encourage themselves in this way. Respectfully replying by telegram, we await your instructions. Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, leading various public organizations and citizens of the city, respectfully bows and presses its seal.

### Italian Steamer Arrives in Shanghai This Morning, Carrying a Batch of Jewish Refugees: 841 Men, Women, and Children, Relief Society Prepared to Accommodate

According to the *Continental Daily News*, the Italian steamer *Conte Verde* is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 22nd), carrying 841 refugees, men, women, and children, from Germany. At that time, the number of German Jewish immigrants in Shanghai will reach 3,500. The Shanghai European Jewish Refugee Relief Committee is

quite apprehensive

about these 800 newcomers, unlike with previous groups of refugees arriving in Shanghai, because the 532 men, 268 women, and 41 children can be housed in the single men's residence on Ward Road, the family residence on Huishan Road, or temporarily in the Riverside Mansion. Of the current group of refugees, 15 have already landed in Manila on February 15, according to the conditions of the Philippine government for admitting refugees, namely that the refugees can provide

adequate guarantees

that they will not burden the host country. The single men's residence on Ward Road can accommodate 1,000 single men, but currently only 200 are housed there, so there is ample room to accommodate the new single men. The committee has also acquired

a building

on Washington Avenue at its disposal, but has not yet decided how to use it. Judging from the current situation, the building will be converted into a hospital, run and managed exclusively by immigrants, to treat Jewish refugees and those who wish to seek medical treatment there.

### American Citizens in Hainan Island Safe; There are Ten American Citizens on the Entire Island

According to the *Continental Daily News*, the American destroyer USS *Edwards* was recently ordered to Haikou to investigate the ten American citizens currently residing on Hainan Island. Yesterday (the 17th), the ship sent a message to Hong Kong, which was relayed to Shanghai, stating that all American citizens residing on Hainan Island were safe and remained in their residences. Seven of them reside in Haikou, while the other three reside in other parts of the island. Nine of them are missionaries, and the remaining one is a customs official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. It is reported that the *Edwards* sailed from Hong Kong to the island to dock, so that it could evacuate the American citizens if necessary. According to a message sent by the ship's officers, they found the situation in Haikou to be peaceful and the American citizens to be in no danger. The American citizens residing elsewhere on the island were also safe. The property of the American citizens was also undamaged during the Japanese occupation. As there was no apparent need for the American citizens to evacuate, the

destroyer decided to return to Hong Kong to prepare for service along the Chinese coast.

### All Sectors Eagerly Provide Disaster Relief; Famous Performers Broadcast and Sing to Raise Funds; Donations from All Sectors Reach Over 10,000 Yuan

The Philatelist Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Fundraising Committee, considering that people from all walks of life were spending the Lunar New Year, while tens of thousands of refugees were without food or clothing, shivering in the cold and crying from hunger, launched a fundraising effort for relief. Initiated by Yu Qiaqing, Jin Tingsun, and Yuan Ludeng, over 600 famous amateur and professional performers from all over Shanghai were invited to perform in a grand Peking opera broadcast at the Continental Radio Station of the Franco-Chinese Pharmacy on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year. All the amateur and professional performers enthusiastically participated, pleading for the lives of refugees throughout the city. Before the broadcast, Yu, Jin, and Yuan delivered speeches, followed by various exciting programs until 4:00 AM. Patrons from all walks of life were extremely enthusiastic in requesting songs, with the total proceeds for the two days reaching over 12,000 yuan. The fundraising committee is currently collecting the funds and preparing a report to submit to the association for use as relief funds.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee's Citizen One-Day Disaster Relief Movement Propaganda Conference opened at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Great Asia Radio Station. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the association, Yuan Ludeng, representative of the Refugee Association, and Zhou Bangjun, Xi Yushu, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Deqin, Tao Leqin, Gu Yucang, Liu Shenying, Ge Futian, Zhu Qizhen, Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Zhuang Ping, and others were present. Lin Kanghou delivered the opening speech, followed by Yuan Ludeng, Chen Jicheng, Tao Leqin, Xi Yushu, and Zhang Deqin. The conference continues today at the Sino-Western Radio Station on Sima Road, mobilizing the entire city's entertainment and broadcasting circles to urge all sectors of the city to participate in one-day disaster relief, practice New Year's frugality, and continue to sponsor refugees. It is scheduled to close at midnight tomorrow at the Continental Radio Station.

### Sijiao Sand Transport Resumes Original State; Over 20 Boats Carrying Over 600 Tons Arrive; Court Opens Second Hearing, Scheduled for Verdict

After the Wantai Sand and Gravel Company monopolized sand transport for several days, in addition to the Sand and Gravel Association appealing for assistance from all sectors, over ten thousand sand transport workers also went on strike. Sijiao sand transport workers voluntarily petitioned Wang Pinrong, captain of the Sijiao guerrilla team, who approved the restoration of the original state. Yesterday, over 20 boats carrying about 600 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao, including those of Zhou Yeyong, Chuan Chunsheng, Wang Lingao, and Yu Dongming, unloaded their cargo at the New Garbage Bridge. As for the lawsuit filed by Jinximin Lawyer employed by Wantai against Fang Jinxiang and others for obstructing business, the Shanghai First Special District District Court held a hearing. A second hearing was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. Jinximin Lawyer appeared in court to defend Wantai. Defendants Fang Jinxiang, Liu Yongqing, and Xu Fuqing all appeared in person and hired Feng Meixue Lawyer to defend them. The result was a scheduled verdict on the 25th of this month.

### Nanshi Lumber Industry Almost Completely Lost; Estimated Loss of Over 17 Million; Mostly Seized and Sold at Low Prices

The lumber businesses and plank shops opened by Chinese merchants, numbering over 20 in the Bund wharves and Gaoshanmiao area of Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi, with the largest scale being the Jufeng Lumber Business (opened at the New Wharf) established by Ma Jiliang, and the Xiangtai, Santai, Shuntai, Kaitai, Zhen Changtai, Jiu Ji Nan Zhan (on Jichang Street), Changtai, Zhengyu, Yongtai, and the Lin Ji Lumber Business (established on the Bansongyuan Bund) founded by Zhang Xiaolin. After the retreat of the National Army to the west, all the businesses fell into the war zone, and the Bund area was a Japanese defense zone, and citizens could not pass through. Except for the Huyu Chang Lumber Business, which managed to move out some of its goods early, the remaining 20 businesses, all the houses, properties, sawmill machines, various lumber, and expensive coffins, totaling an estimated value of over 17.7 million yuan, have now been seized by the Japanese and completely lost. To sell off the lumber, the Japanese instructed rogues to collude with the puppet organization to establish the "Nanshi Revival Lumber Stacking and Firewood Shed," and converted the former Penglai Road Experimental Elementary School into an office, soliciting business everywhere in order to turn the stolen goods into money, and forced carpenters to make various wooden items at low wages, which were transported by the puppet transport company to the concessions for sale. It is learned that recently, puppet police on Zhonghua Road on the inside roads of Nanshi have been using free cars to oppress residents, dragging dilapidated cars back and forth in a busy manner, with more than ten vehicles transporting various lumber. As for expensive coffins, which usually cost over 2,000 yuan, such as nanmu and sand-panel coffins, are now sold for only 100 yuan each. If they have a relationship with the puppet organization, they can be discounted by half.

### Trademark Exclusive Scope; Judicial Yuan Order Interpretation; Limited to Designation

The Executive Yuan previously had doubts about the scope of trademark exclusivity and consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed the Trademark Bureau to investigate and follow up. The original text is recorded below.

Executive Yuan Consultation

If a registered trademark is designated for use on a certain category of goods, even if the names of each goods are not listed, it should also be recognized that its trademark exclusivity extends to the entire category. The Executive Yuan's interpretation No. 1676 has already been filed. However, if only one type of goods in a certain category is designated at the time of registration, there is still doubt whether its exclusive right can extend to all goods in the entire category. Correspondingly, please investigate and reply for reference. To demonstrate public friendship, this consults the Judicial Yuan.

Ministry of Economic Affairs Order

Approved the Executive Yuan's order No. 9340 on November 14, 1938, stating: "This Yuan previously had doubts about the issue of trademark exclusivity and consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation.

Correspondingly, reply for reference, etc.'." Approved this, a copy of the original consultation will be sent to the department. Please be informed, this order. Correspondingly, a copy of the original consultation of the Executive Yuan will be sent. Please be informed, this order.

### Flower Gambling Factory Receives Gift; A Bomb as a Gift; Warning from the Iron-Blooded Army

The gambling atmosphere is rampant in the Robert Road area of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road, causing considerable harm. The most prominent of these is the Yiji Flower Gambling Factory at No. 20, Gongyi Lane. The den opens three times a day, extorting the people's fat and scraping the meager weight. In particular, ignorant women are most deeply victimized, and even those who lose their families are not uncommon. The factory is opened by the well-known gangsters Li Xiaobao and Mao Axiang. Because of their great evil power, the business is also considerable. The matter was known to the Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Elimination Traitors Iron-Blooded Army, which hated its harm to people's livelihood, and then wanted to punish it. Then, on the 13th of this month, an uninvited guest was sent to warn. At that time, the person held a paper package, first greeted the guard at the entrance of the den, and said, "Here is a humble gift, please forward it to your master." After speaking, he handed the paper package to the guard, turned around and said goodbye. After they accepted it, they felt that the object was very heavy, knowing that things were not good, and then gathered many classmates and then chased out, intending to negotiate with the gift-giver, but they did not say that when they reached the entrance, they were pointed at by other strong men with guns. He had to send the original object back to Li and Mao's room. After dismantling and inspecting it, there was a bomb inside, and an enclosed warning letter from the "Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Elimination Traitors Iron-Blooded Army". At that time, Li and others were afraid that the matter would be leaked, which would be related to business, so they secretly ordered the hired personnel to strictly prohibit disclosure, but the facts were obvious, so it was finally revealed to the outside world after four or five days.

### American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai for Disaster Relief; American People Also Donate Food

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the democratic countries of England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have provided much assistance to China in terms of financial and material resources. They are particularly sympathetic to the suffering of Chinese refugees due to the ravages of the Japanese invading army, which is unprecedented in history. Recently, American wheat donated by the United States to Chinese refugees has been shipped to Shanghai by the "Hookla" wheel, along with a large number of food and medicine. The details are recorded below.

Large Quantities of Food and Medicine

The cracked wheat was handed over by the United States Department of Agriculture to the American Red Cross, following the instructions of US President Roosevelt, to donate a portion of the surplus wheat to Chinese and Spanish war refugees. Other food items, such as milk, baby food, canned food, and medical supplies, were donated by American commercial organizations, expressing sympathy for the suffering civilians of the Sino-Japanese War. The Shanghai Advisory Committee of the American China War Relief Association is entrusted to allocate them according to urgency.

### Salvation Army Disaster Relief Fundraising; Exceeded 38,000 Yuan; The Yarnall Couple Also Contributed

The Salvation Army's 40,000 yuan fundraising movement is about to be successfully completed. The total amount received to date has exceeded the record of 38,000 yuan. Shi Zhaoji, Shi Zhaozeng, and other Chinese and foreign people have donated generously. The largest amount donated this time was 293 yuan. The army staff believes that the people of the city will donate the remaining 2,000 yuan and expedite the completion of this movement. The date is not far away. The donation collection point is still at No. 57 Nanjing Road. Also, all the funds donated this time will be used in Shanghai to relieve Chinese criminals in prison and establish vocational schools for street children and foreign refugee homes, and other charitable purposes. The commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, Yarnall and his wife, also donated a large sum of money, and three enthusiastic Chinese, including Mr. Chen, each donated 200 yuan. In addition to holding various charitable activities for the people of the city, the army also runs a refugee home that can accommodate 40,300 people.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Employs National Goods Expert Committee Members: 21 Members Including Wang Xiaolai from This City

In order to handle matters related to the examination and certification of national goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs established a National Goods Examination Committee. Within this committee, it also established a specialized committee comprising 30 to 50 members, to be recommended by domestic industrial and commercial organizations and appointed by the Minister. According to the original plan, 11 specialized committee members were to be appointed from Shanghai. The Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, inviting it to convene national goods organizations and related industries in this city to recommend three times the number of nominees, totaling 33, for the Ministry of Economic Affairs to select and appoint. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs considers Shanghai an important area for national goods manufacturing, and the original quota of 11 members was insufficient. The quota has been expanded to 21 members.

### The Truth of the Yuchunchi Shooting Incident: Han Zhengyi Avenges His Cousin, Han's Gunshot Wound Not Yet Healed, Retrial Postponed

Han Zhengyi (also known as Lu Youlin) from Zhenjiang, his cousin was recently reported to the Japanese Headquarters by a Zhou, accusing him of being a guerrilla. The Japanese arrested and shot him. Upon hearing this news, Han vowed to avenge his cousin. He secretly tracked Zhou's whereabouts. On the 3rd of this month, Han learned that Zhou was bathing at the Yuchunchi Bathhouse at No. 184 Hubei Road. He went there at 2:50 PM with a handgun, intending to assassinate Zhou. However, for some reason, he mistakenly identified the bather Pan Shirong as Zhou and fired a shot at him. The bullet missed Pan but injured the arm of Nie Rongxiang, a back scrubber standing nearby. Han immediately tried to escape with his gun. At that moment, Guo Shouxin, a Chinese detective from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, was also taking a bath. Seeing the situation, he immediately drew his gun and fired two shots at Han, both hitting him. Han was injured and fell to the ground. The detective seized his handgun and five bullets and sent both Han and Nie Rongxiang to the hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the police charged him with attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide opened the trial. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the circumstances and said that according to the doctor's report, Han's injuries prevented him from leaving the hospital, so he requested that the hearing be postponed until Han had recovered. The court verified and ordered the retrial to be postponed.

### Puppets Fear Death, Demand Protection

The puppet "Reformed Government" sees its large and small puppet officials repeatedly targeted and killed, while Liang Hongzhi and his ilk, though protected by escorts, are timid as mice and fear that even with precautions, they could be assassinated. They have become increasingly fearful. Smaller puppet officials have also come forward to demand guarantees of their safety. Liang and others, finding themselves in a precarious situation, besieged both internally and externally, are at their wits' end. After a secret meeting, they agreed that while they could not guarantee the safety of puppet officials serving in the "institutions," they could provide compensation for their deaths. That is, they cannot be responsible for the safety of any puppet official, but should they be assassinated, a sum of "compensation" and living expenses for their families would be provided to express their condolences. At the end of the lunar year, they enacted a "Compensation Ordinance," stipulating that 100,000 yuan would be paid for the killing of a puppet "Special Appointee," 50,000 yuan for a "Senior Appointee," 30,000 yuan for a "Recommended Appointee," and 10,000 yuan for a "Commissioned Appointee" (with smaller sums for lower-ranking puppet officials, omitted for brevity). If there are children, the puppet "salary" will continue to be paid until they reach adulthood and are able to find employment. The puppet "Ordinance" has been sent to the Shanghai puppet "Municipal Government."

### Puppet Organization's "Minister of Foreign Affairs," Chen Lu Assassinated, Incident Occurred in the Chinese Area of the Western District, Public Concession Police Have Discovered Clues

Reuters Chongqing, 20th - The Central Daily News editorial states that the assassination of Chen Lu is a Lunar New Year gift from the Chinese people of Shanghai to the soldiers on the front lines. Before Chen Lu, many other traitors have met the same fate. After Chen Lu, we should keep a close watch.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year (i.e., the 19th), many businesses in this city were closed, and the streets had a different atmosphere. Unexpectedly, a shocking assassination occurred on this day. The victim was Chen Lu (alias Renxian), the puppet "Reformed Government's Minister of Foreign Affairs," who had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing last month. The details are recorded below:

Arriving in Shanghai to Spend the New Year

Chen Lu's Shanghai residence was located at No. 25, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, in the western part of the city, in the area of extra-settlement roads, under the jurisdiction of Zhenning Road in the Chinese area. Chen arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 18th of the lunar calendar and immediately returned to his residence. Chen's comings and goings were usually heavily guarded. In addition to the many bodyguards hired at his Shanghai residence, he also carried guards to prevent accidents. Chen's trip to Shanghai was solely for the purpose of spending the New Year.

Gunfire and Assassination

At about 7 PM on the evening of the 19th, suddenly more than a dozen young men in long gowns, all armed with handguns and Mauser pistols, entered directly through the back door of Chen's residence. Two of them monitored Chen's hired bodyguards. Seeing the large number of attackers and the suddenness of the event, the bodyguards were unable to resist after being restrained. At that time, six or seven of the young men went straight into the living room of Chen's residence. Chen was sitting in the living room with his friend Luo and his family, chatting casually. They were surprised and about to ask who these unknown people were when the attackers fired two shots at Chen's head. One bullet exited from the neck, and the other severed the throat, passing through the throat. Then they fired five or six more shots in succession, and bullets pierced his right thigh. After being shot, Chen immediately fell to the ground bleeding, barely alive.

Not Punishing Wife and Children

At this time, Chen's friend and his wife and daughters were terrified by the scene. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the shooters immediately distributed a leaflet signed "China Youth Iron and Blood Army," which read "Resistance will win, nation-building will succeed, jointly eliminate traitors, and forever protect China." They also claimed that they were eliminating harm for the country and that their wives and children would not be punished. Then they left in different directions. It is reported that when these dozen or so people came and went to Chen's residence, because the area was an extra-settlement road area, their footprints did not touch a step of the Public Concession. After the incident, all parties tried their best to search, but to no avail.

Moving the Corpse for Burial

After Chen was shot, he was immediately taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. However, because the bullets hit vital points, he was barely alive on the way. After arriving at the hospital, he died. At 5:30 PM on the evening of the 20th, his family moved Chen's body to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Taras Road for burial.

Chen's Son Takes Precautions

According to reliable sources, when Chen was shot downstairs, his son Youtao (the current "Director-General of the General Affairs Department" of the puppet "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed" puppet organization) was sleeping upstairs. Suddenly hearing a burst of gunfire, he initially suspected it was the sound of New Year's firecrackers. Hearing the noisy noises downstairs, he knew that something had happened. He quickly got up and ran to the staircase, closing the iron gate installed there to prevent anyone from rushing upstairs. Only after the dozen or so young people had completed their mission and helped one of the bodyguards away did Chen's son Youtao come downstairs in a panic. By that time, his father had been shot several times and was dying in a pool of blood.

Chen Lu's Background

Chen, alias Renxian, was 62 years old and a native of Minhou, Fujian. He was a Jinshi in the late Qing Dynasty. Recommended by Zhang Zhidong, he studied at the University of Paris in France. He later served as an editor in the Hanlin Academy of the Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, he served as Director of Political Affairs and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Beijing government. He later went abroad and served as the Minister to Mexico and France. Since the establishment of the National Government, Chen had been living in retirement at home. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chen had frequent contact with various officials of the "Reformed" puppet organization. He then lost his integrity in his old age and became the puppet "Minister of Foreign Affairs." His assassination has attracted considerable attention from all parties.

Discovery of Clues

The English-language North China Daily Mail said that after Chen Lu, the puppet "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed Government," was killed on Sunday (the 19th) evening, the Public Concession Police Department had seized nine handguns. One of them has been identified as the gun used to kill a Qian. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station discovered three handguns on the night of the shooting incident, believed to belong to the bodyguards. Yesterday (the 20th) morning, the detectives went to the vicinity of Chen's residence and conducted a large-scale search in the gardens of various private houses along Yuyuan Road, discovering no less than six more handguns.

Tokyo Reaction

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd - After the news of the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed Government," reached here, political figures and public opinion here have attached great importance to it and expressed great shock and anger. The "Asahi Shimbun" demanded that the Japanese government ask the Shanghai Municipal Council when it intends to take drastic action to eliminate certain elements in Shanghai. The newspaper believes that the frequent occurrence of such assassinations will greatly affect the relationship between Japan and other powers, especially Britain. The newspaper advocated that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai should "eliminate the anti-Japanese masses in Shanghai."

### Puppet Town Chiefs of Western Shanghai Don Stage Makeup

In the towns of Xinxijing, Huacao, Hongqiao, Caohejing, etc. in northwestern Shanghai, since the westward movement of the National Army, "Autonomous Associations" have been established under the protection of the Japanese. These are managed by a group of rogue local bullies who, in addition to flattering the enemy and willingly acting as slaves, specialize in extorting donations and taxes from merchants and civilians, issuing permits (each costing three or four yuan or more), and engaging in rampant exploitation and oppression of the local people as their only work. They even act as accomplices of tigers and collude with wolves. Last month, the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaonan reorganized the "Autonomous Associations" in various places into "Town Offices," and the former "Autonomous Association Chairmen" were appointed as "Town Chiefs." Six districts in western Shanghai were first designated for a pilot project. The announced Town Chiefs are Wang Ao of Beixinjing Town, Zhao Jiayu of Huacao Town, Hu Ding of Hongqiao Town, Chen Lin of Caohejing Town (merged with Longhua), a Guan of Caojiadu Town (merged with Zhoujiaqiao), and Lu He of Fahua Town. On the lunar New Year's Day, the Town Chiefs put on their stage makeup and performed their ugly plays. In addition, Miao Zhiren, chairman of the Seven Treasures Town Negotiation Association, Huang Siqing, chairman of the Meilong Town Autonomous Association, and Tang Linsheng, chairman of the Changqiao Town Autonomous Association, are currently planning and implementing similar projects in these three towns.

### Guerilla Warfare in Shanghai Suburbs During Lunar New Year, Three Battles Fought in Hongqiao District, Attempting to Attack Jiangwan and Approach Eastern Shanghai

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury says that yesterday (the 17th) we received news that on Thursday (the 16th) night and yesterday (the 17th) morning, Chinese irregular forces and Japanese patrols fought three battles in the Hongqiao District. The rumor that guerrillas are once again active within the Japanese-controlled areas of Shanghai is therefore more credible. According to reliable sources, at 9:15 PM and 11:15 PM on Thursday night,

Many Foreigners

Residing in the suburbs of Hongqiao and MacArthur Terrace (transliteration) heard heavy gunfire. At 2:20 AM yesterday morning, gunfire was heard again. At the same time, Chinese irregular forces in this city issued warnings to Chinese residents in the Hongqiao District, stating that they should not go out after 8 PM. It is expected that during the upcoming Lunar New Year, there will be continued fighting. The Japanese authorities have banned the setting off of firecrackers during the New Year. Regarding the rumor that on Thursday,

Two Japanese Soldiers

Were killed in the Yangshupu District, the Japanese authorities have denied it, saying that no Japanese soldiers were shot in that district. However, according to reliable sources, this rumor is not without foundation. It is said that what actually happened was that Chinese guerrillas took the offensive, attempting to capture Jiangwan on Wednesday and Thursday. But as they began their attack, Japanese reinforcements were dispatched to the area. Some guerrillas discovered that they were isolated from their own forces and

Fled into the Eastern District

And killed two Japanese soldiers on a bridge on the Lan Road River. However, inquiries at various police stations revealed that they had heard nothing about the reported shooting of Japanese soldiers. But if the report is true, then the two Japanese soldiers were killed on the bridge connecting Lan Road and Huade Road, because if they had been killed on another bridge, some of the nearby residents who were questioned yesterday would have heard the gunfire. Residents in the Huade Road area claimed that they had heard

What Sounded Like a Bomb

Explosion, but there was no definite news. According to news received yesterday, the Japanese authorities are now taking special precautions on Hongqiao Road, Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and Zhongshan Road, and have launched a large-scale search. Armed Japanese soldiers will be seen patrolling in the near future. At the same time, there are rumors that guerrillas in Pudong may launch a large-scale attack, which continues to make the Japanese authorities uneasy.

### Japanese Injured by Bullets on Nanjing Road, Beggar Injured in Right Leg

At around 1:30 PM on the 19th, gunfire suddenly erupted on Nanjing Road in this city. At that time, two Japanese men and women had just finished eating at a restaurant and were waiting for their hired Yitai Company car. Suddenly, bullets were fired. One of the Japanese women was hit in the chest, hitting her breast. One of the two men was hit in the right shoulder, and the other suffered a minor abrasion to his right wrist. At that time, a beggar named Zhou Yun, from Nantong, 50 years old, was also shot in the right leg. The police officers on duty nearby heard the alarm and immediately split up to pursue the attackers. Because the incident was sudden, they did not catch anyone. Therefore, it is not yet known who the shooters were. Later, the police received a report and immediately launched a strict search. Meanwhile, the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that the two Japanese men are staff members of the Japanese military news department.

### Child Falls to Death While Playing

A five-year-old boy, Xiangxiang, the son of a Du living at No. 17, Xinshou'an Lane, Huage Road, French Concession, was born chubby and lovable, and his parents loved him very much. At noon on the lunar New Year's Day (i.e., the 19th), he was playing on the third-floor balcony with other children living in the same building. Somehow, Xiangxiang suddenly lost his footing and fell from the balcony into the narrow alley behind the building. When he hit the ground, his head hit the water drain and the ground, and his brains immediately splattered. He was barely alive. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment but died. The parents cried bitterly upon hearing the news and nearly went mad.

### Fire on Robison Road, One Person Burned to Death, One Woman Also Severely Burned

At about 10 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 21, Caishi Lane, Robison Road, in western Shanghai. Suddenly, the fire illuminated the sky, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire quickly spread to neighboring houses on both sides. Later, the fire brigade heard the alarm and drove to the scene, making every effort to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after an hour. When the fire was raging, one man failed to escape and was burned to death. A woman, Jiang Shen, escaped from the fire, but was severely burned. She was taken by the fire brigade to Guangren Hospital for treatment.

### Anli Transportation Company Transports Military Supplies for the Japanese, Letter Demands Military Funds and Meeting, Two Arrested

The Anli Transportation Company at No. 16, Park Villa, Lane 1423, Yuyuan Road, is a partnership between Gu Jiangsheng and Chen Adi (i.e., Chuan Liang). Because the company specializes in doing business with the Japanese, its business has flourished in recent months, and it has made considerable profits. At about 8 AM on the 16th of this month, three uninvited guests broke into the Anli Company, handed over

A letter and left. When the company opened the letter, it turned out to be a threatening letter. The letter read as follows: "To Gu and Chen, the two old bosses: Recently, you treacherous merchants have been transporting military supplies by car for the Japanese and are very prosperous. Now, a unit of our troops has been transferred to Shanghai for rest. The end of the year is approaching,

Military funds are insufficient for expenses. Please provide 1,500 yuan. Our captain will send someone to contact you at the Deyi Restaurant in the Xiaocaichang, Baxianqiao, French Concession. The contact should be made between 3 and 4 PM on the 29th of the lunar calendar. If there is no reply, there will be a later date. Captain Li Lun," and so on. Gu and others immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Detective Tang Jian, Detective Tie Guobin, and others to

On the 17th of this month, together with detectives from the French Concession Police, waited at the Deyi Tea House at No. 82, Avenue Joffre. At 3:45 PM, two men, Hong Renjun from Anhui and Tao Junru from Jiangbei, came forward to contact them and were immediately arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station for detention. On the morning of the 18th, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, saying that the case

Still needs investigation and requested that the hearing be postponed. According to Gu Jiangsheng and Chen Adi's report, they stated the contact situation and said that the Anli Company had not conducted any transactions for two months due to the situation. Before February, it did rent vehicles to the Japanese to transport military supplies. After a brief interrogation of the two defendants, Hong and Tao, the judge ordered them to be detained pending rescheduling the hearing for the 28th of this month.

### Conditions in the Suburbs During the Spring Festival, A Murky and Pestilent Atmosphere

During the three days of the Lunar New Year, the war zones in the suburbs were tense due to the prevention of guerrilla activities. Residents stayed indoors and kept a low profile. Only a few small shops were closed on the streets, and there were few pedestrians. The situation is recorded as follows:

Residents Scramble to Tear Down Absurd Spring Couplets: In the areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and western Shanghai where some streets are already inhabited, some shops were closed for three days according to the old customs. In order to ingratiate itself, the puppet "Municipal Government" had printed a large number of red-bottomed, black-lettered, nonsensical spring couplets in advance and forced them to be pasted on the doors of various shops and households. The phrases are divided into three types, many of which contain reactionary meanings. Here are three couplets to show their absurdity: "Love neighbors and be kind, sing together in a happy land," "Pacify the good and eliminate violence, celebrate the New Year together," "Resistance is weakening, the old government is gone; live in peace, the new business is revitalized," "The rising sun hangs high, rejoicing and cheering," "A good year, people enjoy the three springs." But not long after they were posted, people scrambled to tear them down.

Gambling and Opium Dens Flourish Like Demon Caves: During these 300 days, opium dens, gambling dens, and prostitution, under the collusion of Japanese ruffians and puppet officials, have sprung up in response to the times. They compete with the original opium dens, heroin dens, and large and small gambling dens for customers and business, and they are completely open in nature, with no one interfering. There are even gambling stalls lining the streets, enticing ignorant people and defrauding them of money using various tricks. Therefore, the four suburbs are full of a murky and pestilent atmosphere. Entering them is like walking into a demon cave.

Japanese Troops Take Precautions, Water and Land Routes Remain Open: The Japanese troops, because of the numerous rumors in the four suburbs, fear that guerrillas will take the opportunity to operate, so they have to take careful precautions. They have increased the number of sentries guarding the ferries on both sides of the Huangpu River and the important highway bridges and roads on land. They strictly search residents entering and exiting. Those without puppet "citizen certificates" cannot pass. However, water and land transportation by boat and car are barely maintained, but there are few passengers and revenue is sharply reduced. The Japanese puppets suffered heavy losses.

After Three Days, Puppet Officials "Pick Up Bones": All large and small organizations of the puppet "Municipal Government," except for the puppet "police officers on duty in the puppet police station," were notified by Chuan Xiaonan to take three days off (including Sunday). All the puppet "institutions" were as quiet as death. During the three days, the puppet officials with higher positions hid in secret places and dared not go out, for fear of encountering danger on the way. Small puppet officials flocked to the isolated island, indulging in pleasure and debauchery. The puppet "institutions" are scheduled to open today, and the puppet officials are all calling for "picking up bones" again.

### Colds and Coughs are Prevalent, A Gift from the Rapidly Changing Weather, "Weiling" Medicine is Quickly Effective

Colds and coughs are very common diseases among Chinese people, and are most prevalent during times of rapid weather changes. Because they usually do not pose a life-threatening risk in the short term, everyone regards them as insignificant minor ailments and allows them to heal on their own. In fact, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often arise from extremely ordinary colds and coughs. Tuberculosis begins with a cough, and the danger is unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, turning into old age coughs, asthma with phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Westerners regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. Once they start, they immediately seek treatment and hope for a speedy recovery. Among common medicines, there is a kind of white pine syrup, which is a natural remedy for coughs. White pine is abundant in northern Europe, and Europeans suffering from lung diseases often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling its fragrant air, which has miraculous effects. Therefore, it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit fellow sufferers. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Weiling Pharmaceutical Company has specially formulated a compound white pine syrup according to the constitution of the Chinese people, with principal, assistant, and auxiliary ingredients. It can dissolve phlegm, relieve cough, suppress spasm, and relieve asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, and suitable for both the old and the young. Compared with pure white pine syrup, its efficacy is multiplied many times. People suffering from colds and coughs should not hesitate. Quickly purchase Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup. Each bottle is priced at one yuan, a special price of 75 cents. Sold at Zhengwei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Malu. Telephone 92525. No delivery service for purchases.

### Customs Receives Two Merchant Ships for Smuggling Suppression in the Huangpu River, Asia Sheng and Wan Li

The Jianghai Customs patrol ships, including eleven large and small ships such as Heguang, Fuxing, Lianxing, Yunxing, Fucheng, and Jiaoji, have been detained by the Japanese. Only Heguang and Liuxing remain, and because they are grain transport ships, they are still used by the Customs, regularly carrying out the task of supplying food and fish to offshore lighthouses and light buoys, so the task of suppressing piracy at sea has long been abandoned and cannot be carried out. At the same time, the anti-smuggling work in the port of Shanghai is also lacking in vessels, so cases of smuggling and drug trafficking have occurred repeatedly. It is now learned that the Japanese have agreed to issue the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships Asia Sheng and Wan Li to the Customs for use. The two ships have been received by Shanhaiguan, and after a slight refitting, they will be used for anti-smuggling in the Huangpu River, and will not be dispatched to sea to arrest pirates. Because the Japanese have imposed a blockade on the seas of our country, the Customs, in order to avoid misunderstandings, has voluntarily given up maritime patrol work.

### The Puppet "Municipal Government" Abolishes the Water Rescue Team, Swift Currents at the Blockade Line, Drowning Victims Will Have No Rescue

Because the water flow at the Sixteen Shop Blockade Line was rapid and often caused ferries and sampans to capsize and drown people, the puppet "Municipal Government" had previously organized a water rescue team, with expenses subsidized by the puppet "Municipal Government." There were a total of eight people, each team member receiving 33 yuan per month, and one squad leader receiving 44 yuan per month. Since Chuan Xiaonan took office as "Mayor," he has installed many private individuals and greatly embezzled money. However, he ordered the abolition of this organization, which benefited the people, on the 15th of this month. In the future, if there are capsized ships near the Huangpu River blockade line, there will be no one to rescue them.

### Japanese Military Police and Puppet Police Arrest Eight Chinese, Searching and Arbitrarily Arresting People Near the Pentagon, Taking Them Away in Vehicles

At the western end of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road, near the Pentagon, around 9:45 AM the day before yesterday, eight Chinese were suddenly arrested by Japanese military police and puppet police. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Before this incident, two Japanese military police, wearing khaki uniforms, led more than thirty puppet police, each carrying a rifle, in a Japanese military truck. In addition, four armed Japanese soldiers in four cars successively arrived near the Pentagon and swarmed down, immediately searching houses in the Xin Sen Li and Er Kang Li areas. Residents who witnessed this scene were terrified and had no way to avoid it, and their homes were arbitrarily searched for over an hour. As a result, Lu Pengjiang (30 years old), a Shaoxing man who dealt in silk and satin from No. 30 Xin Sen Li, and Cai Dingkang (24 years old), Cai Dingzheng (19 years old), workers from the Public Welfare Yarn Factory in Chongming, Mao Laigou, a peddler from Chongming, Shi Cailang, and a Mr. Gong from Chongming who dealt in foreign cloth in No. 31, were arrested. Two young men were also arrested in Er Kang Li, forcefully dragged onto the truck, and sped eastward on Extra-Settlement Road. The families of those arrested are unclear about the reasons for the arrests. However, it is rumored that the Japanese soldiers took this action because, according to the puppet police at the time, they wanted to arrest a Mr. Wang and a Mr. Zhu.

### Wife Lives with Lover, Husband Seeks Revenge, Gathers Crowd to Borrow Money, Takes the Opportunity to Kill, Lover Killed with Three Axe Blows on the Spot

Sun Zhangxing, 41 years old, from Nanhui, Pudong, is a servant at a Westerner's house at 1730 Avenue Joffre. He has been living with Han Chen, 29 years old, the wife of Han Daochun, a Shanghai resident at No. 5, Lane 57, Panxing Road, for two years. She has turned her back on her husband and lives with Sun, sharing meals and lodging.

Appearing like Husband and Wife, it aroused the jealousy of her husband, who could do nothing about it but harbor resentment in his heart, long intending to take revenge on Sun. On the night of the 20th of this month, her husband, Han Daochun, brought three people home and asked Sun to borrow 300 yuan for an urgent need, pretending to be calm. Sun did not refuse and took out dozens of yuan in banknotes to lend him. Han accepted it,

Said goodbye with a smile. Sun saw him off at the door. Unexpectedly, at that moment, the three people waiting outside the door pulled out sharp axes and struck Sun's right hand with one axe. Because he reached out to resist, his thumb was chopped off. Then, he was violently struck twice on the back of the head, his brains splattering. Sun immediately fell to the ground. The murderers and her husband saw that their goal had been achieved and fled in a panic. Neighbors and

Sun's lover, Han Chen, came out to see, Sun had already died. They reported to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body of Sun was sent to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. Meanwhile, Sun's lover, Han Chen, was taken in for questioning to investigate the murderers. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Special No. 2 Court, and Prosecutor Wang and a coroner arrived at the scene. It was confirmed that the deceased died from

Axe Wounds. Because no family members were present, after the handling detective reported the case, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the hall for burial. Later, the deceased's wife, Sun Peng, received the news in her hometown and rushed over. Friends of the deceased raised funds to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and then requested the court to issue a certificate to retrieve the body and coffin and transport it back for burial. They also reported to the French police station, requesting a strict search for the escaped murderers to bring them to justice and redress the injustice.

### Letters

To the Editor, Please note that the name of the commodity "Ajinomoto" is legally exclusively used by our company, and only our company manufactures "Ajinomoto". The news about the Taiyi Ajinomoto Factory published in your newspaper today may cause misunderstandings. Please publish this letter in the Letters column to correct the record. Sincerely, Tianchu Ajinomoto Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Factory Affairs Management Office, February 18.

To the Editor, We have been jointly informed by our clients, Ms. Zhang Qin, Ms. Zhang Dai, and Mr. Zhang Haoqiu, that they were shocked to read the news published in your newspaper on the 15th of this month under the local news section, "Jeweler's Elderly Mother Accuses Grandson of Theft". The estate of the late Zhang Bingxin should legally be jointly inherited by Haoqiu and Bingxin's daughter, Haoqiu's sister, Hao Yu. Previously, Qin, Dai, Haoqiu, and others invited friends to check and copy the inventory and seal it to the Huang residence for safety. The grandmother, Ou, was fully aware of this. Later, an evaluation committee was organized to conduct the valuation, and Haoqiu and Hao Yu successively sent letters to Ou and announced the analysis in the newspaper. It can be seen that everything was open and transparent, so how could there be any theft? As for Ou's daily expenses, there is an income of more than 100 yuan per month from the rent of rooms 28 to 31, Continental Square, Luban Road, which is more than enough to provide the necessary support. Now it is reported that Ou has made false accusations, which they had no prior knowledge of, and the court summons has not yet been received. If it is true, then the law must be based on facts, and criminal evidence must be used as the basis for conviction. False accusations and abuse of litigation have their own deserved punishment. However, the value of the jade tripod mentioned in the article is 50,000 yuan, which is even more untrue. The total value of Binggong's entire estate is not even this much. Before the valuation, Ou was invited to recommend a member of the committee, and each item of the estate was recorded in the valuation book. A jade furnace was valued at only 500 yuan, with the personal signatures of the evaluation committee members as proof, which can be verified separately. It is absolutely impossible to fabricate and harm. Deeply fearing that rumors will spread and confuse the hearing, we entrust you to write a letter to clarify the facts and make them clear. Sincerely, Lawyers Shen Weihan and Sun Qiying, February 18, 1939.

Science and Life

### Conditions for a Successful Science Teacher

— Shang Yao

A successful science teacher, of course, studies his specialized subject diligently, but also reads widely in other scientific fields.

He knows how to teach and how to teach science.

He can express his own meaning clearly. He has abundant information on the podium and in the laboratory, and his hands are more skilled and delicate. He can manage instruments and, even more, manage the order of the crowd.

He has a philosophical demeanor. He is also well-versed in history and can sit in a room with young students, talking at length about the lives of Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Darwin, and other philosophers.

In addition, he is more responsible and has confidence in his work.

A science teacher may have a first-class laboratory, ample time, and an ideal plan, but unless he really knows how to teach and is enthusiastic about teaching, he has no hope of success. Conversely, if he is truly enthusiastic and studious, he will succeed even without good equipment.

Success or failure depends entirely on the person, and all difficulties can be overcome.

### Cotton Clothes and Cotton Pants

— Qiao Xia Ke

"The whole family is in the wind, and the clothes for September have not yet been cut." This is a famous line from a Qing dynasty poet: The poet's elegance cannot withstand the wind, so we will put aside elegance for now and talk about the practical issue of staying warm.

I really admire animals. When it gets cold, they don't have the trouble of sweaters and coats. What methods do they use to keep warm? As far as our simple observation with the naked eye is concerned, everyone knows that they have feathers, but everyone must wonder how they can be the same in winter and summer? In fact, some animals can change their feathers or fur according to the cold and heat, while other animals have other ways. They just change the "still air" contained in the fur layer, either increasing or decreasing its capacity, which is the way to regulate cold and heat. Because air is not very conductive of heat, thickening the air in the fur layer makes it easy to retain heat, which is the way to deal with the cold, while thinning the air in the fur layer makes it easier for body heat to dissipate, which is the way to deal with the heat. Imagine comparing the amount of air contained when the fur is spread flat on the skin and when the fur is upright on the skin, we can easily understand that the amount of air contained when it is upright is always more. Therefore, one of the ways animals keep warm is by "raising their fur." There is a muscle near the hair root in the skin, called the "arrector pili muscle," which uses its contraction to raise the hair.

Do we humans have hair? Yes, but too little. Do we have arrector pili muscles? Yes, about the same amount as hair. "When the north wind rises, we shiver." If we try to open our clothes and face it, everyone will find small bumps on their skin, just like goosebumps. This is the result of the contraction of the arrector pili muscle. However, human hair has degenerated, so although the arrector pili muscle does its best, it is still useless. Therefore, in order to obtain a layer of cold-proof air, we must rely on animal fur—leather goods—or other materials containing a large amount of air, such as wool, etc. This has been personally tested by gentlemen and ladies wearing fox fur or fur-lined coats. The reason why clothes keep warm lies in this.

Physiology has a term: "Clothing is the same price as food." This means that if you don't wear clothes in the cold, your body temperature will inevitably be greatly lost, and our way to make up for this loss is to eat more. In other words, if I wear more clothes, my body temperature can be retained, and those things that I eat more to compensate for the loss can be avoided, so it is said that the value of clothes and those things is the same. So, a clever friend came; he put on a fur robe, lined with a cotton quilt, and lay in a nanmu coffin, with an ebony outer coffin on top. He said that the still air outside the body was more than sufficient, and his body temperature would naturally be foolproof. In this way, he could refuse food and spend the winter safely. However, in less than an hour, he was sweating like a slurry, and in less than a whole day, his stomach was rumbling with hunger (the coffin lid was of course not covered). The reason why he was sweating like a slurry is a long story, so we'll leave it at that. As for the rumbling hunger, it clearly proves that the mission of food is more than just one. In addition to the part that is the same price as clothes, there are other missions that clothes cannot replace. We'll also have to leave the mission of food at that. But we already understand that clothes cannot replace food, but can only be the same price as it under certain conditions. Conversely, the same is true for food: food cannot replace clothes (for keeping warm), but can only be the same price as it under certain conditions. Therefore, if you swim in the Arctic naked, even if you are followed by as many Manchu and Han chefs as you want, you will inevitably freeze to death.

Maybe someone wants to ask, what kind of clothes, what style of clothes, are scientific?

Oh! Under the slogan of national unity and thrift, my answer is so simple: the unit of keeping warm is cotton clothes and cotton pants.

### Scientific Strange Tales

— Ji Qian

Black Ore

When Marco Polo first came to China, he was quite surprised to see the Chinese using coal to burn fire. In his writings, he called the Chinese able to use a kind of black ore (Black mineral) to achieve the effect of fire. At that time, Europe did not know the effect of coal, and its cultural level was far inferior to the Chinese nation. Hundreds of years later, with the development of science, Europe has become a new world, and our country has been controlled by others due to its scientific backwardness, which can be sighed for!

Big Old Monster

In the early years of the Republic of China, in Nanxiawa, Beiping, a strange bird sound was heard at night. After a long time, it was never seen what it was. Later, because it was heard every night, the residents were worried that it was a monster. The police station sent a team to investigate and found a large bird in the reeds, white, with a large sac hanging under its beak, bright red. When the wind blew, its beak opened and its sac expanded. The sound it made was the same as what was heard at night. It flapped its wings and flew away. Those who saw it called it the big old monster. For a time, all newspapers carried it. This bird is called a pelican, also known as Taohe (Pelican). It is common in the northern rivers. It eats fish and is in the same family as cormorants. It uses the large sac under its beak to catch fish in the water, like a dragnet. This is an ordinary bird, but it is rarely seen in the city. The residents pointed it out as a monster, which is ridiculous.

Strange Frogs

In the past, thousands of frogs were suddenly seen in the city of Beiping, marching in teams from one place to another, lasting for several days and nights without stopping. The residents all thought it was an ominous sign. At that time, the rainfall was quite large, which was different from the spring drought of previous years. Frogs lay many eggs. In dry weather, most of them die. Only when they develop to the tadpole stage do they die due to lack of water and food. Therefore, there are fewer frogs each year. But that year, due to excessive rain, most of the eggs and tadpoles were able to grow up. The old and young frogs were overcrowded, so they moved together. Only because there were too many of them did the above-mentioned phenomenon occur, which has nothing to do with good or bad luck.

Old Maids Revive the Nation

Darwin once said that the abundance of purple clover in various parts of England is due to the large number of bees, which help its hybridization. The large number of bees is due to the decrease in the number of rats, because rats are enough to harm bees. The decrease in the number of rats is due to the increase in the number of cats, because cats like to kill rats. The increase in the number of cats is due to the fact that old maids in various places like to raise cats the most. From this, it can be seen that organisms are interconnected in a network of relationships. Vogt said that in the middle of the nineteenth century, the breeding of purple clover in England enriched animal husbandry, the beef was very beautiful and cheap, and everyone could eat it. The mental and physical strength of the British were particularly developed. Scientific inventions were heard almost every day, and industrial and commercial undertakings expanded day by day. The achievements in exploration were also very good. The power of the British people spread all over the world, making them a first-class power in the world.

### Human Motorboat, How Wonderful!

— Ye Ren

A small gasoline engine and a propeller are installed on the butt of a small boat, and it can be turned into a motorboat. Then, if a swimmer installs the same propeller, wouldn't he also be able to become a motorboat? In fact, this gadget has been made by someone. It is said that it was very popular on the beach in Miami, USA, last summer. The swimmer installed a small propeller on his back and waist, used his limbs as a rudder, turned freely, and the speed was extremely high. Jun Qi's illustration

### What is this?

— (American Aviation Magazine)

Does it look like a dredger or a thresher? Actually, it's an airplane. It can indeed fly, and according to its inventor's recent test in New York, it can fly straight up and soar in the air for a long time.

### Wealth from Volcanoes

— Xi Wei

Volcanic eruptions are indeed major disasters that destroy life and property, but they can move the reserves inside the earth to the ground for the use of organisms on the ground. Their contribution to blessing organisms is indeed not small.

The gifts sent by volcanoes from their chimneys are diverse, from gold and diamonds to dust and drinkable water, there is everything.

Many metals, especially the heavier and rarer ones, are often found in large quantities of volcanic rock. The reason is that they are dissolved by acid vapors deep underground, carried to locations near the surface, and then remain there in a concentrated state for our use.

Many non-metals also come from the same source, with sulfur being the most prominent. Those that are less prominent and more important are chlorine gas, which is part of the gas exhaled by volcanoes, and the salt that is indispensable to our lives is formed by its combination with sodium.

The most abundant of all fluids ejected from volcanoes is a very common compound—water. Water is part of the crystal structure of rocks. When rocks are chemically decomposed in the process of a volcanic eruption, this water that has been bound by the stone for a long time is also released and escapes to the ground.

Another gas that is extremely important for life is also released in the volcanic chimney. It is the same as the gas emitted from man-made chimneys, namely carbon dioxide. After it is absorbed by plants, they begin to make food. It combines with phosphorus and calcium in animal bodies to become bones and shells. Finally, we must also attribute the origin of coral and pearls to volcanoes.

### Introduction to the Book "Chinese Forest Flora"

— Que Yi Sheng

Edited by Qian Chongshu, jointly printed by the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China and the Forest and Land Reclamation Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, published in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, priced at two yuan in national currency. Available at the China Science Book and Instrument Company, 649 Foch Road, Shanghai.

Through the efforts of several scholars over the past decade, China's higher plant taxonomy has gradually taken shape, making significant contributions not only to academic fields but also revealing the location of our country's plant resources, which is of great importance to national economic construction and the future of the war effort.

Due to these outstanding research achievements, there have been many related publications. In addition to various research papers, there are also numerous specialized works. The earliest was Chen Huanyong's "Chinese Economic Trees," followed by the "Chinese Plant Atlas" (four volumes published) co-edited by Hu Xiansu and Chen Huanyong. Recently, Chen Rong's "Chinese Trees" and other books have been published, all of which are highly valuable scientific works. However, these specialized publications often focus on academic theory and pay little attention to the economic uses of the trees described. Qian's book is a good choice for those seeking a balance between academic theory and economic value.

Although the editorial plan of this book is not explicitly stated, it can be seen from the structure that it selects important Chinese forest plants for description based on the system of plant taxonomy. Each volume contains fifty species. It first examines and determines the botanical names, referencing extensive literature; then describes the morphology in detail; then discusses the geographical distribution in China; then details the value of propagation, cultivation, and afforestation; and finally explores the various economic uses in detail. Roots, bark, flowers, leaves, seeds, and wood are all thoroughly examined. Which can be used as raw materials for papermaking, which can be used as aircraft materials, which can be used as furniture, which can be used to build warships and vehicles, whether seeds can be pressed for oil or used for food, whether flowers and leaves can be used for ornamental purposes or to make fragrances and medicines, etc., all should be detailed. After reading the description of each plant, readers will understand its various economic uses and value in national defense construction. It is not only a good textbook for agricultural and forestry schools, but also an indispensable reference book for those engaged in afforestation and plant production.

Another feature of this book is that all the plants discussed are accompanied by exquisitely drawn illustrations. In addition to accurate depictions of leaves and stems, flowers and fruits are also shown in enlarged dissections to facilitate identification by scholars. The exquisite printing and excellent paper quality are evident to all and need not be赘述. However, there are some typographical errors that are easy to correct.

Plastic Aircraft

An aircraft made of a reinforced plastic material (such as bakelite) has been tested by the U.S. Army Aviation Department. According to reports, one of these aircraft has been rigorously inspected under various flight conditions. If the results are satisfactory, the construction of small training and fighter aircraft will be greatly accelerated because each part of the aircraft can be molded and then assembled, making the process very easy. This is one of the great advantages of using plastic materials.

Comprehensive Bacterial Solution

Dr. Walther Goebel of the Rockefeller Institute in the United States has developed a bacterial solution for preventing pneumonia from common substances such as bran, protein, and wood chips. After injecting this bacterial solution into healthy rabbits for several days, the rabbit blood changed. Dr. Goebel injected this immune rabbit with pneumonia bacteria sufficient to kill thousands of normal animals, but there was no reaction. The main advantage of this bacterial solution, in addition to its high efficacy, is its low cost and readily available raw materials.

Electric Chair for Flies

Someone has invented a screen door that uses electricity to kill flies or other insects and has obtained a patent license from the U.S. government. Vertical copper wires are woven into the door screen, one carrying a positive charge and the other carrying a negative charge, arranged alternately. When an unfortunate fly flies onto the screen or tries to squeeze through the mesh, it connects the positive and negative charges, causing an electric current to flow through its body and kill it.

### Shanghai Citizens' Relief Association Issues Declaration for Soliciting Production and Education Funds for Refugees; Educational Circles Voluntarily Propose Donating 10% of School Subsidies

The Education Group Solicitation Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has launched a campaign to raise funds for refugee production and education. It has received support from educational circles and student families throughout the city and has begun fundraising. The following is the "Declaration for Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education" issued by the association:

Fundraising Declaration

According to recent statistics, there are still 100,000 refugees in Shanghai's various shelters, including 63,000 adults and 37,000 children. This number is not small. Raising funds for the relief of these refugees is, of course, a huge problem. However, Shanghai has a population of four million. If each of the four million residents is willing to contribute as much as they can, it is not too difficult to provide relief to 100,000 refugees, and it is our responsibility to do so in this extraordinary period. The educational and cultural circles of this city, as well as the 200,000 young students, have already made great efforts in the past for refugee relief. However, as long as the refugee problem is not resolved, our responsibility is not over. Our continued donations in the future still depend on the efforts of our educational and cultural circles and our beloved young students.

In terms of refugee relief work, the minimum requirement is to ensure that refugees are not hungry or cold and are not displaced. In other words, it is to provide sustenance for refugees. However, it is absolutely insufficient to only provide sustenance without education. In addition to sustenance, we must find ways to enhance the intelligence of refugees and cultivate their productive capacity. Therefore, the provision of refugee education and the training of production skills are very important and urgent. Refugees will eventually be resettled and will eventually return to their hometowns. If we do not take this opportunity to provide them with appropriate education and teach them production skills, then the livelihood problems of refugees will still not be solved after resettlement and after returning to their hometowns. Therefore, only the combination of education and sustenance is active and thorough relief.

Therefore, this association has invited enthusiastic people from the educational and cultural circles of Shanghai to launch a fundraising campaign. The purpose is to raise a sum of money to promote refugee education and run refugee production enterprises. The goal of this fundraising is 100,000 yuan. This association will prepare "Charity Medals" to be issued to schools and organizations and will be given to enthusiastic people who donate one yuan each. The purpose is clear and upright, and the method is simple and easy to implement. We sincerely hope that our colleagues in the educational and cultural circles, as well as all 200,000 of the city's beloved young students, will enthusiastically donate with the aim of "the greatest joy in doing good," so that the goal of 100,000 yuan can be achieved in one fell swoop, and from then on, refugee education work and production enterprises can be smoothly promoted. Then, not only will 100,000 refugees benefit greatly, but the contribution to the country and society will also be significant. This is the declaration.

Educational Circles Propose Donating 10% of Subsidies

In order to expand the fundraising for the refugee production and education fund, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has launched a city-wide mobilization of all large, medium, and small schools to solicit donations from students and parents starting on the 18th of this month. Since its implementation, the results have been very good. Now, educational circles have jointly proposed to voluntarily contribute 10% of the educational subsidies from the Public Concession Municipal Council this year to relief funds. According to the current total amount of subsidies for each school, which is 160,000 yuan, raising 10% would also amount to 16,000 yuan, which is not a small amount. At the same time, it is suggested that the Relief Association use the students of each school at graduation to prepare exquisite handbooks and use the proceeds to fund refugee production and education. The effect will be very significant. The authorities of the association are pleased to accept the spirit of automatic donation and the good suggestions of the educational circles and will use this as a long-term relief fund for the educational circles in the future.

### Recent Situation of Education in Jiangsu Province (Part 2): Middle and Elementary School Teachers Continue to Dedicate Themselves to Education; Schools Are Still Established in Guerrilla Areas North and South of the Yangtze River

Secondary Education: There were originally more than 30 provincial secondary schools in Jiangsu Province. After the outbreak of the war, a small number of provincial schools were unable to hold classes due to their proximity to the war zone. The remaining schools continued to operate. After the fall of Shanghai and the capital, all provincial schools north and south of the Yangtze River were suspended. At that time, the provincial government considered the area north of Jiangsu to be relatively safe, and it was not feasible for young students to be out of school for a long time. Therefore, it was decided to establish two provincial joint middle schools to accommodate teachers and students from provincial middle schools in the war zone. The First Joint Middle School was located in Lianshui, with Wu Hailou as the principal. The Second Joint Middle School was located in Yancheng, with Qi Shuzu as the principal. Since Japanese troops landed in Tianshenggang on March 17, these two schools were closed. The provincial government asked Chairman Han to use military vehicles to transport students who wished to go west, and they continued to attend classes in Wanxian, Sichuan, until now. The principal is still Wu Hailou. In mid-April, the Provincial Department of Education, considering that there were still many middle school students out of school in the area north of Jiangsu, adopted the principle of breaking up the whole into parts and promulgated the Regulations for Self-Study and Tutoring Groups for Secondary Schools in the War Zone. Each group consisted of 50 people and hired teachers with secondary school qualifications to tutor the main subjects. For a time, such groups were established in counties such as Taixian, Xinghua, Gaoyou, and Baoying. At the same time, several private middle schools opened in various counties in northern Jiangsu, such as the Private Yangzhou Middle School, which moved to Gaoyou to hold classes, the Zhongnan Middle School, which established a branch in Baoying, the Shanghai Huguang Middle School, which established a branch in Taixing, and the Guangshi Middle School Association, which established a branch in Dongtai. The Qiaoguang Middle School, etc., once had branches in Rugao. However, the Guangshi and Qiaoguang branches were suspended due to the fall of Tongru. After July, the provincial middle schools in southern Jiangsu successively moved to Shanghai to resume classes, including Suzhong, Yangzhong, Sunushi, Zenshi, Sishi, Songnushi, Suguang, Nantong Middle School, Changzhong, Zhenzhong, Songjiang High School, Taishi, and other schools. In the north of Jiangsu, the Provincial Department of Education also planned to establish nine temporary middle schools and normal schools in Xuhai, Huaiyan, Xingtongtai, and other areas, based on the principle of setting them up in rural areas. In this way, secondary education in Jiangsu Province gradually gained vitality. In addition, the junior middle schools in Jiangdu, Xinghua, Taixian, Taixing, Lianshui, Huaian, Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Baoying, and other counties in the lower reaches of the Huai River continued to open as usual. In Yixing, in southern Jiangsu, the county Education Bureau also planned a county-run junior middle school to continue classes in the guerrilla area.

Elementary Education: After the fall of the counties in southern Jiangsu, most of the elementary schools in the cities and towns were suspended. Many of the elementary schools in the rural areas were still supported by the original teachers. These people generally do not receive public subsidies but rely on a sincere enthusiasm to win the sympathy of the villagers. Recently, counties such as Yixing, Jiading, Juxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha have restored elementary schools one after another. Although the treatment is very low, the teachers deeply feel that elementary education is the basic education of the country and are happy to engage in it. In the counties of northern Jiangsu, even under the extremely tight financial resources for education, they still try their best to maintain it and strive to promote wartime education. The education bureaus of each county have formulated general guidelines for the implementation of wartime education and ordered the elementary schools to comply with them. In addition, in order to relieve out-of-school children and unemployed teachers in the war zone, the counties in northern Jiangsu have increased the number of temporary elementary schools to accommodate them. For example, the Xinghua County Temporary Elementary School was opened in March of the 27th year and was initially headed by Jin Yingwu. Later, Jin was transferred to the Director of the Xinghua Education Bureau and was succeeded by Zhao Shiru as the principal. The Temporary Elementary School in Taixian was headed by Zhang Xianwu and was scheduled to open in February of the 28th year.

### Charity Football Match: Huali loses miserably by one goal; Western United wins by luck with a score of 3-2; Lu Zhongen loses the country carelessly; Gao Huaide bids 400 yuan to purchase the match ball

The Sino-Western Charity Football Match, sponsored by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association, Huali vs. Western United, met again at the Yiyuan Stadium on the day after the Lunar New Year (20th) at 3:00 p.m. The two sides were evenly matched, and the game was extremely tense. After an hour and a half of fierce battle, each side scored two goals, and the outcome was undecided. Until the last five minutes, unfortunately, due to the mistake of goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, the "yellow-haired" Lobastov took advantage of the opportunity and shot the ball into the empty goal, calmly rolling it into the net. Huali then lost again by a score of 2-3. Huali had already lost 1-2 in last year's Christmas charity match, and it is a pity that they still failed to retaliate. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, the Yiyuan Stadium was crowded with people, totaling no less than 10,000 people, with an income of more than 6,000 yuan. After the match, the match ball was auctioned off, and Gao Huaide, the president of the Lido Sports Association, generously donated 400 yuan to purchase it. The second match, Lido vs. the Army United, is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 5th of next month (Sunday) at the Yiyuan Stadium.

Dutch Consul Opens the Match: The Dutch Consul-General to Shanghai, Mr. Bao Xuewen, President of the International Relief Committee, accompanied by Mr. Li Guiyong, Executive Director of the Relief Committee, performed the opening ceremony. The match was affected by yesterday's heavy rain all day, and the field was muddy and slippery. The performance of both sides was greatly diminished. Although Xiao Dai, the forward of Huali, was absent, Li Yichen was replaced, and the performance was still perfect. The ferocity was far above Western United, which was most satisfying. Tan Fuzhen's center was mediocre and failed to stand out. Xu Chengxun and Zhang Xueyao also had occasional loopholes, causing Fafanxiao and Fohn to be extraordinary in their activities. Because the rear line could not provide sufficient support, the forward line was often seen returning in vain. The forwards of Western United did not cooperate as well as the five tigers of Huali. However, the center back line was strong and terrifying. Maxigan can be described as outstanding. Willie Walter's goalkeeper performed the best, saving countless dangerous balls. The last hurdle for the five tigers of Huali was that their barrage of shots failed to break into the goal. This was the person.

Opening the Record: After the two sides came into contact, Sun Tie Leg opened the record first. Thompson and Robert of Western United scored three consecutive goals. In the first half, Huali was 1-2 behind. In the second half, Xu Wenkui topped the flower, tied the score. It is a pity that in the last five minutes, Lu Zhongen rushed out, trying to intercept Fafanxiao, but was unexpectedly picked by Fafanxiao, and Lobastov sat back and reaped the benefits, shooting the ball into the empty goal. After the kickoff, Western United attacked fiercely. Later, because Robert committed a handball, he was sent into the Western United area. Sun Tie Leg raised his foot and shot fiercely, but it was caught by Willie. Jia Youliang carried the ball forward, and Li Yichen swept forcefully in front of the goal, also falling into Willie's hands. After fifteen minutes of stalemate, Jia Youliang hooked in, Li Yichen headed Sun Jinshun, and Tie Leg swept in, opening the record first. Fafanxiao passed cleverly to the middle, and the three forwards missed the opportunity one after another. Tang quickly raised his legs and scored, only three minutes away from losing the ball. Youliang hooked in again, Li Yichen's shot was saved, and Xu Wenkui added a kick, but it crossed the crossbar, and the good opportunity was lost, which is a pity. In twenty-five minutes, Lobastov got Thompson's pass and knocked on the door. The long-legged deer failed to save, the ball rolled towards the goal, Robert rushed up and pushed it straight into the net. At the end of the first half, Western United took the lead with a score of 2-1.

Miserable Loss by One Goal: Changing places and fighting again, Huali's Cao Qiuting passed the ball to Xu Wenkui. Xu moved forward and picked it up. Li Yichen lay down and launched. The ball bounced back from Willie's foot. Xu caught it and knocked again and was kicked out by Willie. Not long after, Huali got a free kick opportunity. Sun Tie Leg kicked from 25 yards away from the goal, with an extremely fierce sweep, but it was caught by Willie. Youliang, Tie Leg, and Wenkui shot again and again, but Willie was agile and all became illusions. After seventeen minutes, Jia Youliang cut in from the bottom line, and Xu Wenkui waited for a good shot and headed the ball into the net, clearly and beautifully, winning warm applause and tying the score at 2-2. Western United counterattacked again and again, but all failed. After a stalemate until the last five minutes, Fafanxiao got Fohn's shot, carried the ball and rushed in. Lu Zhongen rushed out in a panic, but was picked up by Fafanxiao in the middle. Lobastov reaped the rewards and shot into the empty goal. Before long, the game ended, and Huali lost miserably by a score of 2-3.

### Wonderful Basketball Performance: Washington University Wins Over Paramount; The Reputation is Well-Deserved, the Skills are Superb, the Result is 62 to 54

The basketball team of the University of Washington in the United States (i.e., the representative team of the Seattle Amateur Athletic Association) arrived in Shanghai by the Asama Maru on the morning of the 18th (Saturday), a group of eight people, led by Captain Ross Winner and Manager Ralph Carnae. That evening at 8:00 p.m., they played a performance match with the Paramount team at the Western Youth Basketball Hall. The basketball skills of Washington University were indeed well-deserved, and the performance was superb. They won by a large margin of 39 to 15 in the first half. In the second half, Paramount worked hard to counterattack, and Washington University's offense and defense were also more relaxed. The result was 62 to 54, and Paramount lost by only eight points. The Western Youth Basketball Hall was crowded with people who came to admire the skills, making it the first grand occasion after the Shenbao Cup. The entire team boarded the original ship on the 19th, the decisive day, and went to Japan, then to Honolulu, and then back to the United States. The competition in Japan with us has not yet been decided.

Talk: According to the team manager Ralph Carnae, the reporter was told that this decision to go to the Philippines was at the invitation of the Philippine Basketball Association, and it was the strongest American basketball team in terms of skills and strength in the East. They played a total of 15 games in the Philippines, and they were invincible. Only the Japanese University United Team had some competition at the beginning, but it was controlled by them after entering. The team left Seattle on December 23 to go to the Philippines and is expected to return to the United States in early March. They may play again with the Japanese United Team in Japan, and there will be two games in Honolulu.

Skills: All the team members are unusually tall and strong, all over six feet tall. The team's cooperation, speed, and shooting skills have all reached the realm of perfection. It is even better than the South Pacific team in the previous decision. Its offensive method completely adopts the extremely wonderful blocking method to find gaps. The guards also follow up from behind, and the shooting is unrestricted by angles. The continuous throwing under the board is especially ingenious. The defense uses individual defense methods, but it does not specify dead nails, adapts to changes, and sees its "chrysanthemum cicada shedding its shell" everywhere. Wigner, Lovelich, and B. Aeger are the most outstanding players in the team.

Competition: Paramount's appearance was completely lost in panic and confusion, allowing Washington University to trample on it, with almost no power to parry. The offense was also at a loss, with no way to go with the ball. Cai Yanxiong scored first with a free throw, and then Darwin also scored. Paramount took the lead for the second time with a score of 4 to 3. From then on, it continued to lag behind. The first half ended with a score of 39 to 15, a difference of 24 points. In the second half, Paramount replaced Chen Xianglong with Jia Youliang, and he scored seven consecutive points, chasing to 22 to 39. Then Xu Wenkui was replaced by Zhou Dayun. Wenkui's long-range shooting was like a godsend, and he scored repeatedly. At 51 to 32, Xue Chong, Wenkui, and Youliang counterattacked with all their strength, scoring repeatedly. Washington University's offense and defense were also more relaxed, and the score was getting closer and closer. The result was 58 to 50, and Paramount lost with honor. Referees Blanc and Conrad.

### Hong Kong-Philippines Football Match: Philippine Team Loses Both Games; 4-1 Defeat to Hong Kong Interport; 5-3 Defeat to Hong Kong Chinese Team; Li Huitang's Undiminished Prowess

(Hong Kong, 19th) The Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match was held here today, attracting a massive and unprecedented crowd. The Hong Kong team took a 1-0 lead in the first half and ultimately won decisively with a score of 4-1. Center forward Li Huitang scored three goals singlehandedly, and right winger Fupu scored one goal. Philippine right winger Reyas scored one goal when the score was 2-0. Li Huitang performed exceptionally well. The Philippine players displayed skillful play but lacked the final burst of energy.

(Hong Kong, 20th) The Philippine team participating in the Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match lost again to the Chinese team on the 20th with a score of 5-3, although their performance was better than on the 19th. Li Huitang of the Chinese team was tightly marked and unable to fully display his skills. Left winger Hou Chengtou was the most active player and the standout performer of the entire match. After the start of the game, the Philippine center forward opened the scoring, but Li Huitang quickly equalized with a penalty kick. Chengtou then scored two consecutive goals. The Philippine right forward and center forward also each scored a goal, resulting in a 3-3 draw at halftime. In the second half, Shanxi inside forward Li Zhaorong scored two goals, leading the Chinese team to a 5-3 victory. The Philippine team is scheduled to play the Hong Kong United team on the 22nd.

### Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education; Opinions on Improving Teacher Training Education in Our Country (Part 1) Wu Zengjie

Elementary schools are the places where national education is implemented. The children receiving this education are between the ages of six and twelve, and they need the teaching and nurturing of excellent teachers to develop healthy bodies, lively spirits, practical knowledge, and good habits. Education is the foundation of a nation, and the prosperity or decline of a country depends on the level of education of its citizens. Therefore, if we want a strong nation, we must devote ourselves to the development of education. Among all levels of education, the elementary school stage is the starting point and should be given special attention. If we want to have perfect elementary schools, we should pay attention to cultivating good teachers. The current education system uses normal schools as institutions for training elementary school teachers. Normal schools are like mothers, and elementary schools are like sons. The health of the mother directly affects the physical and mental well-being of the infant. Therefore, we cannot ignore teacher training education if we want to improve elementary education. My opinions on improving teacher training education can be divided into the following points:

Cultivating Students' Habits of Diligence: Current normal school students are the future elementary school teachers. Elementary school teachers have heavy workloads and live simple lives, so they must be accustomed to diligence to be competent. In the past, students at normal schools, except for a few located in rural areas, lacked training in labor. Some schools in cities had very elaborate school buildings, and students lived comfortable lives, inevitably acquiring the atmosphere of urban luxury and extravagance. Graduates of urban normal schools are often unwilling to serve in rural elementary schools. I believe that in the future, all normal schools should be located in rural areas, so that students are constantly in contact with the simple rural environment. School life should focus on labor to cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance, so that they do not regard elementary education as a daunting task. Moreover, in the future, rural elementary schools will have a greater need than urban ones. Locating normal schools in rural areas can allow students to acquire more knowledge of agriculture, increasing the efficiency of serving rural elementary schools.

Increasing Professional Training Time

Teacher training education can be divided into two aspects: general and professional. The former includes reading, writing, arithmetic, physical education, music, manual labor, history, geography, and scientific knowledge. The latter refers to elementary school teaching techniques, the selection and compilation of elementary school teaching materials, and knowledge of education and psychology. In the past, normal schools did not have much problem with general education, but professional training was insufficient, especially the training of elementary school teaching techniques. As a result, after graduating from normal school and serving in elementary schools, students still felt at a loss and groped in the dark. This situation can only be attributed to the inadequacy of normal school professional training and cannot be blamed on normal school graduates. In the future, the final year of normal schools should be devoted entirely to elementary school teaching, administrative internships, and the trial production of teaching materials, so that students not only thoroughly understand the practical work of elementary schools but also truly know how to do it. If increasing professional training affects general education, then it is necessary to extend the duration of normal school studies. (To be continued)

### "The Meaning is Very Ordinary"

— Mao Lie

Perhaps the most important of the five major events during the Lunar New Year holiday was Chairman Chiang's speech at the Third National Political Council. He repeatedly stated that there would be no compromise with Japan and encouraged the people to always put the interests of the nation first and actively resist Japan to save the country. He modestly said that his words were "very ordinary."

In our view, are his words truly ordinary? Of course, he did not present any novel theories to shock people's ears and eyes. In terms of being ordinary, they are indeed ordinary. However, we know that ordinary does not mean unimportant. On the contrary, the most ordinary things in the world are often the most important. Just as water and fire are ordinary, people cannot live a day without them.

In my opinion, Chairman Chiang's decisive statement, on the one hand, reiterated the determination to resist Japan, eliminating the corrupting idea of peace, and on the other hand, reminded the people not to become complacent over time and forget the current difficulties. Although the meaning is commonplace and very ordinary, it is of great significance at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. If everyone can keep it in mind and put it into practice, then the hope of victory can certainly be realized.

In addition to this national affair, the same is true in society and in personal matters: there are many principles that seem very ordinary, and everyone can understand, but their importance far exceeds their superficial ordinariness. For example, consider the principle of frugality. Who doesn't know its theory and practice? But how many people can truly put it into practice, especially during this Lunar New Year holiday? In these past few days, everything we have seen and heard has been in accordance with the principle of frugality? It is no wonder that Chairman Chiang and his wife had to rebroadcast the significance of frugality in saving the country on the radio, and informed people in society did not hesitate to tirelessly and repeatedly appeal to the public.

Now, our leader wants us to unite and resist Japan, and we ourselves are determined to unite and resist Japan. Simply put, there is no grand theory to be found; it lies only in our hard work. If anyone forgets, I hope everyone will remind each other. If anyone is not working hard enough, I hope everyone will urge each other. There is no need to sing high-sounding tunes, and there is no need to worry about whether something is ordinary or not!

### Under the Poplar Tree

— Ya De

As I ran into this alley paved with cobblestones, I saw from afar a poplar tree, more than twenty feet tall, standing straight inside the wall. In the past four years, I have hardly gone a week without seeing this poplar tree, because ever since Little Chen moved into this alley, I have come to visit him every three to five days.

This day, I ran to Little Chen's house as usual, and from afar, I saw that the poplar tree was already shedding its leaves, looking a little haggard. I rang the doorbell at the iron gate.

The iron gate opened, and I ran in. In the courtyard, besides the short and thin Little Chen, there was also a tall man in a blue cloth robe standing under the poplar tree. This tall man had two bright eyes and a fuzzy beard, but it did not hide his youthful appearance.

Little Chen, seeing me staring intently at this unfamiliar guest, smiled and patted my shoulder, introducing him: "Jianren, this is Old Ping, whom I've mentioned to you."

This unfamiliar guest hastily extended his hand, and I mechanically grasped it. Little Chen then spoke to me:

"Old Ping, Jianren is my old classmate. He just came from north of the Yangtze River two days ago... Time really flies. We've been separated for almost eight years now. Looking back on our life eight years ago, it's as if it were yesterday."

Little Chen said ecstatically, and everyone's footsteps slowly moved closer to the poplar tree. The unfamiliar guest used his hand to gently stroke the smooth trunk of the tree.

"Let's go inside the house!" Little Chen pushed us, running forward.

"No," the unfamiliar guest refused, "I love this poplar tree. It's more comfortable for us to stand here. I'm only staying here for two days. After returning to my hometown, no one knows when we'll see each other again."

He said it very naturally, but with some sadness. I wanted to immediately ask him what he was going back to his hometown to do, but I was held back by the silence, and I didn't ask. I only slightly raised my head to look up at this unfamiliar tall man, his eyes gazing at the gray sky, his large hands stroking the trunk of the poplar tree.

"Jianren, what will you do after you return to your hometown?"

Little Chen asked as he took out a cigarette case. We each took one, lit it, and smoked, letting the smoke drift into the sky with the wind.

"Start by training troops." What a loud voice! "I am a person who has escaped death, so I am not afraid of dying... But, for some reason, I fell in love with this poplar tree the moment I saw it. It seems that I am a little reluctant to leave it."

"Ah! You and Old Ping have the same preferences." Little Chen's laughter broke through the solemn atmosphere.

I immediately asked, "What does 'escaped death' mean?"

The one who answered was not Jianren, but Little Chen. He said: "Jianren is a 'quick grower.' When Nanjing was abandoned for strategic reasons, he and more than four hundred other soldiers became prisoners of war. Their hands were tied with thick ropes, and they were collectively shot with machine guns. After that, they were stabbed one by one with knives, and then hand grenades were thrown into the pile of corpses. He slept in the corpses, listening to the blood flowing like a waterfall, smelling the strong smell of blood. He didn't think about his life or death. After a long time, he felt that he was still alive, so he struggled to break free from the thick ropes. With knife wounds on his shoulder, he desperately fled in the wilderness, crossed the enemy's line of defense, endured hunger and cold, and finally arrived safely in a guerrilla area after three full days. Because the flames of war had already ignited in his hometown, he decided to go south and return to his hometown to launch guerrilla warfare."

This story was like a fire, burning in my heart; it was also like a poem, and I felt that every word was very stimulating.

On the evening of the second day, we bought a few pounds of wine and some dishes. The three of us sat under the poplar tree, talking and drinking, as a farewell drink for Jianren. Jianren had a very large capacity for alcohol, pouring one cup after another straight down his throat. The more he drank, the more he talked. For some reason, I felt a very warm feeling. I wanted to hug him and kiss him. I loved his eyes and his fuzzy beard.

The moon had already risen, but it was only a small half-moon, like a banana. Jianren looked at the moon, stretching his neck and saying, "Now our peaceful life has disappeared. It will not be restored until after the victory in the war of resistance and the completion of national reconstruction. How much I love a quiet and peaceful life!"

Jianren's words struck our hearts. I lowered my head and said nothing, but Little Chen stared blankly at him. After a long while, Little Chen said:

"Old Ping, Jianren is leaving tomorrow. We have to go to the dock to see him off."

See him off? What I fear most is seeing friends off on long journeys, especially a beloved friend. I immediately firmly refused Little Chen; but I didn't hide it, I honestly said why I didn't want to see him off. I stood up, ran forward to clasp Jianren's hand tightly, and I murmured, "Friend, it seems that we met by chance and very easily, but parting is a little reluctant. But, can I stop you from returning to your hometown? Impossible, impossible!"

Jianren and Little Chen stared at me in surprise. But I stood by the poplar tree as if I had lost consciousness.

### Fourteen Lines of Poetry

— Shao Sun

Seeing beautiful houses turn to ashes,

Returning swallows cannot find their way home.

Clumps of green grass cover the grave fields,

Where can my cherished loved ones find rest?

Many villages are filled with desolation,

Rabbits roam freely amidst weeds and desolate smoke.

Mud cannot bury the brilliant traces of blood,

The man-eating demon is ferocious everywhere.

Sparse gunfire can be heard in the fields,

The mission of many brave men is being completed.

Every human bomb resists hundreds of artillery shells,

Every head trades for ten enemy soldiers.

This gunfire answers years of accumulated hatred,

Seizing the future's light from scorched earth.

### Shorty: "Old Man, Pass!"

— Dai Cangqi

### Guessing Germany's "New Books"

— Wang Yin

A report from the Haitong News Agency states: Germany published the most new books in the world last year, totaling 25,400 volumes.

This is truly worthy of our envy. However, we cannot help but be surprised that: ever since Germany became Hitler's world, we have only heard of continuous book burnings, and the "quantity" of books destroyed was "the highest in the world." How could they suddenly publish so many books?

Naturally, the news report clearly states that they are publishing "new books." After burning the old ones, they cannot but publish new ones. That's right, very correct. But we can't help but ask: what kind of books are these "new books" that were published in such large quantities in one year?

Although we live far away, we have already learned from telegrams what kind of books Germany burned in the past. Although it has not been specified what kinds of "new books" have been published this time, it is not difficult for us to guess a general idea.

Now, let me make a guess and try to create a statistical table of the types of these 25,400 "new books" as follows:

Praising Hitler and the National Socialist Party: 10,000 volumes

Scolding socialism and the Soviet Union: 5,000 volumes

Calling women back to the kitchen: 1,000 volumes

Claiming that Austria is Germany: 3,000 volumes

Saying that the Czech Republic must be protected by Germany: 3,000 volumes

Pointing out that all Jews are bad guys: 3,000 volumes

Discussing that Ukraine has 500,000 Germans: 400 volumes

Total: 25,400 volumes

I dare say that my table is quite accurate.

But if you still want to ask: what is the "number" of readers of these books? That becomes a difficult question to answer. However, it is still possible to guess a general idea. That is: when the "number" of readers is compared to the "number" of books, the phenomenon must also be "the highest in the world."

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

After repeated arguments, Regiment Commander Ye finally softened a little. Coincidentally, Deputy Regiment Commander Liang and Staff Officer Zhu also came to dissuade him, so he no longer insisted and decided to retreat. However, where to retreat to became quite a problem.

"We have now lost contact with the rear, and the east, north, and south sides are all blocked by the enemy. Only the west side, near Taihu Lake, is a dead end for retreat. My idea is to retreat westward, breaking up the formation and turning the regular army into guerrillas. We should disperse and lie in ambush, control the major towns along the railway line, and at the same time, universally organize the armed forces of the people, and then gradually plan for recovery," Deputy Regiment Commander Liang suggested.

"Fighting guerrilla warfare is certainly our only way out from now on, but we also need to find a base of operations," Staff Officer Zhu said with a hint of reminder.

"Then let's retreat to Hepu Town," Regiment Commander Ye breathed a sigh of relief, "Hepu Town is my hometown. It will be easier to supply the army there. Although the place is a bit remote, it is a good base of operations."

Everyone expressed their agreement. The remaining troops were still slightly less than two battalions, so they ordered the weaker battalion to take on the task of covering the front line and retreating while fighting. The elite battalion, along with weapons and baggage, retreated towards Hepu Town in a forced march.

At that time, Hepu Town was being affected by the changes in the war situation and was in a state of anxiety and panic. The old Shenbao newspaper that was ordered by the township office had not arrived for many days, and everyone could not get accurate news, so they had to inquire from each other. Moreover, there were no outstanding and insightful figures in the town to lead, so everyone had no other way but to be anxious.

Regiment Commander Ye arrived with his troops at this time. It had only been ten days since he left home, but the war situation had undergone major changes upon his return. It was truly "the scenery is the same, but the view is different," which made him feel very emotional. When he was about to reach the town, he ordered the troops to temporarily station outside the town to avoid alarming the people. He himself only went to the township office in the town with Deputy Regiment Commander Liang, Battalion Commander Zhao, and Staff Officer Zhu to visit Town Chief Chen Zhaoqian.

Town Chief Chen saw Regiment Commander Ye and three officers coming together, and he knew that the war situation was not good. He panicked for a while and hurriedly asked, "What is the situation at the front?"

Regiment Commander Ye did not have time to explain to him in detail. He only told him to quickly gather all the people in the town. Town Chief Chen did not dare to delay and hurriedly found the old bronze gong that had been discarded in the dust and ordered the errand boy to knock it outside the door.

"Gong gong gong!" The urgent and loud sound of the bronze gong alarmed all the people in the town. Everyone stopped their work and ran towards the township office. Even Mr. Ye, who did not usually go to the street, slowly strolled over with his water pipe.

"Fangjun," Mr. Ye unexpectedly discovered Regiment Commander Ye in the township office and could not help but call out in surprise. He immediately asked him, "Why are you back? What is the situation at the front?"

Regiment Commander Ye made a gesture to his father, telling him to wait. He saw that more and more people were coming to the township office, so he started to jump onto a stool and speak to them (17)

### Caused by Feverish Speculation: Shanghai's Distorted Prosperity as an Isolated Island, Flourishing in Appearance but Injured Internally

The Motivation for Speculation

All Shanghai exchanges were closed after August 13th due to the war. Speculators suddenly lost their dens of speculation. In peacetime, the daily trading value of the securities and cotton yarn exchanges alone was tens of millions of yuan each. Since losing their speculative targets, large amounts of national currency flowed abroad. From the perspective of speculators, this was merely a shift in target objects, but it was still the same speculative style. However, the impact on the country was significant. Their patriotic sentiments were weak, far outweighed by their desire for profit. Observing the fundamental causes, those who were overly sensitive to foreigners feared that the country's wartime financial resources might be insufficient. Thus, the speculation in foreign exchange became rampant.

Foreign Exchange Speculation

The psychology of speculators in foreign exchange was driven by two factors. First, those who were generally close to foreigners were overly sensitive and apprehensive about the weakening of the nation's wartime finances, leading to inflation or a drop in the market value of national currency. In a single shift, their assets would be protected by changing nationality. At the same time, observing the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates was also conducive to bullish bets. Second, merchants of foreign goods made advance stockpiles. Superficially, this was to guard against losses from exchange rate fluctuations, but in reality, it also contained the same large amount of speculation as the first factor. The rest, such as selling off and arbitrage between currencies of various countries, was equivalent to speculative trading on the exchange. The government then supplied an unlimited amount of foreign exchange to those who needed it, but then restricted it due to the large outflow of national currency. This led to a significant discrepancy in the exchange rates of the same currency between Chinese and foreign banks.

Western Medicine Merchants and the Financial Sector

Since the internal shift of the Shanghai war, Shanghai had become an isolated island. Western medicine merchants, seeing the prolongation of the war, and those with strong capital, rushed to order various medicines from abroad that China did not have but desperately needed. This was done to prepare for shortages and price increases, which would incur losses, as a preemptive measure. This kind of profit, on the one hand, was convenient for patients, and on the other hand, avoided miscalculations in business. Moreover, they gained unexpectedly huge surpluses on exchange rates. During this period, the financial sector saw a massive increase in deposits in various banks due to the gathering of the landed class in Shanghai. These idle funds, in this extraordinary period, had no proper way to be fully utilized to generate profits. Apart from a small portion being used for industry and commercial sector, the majority was tied up in foreign exchange. The amount and surplus depended on their financial strength and vision. Thus, the more profitable ones earned tens of millions in a year, while general small banks, due to a lack of creditworthiness to absorb deposits, not only could not obtain this unexpected profit but were also in danger of collapse. The benefits obtained by other private individuals from foreign exchange are not included in these numbers.

Gold and Currency

Before August 13th, the gold price per bar was eight or nine hundred yuan higher than the current gold price. Before August 13th, the price of foreign banknotes and coins was different from the present, and the increase differed by seventy or eighty percent. The sharp rise was nothing but due to the storage of the landed class. The fervor of speculation was no less than that of foreign exchange. However, one often only had a numerical representation on the contract, while the other was a spot transaction. The common people, however, not only did not enjoy this slightest of rights, but were indirectly harmed by the increase in commodity prices. Those with long sleeves dance well, and are also good at seizing the opportunity.

Government Bonds and Cotton Yarn

Although the government bond and cotton yarn markets were suspended after August 13th, their grey market trading gradually sprouted and expanded after the war shifted inland. From irregular, they gradually became regular. Although the amount of trading, restricted by cash, was not as large as when the market was open, it was still considerable. The fluctuation of numbers was about 50-60% of the market price for government bonds and about 40-50% for cotton yarn. The fluctuation of flannel was smaller. This kind of spot speculation or hoarding was mostly superior for those who ran cotton yarn than for government bonds. However, the speculation was mostly done by those who were familiar with this path, each buying and selling according to their inherent vision. However, the scope had already shrunk, and outsiders rarely made a living in this. Therefore, the various yarn factories, because their strength had not been completely destroyed, and those who were able to resume operations, their profits were also far beyond the expectations of ordinary people (see separate article on the cotton yarn industry).

Metals and Building Materials

Due to the war and the difficulty of supply, the price increase of metals was staggering. Green bell, due to special needs and the most felt shortage of goods, the market price gradually soared, and even rose to more than 1,000%, and it was still not easy to get the goods (those who enjoy this kind of right were mostly in the industry and finance sector). The other kinds all varied according to the urgency of their needs, but at least they also rose by 50%. Building materials, with various copper frames, were mostly hoarded by the merchants in the industry, willing to reject customers in order to wait for a good price. Therefore, general ordinary builders often could not obtain the copper frames they needed and could not expand their business. Second, various kinds of wood, the most common of which was western pine, was also not easy to obtain in large quantities. In addition, bricks, tiles, cement, etc., also enjoyed particularly developed businesses due to the rise of new construction. Even transporting broken bricks and tiles from the occupied areas around Shanghai could fetch a good price.

Hotels and Second Landlords

Before August 13th, the hotel industry invariably used price reduction advertisements as a call to action. At the beginning of the war, small hotels were closing or being sold everywhere. After the war shifted inland, the population of Shanghai increased dramatically, and all the hotels were full, and some even secretly increased prices. Some who had a small amount of capital and rented small hotels made profits ranging from one to three times a year. Second landlords who were good at planning, a building or two, could accommodate seven or eight or more tenants in the most common cases. In addition to the second landlord's own residence, they could obtain tens or one or two hundred yuan in unexpected income per month, and the second landlord could still maintain the good name of enthusiastically regulating the housing problems of the general public. Those who had their own houses, the total amount for all tenants ranged from a few hundred yuan to several thousand yuan, for a one-time unexpected irregular gain.

Restaurants and Snack Food Stores

The prosperity of the restaurant business is enough to make one feel sad. In this extraordinary period, more than half of the four million people in Shanghai must be unemployed. Although most people have jobs, most of them can only barely make a living in this high cost of living, and some even do not know what the next day will bring. It would be fitting that this kind of restaurant business should decrease rather than increase. Unexpectedly, what no one expected was that not only did it not decrease, but the increase was even more impressive than before August 13th. Restaurants from various places in the interior that usually had a slight reputation all sought houses for business in the British and French concessions at high prices, dotted all over the place, with no less than a hundred or ten new ones. Most of them were tripling profits, and some even made more than 100,000 yuan in profits in a year. The number of other tea houses and scattered food stores also increased dramatically, and the business was also booming. Among them, tea houses were the most popular. Several large tea houses, such as so-and-so, were always full from morning to night.

The above are just the obvious and eye-catching large examples. The remaining industries, such as silk, tea, fur, and fuel, which are not very necessary, although they also have considerable profits, are not as eye-catching. Even more, the purchase of jewelry at reduced prices and the unclear sources of old goods merchants, their speculative methods are even more despicable and cannot be taken as a model. Those with much wealth are good at buying and selling, and are also good at taking advantage of the deformed development of opportunities. However, the sources of these various profits, a small number come from the supply of the inland landed class, and the majority are the losses suffered by the government. To sum up, the biggest reasons are nothing more than the dramatic increase in population and the extreme shortage of foreign exchange (Kui Wei Sheng).

### Securities: The Digestion of Wartime Government Bonds

When a country's finances feel that its regular income and economic strength are insufficient due to various special equipment and improvements, issuing government bonds to supplement financial deficits is the most economically sound principle. Because it takes from the people and uses it for the people, there is absolutely no harm in the outflow of rights and interests. Compared to increasing taxes or issuing more banknotes, it is safer and faster. However, the amount of government bonds issued cannot be inexhaustible according to the principle of measuring income and expenditure in national finances. How is the country's source of profit? How is the people's wealth? Beforehand, a careful investigation must be conducted, with the condition precedent that it does not harm the people's livelihood and the development of industry and commerce. Within the scope of possibility, issuing an appropriate amount of government bonds to subsidize the country's legitimate financial needs, then its digestion will surely be twice the result with half the effort.

Since the issuance of government bonds in our country since the beginning of the Republic of China, until the reorganization and unification in the 25th year, including the 340 million yuan of recovery bonds issued at the same time, the total is no more than 1800 million yuan (of which the 400 million yuan of the five types of government bonds issued in the 20th year of the Republic of China was the largest). Calculated according to the national population ratio, each person's burden is only 4 yuan. Since August 13th, due to the special needs of the war, as of the end of the 27th year, the government bonds that have been issued are of the following four types:

(A) 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds in the 26th year

(B) Gold bonds in the 27th year, divided into (1) 100 million yuan of customs gold, (2) 50 million US dollars, (3) 10 million pounds sterling, totaling about 550 million yuan in national currency

(C) 500 million yuan of national defense bonds in the 27th year

(D) 100 million yuan of relief bonds in the 27th year

The total amount of the above four types of government bonds is 1.65 billion yuan. In a fiscal year, the amount of government bonds issued is so large, which is certainly a shocking initiative. However, after detailed analysis, it can be known that the number is still limited. For example, the gold bonds in the 27th year are calculated in foreign currency and are not included in the list of domestic government bonds. The national salvation bonds in the 26th year are the people's enthusiastic donations, that is, the people's voluntary national salvation donations. The government is the passive Voltaire national salvation bonds to accept the people's free donations. Therefore, a large part of the matured coupons of the national salvation bonds in the 27th year are still transferred to the government to express their original intention of national salvation donations. Therefore, the above two types of bonds must not be fully included in the scope of domestic government bond issuance. After this analysis, it can be known that in the one and a half years since the War of Resistance, the true domestic government bonds issued are only 600 million yuan, adding the previously issued 1.8 billion yuan, totaling 2.4 billion yuan. The amount borne by the people is only 6 yuan per person. Even including the above two bonds, the amount borne by each person is still only 9 yuan, compared to Japan, with a population of 77 million and a government bond amount of 1.5 billion yuan, with each person bearing 200 yuan in government bonds, which is only slightly less than one-twentieth of it. Assuming that we estimate our national strength at the lowest limit, only one-tenth of Japan's, it can be known that the people of our country still have a government bond digestion capacity of 400-500 million yuan. The people's digestion capacity for government bonds is closely related to their faith in government bonds. To observe the people's faith in government bonds, it can be measured by the rise and fall of the market price of government bonds in the securities market. The following table lists the statistics since August 13th.

### Comparison Table of High and Low Prices Before and After the Suspension of the Unified Government Bonds and Major Records of the Causes

Looking at the table on the right, it is nothing less than a thermometer of the people's faith in government bonds. The major reasons for the high price of government bonds in the table are nothing more than faith in the final victory of the War of Resistance and the sympathy of countries such as Britain and the United States for our country. Based on the above two basic beliefs, it can be known that the people have extremely strong digestion power for government bonds. The results obtained from this measurement have a very significant impact on politics and economics (Nine).

### Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Industry: Unprecedented Profits: How Wonderful This Time

The prosperity and development of the cotton yarn industry in the 27th year can be described as unprecedented profits in history, far exceeding the golden age of the European War. All yarn firms and cotton firms can be said to have made money, and everyone had a full pocket. As for the abundance of profits for yarn factories, it is surprising, mostly between six and seven million yuan, (omitted). Therefore, some yarn factories have cleared their bank mortgages, earned back their self-management, and are not subject to any creditor restrictions. The following is a brief description of the booming situation of the cotton yarn industry last year and the profit situation of various parties.

(1) The price of yarn was extremely sluggish in the first half of the year. In the autumn, due to the consistent stance of the War of Resistance, people's hearts were firm and high. The population of the interior gathered in Shanghai, and the Xunhan yarn factories were dismantled and moved to Sichuan. The needs of the interior were all concentrated in Shanghai.

(2) Most of the yarn factories in Shanghai, in the areas invaded by the Japanese army, were destroyed by artillery fire and could not work. Even if they could work, they were operated by the Japanese. Only the Chinese-owned yarn factories in the special zone were still able to work as usual. However, the amount of yarn produced was less than 1,000 bales per day. How could such a small number meet the general demand? The adjustment was uneven, and the market showed a state of demand exceeding supply. As a result, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and West Guangdong were short of goods, and the market price soared step by step. Therefore, the price of a bale of yarn in Sichuan soared to more than 1,000 yuan.

(3) The general wealthy, in view of the above situation, the idea of ​​searching and hoarding arose spontaneously. The brokers of the exchange had been idle for more than a year, and they were eager to move after being still. Therefore, they gathered funds to form new cotton yarn firms like mushrooms after a rain. As soon as they entered the market, they immediately dragged in, so the chips in the market felt even more scarce, and the market situation went straight ahead, with new peaks emerging one after another.

(4) The Japanese army invaded Guangdong, and Hankou was abandoned again. The main area for cotton yarn sales in South China was lost, and it was hit hard. For a time, it seemed like a torrent of water pouring down, falling to 318 yuan. However, after the price plummeted, the real demand gradually improved. Although Guangzhou fell, the only transportation line to the interior, the Guangjiu Yuehan transportation line, was cut off. However, since the completion of the transportation from the sea defense to Kunming and from there to Chongqing was completed, the agility of transportation was far from what it used to be. The southwest demand increased, and Minnan also came to purchase, and the transportation to Chongqing was not what it used to be. This southwest need increased, and Southern Fujian also came to purchase, and the troops solidified the business in Jiangxi Province, and the Hakka gathered, and eastern Zhejiang purchased, and transported to the rear, and cotton cloth and cotton yarn were especially prosperous, and the market, which had been in decline for a long time, gradually showed signs of recovery. By the end of the year, due to the easing of bank finance, the purchase was even more intense. At the same time, the consumption increased in the southern corner, and the yarn price rose again to more than 400 yuan. Therefore, the yarn industry was uniformly profitable and generous. According to the market, the most yarn firms had 500,000 yuan, 100,000, and 200,000 yuan, and most had 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

(5) To reiterate the situation of cotton, first of all, it was not as good as the yarn market. However, since autumn, although the US-Indian cotton market has fallen one after another, after the "Japanese puppets" implemented control in this port, the inland heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes blocked the source, and the long-term arrival of goods was depleted and slack, and the rising wind was actively advancing. New high prices were created endlessly, and fire machine flowers rose to more than 70 yuan, which is also a new record for the flower industry. Therefore, the flower firms with a little inventory in the first half of the year, spring and summer, all made great profits. The household with the largest profit for the flower firm was more than 700,000 yuan, the middle one was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and there were also several that were just so-so. It can be called a year of fortune for the cotton industry, but it is also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I hope to continue to regenerate in the coming year (Yuan).

### Last Year's Spot Yarn Transaction Situation and Its High and Low Prices

The actual sales of spot yarn, the total transaction volume in all aspects throughout the year was 190,148 bales, but among them, the transaction volume of hoarders and fellow traders accounted for more than 50%. The most popular, of course, were those in the southwestern non-war zone. The yarn sales within the war zone had been almost completely seized by Japanese yarn. In addition, an investigation of last year's transaction situation showed that the transaction in January and February was the smallest period. After March, it gradually improved with the good situation. The transaction in June had seen an increase. The business in September and December was the most prosperous period of the year. The transaction in mid-October, due to the outrageous price increase and the change of color in Guangzhou, the transaction dropped sharply, a sharp reduction of more than 80% compared with September. Then the price was low, and the north-south war situation was smooth, and it was increasing day by day. The transaction in December was very prosperous, reaching 30,378 bales, which was the largest amount of transaction this year. The following table lists the quantity of transactions in twelve months (unit: bales).

The highest and lowest prices since one year and the price before the holiday are compared as follows for reference.

### Talking About the Shanghai Woolen Industry from a Historical Perspective

— Zhifeng

Shanghai's woolen industry is the pioneer of the whole of China. At that time, the provinces purchased woolens, and they had to purchase them from Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai's woolen industry is nothing less than the general hub of the national woolen industry. However, there were no formal woolen shops in the Tongzhi period of the former Qing Dynasty. Most of them were brought to China by Westerners for making clothes. Later, the Louis Smore Auction House began to transport a small number of woolens for sale. Because at that time, Shanghai's population and transportation construction, commercial prosperity, were far less than nine-tenths of what they are now. In addition, at that time, most of the money was used, and the standard of living was very low, and woolens had to be sold in silver. Our people did not know the advantages of woolens, thinking that they could only be used by Westerners for clothing. Therefore, there was very little use. By the 28th year of Guangxu, because of the Boxer Rebellion, many people from all over the country came to Shanghai, and an edict was issued to change the law, implement new policies, open schools, and send students abroad. The Shanghai Concession continued to release roads, and the market gradually prospered. Westerners from Europe and the United States also came to Shanghai to open foreign firms. The diplomatic relations were cordial, and merchants gathered. The woolen industry emerged in this era of restoration.

Two or three years before the founding of the Republic of China, woolens became popular among fashionable people because they imitated Europe and the West. Especially people in the academic community, took it for its softness, warmth, wear resistance and non-creasing, suitable for weddings and funerals, men, women, old and young, often wore it as guests, and they were quite generous, unlike silk and satin, which had a rich and noble atmosphere. At the same time, wearing a suit was noble, and the young bosses of foreign firms, that is, the wealthy students studying abroad, expanded the sales. The number of woolen shops on Bai Xing Road and Peng Road increased greatly. In the first year of the Republic of China, the decree to change the clothing system opened up an exclusive market for woolens. Every firm in the industry made thousands or tens of thousands of profits. Therefore, newly opened and branch shops sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, creating a woolen market in the Hongkou district. This time can be said to be the pioneering era of the woolen industry.

As the Shanghai woolen trade developed steadily and the number of people in suits increased day by day, Western clothing tailor shops stood in large numbers, and the overcoat business suddenly flourished. The profits from the business of the U.S. Navy ships were great. The number of woolen shops increased every year, but they were only for Western clothing. Therefore, their business was not yet common. The goods they sold were all double-width, which were not suitable for making Chinese clothing. Therefore, the people in the industry specially set up a special retail store in Qipan Street, selling Chinese clothing materials, marking the price per foot. Its business was very developed. In addition, wholesale shops were opened, distributed in Tao Zhuli, Jingxingli, Wufunong, Xiangfen Lane, Jifuli, Pintang Alley and other places. The woolen sales market seized the position of silk and satin and replaced it. Biji woolen long robes were everywhere. Foreign firms from England, the United States, France, Poland, Germany and Italy also came to Shanghai to open shops at the same time, and transported spot goods for sale. At this time, Chinese camel wool robes were popular throughout Shanghai. On rainy days, a raincoat was worn. This trend flowed into the interior, and the Hakka also came to Shanghai to set up villages to purchase woolens. Therefore, woolen sales markets for both Chinese and Western clothing were available. By then, the industry was also divided into two factions: (1) the Hongkou unpacking gang, (2) the Shanghai Dalubang.

During the European War, the British exchange rate reached eight or nine shillings, and the gold decoration in silver shops was exchanged for 24 yuan per tael. Many of the Hongkou unpacking shops and the booking gang suffered losses. Within one or two years, more than half of them closed down one after another. The Hongkou woolen market almost declined. After this trend passed, most of those who reopened moved to Qipan Street. The woolen shops in Qipan Street gathered more and more, although they closed down from time to time, they closed and opened, and the store base was never empty. The Dalubang promoted Chinese clothing materials in addition to door-to-door sales, and most of them also operated Western clothing sets. The only difference was the samples. In this way, every year the sales increased by one year. The northern gang, the Sichuan gang, the Guangdong-Fujian gang, and the Dalian gang successively expanded their purchase of woolens. The woolen industry in Shanghai was prosperous, and the strength of the Qipan Street woolen gang surpassed the Hongkou gang. The Woolen Industry Association also moved from Xia Hai to Shanghai. This time can be said to be the era of recovery after the European War.

In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was unified, and the capital was established in Nanjing. Sun Yat-sen's suit was popular. At the same time, people from military, political, academic, and business circles specially increased the number of people wearing suits. Most of those wearing Chinese clothes also used woolen products. Cities and villages had a large number of purchases. The number of brokers and street runners suddenly increased. Qipan Street almost became a large woolen market. Because of the many shops, complete colors, fair prices, and friendly hospitality, it was more convenient to choose, evaluate each other, Shanghai's general foreign goods stores and silk and satin stores mostly also sold woolens in order to facilitate customers' purchases. If it were not so, the business would be hit. It can be called the prosperous era of the woolen industry.

The woolen gang on Qipan Street can now represent the entire Shanghai woolen market. In addition to purchasing high-end and excellent woolens from unpacking shops to get samples, ordinary people need Chinese and Western clothing materials, and they all come to Qipan Street to choose and purchase. Among them, except for three or five that are really not two prices, most of them have to bargain to get real cheap goods. The shops often hold large discounts during the peak sales period in spring and autumn. In the afternoon, each store has the hard work of not being able to entertain. It is even worse on Sundays. The 27th year was even more lively, which shows that the population of various roads in the isolated island is concentrated, and the expansion of consumption is also unexpected by the woolen industry in the 26th year.

In the era of commercial warfare, the woolen industry also competed with each other to attract customers. Among them, the sales of woolen products can also be divided into three periods: (1) In the initial pioneering era, British goods accounted for the top spot, (2) In the recovery era, French, German, American, Italian and Polish goods were in high demand. Although British goods still accounted for the top spot, there was a great shake, (3) In the prosperous era, our country's products were successively born, struggling to sell well, unfortunately, inferior goods were dumped, and they were hit a lot. In recent years, the domestic woolen factories, buyers and sellers, have adhered to the uncompromising tenet, always firmly believed in the highest industry association, and tried their best to promote sales. With a fearless spirit, they repelled inferior goods and tenaciously fought a protracted war. The final victory must belong to us.

### Finance: Little Change in the Exchange Market at the End of the Year

On February 18 (last Saturday), the exchange market only traded for half a day. The market was calm and stagnant, completely filled with pre-holiday atmosphere. Initially, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 125 for British gold and 15.875 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was longer by 1 centime and 1875 for the British and American exchange rates compared with the previous closing British average US loose 03125, After opening, foreign firms and foreign banks settled. However, telegrams from Hong Kong and other places were sold to be favorable (on behalf of a bank in North China). Chase Holland shillings 8 pence 125. Another US dollar of 15.875 yuan was issued. After the US bank absorbed it, it resold it to foreign firms for 15.8125 yuan. Therefore, it was once hard to shillings 8 pence 140625. US exchange rate of 15.90625 yuan, both can be settled. Although Hong Kong exchange rate, foreign banks and Anda absorbed, but the money exchange industry also had good selling intentions, so the situation was not much changed. At noon, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 125 for British gold and 15.875 yuan for the US exchange rate. As a result, the previous closing British average US was loose 03125. The Hong Kong exchange rate was neither honored nor disgraced, and it was still 54.375 yuan. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

### During the Winter Vacation, There Were No Transactions in the Gold Market. There Were Only Buyers and No Sellers

On February 18 (Saturday), the gold market was closed due to the winter vacation. Only a few members came to the market to buy and sell, so the Hong Kong gang had no way to search for purchases. At the same time, the buyers wanted to purchase at about 20823 yuan, but the sellers were reluctant to move forward, so there was no transaction. The gold decoration in silver shops was not changed, and the old firm, such as Lao Qingyun, still hung the original price of 211 yuan. The new firm also still hung 209 yuan, and received 203 yuan.

### Import and Export: Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives in Shanghai - Totalling 22,900 Bales

During the Lunar New Year, a large batch of Indian cotton was shipped here, totaling over 6,000 tons, or 22,900 bales. It was shipped yesterday on the British ship "Bateman" (transliteration) from Calcutta, purchased by Japanese merchants. Yesterday, a British ship departed for Europe, carrying 133 bales of Huzhou silk and 60 tons of tea. Miscellaneous goods such as beans were few in number due to the New Year holiday. The export of Ningbo cotton has been approved. We hear that a large batch is arriving today. The exact number is pending investigation. (Year)

### Welcoming the God of Wealth

— Lishi

The purpose of welcoming the God of Wealth is entirely selfish. Therefore, some people consider this behavior not only ridiculously superstitious but also shamefully foolish. However, the business community's welcoming of the God of Wealth contains another layer of meaning. Originally, a year's business operations are meant to start on this day of the God of Wealth, after this kind of ceremony. Therefore, stores and businesses take the ceremony of welcoming the God of Wealth very seriously, and the rituals are also very solemn. On the late night of the fourth day of the old Lunar New Year, on the one hand, the list of attendees for the worship is drawn up, which determines personnel changes. On the other hand, they discuss the business situation of the past year and future strategies, announcing new goals. Because of this, the practice of welcoming the God of Wealth continues to thrive in the business world.

According to news from various sources, the final reports of the business community in this city for the last period all show profits. The best performing was the yarn industry, with some earning five or six million; the piece goods industry certainly earned over a million; other industries varied, with tens of thousands or fifty thousands, all looking better compared to previous years. Tonight, welcoming the God of Wealth will naturally be even happier and more enthusiastic than before, and the display will certainly be more extravagant and noisier, hoping to receive the blessing of the God of Wealth to protect their industry and business, to make it even more prosperous and profitable. However, we feel that the reason why the isolated island's business community was able to make a profit last year was not the blessing of the God of Wealth, but the grace of the God of War. If it were not for the God of War driving the population of the mainland to gather here and devastating the mainland's production, there would not be such an abnormally prosperous situation today. Precisely because of this, the essence of this prosperity is very fragile and very illusory, and this superficial prosperity still conceals the crisis of the isolated island's business community's future. It is like a person after an illness; although the body is fat, it is swollen, not truly strong. The evolution of edema is very dangerous.

If the ceremony of welcoming the God of Wealth is truly the time to decide on new business strategies, then we hope that business people will no longer be attached to this isolated island with its polluted air and dark surroundings, and should plan to invest in the mainland to develop our infinite wealth. They must understand that when the situation of the isolated island is no longer isolated, the current false prosperity will wither away, and besides, devils surround us, seizing and exploiting at will, which will be an unavoidable calamity!

### Xiang Yu, the Conqueror

— Li Zhihua

Historical films are not reproductions of historical records, so slight adaptations are permissible, and sometimes even necessary. But this "permissible" or "necessary" should be based on a new historical perspective, using it selectively and critically. Otherwise, it will be like putting a cow's head on a horse's body, turning it into a case of gilding the lily or making a tiger resemble a dog, which would be a joke.

Therefore, the difficulty of historical films (so-called "period dramas") lies not only in the research of costumes and props and the grand scale of the scenes but also in the viewpoint of the creators. There will inevitably be the creator's subjectivity, and therefore there can be no ambiguity. The news editor should be the most "objective," but in the size of the headline and the prominence of the position, he still cannot escape his likes and dislikes and the reflection of his awareness of a certain piece of news. As an art form, can a film truly be detached and become a "third person"?

Therefore, our basic attitude toward the production of historical films is not so much the issue of how faithful to historical facts, but rather how to critically accept the lessons of history from the standpoint of the Chinese people today.

Director Wang Yuanlong has made it very clear about the theme of "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror": "Because we want to make the story conform to modern trends, we use Xiang Yu and Liu Bang as examples. One is a warmonger and militarist, while the other advocates peace and benevolence. As a result, the former failed and the latter succeeded. This is the theme of 'Xiang Yu, the Conqueror.'"

"Warmongering and militarism" and "benevolence and peace" are aimed at the current situation in China and also at the current world situation. "The benevolent prosper, the hegemon perishes," is originally an unchanging truth, but on the issue of "advocating war" and "advocating peace," we still need to add a precise annotation. Otherwise, Yue Fei, who "advocated war," became a villain for all time, while Qin Hui, who "advocated peace," became a hero for eternity. At a time when the likes of Jingwei use selling out the country as an excuse for "peace," and Eastern fascists with mouths full of "benevolent governance" who advocate war cannot step down, and many hope for "peace" to protect their loot, simply talking about "advocating war" and "advocating peace" in terms of words alone is truly in danger of becoming the "tail" of the aggressors. I imagine that the original intention of the filmmakers would not be like this.

Therefore, regarding "peace" and "war," we should really look at it further.

After the Eastern fascists' "punitive expeditions" failed and their "purge" became hopeless, the new policy they implemented in Jiangnan was a policy of appeasement, which is to buy people's hearts. The so-called policy of appeasement, when exposed, is actually not worth half a cent. On the one hand, they instigate Han traitors to collect exorbitant taxes and levies, using both soft and hard tactics to gather grain and other supplies, and then, they come forward to transport some of the grain from area A to area B for "relief," pretending to be a "righteous army." This kind of trickery is seemingly the ultimate in "benevolence and peace," but in reality... anyway, very few people will know about this trick.

And is this kind of "benevolence and peace" really "benevolence and peace"?

"Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" uses the "victory of benevolence and peace" and the "failure of warmongering and militarism" as its theme, which is originally very good. But the regret lies precisely here: it only talks about the surface and does not make a further dissection, and this is not enough.

We sympathize with the filmmakers' painstaking efforts, and we admire such a solemn theme, but at the same time, precisely because of this time and place, we cannot help but demand perfection to prevent misinterpretations. -- If such a play were to be publicly shown in the occupied areas, then such defects should be prevented even more.

Regarding this point, I would like to use an example to discuss it:

"Xiang Yu advanced into Xianyang, ignoring the advice of the crowd, killed the Qin Prince Ziying, and slaughtered tens of thousands of people in Xianyang." After that, there is a scene on the screen of a woman from the people plotting to enter Xiang Yu's tent to assassinate the conqueror. This scene is very important, and what the woman from the people said is even more worthy of our attention. She said: "After the people overthrew the King of Qin, what they hoped for was an army of benevolence and peace, but who knew that as soon as the conqueror arrived in Xianyang, he slaughtered countless people... so the families of those killed formed an alliance, forged daggers, and sent her into the tent to plot the assassination, to avenge the people who were killed..." (roughly like this). This scene, in terms of the "theme," certainly fits the "theme" and shows that the people cannot be underestimated. However, in our view, we feel that such a "theme" still needs to be clearly indicated. First, we should correctly and clearly indicate who the enemy of the people is. Second, we must fix the enemy, so as not to mistakenly regard the brutal and cruel enemy as an army of benevolence and peace and place hopes of affection on them. In this situation, we can only emphasize the "theme" from the standpoint of the Chinese people today to warn the vacillating, compromising, and backward people. If this theme is not clearly expressed, it may lead to many regrets.

Unfortunately, "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" did not do it clearly and one hundred percent.

In other aspects, in terms of script writing and the director's handling, it seems that because too much emphasis was placed on a few major scenes, the transitional scenes were neglected, so that people have the feeling of watching a Beijing opera-like "Complete Story of the Chu-Han Contention," forming a continuous feeling of old plays one after another. This is certainly because there is too much historical material and it is not easy to handle, but it is also because the playwright focused too much on the individual courage of the conqueror. History is not created by individuals; too much emphasis on the individual and neglecting his environment and evolution is also a dangerous thing.

Perhaps this is because the playwright was influenced by Beijing opera (the difficulty of filming period dramas is also how to jump out of the influence of Beijing opera), so in the division of scenes, it unconsciously created this situation, and the same is true in the writing of dialogue and the actors' movements and lines.

Wang Yuanlong's Xiang Yu is admirable in his roughness, but his heroic spirit of uprooting mountains is still not enough, especially his heroic posture on horseback, because his physique is not good enough to portray this great hero of an era. Jin Suqin's Yu Ji has few scenes, and perhaps because it is her first time on camera, she is not amazing. Several others also seem to have questionable qualities.

The most commendable thing about this play is the grandeur of the scenes. From this point of view, it can be seen that no expense was spared, but because the enemy and ourselves are not clearly distinguished enough, so although a lot of money was spent, we still cannot feel very satisfied.

Filming period dramas has its special advantages, which lie in using the past to warn the present, and from the perspective of the Chinese people at this time and place, "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" is not enough to make people feel satisfied.

### Happy News

— Mo Dian

I received your letter on New Year's Eve. The traditional Lunar New Year in Shanghai is busier than the Gregorian New Year; it hasn't changed after being called an "isolated island"; perhaps even more so. According to reports, all industries have had large surpluses; you can imagine the prosperous state of Shanghai after two years of separation. But old friends remain the same; my writing income is not enough to support my family. On New Year's Eve, I was still struggling with urgent matters, aimlessly running around, and almost took the "Hong Kong tram" to welcome the God of Happiness, going to the police station to "stay up all night."

This is naturally just my personal matter and has nothing to do with New Year's Eve.

The shops on Nanjing Road have extended their business hours, and the crowds in the candy shops are daunting; just after eight o'clock, the movie theaters have already posted "Sold Out" signs; the dance halls are naturally packed; crowds of people stand on the streets. I wonder, what are they watching?

Back home, there is the sound of mahjong everywhere, which seems to be a necessary decoration for "passing the New Year."

Forgive me for being unsophisticated; perhaps because I'm poor, I take the opportunity to stretch out and fall asleep in bed; this is still considered fortunate compared to you.

When I woke up on the first day of the New Year, the first sound that entered my ears was still the sound of mahjong. I don't know if they played all night or if they had special early showings like movie theaters? In short, this spirit is admirable!

But the weather is not good; it's raining. I could have rested for a day, but there were still some unfinished matters to clarify with a friend from the other night. My family didn't prepare glutinous rice balls or lotus seeds, so I left the house on an empty stomach as usual.

I ran into the landlady in the kitchen. She was lighting incense and candles, worshiping the Buddha. When she saw me, she smiled a rare smile and wished me a happy new year, asking if I was visiting relatives. I didn't know how to answer her; I probably just nodded as a greeting. If there is any happy news this year, it will be her rare smile.

I had lunch at my friend's house. My friend's wife wanted to go to the movies and invited me to go with them. Because we are close friends, they often treat me, so I honestly went along. But strangely enough, both movie theaters we went to were "Sold Out," and tickets for the 5:30 show were not available; you had to plan to watch the 9:00 movie at 2:00 in the afternoon. We don't have that kind of leisurely temperament. It was raining again, so I said goodbye to my friend and left.

It's rare to have a day off, but it feels too empty. Should I go home? It's too disappointing to spend the first day of the New Year in such a cold and lonely place. So, I wandered in the rain like a ghost, unable to make up my mind.

Originally, although I don't have any relatives in Shanghai, I have many friends, but they wouldn't be as idle as me. People with families have to visit various places, and even if I could find a kindred spirit by chance, it wouldn't be right to go and chat on a rainy day on the first day of the New Year. Fortunately, I suddenly had an idea. I bought a newspaper and sat down in the lobby of a newly opened movie theater. There were water fountain facilities and comfortable sofas. I lit a cigarette and looked at the newspaper and the dull film, as if waiting for a lover... I slipped out when the 5:30 movie started, because the doorman in the royal uniform seemed to be paying attention to me.

By this time, the street lights were on, but the streets were very quiet. I found a small restaurant on Edinburgh Road that was still open, so I squeezed in and sat with those "friends" wearing crooked hats, ordered some wine, had a hearty meal, and then collapsed on the bed again when I got home.

I have told you frankly how I spent this New Year, although I haven't described my state of mind, but old friends can easily guess from between the lines.

Today I went back to work as usual and felt refreshed; I guess I was just born to be poor! However, I feel that people really have to "work." People like you would never let these few days go to waste, and in your group, you not only "work" on the things at hand, but also desperately find things to "work" on.

If there is any happy news this year, it will definitely come from you.

### After the Rain, Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 4: Tracing the Past, Le Tian Conveys Wonderful Words; Forming New Friendships, a Pleasant Trip to a Scenic Spot

The second piece of domestic news was also very unique. It was that China and the Soviet Union had agreed to a trade agreement in which China would exchange tea worth 50 million yuan with the Soviet Union for kerosene of the same value each year. This "barter" method was popular in primitive times. It is the so-called exchanging what you have for what you don't have, which initially occurred between individuals. For example, if you have cloth and I have rice, I would exchange rice for your cloth. Conversely, if you want something else, you can also exchange it with people; that is the beginning of trade. Unexpectedly, this barter system has now become popular internationally. Because China has also mined several kerosene mines in recent years, the actual demand is huge. It is simply impossible to rely solely on domestically produced kerosene. According to the current situation, 30% is from domestically produced kerosene, 40% is from American kerosene, and 30% is still lacking, so we must use Soviet-produced kerosene. Fortunately, Chinese tea is also exported to the Soviet Union in large quantities, so this exchange agreement was signed. Others didn't care when they heard this news, but the He sisters paid attention. They thought: This was announced after Father went to Beiping. He had already made contact when Father was in Shanghai; that was also one of the many events after their father went north. At this time, Liyu looked at Shuangyu, and Shuangyu also nodded. Everyone understood, but it was not convenient to say it out loud. In addition to these two pieces of domestic news, which were relatively important, the rest were very trivial. After reporting the domestic news, they reported international news. The important international news was that the Third Disarmament Conference would be held on January 10th next year. Hasn't the Disarmament Conference been going on for twenty or thirty years? In the past, there was a Disarmament Conference this way and a Disarmament Conference that way. This year there is a Disarmament Conference, and next year there is a Disarmament Conference. After opening and opening, as a result, the Disarmament Conference has become an Arms Expansion Conference. This time, it is a real Disarmament Conference. The countries have had a drink together and said everything is open. What can't be overcome? Therefore, on January 10, 1952, the Third Disarmament Conference will be held in Washington, D.C. The first thing is that no country is allowed to manufacture bomber aircraft anymore. All previous military aircraft will be converted for civilian use. Those that cannot be converted for civilian use will be destroyed. Also, those who manufacture poison gas bombs, no matter how much of a chemical doctor or inventor you are, if you produce that kind of poison gas that harms humanity from now on, you will be publicly recognized as a criminal of the world, and you can be detained wherever you go.

### Xin Yanqiu Sacrifices Herself for the Country

— Mu Yun

Reuter's News Agency, Peiping, 20th: According to reliable Chinese sources, the female actress Xin Yanqiu (transliteration) attempted to assassinate Miao Bin at Jixiang Theater several weeks ago, but failed, and Guan Zhenglin (transliteration) died on the spot. Shortly after, Xin Yanqiu was arrested by the Japanese military police and has since died in prison.

Xin Yanqiu, whose surname is Wang and given name is Yuhua, is from Peiping. Her father, Wang Haishan, is a very kind person. Her older brother, Zixiang, once studied the huqin with Xu Lanyuan, and when he succeeded, he played the instrument for his sister. Yuhua is intelligent and beautiful, with a heroic spirit in her eyes, so she is most brilliant in portraying "Hong Fu" and "Yu Ji." The martial arts master Yang Xiaolou rarely performed with female actresses in his life, but he uniquely paired Yuhua with Yu Ji in the play "Farewell My Concubine," which shows the transcendence of her art. Yuhua's singing style is based on Cheng Yanqiu, and her appearance is also somewhat similar to Cheng, so she was named Xin Yanqiu. Later, she studied drama with the famous actress Wang Yaoqing, and her attainments became even deeper. Ten years ago, three female actresses came to Shanghai from Peiping to perform at the same time. One was Xue Yanqin at the Grand Stage, the second was Liu Yanqin at Tianchan, and the third was Xin Yanqiu at Dan Gui First Stage. The three beauties competed, and their skills were commendable, far surpassing the previous generation of female actresses who valued appearance over art. Among the three, Xue Yanqin excelled in voice, Xin Yanqiu excelled in singing style, and Liu Yanqin excelled in martial arts. Within a few years, Xue was taken as a concubine by Puyi's cousin, Liu disappeared after leaving Shanghai, and only Xin Yanqiu continued to perform from time to time after returning to Peiping. Yan Jupeng, Wang Youchen, and others also successively supported her (i.e., as the lead male role), so her reputation rose sharply, and she was recognized as the chief of the female roles. Four or five years ago, she was suddenly favored by a young division commander of the Central Army, who spent thousands of gold to buy her a new car, which she often drove around the downtown areas in front of and outside the city. Among the old Beijing actors who had their own cars, there were only a few people such as Lian Liang, Xiao Yun, and Shuyan. Others, such as Cheng Yanqiu, used chartered cars instead. Therefore, Yuhua's possession of a car was quite surprising to her peers. Rumors arose for a time, and everyone said that she would give up her acting life and marry the division commander. Later, it was heard that the conditions in her family were very harsh, and they would not agree to the marriage without a hundred thousand silver dollars, so the matter was stopped. This report says that Yuhua attempted to assassinate Miao Bin in Jixiang Garden in the Eastern District, but was arrested by the Japanese military police and died in prison. According to general speculation, Yuhua had a very deep relationship with a young division commander of the Central Army, and she was influenced by him day and night. Her patriotism would certainly not lag behind others. Seeing Miao and others lose their minds and willingly recognize the enemy as their father, it may have touched her sense of righteousness, and she wished to imitate the actions of heroic women such as Hong Fu, so she made a surprising move, adding a unique color to the acting world, or she was imprisoned on suspicion, resulting in her demise. As for the real reason, we can only wait for future investigations. (The above is a photo of her in the play "Farewell My Concubine" taken four years ago.)

### Robin Hood

— Jia Feng

The heroic Robin Hood is an invincible archery general, a skilled swordsman, very romantic, cheerful, and amiable. He is a famous and active figure in modern times, as he was in the centuries before Sir Walter Scott and Owen. In fact, now he is even more popular than before, because Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, two famous stars, have filmed this active and lovable character.

But is there really this brave warrior in the world? Some will be surprised to ask us such a question. Of course, in fact, this lovable bandit cannot be found in official history, except in ballads and storybooks.

The first mention of Robin Hood was in William Langland's collection of poems published in 1377. Then, Wyntoun's Scottish History also mentioned him. Since then, the legends and anecdotes about this brave outlaw and his subordinates have been spread more and more widely and become more and more complicated. In Walter Scott's "Ivanhoe", Robin Hood is the hero of the book. He first appears under the names of Yeoman Locksley and the archer Locksley, and finally, he meets the world under his old name, Robin Hood.

Some historians and novelists, although they know that historical data is still needed to verify it, always feel that Robin Hood was a real person.

People think that Robin Hood appeared in Sherwood Forest in England during the time of King Richard the Lionheart. This was the era when the local Saxons were oppressed by the Norman victors who succeeded William the Conqueror. They conquered this country in 1066.

According to the stories passed down from earlier years, Robin Hood's career was robbing the rich and helping the poor. At first, people assumed that he came from a poor family, but as the story spread year after year, people felt that he was too good, so the storytellers said that he came from a noble family. Recently, in Warner Bros.' film, his real name is Earl of Locksley.

It is interesting how Hollywood has selected and rejected the legends of Robin Hood. Fairbanks wrote a forty-four-word outline on a piece of paper for his production. The Warner Bros. research department did a lot of research on this. The research department studied the records of this figure for four or five years. The scriptwriters Ryan and Miller for Flynn read all the popular materials about Robin Hood, then threw away their notes and made a story that happened to be the same as Fairbanks's.

### A Play Critic's Conversation About the Role of Empress Dowager Xiao in "Qian Qian Studio Theatre Talks"

— Xiao Cang

Chen Delin is a leading figure among female impersonators since the Republic of China era. His singing adheres to old methods and does not seek novelty. However, the audience below the stage praises his skills and never tires of the old ways. This is because his voice and singing method possess true power and skill, allowing him to stand tall in the era of new female impersonator tunes. Recently, Mr. Zheng Guoyi, in Xinwenbao (News Daily), discussed Yanmenguan (Yanmen Pass), praising Wang Yaoqing's vivid portrayal of Empress Dowager Xiao in the play. Yaoqing's delivery was sharp and decisive, unlike anything else. His demeanor and bearing were also unique, elegant and generous, beyond the reach of ordinary actors. I, like Mr. Zheng Guoyi, admire both Delin and Yaoqing's singing and acting and consider them outstanding talents in the opera world. However, Mr. Zheng Guoyi has not seen Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao. Therefore, at the repeated request of Mr. Huang Jiping of this newspaper, I have written this article to share my thoughts with fellow enthusiasts.

Chen Delin's role as Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" was almost exclusively his in the old capital. In grand ceremonial performances, "Visiting the Mother" was often the final act. Therefore, those who resided in Beijing for a long time all knew that Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao was unrivaled in the opera scene. His dialogue was undoubtedly excellent, and his dignified and solemn bearing was particularly outstanding. It is said that because he served in the inner court, he gained a deep understanding of the demeanor and gestures of noble Manchu women, allowing him to perfectly embody the character. How could ordinary people easily emulate him?

Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, Wang Yaoqing never played the role of Empress Dowager Xiao. This was because there was already a master ahead, and he did not want to compete with Delin for a single day's advantage. Yaoqing's sharp and decisive delivery was his strength, but his voice still retained some male tones, which was his only weakness. Delin's Beijing accent was clear and powerful, and he could perfectly mimic the voice of Manchu women, surpassing Yaoqing in this aspect. Delin's allegro sections in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" were considered the best among female impersonators because his articulation was clear, and his voice was round and smooth. The faster he sang, the more exquisite it became, similar to Lao Tan's allegro. Delin's possession of these two advantages made him superior to Yaoqing. Moreover, Delin's demeanor and bearing were also superior to Yaoqing. Therefore, when discussing Empress Dowager Xiao, Chen Delin must be considered the ultimate performer. Furthermore, the dialogue between the Empress Dowager and the princess in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" required perfect synchronicity and seamless execution. Even the slightest hesitation would ruin the performance. Delin's performance in this section was highly acclaimed. After Delin and Yaoqing, Wu Caixia and Luo Furong Cao were the most praised contemporary performers. Caixia purely adhered to the old methods, while Tongshan modeled himself after Delin. Shanghai praised Tongshan's Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting the Mother." In reality, Tongshan's Manchu costume and stage steps still revealed traces of affectation, lacking the pure and natural grace of Delin. There was a clear difference in quality. I am not making this assessment because Delin has passed away, to shock the world. Rather, I am offering an unbiased opinion on the art of the two performers. I believe those who have frequently listened to Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao will agree with my fair assessment.

In the winter of the third year of the Republic of China, I attended a charity performance organized by the Beijing Opera Association in the old capital at the Tianle Theatre, where I saw Chen Delin, Yunfu, Wang Yaoqing, Lu Sanbao, Hu Suxian, Jia Honglin, Jin Zhongren, Wang Huifang, and others perform "Yanmenguan" (a scene from "Northern and Southern Harmony"). Delin as Empress Dowager and Lao Yunfu as She Taijun were equally matched in skill and could be considered the heavenly voices of this opera. Later, at the Xinming Grand Theatre, Mei Lanfang staged the complete "Yanmenguan," with Delin, Yunfu, Wang Fengqing, Zhu Suyun, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, Xun Huisheng, Zhu Guifang, Li Shoushan, Jiang Miaoxiang, and other actors as supporting roles. It was also a grand occasion. I only managed to attend one performance and still regret not seeing the entire play.

### A Tour of Shanghai's Peking Opera Theatres During the Lunar New Year

— Hai

Since closing their doors last winter, Shanghai's Peking Opera theatres have completed their internal reorganization and adjustments to their casts. All reopened on the first day of the lunar new year, to enhance the festive atmosphere. A reporter visited the backstage areas of each theatre and now presents the observed grandeur as follows:

Golden Theatre: Zhang Eyun, the northern-style female impersonator and respected figure, has long been admired by the people of Shanghai for her beauty and artistry. This time, she is performing with the support of Yang Baosen, Ye Shengli, Liu Lianrong, Ma Fulu, and others, creating a harmonious blend of talent. Those who are captivated by Eyun are flocking to see her, resulting in sold-out performances every day and excellent results.

Carlton Theatre: The Yi Feng Theatre Company originally planned to rehearse the two-part "Wen Suochen" during the break, but the time was too short. Since reopening, they plan to perform old plays for half a month and then rehearse new plays. Opera fans have deep faith in the company. Before New Year's Eve, they rushed to book seats, selling out all tickets from New Year's Day to the God of Wealth Day. Zhou Xinfang can truly be called the "authority of the Peking Opera world."

Gong Wu Tai Theatre: The play "Red Lotus Temple" has deeply resonated with the audience and has a very strong appeal. On New Year's Day night, they premiered the 29th installment of the new play. With the addition of martial arts actor Yuan Xiaolou, Huang Baoyan, and child actor Xiao Xiaoshentong, the cast is even stronger. Therefore, at nine o'clock in the morning, audience members were already buying tickets to enter, and by eleven-thirty, the iron gates were tightly closed, with hundreds being barred from entry. Many waited until the end of the day's performance to gain entry. The theatre's splendor was truly unmatched by any other theatre. The front of the theatre was decorated with a full view of the burning of the Red Lotus Temple, which was quite eye-catching and an excellent tool for attracting the audience.

Da Wu Tai Theatre: Monkey King Zhang Yipeng had once expressed a desire to retire. However, after the authorities earnestly persuaded him to stay, he dispelled his intentions and continued to perform on stage from New Year's Day. The 32nd installment of "Journey to the West C," which premiered the night before last (the second day of the new year), had special contributions in terms of plot and technique. Moreover, the authorities provided extremely magnificent scenery and prizes made of four thousand taels of gold, creating an unprecedented record of ticket sales. Yipeng will be adding the play "Dang Peng Beats Zou Wannianchun" in the 33rd installment, which has profound significance and is being actively rehearsed.

Tianchan Theatre: Famous dan Huang Duqiu and sheng Gu Shaohua performed together. Martial arts actors Wang Duqing and Wang Fuying, who had left the Gong Wu Tai Theatre, also joined the troupe, and the cast was well-organized and not inferior to other theatres. However, due to excessively high ticket prices and the exorbitant demands of the tea servers, the audience was hesitant to attend, resulting in mediocre business, which was unexpected. It was not until the past two nights, when Huang Duqiu and Gu Shaohua performed "Yu Tang Chun" and "Si Lang Visits His Mother," that the theatre was finally sold out. Opera fans have a very good reputation for Gu Shaohua.

Queen Theatre: One of the masters of southern-style short-play martial arts, Gai Jiaotian, after being strongly encouraged by famous amateur actor Yu Yung, came out of retirement with his young son Guan Fu (stage name Xiao Gai Jiaotian) and joined the Queen Theatre. Although the scale is small, most of the audience members are highly respected people, and opera fans gather here. The expenses of the backstage and front stage are very low, and profits are guaranteed.

Kade Theatre: The theatre was reorganized and taken over by Yongji Zhongyuan Company. In addition to famous actors Xiao San Mazi, Guo Yurong, Xin Yanqiu, Wang Guiwu, Zhao Yunhe, and others, they also negotiated with Zhang Yipeng and hired his third brother Yupeng (stage name Erpeng) to perform as the mainstay of the theatre. Yupeng has a deep family background and his art is comparable to that of his father and brothers. After taking the stage, he received extremely high praise and made a sensational debut, which was expected. Some say that with the Gai family's father and sons all coming out of retirement, the Shanghai opera scene is dominated by their family, which is no exaggeration.

### Interests of Performers

— KS

In the film industry, whenever someone mentions the name "Mei Ran Gong" (Mr. Beautiful Beard), everyone will think of Gao Lihen with his face full of whiskers. It is said that the reason he puts this very annoying thing on his beautiful face is because there is a reason, and the inside story of this reason is an unspeakable secret! He is from Sichuan, and his Shanghai dialect with a Sichuan accent has caused many jokes. As a result, female stars often misunderstand him and quarrel with him! He loves spicy food, and a jar of spicy pickles is a staple dish in his home all year round!

The one who specializes in playing "Mr. Wang" is Tang Jie. His performing art surpasses his directing technique, which means that he is less likely to succeed in directing than in performing! Years ago, he had a habit of reading comics. He would read everything with comics in newspapers and magazines before he was satisfied. However, he most admired Ye Qianyu's "Mr. Wang." He felt that "Mr. Wang's" actions and deeds were not only very interesting but also exposed the ills of all levels of society. Therefore, when he worked at Tianyi Film Company, he introduced "Mr. Wang" to Shao Zuiweng and suggested filming it. At the same time, he also advocated playing "Mr. Wang" himself. As a result, his proposal became a reality. Therefore, on the eve of filming, in order to seek realism, he did not hesitate to shave off his full head of black hair and even painfully pull out two beautiful front teeth.

Diao Banhua, known as the "Second Hu Die," was originally an unimportant actor in Wen Yimin's Jianghua Company. However, women sell beauty for money. After leaving Jianghua, Diao Banhua finally had a smooth career and became a red star. She has the naive temperament of a child. Because she is naive, she regards everything as child's play. For example, love; she has no understanding of it. She feels that everyone is lovable, but she cannot distinguish the lovable aspects of her object. Therefore, again and again, she has made many jokes; and the jokes have affected her future!

### Isolated Island Drama Talk

— Wang Weiwuo

I Talk About the Qi School

Talking about the Qi School is not an easy task. It is not that one cannot write without in-depth research on this school. Si Jun's article on the "Qi School" earlier inevitably had some aspects that were difficult to sympathize with. Now, let's put aside Zhou Xinfang, the master of the Qi School, and talk about the people who are currently studying the Qi School. Although Gao Baisui has the best status and reputation, realistically speaking, the person who will inherit Xinfang's mantle in the future should be none other than Wang Chunbai.

Wang Chunbai, originally named Wang Yunsen, came from a martial arts background (that is, what the opera troupe calls "hitting the target"). He once hung the top sign at the New New Company's roof garden. After entering the Gong Wu Tai Theatre, he changed his name to his current name, giving the impression of ascending the dragon gate and increasing his value a hundredfold. Chunbai put a lot of effort into learning the Qi School, and his singing and acting are both just right. It is acceptable that he has a considerable foundation in martial arts, which is something that Baisui and Hefeng cannot match. Xinfang was a martial arts actor in his early years. Indirectly speaking, the plays that Xinfang performs cannot be pleasing without a considerable foundation in martial arts. Therefore, Xinfang once made an absolute judgment, believing that Wang Chunbai will definitely be one of the most successful people in learning the Qi School.

As for Baisui, his artistry far surpasses that of Chunbai. However, his study of the Qi School is not as skilled as Chunbai's. Baisui originally followed Liu Hongsheng and joined halfway, paying his respects to Zhou Xinfang. In fact, with such a good voice as Baisui's, it is a real waste to learn the Qi School. Baisui also has a foundation in martial arts, but his movements are not graceful. It is acceptable that he often walks diagonally, which is extremely unsightly. His singing and reciting are among the best in the Qi School, but his acting is stiff, not as lively as Chen Hefeng's. Chen Hefeng was overly lively in his early years, almost greasy. In recent years, Hefeng has been able to weed out the dross and retain the essence. He is not as greasy as before, but more commendable. It is acceptable that his body is beautiful, and his skills in water sleeves and jumping robes are extremely capable of achieving a beautiful style. His art has indeed improved a lot.

In addition to the above three people, Xinfang's direct disciples also include the late Wang Yingzhou and Yang Baotong (Yu Zongying, Wang Shaolou, and Wang Fuying are all difficult to include in Xinfang's school, but they are also martial arts actors, so I will not discuss them). Wang Yingzhou's voice is the most like Xinfang's, but his acting is excessive. However, his art is indeed better than Yang Baotong's. Yang Baotong's learning of the Qi School can be said to be completely unremarkable. However, he is studious and tireless. "Where there is a will, there is a way." He will definitely make progress in the future.

Chen Xiaomu, Li Feichun, Xu Hongpei, and others are also hanging the banner of the Qi School (I have never heard of Zheng Yuanlin and Zhu Junpei, who Si Jun mentioned, as Laosheng of the Qi School). The art of Chen and Li is not elegant. Xu Hongpei has recently received guidance from Fan Shujian and has the air of making rapid progress. The younger generation is to be feared.

Speaking of amateur actors, there have been as many people learning the Qi School in recent years as there are carps crossing the river. In the past, Guo Xiaoxiao was the best. After Guo retired, Xinfang's son-in-law Zhang Zhongyuan can be called the leader in this field. Sun Lanting is considered the best in learning Xinfang's "Chasing Han Xin." Wang Qijun's singing is the most beautiful, and Zhu Lianfu is the most qualified and experienced. Others, such as Wang Xuechen and Hua Zhenya, are also believers in the Qi School. Cheng Yuzhang, who Si Jun mentioned, is Zhou Xinfang's eldest disciple, but he is not an amateur actor, and Yuzhang is not a Laosheng. These are my opinions, what do you think, Si Jun?

### Hitler's Lover: A Jewish Movie Star

— Hao

Everyone thinks that the German leader Hitler to this day. In fact, who knows, he already has a lover, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that his lover is precisely the Jew he hates the most! This is really inexplicable, is it that heroes are short-lived and have long-lasting feelings for their children?

Speaking of this Jewish woman, she was originally a red star on the screen, named Lan Na Lifen Shide Lane Refenster, who is now twenty-one years old. She became an orphan without parents when she was fourteen years old. Her uncle took her to a song and dance theatre in Shengkangsi City to learn to dance. Because she was born beautiful and clever and lively, she became very famous in less than three years, and became an angel of the public. Finally, she got the help of friends and entered the Finas Film Company in Austria, and then she became a movie star again.

After she joined the film company, the films she acted in were all musicals or song and dance films, and she acted very little. It was not until the summer of the year before last, when a top red female star in the film company died of lung disease, that her fate turned for the better, like the sky clearing up after the rain.

Last year, Lanna went to Germany to find a famous musician, who was a close friend of Hitler's. Lanna and Hitler became acquainted through this "matchmaker."

When Hitler saw this contemporary celebrity Lanna, his iron heart was greatly shaken, causing this leader to almost throw some of his anti-Jewish thoughts out of the window. As a result, two people who were incompatible with each other fell in love.

But at first, Hitler did not know that this red star was Jewish. When their love was in full swing, Lanna bravely said to Hitler, "I am a Jewish woman! Do you still love me?" Hitler not only did not get angry after hearing this, but embraced Lanna and kissed her, saying, "It doesn't matter, as long as I love you," and then gave her a sweet kiss……

After the German Army Chief of Staff Goering heard about this sensational matter, he immediately advised Hitler, but Hitler said to Goering, "Please do not interfere in my private life." Goering was so angry when he heard this that he left.

Yes, how mysterious this should be! Lanna knew very well the danger of her situation, but she carefully wrapped the soft threads of love around this contemporary hard man—Hitler.

### On the Subject Matter and Compilation of Scripts

— Xiaolan

Everyone knows that the mission of a playwright lies in finding good subject matter and writing a good script to supply to the actors. The generation of subject matter is based on the playwright's unique intellect, recognizing the many major issues in society that people inadvertently overlook. Using his intelligent mind, he arranges authentic and imaginary facts, and with his flexible pen, he writes scripts to express the importance of the subject matter. Or, a clever playwright intersperses his own criticism into the script as a way to resolve the topic. In this way, the playwright not only makes the audience aware of the seriousness of the problem but also gives the audience help in solving the problem. If the playwright does not have rich experience and deep understanding of society, then it is better to write the subject matter faithfully without adding any self-criticism, so that the audience can recognize this long-unnoticed problem and solve it themselves.

If the playwright has found good subject matter, before starting to compile it, he must grasp the core of the subject matter. If the core of this subject matter can be displayed without a trace in one act through the skills of compilation, then it can be known that this is the subject matter of a one-act play. Originally, the compilation of a script does not lie in the number of acts. In addition to the main act that showcases the core of the subject matter, the other acts in the compilation of multi-act plays must also grasp the core of each sub-act, so that the performance will not be scattered and bland. In addition to setting off and strengthening the importance of the main act, the emotions contained in each sub-act must be considered, so that the intensity of tension and enthusiasm does not exceed the performance of the main act, which would cause the defect of taking the host's place, and instead make the audience's ability to recognize it vaguely. The playwright should pay attention to this point when compiling.

### Silhouette of Chen Yunshang

— (Deng Zhongwei)

Mr. Zheng Zhihang is a master in the silhouette world. His superb skills have long been known for their reputation. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he went to Hong Kong. Almost all of the film industry and Cantonese opera stars there have Mr. Zheng's silhouettes. The above is one of his recent works.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City Liyuan in the Old Capital (120)

— Xu Muyun

Actors' hobbies for eating, drinking, gambling, and playing with birds, animals, insects, and fish

After saying that, Shao Shan shouted at it again, "Three, yawn, bow, I'll give you smoke to smoke." The clever monkey immediately made these two movements. At that time, I found it very interesting. Shao Shan's buddy took the cage downstairs and put it on the bed for Shao Shan to burn for it to smoke. Unfortunately, monkeys are naturally fond of movement and not fond of quiet. Shao Shan's original intention was only to restrain its nature, and he would release it in at most three or four days. Unexpectedly, it suffocated to death in a few days. Shao Shan was very regretful about this matter, and even cried loudly. He put it in a wooden box and sent it to Pushan Villa. People who didn't know the situation suspected that it was a young master or a young lady from a wealthy family.

Once, Shao Shan went to Hong Kong with Dr. Mei to perform. He spent six hundred yuan to buy a small tiger. This tiger had a very clear "king" character on its head. Also, because he was born in the year of the tiger, he was willing to pay a great price to buy it, intending to bring it back to Shanghai, where he could open an animal exhibition hall of tigers, monkeys, cats, and dogs in his residence. Unexpectedly, this tiger was too small. When he was on the ship, he gave it a large piece of raw beef to eat. Because it did not have great chewing power, it could not swallow it down, nor could it spit it out. In this way, it was stuck to death alive. His extravagance and his love for raising livestock are indeed rare and very strange in the Liyuan industry.
