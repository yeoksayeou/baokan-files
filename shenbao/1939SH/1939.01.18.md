### Defending the Great Northwest: China's Comprehensive Military Deployment; A Large Number of Elite Troops Stationed in the Hancheng-Tongguan Area; Rushing to Build River Defense Works and Striving to Consolidate the Periphery; The War Zone Headquarters Established a Supervision Group to Mobilize Mass Work

(Hong Kong) Shaanxi News, China is defending the Great Northwest with comprehensive military deployments. It is not easy for the Japanese to cross the Yellow River. Only Jin Southwest and Sui South, located on the bends of the river, are potentially passable. However, Sui South has mostly desert terrain after crossing the river, while Shaanxi North and Henan West have mostly mountainous terrain. Therefore, defending the Northwest, the Guanzhong area is critically important. This section of river defense includes Hancheng, Heyang, Pingmin, Chaoyi, Tongguan and other counties. Currently, China has stationed a large number of elite troops in the Hancheng-Tongguan area, and there are also mechanized troops. River defense works are also under construction.

Editorial

### China's Creditworthiness and British and American Interests

The Ministry of Finance of China announced the day before yesterday that it will no longer provide concessions for the repayment of foreign debts secured by customs duties, but will only allocate funds proportionally from the customs revenue of areas outside the war zone. Most of the Chinese government's foreign debts and reparations are secured by customs duties; domestic debts are secured by salt taxes or consolidated taxes. Newly issued domestic and foreign debts are mostly secured by direct taxes such as income tax; the Unity and Reconstruction Bonds and the Gold Bonds are also secured by customs duties. Now that China is no longer providing advances for foreign debts secured by customs duties, it will affect the interests of Britain and the United States; on the other hand, it seems that China's creditworthiness is also in question. We are willing to take a third-party position and make a rational analysis.

First, the Ministry of Finance-managed foreign debts secured by customs duties (as of January 1, 1939) include the Reorganization Loan, the Anglo-German Supplementary Loan, the British Boxer Indemnity, and the Sassoon Huai River Loan, totaling £24,611,367; and the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, totaling US$25,546,000. It can be seen that as a result of the Japanese seizure of customs duties, it is Britain and the United States, not China, that suffer the losses, especially Britain. Recalling that in 1938, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Horiuchi, discussed the handling of the Shanghai customs duties issue. The Anglo-Japanese agreement on Chinese customs duties signed on May 3 stipulated that all customs revenue in areas under the control of the Japanese military will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, from which the amount needed to repay foreign debts will be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fulfill the obligation of repaying foreign debts and indemnities secured by customs duties. However, in fact, only one million yuan was repaid for the Reorganization Loan after the agreement was signed, and other foreign debts were not repaid at all. At that time, Britain was satisfied with this agreement, so that China could not freely dispose of the customs revenue even after protesting. Today, China no longer provides advances for debts secured by customs duties. Although the motivation does not include the meaning of resistance, it cannot be regarded as illegitimate in law.

Second, the Chinese government has made its best efforts to maintain its foreign debt reputation in recent years. For example, in October 1936, the Fisk Aircraft and Marconi Wireless Loan were reorganized. In April 1937, the Chicago Bank Loan and the Taiping Development Company Loan were successively established for repayment, designating salt tax as security. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all customs revenue in the war zone has been seized by Japan and deposited in Japanese banks; as a result, the accumulated amount of debts owed by each customs office in the war zone that should have been shared and not paid, which was advanced by the Central Bank after negotiation with the Chinese government, reached as much as 175 million yuan. It can be seen that the Chinese government has been trying its best to maintain its creditworthiness even during the war. Since the customs duties are seized by Japan, making it impossible for China to fulfill its debt repayment obligations, in essence, it is not that China wants to default on its debts, and therefore there is naturally no obligation to provide advances for repayment.

Third, the Ministry of Finance of China no longer providing advances for customs duties-secured loans does not mean that there is a flaw in China's anti-Japanese financial situation, resulting in the inability to maintain creditworthiness. The starting point is entirely an economic war of self-defense, avoiding Japan from using China's financial resources as a tool of aggression. Therefore, after making every effort to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States, it cannot continue to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States while simultaneously financing the enemy. Therefore, this is a necessary measure during wartime, and the reason is not in finance. In September 1938, China temporarily suspended the repayment of principal on the Crisp Loan and the Anglo-French Loan because Japan seized all salt taxes in the war zone, which was also the same reason.

Fourth, although the Ministry of Finance of China does not allow any more concessions for customs duties-secured loans, it is still doing its best to maintain its creditworthiness in order to avoid harming the interests of Britain and the United States. In the Ministry of Finance's statement, it has clearly stated that in the future, for all long-term debts borrowed before the war and secured by customs duties, the amount to be shared proportionally according to the customs revenue of the non-war zone customs offices will be handed over to the Central Bank on a regular basis. If the customs offices in the war zone hand over the unpaid amounts owed for sharing compensation as before, the Chinese government will still allocate debt repayment funds as before to restore the situation before the war. Therefore, if Britain and the United States do not maintain their interests in the Far East, if they really have the determination to maintain their interests in the Far East, they should cooperate to sanction Japan, so that China's customs administration is independent, complete, and free, which indirectly means that their own interests are reasonably maintained and protected.

In short, China's decision not to provide advances for debts secured by customs duties this time is not due to the financial difficulties of the anti-Japanese war affecting the inability to maintain creditworthiness, but entirely the result of Japan's seizure of customs revenue. In fact, there is nothing to criticize. We only hope that Britain and the United States can have a more detailed analysis and a deeper understanding of the overall situation in the Far East for their own interests, and realize that their creditor's rights are in danger due to Japan's aggression. No longer ignore it, but take more effective measures to jointly sanction Japan, and take extremely rapid action. Not only will its creditor's rights - all its interests in China - be reasonably maintained and protected!

### Rights and Interests in the Far East Are Endangered; Democracies Should Respond Jointly; France Will Follow in the Footsteps of Britain and the United States in Sending a Note to Japan; Tokyo Expresses Determination to Implement Basic Policy

(Paris) Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington, after the United States and Britain successively presented notes to the Japanese government, it is rumored that the French government will also present the same note to Japan in the short term, demanding respect for the Nine-Power Treaty and making a clear statement on its policy towards China. This has now been confirmed by French officials. (Havas Dispatch on the 16th)

(London) According to British political sources, France will present a note to Japan in the near future to express the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East. It is said that the content of the French note is similar to the one presented by Britain on January 14, asking Japan to explain its plans. British officials confirmed yesterday that before presenting the note, Britain will inform the United States and France of the content of the note, and the wording of the note has received the "explicit approval" of the U.S. government. (Haitong Dispatch on the 17th)

(Tokyo) According to news from various Japanese circles here, the Japanese government will respond to Britain and the United States' notes on China affairs within the next few days. It is claimed that the note suggests that the relevant powers may discuss amending the principles of open door and equal opportunity in the Nine-Power Treaty. However, it is difficult to resolve issues that are difficult to resolve through bilateral talks through multilateral negotiations. Various Japanese circles here believe that Britain and the United States are not aware of the irrationality of conference diplomacy or are motivated by a predetermined policy and want to use the shortcomings of conference diplomacy. However, Japan and Britain and the United States have a traditional friendship, so the Japanese government is prepared to negotiate on the British and American proposals under the following conditions: (1) Complete liberation of all Eastern countries, including the elimination of China's colonial status and the freedom of Eastern people to travel and reside; (2) Complete freedom of world trade, including the abolition of existing economic blocs and the abolition of tariff barriers and import quotas; (3) Fair redistribution of raw materials, including

Including free purchases of raw materials essential to national survival, and safeguarding natural resources necessary for national defense. Japanese circles also stated that Japan will dispel the anxiety and doubt expressed in the British and American notes regarding the British and American view of Far Eastern affairs. In other words, if Britain, the United States, and other third countries accept the above conditions, then all restrictions imposed by Japan, Manchukuo, and China on Britain, the United States, and other third countries in making legitimate efforts to "engage in economic activities necessary to defend their natural defenses and achieve their economic autonomy" will naturally be eliminated, and at the same time, China's semi-colonial status can also be abolished.

### Hiranuma Will Elucidate Policy in the Diet

(Tokyo) According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, Prime Minister Hiranuma will deliver a speech in the Diet on the 21st of this month, stating the Japanese government's decision on its China policy. If the Nationalist government led by General Chiang Kai-shek does not abandon its policy of resistance to Japan, Japan will not hesitate to use various methods to destroy it. As for any Chinese people who understand Japan's goals and are prepared to participate in the work of reconstruction, Japan welcomes cooperation with them. At the same time, Japan is prepared to cooperate closely with countries that recognize Japan's position in the Far East, because the goal of this Sino-Japanese war is not so much to fight for military victory as to revive China and transform East Asia. Hiranuma's conclusion will strongly advocate the necessity of concentrating national forces, developing national defense, and increasing production. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious.

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Wang Jingwei left Hanoi for Haiphong a few days ago and has now taken a French ship from Haiphong to Europe (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th) According to the French Shanghai General Daily, Japanese sources previously stated that Wang Jingwei's close associates had told the Japanese that Wang had already fled. However, according to a Hanoi telegram yesterday, Wang's close associate Zeng Zhongming made a statement to the Japanese, saying that Wang Jingwei was still in Hanoi on Saturday evening (January 14), but his residence had been moved three times. At the same time, according to British sources, Wang Jingwei is indeed still in Hanoi and is conducting "peace" negotiations with several Japanese representatives. In short, Wang's whereabouts are now a mystery. (Reuters News Agency)

### England Maintains Friendship with China, Chinese Public Opinion Expresses Gratification

(Chongqing) The Ta Kung Pao's editorial today roughly states: All Chinese people who read the British note to Japan were greatly delighted, even more so than Britain's financial assistance to China. This note has swept away all kinds of misunderstandings held by the Chinese people regarding Britain's Far Eastern policy. The Chinese people now know that Britain will never abandon justice or friendship with the Chinese people. We can assure the British people that the Chinese people have always respected their friendship with Britain and will never forget Britain's friendship towards China in the critical moments of their history of survival, and will definitely find a way to fully repay it. This morning, all newspapers published the full text of the British note, unanimously praising Britain's attitude. The part of the note that analyzes the near-term peace conditions of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe in clear terms, considering them an attempt to encroach upon Chinese territorial sovereignty, is widely circulated among the Chinese people. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now claims that the major signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, Britain, the United States, and France, now hold the same views on how to deal with the Far Eastern situation, which is very gratifying. To stop Japan's aggression in China and maintain the status quo in the Far East as stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, the united action of these three countries is indispensable. The Central Daily News also published an editorial, stating that Britain's Far Eastern policy has now reached the final stage of decision-making, and what is needed now is action. If Britain raises its voice in Geneva, other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, including the United States and China, will definitely rise up to support its position. If Britain decides to take action, it can re-establish its leading position in the Far East for the next hundred years and gain China's great market, not only protecting its existing interests in the Far East.

(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a secret meeting this morning and adopted the agenda for this session of the Administrative Council. The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, visited the Soviet representative for talks, and the result was quite satisfactory. At noon today, Representative Gu attended a lunch hosted by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and then visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet. The general impression of the League of Nations is that after the talks between the representatives of China, Britain, and France, this session of the League of Nations Administrative Council will draft a resolution based on the final notes sent by Britain and the United States to Japan. At the same time, it is widely believed that France will follow the example of Britain and the United States and issue a note to Japan. This morning, when reporters asked the French Foreign Minister whether France would make further statements on the Far East issue, the French Foreign Minister did not respond. (Dispatch on the 16th)

(Chongqing) Zhu Jiaju, Chairman of the China Association of the League of Nations and Confidential Secretary of the Kuomintang, delivered a speech at a reception held here yesterday afternoon, urging the League of Nations to prevent the supply of munitions and financial credit to Japan and to provide financial and economic assistance to China, and to facilitate transportation with China, including maritime transport. Zhu advocated that countries with interests in the Far East should convene a meeting to supplement the inadequacy of the League of Nations' actions regarding the Sino-Japanese War. Wang Shijie, Vice Chairman of the Association and former Minister of Education, stressed that Japan's position is becoming weaker, and countries should not fear being drawn into war against Japan by strictly implementing sanctions.

### Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday Passes Report on Spanish War, Foreign Soldiers of the Government Have All Withdrawn, Representatives Hope Rebels Will Do the Same

(Geneva) The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened at 5 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler. The report submitted by the International Investigation Committee on the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers from the Spanish Republican Government was immediately passed. The main points of the report stated that all foreign volunteer soldiers belonging to the Spanish government forces had been quickly withdrawn from the front lines, of which 76.7%, or 4,640 people, had already left Spain, and the remaining 53% had not yet been able to leave due to incomplete passport procedures. French Representative Foreign Minister Bonnet then delivered a speech, praising Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín for his contributions to general peace, but said that the Spanish Nationalist government should also take the same measures so that the situation in the Mediterranean could be stabilized. As for France, it has assisted Spain based on humanitarianism, and recently donated 45,000 tons of wheat to the Spanish government to help refugees, which is one example. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, British Foreign Secretary Halifax, and New Zealand Representative Jordan then spoke, all advocating that foreign volunteer soldiers belonging to the Spanish Nationalist government should also be withdrawn. Soviet Representative Sulich, the Soviet Ambassador to France, expressed sympathy to the Spanish Republican government and said that the responsibility for the failure to completely withdraw foreign volunteer soldiers from Spain should be borne by the Nationalist army. Finally, Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Del Vayo delivered a speech, roughly saying, "All the troops within the Republican government's jurisdiction who are fighting for independent sovereignty are Spanish."

### Copy of British Note Sent to Washington, Hull Refuses to Comment

### British Press Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Believes Effects Will Be Hundreds of Times Greater Than British Note

(London) "Financial News" stated in an editorial today that the British note to Japan is like an admonition, lacking effective sanctions. Does the British government naively believe that the Japanese authorities at this stage will change their policies at the wave of a teacher's finger? The future of the two to three hundred million pounds of investment is now threatened, and words alone cannot protect it. Things have now reached this point. If the British government wants to maintain an attitude of non-intervention in the Far Eastern war, and hope to salvage the interests endangered by the war, it is impossible. Even seeking to preserve one-tenth of the interests is slim. If Britain and the United States take a common policy to resist the import and export trade between Japan and British-controlled regions, the effect will be hundreds of times greater than a diplomatic note, because Japan's foreign trade is the lifeblood of Japan's economy. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Press Opposes Britain, Even Deeming it a "Covert Enemy"

(Tokyo) After Britain issued a note to Japan, the tone of the Japanese newspapers' responses was extremely sharp. They all claimed that as long as Britain does not recognize Japan's mission in the Far East and continues to secretly aid General Chiang Kai-shek, there is no possibility of understanding between Britain and Japan. "Hochi Shimbun" criticized the British note as absurd and declared that Japan should follow the example of the Soviet Union in abolishing all treaties and Germany and Italy in abolishing the Treaty of Versailles and directly abolish the Nine-Power Treaty. "Nichinichi Shimbun" declared that if Britain continues to support the government of Chairman Chiang, Japan will regard it as a "covert enemy." (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### German Press Criticizes Weaknesses of British and American Notes

(Berlin) The German press commented today on the British and American notes to Japan, calling them a more sharp tone taken by Britain and the United States against Japan and saying that the Anglo-Saxon nations are uneasy about the establishment of political, economic, and cultural groups between China and Japan and Manchuria. They still say that Britain and the United States do not intend to intervene militarily. They may be good at wording in the notes, but in terms of implementation, Japan is more successful.

(London) The Spanish Embassy in London issued a declaration as follows: "Those who believe that the war is gradually coming to an end will again prove their mistake. The recent offensive by the Nationalist army will not have the slightest impact on the strength or combat effectiveness of the government army. The Spanish government solemnly declares that even with the powerful intervention of foreign infantry armed with sophisticated weapons and the efforts of authoritarian countries to destroy the Spanish Republic, the Spanish people will still bravely resist until they defeat the invaders and the ultimate goals of their Spanish allies." (Reuters, 17th)

Port Brest: The 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu" was launched here this morning. Naval Minister Campinchi and many other dignitaries were present to watch. Minister Campinchi is also scheduled to hold a keel-laying ceremony this afternoon for the "Richelieu"'s sister ship, the "Clemenceau" (named after the Tiger Premier during the European War).

### German Diplomatic Activities Actively Woo Allied Countries

Hungarian Foreign Minister Talks at Length with Hitler, Withdrawal from League of Nations Only a Matter of Time, German Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Warsaw

(Berlin) After Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived here, he had a long talk with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for two hours. Before traveling, former Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös paid a visit to Führer Hitler. When Foreign Minister Csáky met with German dignitaries, he performed the "Hungarian Greeting," placing his right hand on his chest. People generally felt interested in this. According to German semi-official sources, Foreign Minister Csáky and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop discussed various issues between Germany and Hungary in a very friendly spirit today. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact shows that the policies promoted by the Rome-Berlin Axis and the activities between the anti-communist triangle of Germany, Italy, and Japan are fully accepted by Hungary. All outstanding issues between Germany and Hungary can be easily resolved. Informed sources said that Foreign Minister Csáky's trip has no special significance, but Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations is only a matter of time. As for whether Foreign Minister Csáky's visit has anything to do with this matter, they declined to express their views. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was originally scheduled to visit Warsaw in late February, that is, after Foreign Minister Ciano visited Huaisha.

### No Competitive Selling of Chinese Bonds on the London Market

(London) There is no competitive selling of Chinese bonds. The general impression is that China will be able to find a way to recognize the Anglo-Japanese agreement of May 3 without damaging its borrowing in the current shift in British and American policy, which is beneficial to China. The Times said that regardless of the surplus or deficit in customs revenue, the Chinese government has always upheld the special status of debts secured by customs duties. Now that it is facing an unprecedented difficult situation, everyone is willing to continue to sympathize with it. However, although the Chinese government's acceptance of a compromise solution that may not be the same as the Anglo-Japanese agreement seems like a concession, it is less harmful to China than ignoring its debts. There is reason to believe that the Chinese government will adopt a suitable political view for China's real needs. The Daily Herald claimed that people in London fully recognize the Chinese government's natural interest in not making concessions, but when weighing the two evils, concession is less harmful. The Daily Mail suggested that the solution to this matter is for the Chinese government to stop repaying the principal and continue to pay interest. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### U.S. Naval Circles Strongly Advocate for Enhanced Defenses on Guam Island, Extensive Establishment of Naval Bases in the Pacific, Requesting Congressional Appropriation to Implement the Plan

(Washington) Today, the U.S. Navy publicly urged Congress to immediately allocate funds to implement the plan outlined in the Hepburn Report, emphasizing the importance of defending Guam. Guam is located in the center of the Japanese-controlled islands and is only 1,500 miles from the Japanese mainland. Disregarding the Japanese Navy's recent expression of "deep concern" regarding the U.S. defense of Guam, a U.S. Navy spokesperson stated today that Guam is a fortress that should be defended immediately to provide a base of operations in the Far East and to assist in the national defense along the coast. The spokesperson said, "The U.S. Navy intends to build Guam into a strong fleet base. In 1946, we will abandon the Philippines. After abandoning it, we will inevitably seek another suitable base in the Far East, otherwise we will be reduced to a second-rate power. Guam is our land, and since we have no intention of abandoning it, why not defend and protect it?" While naval experts continue to draft plans for expanding naval bases in the Pacific and Caribbean, senior officials and members of Congress have differing opinions on the issue of defending Guam. It is said that the main opponents of this plan come from the State Department, who are apparently concerned about the Japanese statement regarding "deep concern" about defending Guam. The Navy Department is working with the Budget Bureau to draft legislation that would allow the recommendations in the Hepburn Report for the establishment of forty-one naval bases to be implemented. Observers in Congress believe that the Navy has secured funding for the construction of the forty-one bases, but there may be a strong debate in Congress over the defense of Guam. The Navy's informal rationale for defending Guam is that concentrating strong air power and submarines on the island would allow for a large encirclement of the Japanese Navy advancing south or west. The Hepburn Report also states that with this base, the Philippines could be spared from attack, and any difficulties in defending the U.S. coast and Hawaii could be reduced, and the U.S. Navy's ability to operate freely would be greatly increased. (U.S. Associated Press, 17th)

(New York) The National Aeronautic Association continued its annual meeting today. Air Force Chief of Staff General Andrews attended and delivered a speech, saying, "If the United States does not strengthen its air defenses, then in the event of war, enemy aircraft capable of flying back and forth between Europe and the Americas will target U.S. industrial centers and ordinary people for bombing." Aircraft manufacturing is changing rapidly. Compared to future bombers, the super bombers that the United States currently possesses are insignificant. As far as the current state of our country's aircraft factories is concerned, I believe they are capable of building giant bombers capable of flying 16,000 kilometers in one go. Why can't other aircraft factories do the same? And it is to be expected that they will work hard to do so. Moreover, in terms of the current strength of the U.S. Air Force, it ranks only fifth or sixth in the world. The Air Force Chief of Staff can only deploy 400 aircraft. In the future, we must work actively to manufacture fighter planes and improve air defense facilities along the Atlantic coast to ensure security." (Havas News Agency, 16th)

### U.S. Congress Pursues Movement to Amend Silver Purchase Act, Silver Bloc Congressmen Offer Much Support

(New York) According to Washington sources, a strong movement is underway in Congress to significantly amend the Silver Purchase Act, with attention being paid to proposals to prohibit the Treasury Department from purchasing foreign silver. Silver bloc Congressmen are offering much support for this movement, as they deeply fear that large-scale purchases of foreign silver will leave domestically produced silver with nowhere to be sold. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau mentioned this matter when he received reporters yesterday, saying that the Senate has not consulted him regarding the proposal to cease purchasing foreign silver. (Reuters, 17th)

### U.S. Senator Proposes Prohibition on Steel Exports

(Washington) U.S. Democratic Senator Schwellenbach proposed in Congress today that the export of steel and scrap iron from the United States should be prohibited, except with the express permission of the President. Political figures believe that this proposal is clearly intended to prevent Japan from purchasing scrap iron from the United States, and if it is implemented, it will deal a significant blow to Japan.

### Mysterious Explosions Occur on the Same Day in London and Northern Ireland, Police Investigate Suspected Political Background, Prelude to Terrorist Actions by the Irish Republican Army

(London) After an explosion occurred at the Southwark power plant in this city yesterday morning, another explosion occurred at the Birmingham City power plant (located near the water tower) yesterday evening. The material damage appears to be significant. (Havas News Agency, 17th)

(London) The London Metropolitan Police are now investigating two mysterious explosions in London. The more serious incident occurred outside the management office of the Southwark Central Electricity Station. Although no one was injured, countless doors and windows were shattered. An explosion of a similar nature also occurred in the Harlesden area of northwest London, where an overhead power line passes over a canal bridge. Judging from the circumstances of the two incidents, they were likely caused by bombs. Explosives experts from the Home Office are working with the police to investigate. According to police speculation about these explosions, they may have a political background. One theory is that they are related to disturbances organized by the "Irish Republican Army." The police previously received reports stating that if the Irish question could not be resolved in both Northern and Southern Ireland, disturbances might occur in England. Three explosions also occurred in Manchester yesterday, killing one person and injuring three. The roads were blown into giant craters, and many doors and windows were shattered. Although the cause of these explosions is said to be electrical faults, investigations are still ongoing because they occurred at the same time as the explosions in London. (Reuters, 7th)

Dublin: Following the explosions in London, Manchester, and Belfast, Northern Ireland, well-informed sources here commented, "This is the beginning of a terrorist campaign by the Irish Republican Army. The goal is to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland. The declaration by the Irish Republican Army to establish an Irish Republic is essentially an ultimatum." In addition, the Irish Republican Army is said to have large-scale terrorist organizations in England and Scotland. (Havas News Agency, 16th)

(London) Northern Ireland Home Secretary Sir Dawson Bates, in referring to the statements issued by the "Irish Republican Government" and the "Irish Republican Army" claiming the existence of an Irish Republic, said that the recent acts of violence on the Northern Ireland border were undoubtedly the beginning of this movement. The Northern Ireland government has long been aware of their plans for violence, and therefore, it has become necessary to detain the leaders of the "Irish Republican Army." The Northern Ireland government will not delay in fulfilling its responsibilities and will not hesitate to exercise its powers. If necessary, the government will seek to increase its powers to curb the criminal activities of illegal societies and eliminate all acts of violence and murder, thereby achieving its political goals.

### Internal Unity in the Soviet Union, Full Effort to Cope with the Crisis, Soldiers Swear Allegiance to the Government, Youth Groups Become Militarized

(Moscow) The movement to purge reactionary elements in the Soviet Union has eased after the removal of Yezhov, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and head of the political police. Since the Munich Agreement, the government has shifted its focus from domestic politics to international relations, mobilizing national strength to cope with external crises. The major measures include: 1. Stricter enforcement of labor discipline. 2. Army soldiers are required to individually swear allegiance to the Soviet government and sign a declaration stating that they are willing to be punished by federal law and despised by the nation's citizens and workers if they betray their oaths. 3. All youth groups, including the Communist Youth League, are controlled by government committees and militarized. 4. In addition, although the 1938 production plan is smaller than the 1937 plan, the planned production quantities have still not been fully met, and the government has taken various measures to prevent production declines.

### The East River Chinese Army Encircles Shilong, Zhang, Tan, and Ye's Troops Advancing Sharply, Japanese Army Changes to Supplying by Waterway

Shantou Correspondence: According to battlefield news from Huiyang, water and land transportation in the counties along the East River has resumed since New Year's Day. Passengers and goods from Xingning and Heifeng can travel directly to Bao'an and Hong Kong via Laolong and Huiyang without any obstacles. Huang Renhuan is inspecting various counties, instructing on the construction of highways and telegraph poles, and dividing areas for joint defense and mutual assistance. The section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Changshentou to Shenzhen is being controlled by the Chinese army. Zhang Ruigui, Tan Sui, and Ye Ting's three units are attacking Shilong from three directions. Tan's division advanced to Hengli Bridge. Wu Daonan, the brigade commander of the Security Brigade, and Yuan Xiajiu, the special service battalion of the Eastern Route, attacked Chashan, Dongguan from Longgang and Dashawei. Another route was taken by Ye Ting's troops, who bypassed Mount Luofu in Boluo to attack Shilong. On the night of the 28th of last month, a plainclothes team attacked Shilong, engaging in street fighting until dawn before retreating. On the 31st, they approached Shilong again, cutting off the Japanese army's rear lines. Fierce battles occurred between Zengcheng and Conghua from the 31st, where the Japanese army's Nomura, Fukuda, and Takahashi units suffered heavy losses in Taipingchang and Rongshupu. On New Year's Day morning, the Japanese army counterattacked towards Dagangling and Shuicao, engaging in fierce battles with Liang Shiji and Kong Kequan's divisions in the villages of Shangang and Shabei. Both sides engaged in artillery battles all day. The Japanese army reportedly built defensive fortifications in the mountainous areas of Chicao, Duncun, Sanbaidong, and Gouer. The battles continued until the evening of the 2nd, when the Japanese army retreated towards Zengcheng. A regiment of infantry and a large battalion of artillery that entered Zengcheng seemed determined to hold it. The Wang Dequan, Peng Linsheng, Chen Gongxia, Liang Shiji, Hua Zhenzhong, Kong Kequan, and other divisions of the Guangdong Army that withdrew from the Yangtze River have moved south along the Yuehan Railway and arrived at the northeastern front, advancing towards Shangang and Guizui. Also, on the 31st, Changning, Futian, and Lianhe were recaptured by the Chinese army. Currently, Huang Tao's division, comprising the three brigades of Lian Tisheng, Chen Fengzhao, and Wen Shuhai, is surrounding Zengcheng. These three brigades are also under the command of Zhang Ruigui. The Guangdong Army is simultaneously surrounding Shilong and using large forces to pressure the front lines of Zengcheng and Conghua. Furthermore, it is reported that nearly one hundred Japanese warships and motorboats are concentrated at the White Goose Pool in Guangzhou. Because the highways along the East River have been blown up by the Chinese army, and Shitan, Shilong, and Dongguan are surrounded by the Chinese army, the Japanese side has changed to supplying grain and machinery by waterway, landing at Taiping, Shuijing, and Humen to support Shilong. It is rumored that the Chinese army captured Zengcheng on the 6th, and the Japanese army retreated to Xintang, Da Mao Mountain, and Shitan, where they are currently in a stalemate. The fighting on the Shilong front is also fierce. Street fighting occurred in Shilong City on the 6th, and the Wanlong Highway Bridge was blown up. The war on the East River is progressing favorably for the Chinese army.

### Japanese Army in Hangzhou Panicked, There is Talk of Retreating

Hangzhou Correspondence: Yamata, the Japanese commander in charge of Central China, has, due to the fact that the Japanese army stationed in various parts of Zhejiang Province has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and has suffered heavy losses, and also because the Chinese army is about to launch a major counteroffensive along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, reportedly planned to withdraw the troops from Hangzhou. On the afternoon of the 12th, he sent a special envoy to Hangzhou to convene a meeting of military officers stationed in Hangzhou at his residence. The content of the meeting was extremely confidential. The next evening, the special envoy invited foreigners from various church groups and other organizations in Hangzhou to a banquet. During the banquet, the special envoy told those present that "the focus of the war has now shifted to the South China area, and there is no need to hold this place. We plan to transfer the troops. However, once the troops are transferred, the Chinese army will inevitably take the opportunity to enter. But once occupied by the Chinese army, there will inevitably be massacres. Therefore, we ask your groups (referring to churches, etc.) to quickly organize an international refugee shelter to provide protection," and so on. All the foreigners present did not express any opinion upon hearing this. It is heard that the special envoy's request for friendly nations to organize the so-called international shelter was decided after several discussions between the special envoy and Wang Ruiqing and others, the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, for the sake of preserving their lives.

### Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Army Outside the South Gate of Yangzhou, Japanese Army is Empty, Total Number of Soldiers is Less Than Four Hundred

Yangzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Yangzhou was transferred to invade Tiangchang and Deyi, it suffered heavy losses and the interior is extremely empty. At around 7:00 AM on the 7th, a Chinese bomber flew in from the west and circled in the air before dropping three bombs on the Japanese army's positions outside the South Gate, and then flew away safely. The Japanese losses are unknown, but the situation was extremely panicked. The Japanese army, unable to cope with the constant attacks from the Jinan team, dispatched fifty or sixty puppet pacification soldiers to Deyi to reinforce the defenses and protect the construction of the Yang (zhou) - Tian (chang) highway. Japanese military police commander Tsuchiya and special operations squad leader Gui Goro both went to deploy defenses. Currently, there are only two hundred and several dozen Japanese soldiers and more than one hundred puppet soldiers in Yangzhou, totaling less than four hundred.

### Battle Report of the New Fourth Route Army Recapturing Yanli Town, Commander's Instructions Before Departure, Political Instructor Taking the Lead

The English "Shanghai Evening Post" says: The Fourth Regiment of the New Fourth Route Army gathered in the mountains several miles outside Yanli (transliteration) Town, taking a day to rest, inspecting and wiping their guns. Experienced soldiers often showed smiles at the corners of their mouths, appearing excited, and often sang songs such as "Chop hard at the heads of the devils... Kill, kill." After dinner in the evening, they went to bed almost immediately. Before midnight, they were ordered to get up and assemble. At this point, all the new recruits knew that they were about to go into battle. At this time, the commander was already waiting, and began to speak in a gentle tone, saying, "We will attack Yanli Town. There are about one hundred enemies in the town, seventy rifles, and two machine guns. There is a small squad of enemies on guard on the east side of the town. There are no sentries otherwise. The enemies are all in the Great Temple in the center of the town. We will begin the attack before dawn. The terrain of the town is at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by roads. There are two small paths on the left side of the town. Eat at one o'clock, and prepare to depart at four o'clock. We will divide into four routes. One-third will take the offensive on the front, and two-thirds will attack from the sides using the small paths. Those taking the small paths must set out half an hour early and wait quietly for the attack. Those of us taking the offensive must use bayonets and hand grenades, and engage the enemy in close combat. Check your bayonets and hand grenades, and make sure they are ready." After the commander finished speaking, the political instructor stood up, raised his fist, and shouted, "Armed comrades, we are ordered to wipe out the enemies and drive them out of the country. How about it?" The soldiers shouted, "Of course, of course." The instructor shouted again, "There are not many enemies. We believe we can fulfill the order. We must do our best and annihilate the enemies before sunrise tomorrow. Then we will win a great victory." The soldiers all shouted, "Good, good." At three thirty, two teams began to advance towards the town along the small paths. At four o'clock, the third team also set out. They did not speak a word, and walked forward quickly. The commander and the political instructor took the lead and led the third team to within half a mile of the town, and a few hundred yards away, a Japanese sentry was walking back and forth. Two soldiers were dispatched to stab the Japanese sentry to death as quickly as possible. The commander then ordered the attack, and the political instructor raised his Mauser pistol and shouted, "Follow me," and the soldiers followed him forward. Although a few sentries put up a hasty fight, the attack was extremely rapid, and the sentries were immediately wiped out. At this time, the main force of the Japanese garrison in the Great Temple in the town had awakened and hurriedly put on their clothes, grabbed their guns, and resisted stubbornly. However, the other two teams had also attacked, attacking from both sides, simply and quickly. When the rising sun rose, the battle had ended, and the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth was raised high over the town. In this battle, sixty Japanese soldiers were killed, two were captured, and the rest escaped. On the New Fourth Route Army side, five people died for their country and were immediately buried. Fifteen were wounded and temporarily sent to the rear for treatment. The next day, a memorial service was held for the fallen, with two or three soldiers reporting on the battle and the glorious martyrdom of the five. A victory message was also reported to the General Headquarters, which also held a memorial service, with the political instructor giving a speech to those attending, saying that we must remember the fallen with our own courage and must take them as our example. Several days later, when the wounded soldiers were transferred to the hospital, the commander would personally comfort them and encourage them.

### The Japanese and Puppet Troops are Besieged in Linyi City, Japanese Troops on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are Moving Northeastward Day After Day, Many of the Old and Weak in the Hometown of Xiang Yu are Killed, Villagers in Shuanggou Organize a Non-Recognition Association

Huaiyin Correspondence: The total number of Japanese and puppet troops in Linyi County, Southern Shandong, is approximately five hundred. Some time ago, they invaded Chuanjiazhuang, Sanguanmiao, Weitun, and Shilibao, all of which are subordinate to Linyi County. However, they were met with fierce counterattacks from the Chinese army and local self-defense forces and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, in recent days, they have only been able to huddle inside the city and have not dared to invade the countryside again. Unexpectedly, yesterday, more than two hundred puppet troops, accompanied by six fake cannons, led by Kuroda, fled along the Lintai Highway towards Taierzhuang. They were ambushed again by the Chinese army at Location X, with an estimated fifty Japanese soldiers killed. The survivors fled back in a panic and cowered inside the city. It has been found that there are approximately two hundred Japanese bandits and two hundred puppet troops in Linyi, for a total of less than six hundred. In the past two days, they have forcibly gathered local people to build a highway from Linyi to Taierzhuang in order to prevent the Chinese army and guerrillas from cutting off their retreat, as they have repeatedly tried to escape but have been ambushed by the Chinese army. Also, some time ago, the Japanese and puppet troops invaded Fujiazhuang, which is subordinate to Linyi, and also repaired the highway. It is also reported that the Japanese and puppet troops are actively repairing traffic routes, apparently intending to invade Tancheng and threaten Canghai. The Chinese army is now making careful preparations.

Xuzhou Intelligence: There are approximately five hundred Japanese soldiers in Xuzhou. Japanese troop trains are heading northeast on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway every day. There are approximately two hundred Japanese soldiers in Jing'an Town, northwest of Xuzhou.

Suqian News: The Suqian puppet Maintenance Society is located in the North Warehouse Elementary School. The chairman is Chen Jingli (nickname Chen Fu Dwarf), the vice-chairman is Xu Chengkui, and the propaganda team leader is He Chunting. The Japanese army went to the refugee shelter at the Catholic Church in Suqian to take away seventy to eighty refugees, and their whereabouts are unknown. Near the former residence of Xiang Yu south of the city, more than one hundred elderly female refugees were killed. Wang Yan, who was already eighty years old, was also killed under his bed.

Shuanggou News: The villagers in the area are deeply angered by the looting of the puppet "Xixi County Government" and have secretly organized a "Non-Recognition Association." They do not recognize any organizations of traitors. The association has hundreds of guns and is strong. Traitor Zhang Dehui was killed by dozens of members of the "Non-Recognition Association" at the Xu Family Village northeast of Shuanggou. Zhang fled to Shuanggou with his head in his hands, and his henchmen went to ... entered ... by the Yellow River dike, and were met by the association ... gunfire suddenly erupted, and several puppet ... troops of the traitor were wounded.

### Eastern War Zone – Chinese Troops Strive to Recover Hangzhou

Large Contingent of Chinese Troops Arrive at Haiyan – Japanese Spokesperson Admits Without Objection – Yuanhua Unscathed After Bombing

According to foreign sources, guerrilla warfare near the suburbs of Hangzhou has become increasingly active recently. Chinese troops have crossed the Qiantang River and reached the Haiyan area, numbering over 8,000. This number has been admitted by the Japanese spokesperson. However, the spokesperson remained silent about news from the front lines, further confirming that the news of the Chinese guerrilla forces' great victory is not a fabrication.

Suzhou Area – Heavy Losses for Japanese Troops

Furthermore, it is reported that in the Suzhou area, the Chinese guerrilla forces engaged the Japanese troops in 309 battles, large and small, last winter. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses, with a total of 4,505 deaths. The Chinese troops also seized a considerable amount of war booty, including 1,442 rifles, 328,000 rounds of ammunition, 70 machine guns, and a steamboat.

Japanese Troops Near Suburbs – Transferred to Hangzhou and Jiaxing

The situation in Hangzhou is widely rumored to be extremely tense. Observations of the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai also support this. According to Chinese sources familiar with the suburbs, the number of Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shanghai has decreased significantly in recent days, with the majority being transferred to the Hangzhou and Jiaxing areas. Currently, the number of Japanese troops stationed near Shanghai is very small. For example, the Shanghai High School, located at the intersection of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in western Shanghai, was originally an important stronghold for the Japanese troops in western Shanghai. Usually, the school housed over 500 Japanese troops, sometimes as many as 1,000 or 2,000, but now there are fewer than 100. Longhua has only a little over 100, Hongqiao has only about 20 injured, and Beixinjing has only a few dozen. The Lincoln Road Japanese Headquarters, which governs the defense of the Shanghai suburbs, including the Toyota Japanese troops, also has no more than 300 men. The defense is weak, an unprecedented situation since the withdrawal of the National Army from Greater Shanghai. As a result, guerrilla teams in western Shanghai have been very active recently. As for the eastern suburbs, the number of Japanese army troops has also decreased significantly, with the defense largely taken over by the Japanese navy. The Japanese military strength in the suburbs has been drastically reduced, so they mostly hold fast to their strongholds and dare not go out to prevent guerrilla attacks.

Attacks on Yuanhua – Still Unsuccessful

The Japanese troops have deployed reconnaissance posts along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, with guards of one or two sentries for security. Unexpectedly, in the last ten days, they suddenly strengthened their defenses, dismantling civilian houses along the line to obtain bricks and wood to build small bunker-style observation posts, manned by Japanese soldiers armed with machine guns. The situation is extremely tense. However, Chinese troops continue to arrive, crossing the railway as if entering an uninhabited area. The Japanese troops originally planned to attack Yuanhua in three routes, from Zijingshi, Haizha, and other places. One route still attacked Lujialan, and another route went to Baishiqiao and Xintangqiao, with minor clashes. The Japanese troops retreated back to Daoxi and other places. On the 2nd, 120 Japanese troops, using local collaborators as guides, advanced to near Maqiao, and made brief contact with Chinese troops, but dared not penetrate deeper and retreated immediately. On January 7th, Japanese aircraft dropped four bombs on Yuanhua Town. One fell on the firewood yard of the Cha Xijiu family, destroying one main beam. One fell on the Dafenzhou farmer's family, killing three sheep. One fell on the Hexiaofang Cha house, destroying a corner of the house. One fell on a match poplar tree at the Maiyuqiao bridge in Yuan Town, killing a dog. However, the Japanese troops have not forgotten the guerrilla forces in the Yuanhua area, and are still thinking of attacking.

### Sudden Rise in Rice Prices in Shanghai – Guilds Exert Utmost Effort to Suppress

Reduced Inventory in Inland Areas and Higher Grain Prices – Japanese Smuggle Hundreds of Thousands of Units of Grain Monthly

Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been soaring. Market forces are working hard to suppress them, and public sentiment has been somewhat stabilized. The price increase is entirely due to the Japanese army seizing rice in all locations, smuggling it out, leading to a reduction in the rice inventory in inland areas, and the Japanese puppet regime’s increasing taxes. The details have been investigated by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency as follows:

Japanese Smuggling – Reduced Inventory

The Japanese army is carrying out large-scale seizure of rice in the occupied areas of Wuhu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiujiang and Zhenjiang, smuggling approximately six to seven hundred thousand units per month. This rice is taken directly from farmers by force by threatening them to lower the market price. Then it is shipped by ship to Hongkou, and then reloaded for export. Therefore, it is quite difficult to exercise the functions of customs officials within the Japanese army's sphere of influence, so the Japanese army dares to be so bold. For several months, the inventory in inland areas has gradually decreased. Now it is the time when winter transitions to spring, and the supply of rice cannot meet the demand. The rice price in all locations has increased.

Delayed Supply – Rice Price Soars

Recently, after the price of rice in various producing areas has risen sharply, general traders and firms dare not import too much, fearing that they will suffer losses after arriving in Shanghai. At the same time, the Japanese army's increased collection of illegitimate taxes has further increased the burden on traders. Due to these various reasons, the supply of rice to Shanghai has suddenly stagnated. Currently, only four to five thousand units of rice are shipped from inland areas to Shanghai every day, while the daily sales in Shanghai are over ten thousand units. Since the transactions are not as numerous as before, the rice price has soared when the market opens every day. Compared with the transaction price last week, it has increased by sixty to seventy cents, with the best white rice approaching thirteen yuan. The high-quality indica rice from various firms is already approaching twelve yuan.

Market Suppression – Yesterday Slightly Returned to Normal

In view of the continuous increase in rice prices and the increasingly tense market situation, the Market Management Committee of the Bean and Rice Industry Association has specially set up suppression measures for the sake of maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. Therefore, after the market opened at 9:00 am yesterday, transactions were still frequent, and the market price continued to rise. After the market tried its best to push it back, it began to fall at the close of the market, which was similar to the market situation on the previous day (the 16th), and people's hearts gradually became stable.

### US Fleet Commander – To Go to Wuhu Today – US Consul General to Accompany

US Fleet Commander Admiral Kimmel will take a warship up the Yangtze River today (the 18th) directly to Wuhu. US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will accompany him. He is expected to return to Shanghai on the 24th.

### European Immigration to Shanghai – Has Become a Serious Problem

London and New York Seem to Have No Hope of Assistance – Conference Is Financially Distressed and Finds It Difficult to Maintain

—More Than a Hundred People Have Received Capital to Do Business—

The North China Daily News reported that in September of last year, an International Committee for the Relief of European Refugees was established in this city, with the aim of raising funds to relieve European refugees coming to China. It does not discriminate against refugees based on nationality, race, or political belief. Prior to this, there was a group for the relief of German Jews coming to China. Because the two groups have the same purpose, they work closely together. The funds raised are sufficient to provide comfortable food and lodging for the refugees coming to Shanghai. However, at that time, the Levinah Jewish Organization said that China was affected by the war, and the refugee problem was quite serious, so Shanghai could not take care of the large number of refugees coming from abroad. However, immigrants from Central Europe continue to come to Shanghai, and the Jewish organizations already established in this city cooperate to take care of them. At the same time, the organizations sent letters and telegrams, reporting the serious refugee problem they encountered to charitable organizations in London, New York, Paris, Singapore, and other places. However, because these organizations also have to take care of Central European refugees and have their own complex problems, the assistance that this city receives from these organizations is very small, totaling only one hundred pounds from London, two thousand five hundred US dollars from New York, and several thousand units from Singapore and Hong Kong. However, the Shanghai organizations have requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Council, consulates, and the American Advisory Committee for the Relief of Chinese Civilians. The Advisory Committee also telegraphed the American Red Cross in Washington, D.C., requesting assistance. At the same time, the continued arrival of refugees in Shanghai is not only continuous, but also has the risk of being endless. A month ago, an Italian mail ship brought 550 people. Currently, there are about 1,750 people in Shanghai, and many more have already set out or purchased ship tickets, preparing to come to Shanghai. Neither Shanghai nor London nor Paris nor other organizations can stop it. The refugees who arrive in Shanghai all explain the reasons why they have to leave their old places. It is pointed out that it is difficult to prohibit these people from boarding the ships. The organizations in this city, due to financial constraints, telegraphed London, requesting immediate assistance and have received a reply, inquiring about the number of refugees who have arrived in Shanghai and are on the way, and the amount of funds required to maintain them. From this, it can be proved that the relief committees in this city can hope to receive assistance from overseas. However, to this day, two weeks have passed since the reply telegram, and judging from the actual situation directly obtained, London and New York seem unwilling to allocate funds to Shanghai. According to sources from responsible parties, the committees in this city have raised eleven hundred thousand units so far, but now it has all been used up. A small number of refugees can still get assistance from relatives and friends overseas, and some do not want to ask for assistance from the committee and sell their jewelry to make a living. However, over 90% are penniless and must rely on public donations. Only a small number of refugees have found jobs in this city. Some who have medical experience are hired by the committee to serve in inland hospitals. The committee is now considering that instead of continuing to provide food and lodging for these people, it would be better to provide some capital to enable them to do business themselves, so that they do not have to continue to give them food. This goal has greatly progressed after Sassoon donated one hundred thousand units. So far, 125 refugees have applied to resume their businesses and have been approved by the conference and have now begun their new lives in a foreign land. Other applicants are currently under investigation. This plan will be temporarily suspended only after the funds have been exhausted. However, there are still a large number of immigrants who have not been able to obtain jobs or who cannot do business in this city due to a lack of experience and language difficulties, and they still rely on the committee. The conference is financially distressed and finds it increasingly difficult to maintain them.

### Opening of the Northern District – Still a Distant Prospect

The Japanese side said that it is still under discussion, but they cannot explain the details

The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 16th), when the Japanese side received reporters, a reporter asked the Japanese spokesperson what he had to report about the return of the area north of the Suzhou River to the management of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The spokesperson replied that it is currently under discussion. As for the rumor that the Japanese Residents Association has requested that the area be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council, he had no information and could not explain under what circumstances the area could be recovered by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Dense Fog Hinders Navigation – Ships Blocked at the Wusong Estuary

The English-language Great Evening Post reported that today (the 17th), news was received from Yokohama that the President Harrison was delayed for three days due to encountering a storm before finally arriving at Yokohama. At the same time, shipping in this city was also blocked at the Wusong Estuary and the Yangtze River Estuary due to dense fog. Around 10:00 am, not only had the fog not dissipated, but it seemed to have become even thicker. All ships, tugboats, and barges traveling to and from the sea were also affected.

### Bond Interest Paid by Chongqing – Bondholders Gladly Accept

Central Bank Obeys Head Office Telegram – National Debt Committee Draws Lots as Usual

The Ministry of Finance notified the customs authorities that the redemption and interest payment of the bonds would continue as usual, but the payment would be changed to the Chongqing head office. The details are as follows:

All Bondholders – Have No Objections

Bondholders who have domestic government bonds guaranteed by customs duties, trust certificates, gold bonds, etc., are grateful for the government's maintenance of creditworthiness and protection of bondholders' interests, and have repeatedly paid huge sums of money to pay on schedule. This is because the customs duties within the war zone have been seized and all deposited in Japanese banks. The Ministry of Finance announced that customs-guaranteed compensations would no longer be allowed to overdraw. They believe that this is a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the government were to make long-term advances, it would be truly lacking, so they were happy to accept it without any objections.

Promulgation of Chongqing – Payment Method

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank sent a telegram to the Chongqing head office a few days ago to inquire about the case of the change in the redemption and interest payment of public bonds to Chongqing. A reply telegram has now been received. The redemption and interest payment of the five types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E of the unified public bonds due at the end of this month and the recovery public bonds due at the end of February will be paid in full by the Chongqing Central Bank head office. If bondholders want to receive the soft currency from the Shanghai Central Bank and the China and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau entrusted by it, they must be paid in six installments. The detailed arrangements for the full payment of the Chongqing Laiqing and the Shanghai installment payments have been promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, but the above detailed arrangements have not yet arrived in Shanghai.

Public Bond Draw – Held as Usual

All matters relating to the drawing and redemption of domestic public bonds are handled by the National Debt Gold Custody Committee. It is stipulated that a public bond drawing will be held in Shanghai every month. The sixth decision on the redemption of the Revival Public Bonds was held on the 10th of this month. The seventh redemption of the Unified Public Bond Class A Bond was scheduled to be held on February 10th. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Kid Committee that the Chongqing payment has been decided, but the detailed arrangements have not yet arrived in Shanghai. As for the subsequent unified, recovery, gold, and special public bonds, the drawings are held as usual because no order has been received from the Ministry of Finance. The government is determined to maintain its creditworthiness for internal savings.

Shanghai Installment – Reasons for Payment

A leader in the financial industry told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that the government's maintenance of the credit of domestic public bonds has been consistent from beginning to end. The payment of interest in Chongqing is not overdue. Because all bondholders have the principal and interest due and can receive it in full from the Central Bank head office in Chongqing. As for the Shanghai installment payment method, because Shanghai is an occupied area, it is to prevent a huge amount from flowing in and the excessive amount of currency in the Shanghai market. At the same time, the government has already restricted the transfer of funds from the mainland to Shanghai. As of now, the Silver and Money Industry Association has not received an order from the ministry, but in fact, there is no need for the two guilds to forward the order. It is reported that the Central Bank has obeyed the order.

Bond Market Yesterday – Slightly More Stable

In the informal securities trading market in Shanghai, after the Ministry of Finance announced that the duty-guaranteed securities would no longer be allowed to overdraw, all bonds of the Unified Public Bonds fell across the board the day before. Yesterday, because it was rumored in the market that the Unified Public Bonds due at the end of this month would be paid as usual, and the payment of interest in Chongqing was not overdue, the bond market was slightly more stable, and the decline was less than one unit. The closing price of Category A bonds was 55.8 units, down 0.7 units from the previous day; Category B bonds were 49.5 units, down 0.5 units from the current day; Category C bonds were 48.8 units, down 0.2 units from the previous day; Category D bonds were 48 units, down 0.5 units from the previous day; and Category E bonds were 48.3 units, down 0.3 units from the previous day.

### After the Failure of the Japanese Puppets to Manipulate the Labor Movement – Ambitions Not Extinguished and Still Trying to Act

Again Using Wang Jingwei's Name to Lobby Everywhere – Various Trade Unions Issue Declarations Rejecting Deception

The Japanese puppet regime, trying to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement, organized the "China Workers' Welfare Association" and urged trade unions to join, but was severely rejected. The association was unable to expand its affairs. The Japanese side has stopped providing subsidies, and the work has been suspended. In recent days, several members of the association have been active again, saying that they were entrusted by Jingwei to establish a labor movement organization in Shanghai to respond to the peace movement. Yesterday, various trade unions in the city issued a declaration, stating that they would strictly adhere to their positions and would not be tempted at all. The details have been investigated by a reporter from Modern News Agency as follows:

Pseudo Welfare Association – Work Suspended

The pseudo "China Workers' Welfare Association" hosted by the Japanese puppets is headed by Hu Shouchang, the pseudo "Social Director", with Lin Qijiong as the secretary-general, and the Japanese, Miyata Kyusho, as the instructor. Since it was announced "established" last year, it has used "relief of unemployment" as a slogan to tempt trade unions to cooperate. However, the persons in charge of the trade unions all understand the righteousness and strictly refused, causing the association to be helpless. So, they gathered some unemployed people and fabricated the names of trade unions, carrying out self-pulling and self-singing. As for the actual situation, it is completely empty and powerless. Hu Shouchang, Lin Qijiong, etc. took this to the Japanese to fraudulently obtain huge amounts of funds. Soon, the Japanese learned of the situation and immediately stopped the subsidies. The association, with no funds, fell into an invisible standstill.

Using Wang's Name – Attempting to Resume Activities

Ever since Wang Jingwei betrayed the party and the country and issued the "Yan telegram" in Hong Kong, advocating surrender and peace with Japan, it has aroused unanimous condemnation across the country. In order to rectify discipline and express the determination to resist, the central authorities have already expelled him from the party forever and removed him from all positions. Therefore, Jingwei is now despised by the people of the whole country. However, the Japanese puppets, thinking that he was once an advanced figure in the country, still tried to use him to complete their dream of peace. Recently, in order to do so, the "China Workers' Welfare Association" sent minions to act everywhere, claiming that they were authorized by Jingwei and enticing people with huge activity funds, planning to reduce the number of labor groups, hoping that various trade unions would participate. However, the truth of this ghost trick can only entice some ignorant workers. As for the responsible persons of each trade union, they can all discern the hidden dangers and have never paid attention to it.

Various Trade Unions – Issue Declaration

Yesterday, various trade unions in the city issued a joint declaration, saying that since the Japanese army moved out of Shanghai, the trade unions in the city, although limited by the environment, have automatically stopped political activities, but their loyalty to the party, the country, and their leaders has remained unchanged from beginning to end, and they will persist without wavering. They will spare no effort to eliminate any enticements or threats from the Japanese puppets. The organization of the pseudo "China Workers' Welfare Association" is only the behavior of some idle people in the name of fraud. The labor circles in the city have never participated in it. Recently, some people have used the name of Jingwei to organize workers' organizations in Shanghai, hoping to promote the "peace movement". Whoever proposed it and what the background is, is not difficult for discerning people to imagine. The labor circles in the city deeply understand the righteousness and will never be deceived by it. However, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be shameless people who borrow the name to sell out the country and try to deceive others. Therefore, we hereby solemnly declare to be observed by all circles.

### Real Estate Transactions in the Foreign Concessions:  Small Properties in the Western District Are More Active,  Central District Real Estate Remains Stagnant,  Investment Motives Also Differ From Before

Shanghai is one of the world's ten major commercial ports and the most important port in East Asia.  Due to various special political and economic relationships, it has developed its unique character, promoted its unique development, and thus created its unique status.  In the ninety-odd years since the opening of the port, the population has increased daily, and land prices have soared.  In the past, the market price per mu was only 15,000 to 30,000 or 50,000 cash coins, but later it rose to 500,000 yuan per mu.  In the past, real estate was an important object for financial institutions to secure loans and for investment purposes.  However, since the "January 28th" incident, there has been a very significant decline, especially in the formerly prosperous Public Concession.  Since the "August 13th"

War Began

People from the inland areas have flocked to Shanghai to seek refuge, and since the Hongkou area has not yet been opened, it is said that both the northern and southern parts of the city have turned to ashes.  As a result, the population density in the safe areas of the concessions is unusually high.  Even the areas beyond the boundaries of the concessions, east of the railway line, have been completely rented out.  Therefore, Shanghai real estate, which had been sluggish for many years, has shown signs of activity again.  However, the nature of the real estate recovery after the war is

Different

From the previous real estate boom.  When land prices rose in the past, all investors were happy to buy, and it was very convenient to use it as collateral at brokerage firms.  Therefore, real estate transactions were very easy, consistently reaching around 10 million yuan per month.  Moreover, the larger the property and the better the location, the more valuable it was.  The post-war real estate activity has gone in the opposite direction.  The general public buys real estate only for residential or factory construction purposes.  Therefore, small properties in the French Concession and the Western District, with areas of one or two mu and with residential buildings, etc.,

Have Many Transactions

In addition, there have been some transactions in the areas along Yichang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and Gordon Road, where land can be used for factory construction.  Their value is roughly close to the assessment of the Public Works Department, with better properties being 20-30% higher.  The monthly transaction volume was very small in the first four months of the war.  This is because there were fierce battles in the suburbs at that time, and people within the concessions were uneasy and had no time to consider real estate transactions.  Since May of last year, it has gradually become lively, with an average monthly transaction volume of

About One Million

Yuan.  However, these transactions mostly involve the Western District and small properties.  As for the Central District properties, there is very little activity, and prices remain low and have not risen.  For example, recently there was a piece of land on Hankou Road, with an area of two mu and three fen, which, according to the assessment of the Public Works Department, should be worth more than 287,000 taels, equivalent to 400,000 yuan in current currency.  However, it was recently sold for only 290,000 yuan, including the buildings, which is less than

30% Off The Assessed Value

Another example is a piece of land on Jing'an Temple Road, with an area of five mu and one fen, which, according to the assessment of the Public Works Department, is worth more than 410,000 taels, equivalent to more than 580,000 yuan in current currency.  However, the transaction price (last summer) was only 480,000 yuan, including excellent buildings, which is also only 30% off the assessed value.  In addition, a large property on Henan Road is recently willing to sell for half the assessed value of the Public Works Department, but it is said that it has not yet found a buyer.  It can be seen that the activity of Shanghai real estate is only

Limited To The Western District

And small properties, and cannot be regarded as a universal boom.  The current status of Shanghai is greatly related to the international situation.  In the event of a world war, it would inevitably affect Shanghai, and there is little certainty.  Moreover, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan is deteriorating, and it is uncertain whether it will have any impact on the situation in Shanghai.  At the same time, the general public is

The Value of the Legal Tender

Although they were initially skeptical, after the government's efforts to maintain it, the value has become increasingly stable and trusted.  They are also unwilling to invest heavily in real estate, resulting in stagnant funds.  Therefore, it will take a considerable amount of time for the Shanghai real estate market to return to its past prosperity, and it cannot be achieved in a short period of time.

### General Manager of the Public Works Department, Fankerling, Did Not Visit Fu Xiao'an

Regarding the recent report that the General Manager of the Public Works Department, Fankerling, visited "Fu Xiao'an," it has been learned that on the evening of the 9th of this month, "Fu Xiao'an" visited the General Manager at his private residence and met with him.  "Fu" immediately inquired about the British army's closure of the Huxi Da Xi Road Police Station.  Mr. Fan replied that he was unaware of it and did not comment on it.  "Fu" left after hearing this.  According to Mr. Fan, since August 13th, he has consistently maintained his neutral position.  Therefore, he is willing to meet with any personnel who can improve the local situation in Shanghai, such as eliminating bandits and gambling outside the boundaries of Huxi, and is very eager to do so.

### The Issue of Salaries for the Lone Army: Xie Jinyuan Makes a Solemn Statement: A Statement Has Been Issued by All Officers and Soldiers: All Account Books Will Be Audited by Accountants

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since the loyal and brave Lone Army of the Four Banks moved to Jiaozhou Park, all sectors have been extremely concerned about their current situation. A reporter from this newspaper met with Mr. Xie Jinyuan, the adjutant of the Lone Army regiment, yesterday, and discussed various matters in detail. The details are recorded as follows:

The reporter met Mr. Xie at his residence yesterday. Mr. Xie's heroic demeanor remained unchanged, but he appeared slightly thinner due to recent insomnia. He wore a neat and dignified blue suit made of domestically produced wool. The furnishings in the room were simple and unadorned, with many books on the desk. Mr. Xie initially studied engineering, then studied politics at the Whampoa Military Academy, and later joined the army. He recorded all matters in his diary. His personal life was very disciplined, and he abstained from things like tobacco and alcohol. His attitude was sincere and serious.

Mr. Xie first mentioned his recent insomnia, which had been examined by a doctor but the root cause had not yet been fully identified. However, he believed it was due to excessive mental stimulation. Since his unit's withdrawal from the Four Banks, he had been very grateful for the care and encouragement from people across the country. However, he believed that the duty of a soldier was to defend the country and protect the people. During this ongoing war of resistance, his unit had been unable to continue serving the country and the nation, which caused him deep unease. Currently, all the soldiers are on an isolated island, their hearts are with the country, and their fervent emotions cannot be expressed, which causes them mental distress. This is not only true for himself, but all the soldiers in the battalion share the same feeling. Under these circumstances, the soldiers are able to understand the environment and diligently engage in academic research and physical training, in order to serve the country in the future.

Mr. Xie then recounted that when his unit was fighting in the Four Banks, he stayed awake for four days and nights to deal with everything. At that time, he was so nervous that he only knew that he had dedicated himself to the country and would not hesitate to sacrifice himself. Later, he was ordered to withdraw, and the entire unit broke through the encirclement. The number of sacrifices was less than expected. Even the wounded platoon leader was carried out by the soldiers in the midst of gunfire. This was also because the soldiers were able to understand the great righteousness of revolutionary soldiers, so they were able to overcome dangers as if they were on flat ground. When Mr. Xie spoke to this point, his emotions were very excited and also very sad. He also said that in the past year, he had been negotiating with various parties, adhering to the position of the country and the nation, hoping not to disappoint the ardent expectations of people across the country.

Regarding the external letter about the salary issue of the Lone Army published in a certain newspaper a few days ago, Mr. Xie also mentioned that the officers and soldiers of the Lone Army had already issued a statement yesterday about this matter. What he can say now is that all the accounts of the Lone Army are audited by accountants, and reports are submitted to the relevant parties. All the provisions are provided with the assistance of local people. However, since there is no readily available funds, we often have to cope with raising funds. The soldiers of the Lone Army understand the great righteousness, so although the provisions are sometimes difficult, they get along very well in the same room. Soldiers and officers talk about everything, and they can deeply understand the current situation and the planning of provisions. It is also learned that the issue of provisions for the Lone Army is currently being discussed by all relevant parties to find practical solutions. People from all walks of life are continuing to find ways to care for the loyal and brave soldiers, and it is expected that a solution can be obtained in the short term.

Xinsheng News Agency said: Since the report on the salary issue of the Lone Army was published the day before yesterday, the Lone Army, fearing that it would cause misunderstandings, has issued an important statement in the name of all the officers and soldiers of the Lone Army, stating that they are fully confident in the integrity and incorruptibility of Regiment Commander Xie. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met Regiment Commander Xie yesterday at his convenience. Mr. Xie narrated the matter in detail, and his ardent emotions for the personality of soldiers and the reputation of the nation were admirable. Mr. Xie also said that the salaries and provisions received by the Lone Army before and after have detailed accounts, which are audited by accountants and sent to the relevant parties. It is also a fact that the provisions for the Lone Army are difficult, and they have been able to cope with the situation with the care and assistance of local people. The soldiers of the entire battalion live in the same room day and night, talking about everything, and they can deeply understand the current situation. He admitted that being stranded on an isolated island and unable to continue serving the country caused them great mental pain. Mr. Xie concluded by saying that he is a soldier, and he will uphold the spirit of the past, hoping to promote the glorious history of the Lone Army and not disappoint the expectations of people across the country.

Shanghai Special Edition

### Shanghai Postal Service During Wartime (Continued)

Withdrawal and Collection of Employees in Various Districts

After the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Shanghai, the areas along the transportation lines fell one after another. The employees of the Wu County, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nanjing, and Anqing bureaus under the administration of the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were successively concentrated in Shanghai, while Hangzhou withdrew to Lishui. At the same time, Mr. Chapelin, the French director of the Shanghai Administration Bureau, was commissioned by the Ministry as the Chief Auditor of the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and also managed the affairs of each district.

Withdrawal and Collection of Relocated Employees

As the war shifted westward, the environment in Shanghai became increasingly special, and the pressure exerted on the postal service by the Japanese became increasingly heavy. First, they forced the postal service to move back to its original location. After several negotiations by Mr. Chapelin, it was still ineffective. It was not until March 6, 1938, that the temporary bureau on Yuyuan Road moved back to its original location on North Sichuan Road to continue operations.

Stationing of Japanese Inspectors

In the past, letters from the post office were inspected by personnel sent by the Party Department. The Japanese army also requested this precedent. After the post office moved back to its original location, they stationed 22 Japanese inspectors and began operations. From then on, all important departments such as sealing, distributing, delivering, registering, express delivery, printing, and joint mail had traces of these people. Tens of thousands of pieces of mail were detained every day, with printed matter being the most numerous. Even neutral books and magazines suffered the same fate. Famous Western bookstores in this city, such as Bifa, China-America Book Company, and Dahua Magazine Company, were all spared. Every week, truckloads of detained mail were transported from the post office to Hongkou, often reaching 30 to 40 bags. Recently, under the pretext of preventing the import of military supplies into the interior, parcels along the Jinghu and Huhang lines have also been ravaged.

Increased Use of Japanese Postal Workers

When postal rights were recovered, many personnel from foreign post offices followed and continued to serve in the post office. Therefore, the post office has always had foreign employees. The Shanghai district originally had two Japanese employees, but at this time they were promoted to assistant director and chief inspector, respectively, and one Japanese employee who had already resigned was rehired. At the same time, in June 1938, more than a dozen Japanese translators were recruited, with the reason being "business needs."

Suspension of Stamp Sales

Stamp duty was originally sold by the post office on behalf of the government. After the establishment of the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau," the Japanese forced the post office to stop selling and instead sell the stamps of the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau." The post office announced on June 13, 1938, that it would stop selling all tax stamps on behalf of the government.

Opening of Beijing-Shanghai and Japan Airmail Routes The post office since

### Loans Due for Cotton and Wheat: Japanese Arrogant Statement: Disagreement on Repayment: Attempt to Seize Customs Revenue

According to the Continental Daily, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference yesterday (16th) that the Japanese side does not agree to the repayment of the 5% due on the 1935 US Cotton and Wheat Loan. The situation regarding loans secured by customs revenue remains unchanged. As for the funds currently deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank that may be used to repay loans secured by customs revenue, the prerequisite is that the Chinese Customs fulfill all the conditions stipulated in the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of May 3, 1938. After the environment changed, the direct airmail routes from Shanghai to the interior were all stopped. Recently, airmail routes from Shanghai to Nanjing and Shanghai to Japan have been added. Although this move has no significance, it can also be seen as an accommodation.

Restoration of Business in War Zones

The most notable work of the post office today is its efforts to restore business in the war zones. Since March 1938, news of the restoration of bureaus has been announced daily, including:

March: Liuhe, Zhenjiang, Lishui, Hushe, Puzhen, Gaochun, Wujin, etc.

April: Nanjing, etc.

May: Wu County, Gaozi, Daqiao, etc.

June: Wuxi, Danyang, Longtan, etc.

July: Jintan, Xinfeng, etc.

Shanghai District: Dachang, Jiading, etc.

August: Bengbu, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, etc.

September: Shanghai District: Nanxiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, etc.

October: Various bureaus in Anhui and Huangdu in Shanghai District.

November: Jiaxing, Jiangyin, etc.

December: Wusong, Baoshan, Fengjing, etc.

Although most of the above places are not under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District, they are currently under the command of the director of the Shanghai Bureau. Since Shanghai is the hub for the restoration of bureaus, we must pay attention to them. As for the branch bureaus in this city, except for the 11 bureaus temporarily suspended, including Nanshi Bund, Guoma Road, Dananmen, Longhua, Gaochang Temple, Zhongshan Road, Lao Beimen, North Sichuan Road, West Huade Road, Wenbei, and Baoding Road, others such as Huajin Road, Ximen, Lannidu, North Station, and Tilanqiao have all been restored. As for Youheng Road Post Office, it has been selecting and dispatching Japanese-speaking postal workers to serve since the outbreak of the war, and it has not stopped to this day.

Business Conditions

Before the outbreak of the war, the average daily business of the post office was 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. After the war, it plummeted. Before Guangzhou and Hankou fell, the parcel business developed particularly well, reaching 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per day. Now it is only about 20,000 yuan. Before the war, the postal service's economic income was transferred by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to the Central Bank. Now it is said that it has been changed to foreign (British and French) banks, and it is fortunate that it has been able to avoid the fate of the Customs. Other things that can be described in detail are:

(A) Changes in Airmail Routes: Direct airmail from Shanghai, except for Nanjing and Japan, has been stopped. The air routes in the southwest provinces have been added by China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, including:

Yiyu Line - Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing.

Yurong Line - Chongqing, Chengdu.

Yukun Line - Chongqing, Kunming.

Yujia Line - Chongqing, Luzhou, Xufu, Jiading.

Eurasia Line - via Guilin, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Hanzhong, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Ningxia, etc.

However, mail from Shanghai to various places must first be sent to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Chongqing by Hong Kong-Chongqing airmail.

(B) Collection of Car Transportation Loss Fees: The post office currently relies on cars on the road to maintain transportation, which is expensive. Therefore, books, printed matter, trade contracts, samples, and other heavy items must be charged a car transportation loss fee, calculated as:

Within the province: 2 jiao per kilogram or odd number.

Each province: 4 jiao per kilogram or odd number.

(Inner) Increase in Draft Fees: Draft fees have also been increased due to water replenishment fees, but it varies from place to place.

Other matters such as the delivery of parcels and printed matter change from time to time due to environmental factors, and this article cannot provide a more fixed report. (End)

### Damaged Banknotes:  Collected and Exchanged As Much As Possible

The Ministry Orders All Banks To Handle It Properly  In Order To Maintain Monetary Confidence And Facilitate The People's Use

The Shanghai Money Exchange Association previously had restrictions on the exchange of damaged banknotes by various banks, which was deeply inconvenient. After requesting the Ministry of Finance to facilitate this, the Ministry of Finance has now sent a telegram in reply stating that damaged banknotes should be collected and exchanged in accordance with the method of collecting and exchanging damaged banknotes in order to maintain monetary confidence and facilitate the people's use. An order has been issued to all banks to handle this seriously. According to the previous situation, the Shanghai Bank of Communications, Jiangsu Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Farmers Bank have been telegraphed to improve the situation in a practical manner and collect and exchange as much as possible.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Reduces Tianjin and Beiping Remittance Fees Again: A Reduction of 3 Cents Per Yuan: Remittance Limit of 50 Yuan

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau previously stipulated that from January 1st of this year, for all drafts issued to Tianjin and Beiping, the remittance fee per yuan would be reduced by 7 cents from 20 cents. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the bureau has decided to continue to reduce the remittance fees for Beiping and Tianjin by reducing it from 7 cents to 3 cents per yuan in order to reduce remittance fees for all sectors and provide convenience. This provision has already been implemented, but the remittance amount is still limited to 50 yuan. In addition, remittances from Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhejiang East counties, and Jinan to Tianjin and Beiping will also be handled in the same way as in Shanghai.

### The End of the 27th Year: Various Industries Begin Preparations: Money Industry Will Hold a Meeting To Discuss Methods

The Shanghai Money Industry Association has decided that February 18th will be the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Various industries are aware that the end of the year is approaching and have already begun preparations. They have been trying to recover outstanding loans and are also transferring funds to ensure a smooth transition. At this time when the end of the year is approaching, the Shanghai financial market is very stable, and national goods factories have shown abnormal development. The Money Industry Association has also scheduled an executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss preparations before and after the end of the year.

### The General Police Department Cracked a Large-Scale Thief Gang: Si Xian, Yong An, Etc. Were All Robbed: Mingxing Pawnshop Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods

Recently, there has been a large-scale dealing organization in this city, with most of the main criminals being Cantonese. They often appear in major companies on Nanjing Road, and the Mingxing Pawnshop at No. 512 Tianjin Road is said to be their main base for selling stolen goods. Because of their superior skills, they have never been discovered. Recently, however, Li Jincheng and Han Shoushan, detectives from the General Police Department, have detected their activities. They

Arrested the Following

Thieves from this organization: Cantonese Wong Hoi-chan, Chan Ah-fook, Tsui Ah-fat, Sung Bing; Hoi-mun native See Lai-sang; Shao-hsing native Tao Ka-nung; and Cantonese Tan Nam, Li Chuen, Fok Yu-lam, Wu Yat-wai, etc., who specialize in receiving stolen goods, for a total of ten people at the Great Eastern New Hotel on Bali Bridge Road in the French Concession and other places. It was discovered that recently, they had stolen from Si Xian, Yong An, Xin Xin, Lihua, and other major companies, as well as Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin Bureau, Nanyang Socks Factory, etc., no less than

Sixty to Seventy Times

or more. The stolen items are worth approximately several thousand yuan. When Mingxing Pawnshop receives these stolen items, they sometimes do not even issue pawn tickets. When the police officers arrive, they simply explain the situation and immediately hand over the pawned items in their entirety, without the need for the detectives to specify which items should be retrieved. There is no doubt that they are knowingly

Receiving

Stolen goods. In the afternoon of yesterday, Special Court Judge Fung Sai-tak held a hearing on the case. According to the police lawsuit, the two companies that were stolen from the most times were Lihua and Xin Xin, followed by Si Xian and Nanyang. The police lawyer Yu Bo-yi prosecuted Tan Nam, Li Chuen, Fok Yu-lam, and Wu Yat-wai for habitual receipt of stolen goods, while prosecuting them for habitual theft. Chan Ching-wo, an employee of Mingxing Pawnshop, was also

Accused Of

Receiving stolen goods. Representatives Chan Kwai-sang, Wong Sung, and Cheung Kwong-yu from Si Xian, Yong An, and Xin Xin were also brought to the case. The stolen goods retrieved from this case, worth over a thousand yuan, were all brought to the court by the detectives. According to the lawyer representing the pawnshop, Chan Ching-wo has died. Therefore, the prosecution for this part will be corrected by the police. After Judge Fung investigated the lawsuit in detail, he ordered a new hearing to be scheduled.

### Extorting Vegetable Vendors: Reported To The Police And Arrested: Hou Qi And His Accomplices: Re-Trial

Vegetable vendor Tong On-kat, who lives at No. 19, Lane 81, Hardoon Road, has a smoking habit. At about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lau Yu-chun, Kam Hoi-chiu, and Lui Chun-pang, three men from Yangzhou, posing as police detectives, broke into Tong's home and demanded 120 yuan, threatening to take Tong into the police station if he did not pay. Tong, in a state of panic, paid 20 yuan first, and agreed to pay the remaining 100 yuan at 8:00 PM that night. Lau and his accomplices then left. However, Tong was not willing to give in and reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detective Leung Yuk-leung and police officer Leung Chun-shan to wait for them. When Lau Yu-chun came alone at the appointed time, he was arrested by the police. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer Lai Chi-shan prosecuted him for extortion and disturbing the peace under Articles 346 and 158 of the Criminal Code, and requested a new hearing to be scheduled as his accomplices were still at large. After a brief interrogation by Judge Chueng, he ordered the suspect to be detained pending a new hearing.

### Funeral Home Manager: Pelted With Filth

Hu Chun-wah, a 38-year-old native of Wuxi, the Chinese manager of the British-owned Dazhong Funeral Home on Yanping Road in western Shanghai, lives in the building. Hu also holds a position at the China Credit Bureau. At around 10:20 AM yesterday morning, Hu left the funeral home in his private car, number 1948. As he passed the wooden bridge near Changping Road and Yanping Road, a young man, about 20 years old, suddenly stepped forward and threw a piece of leather paper filled with yellow and white filth at Hu's face, causing Hu's face to be covered with fecal matter, and his whole body was stained. The filth-thrower then left quickly and was not apprehended. Hu immediately returned to the funeral home to clean up the filth and investigate the filth-thrower.

### Robbery In Lafei Fang: One Thief Arrested: Attempt To Escape With Stolen Goods, Maid Chases And Shouts For Help: Police Arrive And Arrest Him Head-On

At about 6:00 PM yesterday evening, five robbers, dressed in clothing of varying lengths, suddenly arrived at the home of Dr. Yang Choi-chi, a gynecologist specializing in obstetrics, at No. 46 Lafei Fang, Lafei Road in the French Concession. Under the pretext of seeking treatment, they took out guns and threatened the occupants, and arbitrarily searched and robbed the home. They then left through the back door to escape. At the time, one of Dr. Yang's maids, who was very alert, saw the robbers leaving in a hurry and bravely chased after them, shouting for help. At that time, one of the robbers, in desperation, fired a shot to warn the pursuers. The other robbers then fled in different directions. One of the robbers, dressed in black shorts, ran out of the main alley, past the guard's post. Tang, the guard, had already heard the shouts for help and saw a person running frantically. Knowing that the person was not a good person, he also followed and chased him out of the alley. He chased him to the corner of Masnan Road, where a Chinese police officer, who had also heard the alarm, arrived head-on. The police officer drew his gun and ordered the robber to stop. The robber then surrendered and was arrested. At the same time, the French General Police Department received a report and arrived in patrol cars. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives first guarded all the alleys of Lafei Fang, cut off traffic, and conducted a thorough search, but found nothing. Afterwards, the victim, Dr. Yang Choi-chi, went to the police station to report the robbery. The arrested robber was interrogated strictly by the police chief, and then ordered to be detained pending trial in the Second Special Court.

Sun Bing-chung, etc., representatives of the employees of the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Exchange, and the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Exchange were involved in a salary dispute. The Second Special District Court sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting mediation. The Chamber of Commerce accepted and appointed members Xu Jiqing, Pei Yunqing, and Xu Xiaochu, and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui and accountant Xu Yongzu to handle the matter together. It is heard that this case has been mediated by the Chamber of Commerce after summoning both parties separately for a total of seven times, and persuading them earnestly again and again. When their opinions were quite close, they invited both parties to conduct a practical mediation, discussed and determined the method of maintaining the minimum living expenses, and signed a settlement agreement. From now on, both parties will fulfill the agreement. The Chamber of Commerce will copy the agreement and send it to the court for filing.

### International Hotel Waiter Dies Tragically in Jump
### Addicted to Gambling, Excessive Spending Leads to Despair and Suicide

Mu Sang Guoliang, a twenty-eight-year-old waiter at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road and a native of Yangzhou, had worked at the hotel for four years. He was usually capable in his work and thus deeply valued by the hotel. He was promoted to his current position two years ago. He lived at No. 70, Lane 82, Gordon Road, Avenue Edward VII. His mother worked as a nanny for foreigners and recently returned to Shanghai from abroad with some savings. Guoliang was her only son, so his mother

Excessively Pampered Him

However, Guoliang was addicted to gambling. Since Shanghai fell last year, gambling dens have sprung up everywhere in the western part of Shanghai. Guoliang frequented these places but always lost, spending a large sum of money. Soon, he had his mother go to the bank and withdraw 600 yuan in cash. Unexpectedly, he lost again and falsely claimed that the money was stolen by pickpockets. Although his mother loved him deeply, she was filled with anger and repeatedly warned him, but to no avail. Sang had been married once, but the relationship was cold, and they soon divorced. He recently became engaged again, with the wedding set for the Lunar New Year. Because he was penniless and in urgent need of money, he borrowed 200 yuan in cash from a friend the day before yesterday. After finishing work, he took the money to a Hollywood gambling den, intending to

Make a Last-Ditch Effort

But he lost it all again. He returned to the International Hotel at dawn, and in his remorse, he conceived the idea of suicide. Around six o'clock, he went straight to a window on the fifteenth floor. A colleague was cleaning up and saw that Sang looked depressed. When asked what was wrong, he said he was getting some fresh air. Taking advantage of the colleague's inattention, he immediately jumped from the building and fell onto the road, breaking his right arm and left leg, with blood splattering everywhere. The scene was tragic. A police officer quickly called for an ambulance, which took him to Baolong Hospital, but he died from his critical injuries.

### Cotton Crushes Laborer to Death

Yesterday morning around eight o'clock, dozens of laborers were unloading cotton at the No. 4 warehouse of the Japanese-owned Tongxing Zhangtao Factory on Gordon Road in western Shanghai. Unexpectedly, many bales of cotton on the upper level suddenly fell, crushing Ji Yuanhong (age twenty-nine), a laborer from Jiangbei. He was severely injured internally. Although his colleagues rescued him on the spot, he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died.

### Iron Bed Shop Fire Kills Nine People
### Shop Owner Turns Himself in to the Police
### Police Charge Him with Negligence, Ordered to Be Detained and Re-examined

The Yongxinglong Iron Bed Shop at Nos. 334-336 Avenue Edward VII, is owned by Fan Delong from Jiangxi. The downstairs is entirely shop space, while the upstairs, in addition to a part where Fan lives himself, is rented out to others. The shop has fire insurance with Tianyi Insurance Company for 10,000 yuan. On the fourteenth of this month, a shop assistant named Han Baolin (age thirty-nine) from Zhejiang and an apprentice were packing turpentine for painting beds into small cans. Some of the oil inevitably leaked onto the floor. This oil was made of chemical mixtures and was

Extremely Flammable

At that time, after Han finished packing, he took out a cigarette and lit it. At 12:55, after he finished smoking, Han threw the cigarette butt on the ground, which was stained with oil. The fire immediately ignited and spread to the canned turpentine, causing the fire to suddenly expand and become uncontrollable. It immediately burned through the ladder, causing many of the people living upstairs to jump from the windows to escape the disaster. Those who

Failed to Jump

were either burned to death or injured by the fire. After the fire brigade heard the news, they rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire, preventing it from spreading to other houses. Only the entire building of Yongxinglong was destroyed. Afterwards, Chief Detective Cheng Renkun of the General Inspectorate found that Fan Delong's wife, Fan Chen, his concubine, Liang, his sons, Pei Ji, Ming Cai, and Hai, and tenants Chen Mao, Zhang Mingsheng, Zhang Zhenzhen, Han Baolin's son, Han Borong, and maid Zhu Xiufeng

Were All Burned to Death

In addition, Zhang Xu, Jiang Zhou, Cai Kaide, Cai Kaixing, Cai Wenyin, Cai Fengxian, and Cai Ying, seven people, were burned. In addition to the dead being sent to the morgue for examination, the injured were sent to hospitals for treatment. After causing the disaster, Han Baolin was once dazed by the smoke and then became mentally confused, wandering on the road all night. He did not go to his friend Li Ruilin's place at No. 305 Avenue Edward VII until yesterday. After discussion, Han decided to

Turn Himself in

Detectives determined that Han should be held responsible for this incident and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged him with arson of a dwelling occupied by people and negligent manslaughter under Articles 173 and 276 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was needed, he requested that the hearing be postponed for two weeks. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Han was ordered to be detained and the hearing was postponed.

### Smallpox Rampant in Concessions
### Mortality Rate Increases

The Continental News reports that in the week ending last Saturday (the 14th), eighty-six Chinese and three foreigners died of smallpox in the two concessions. The second highest mortality rate was from tuberculosis. Many died of typhus in the French Concession during the same period, while only one person died in the Public Concession. Also, during the same period, the total number of deaths in the Public Concession was 1,222 Chinese and seventeen foreigners. In the French Concession, the figures were 237 Chinese and eleven foreigners.

### Robbery on Tiantong Road

At around 5:45 yesterday afternoon, two thugs suddenly broke into the home of a certain family at No. 4 Guiren Lane, Tiantong Road. One of them held a handgun and threatened them to remain silent. They were robbed of 300 yuan in legal tender and fled. The victim reported the incident to the police for investigation.

### Pan Sheng-san's Home Robbed of Large Sum in Broad Daylight
### Robbed of Over 20,000 Yuan in Cash and Jewelry
### Western Newspapers Claim Pan is a Pro-Japanese Figure

Yesterday at about 10:30 AM, seven bandits came to the home of Pan Sheng-san, who used to run an inland river shipping company, at No. 10, Lane 126, Kinnear Road, Jessfield Road. Four of them had handguns. They intimidated and threatened everyone, first confining all the male and female servants in one room, and then stationed one bandit outside to keep watch. The rest swarmed upstairs, ransacking the place and looting at will. They robbed the family of over 20,000 yuan in currency and jewelry estimated to be worth over 7,000 yuan in foreign currency. They took the loot and left with a whistle. Afterwards, the victim filed a loss report with the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting that the bandits be arrested and brought to justice.

The English-language North China Daily News stated that seven Chinese men went to the home of a Mr. Pan at No. 10, Lane 126 Kinnear Road, Jessfield Road this morning (the 17th) and robbed him of 20,000 yuan in cash and 7,000 yuan in jewelry. This was the second major robbery within 36 hours. It is still unknown whether this gang is the same group that robbed a coal shop on Xin Zha Road of 30,000 yuan at midnight on Sunday (the 15th). If so, they have already stolen 57,000 yuan. If not, the police will have to deal with two major gangs. It seems impossible for such a robbery to occur on the streets of the district with police officers patrolling day and night, but the gang actually did it. In addition, the robbery location is at a corner, only a few steps away from the Jessfield Road police station, which is staffed by puppet police and Japanese soldiers. The seven bandits waited this morning for an opportunity to avoid the police patrol before sneaking into the lane. At 10:30 in broad daylight, they told the Pan family that they were delivering gifts to their master and entered the house. Four of the thieves, dressed in Western suits, were all armed with Mauser pistols. The homeowner had no choice but to let them do as they pleased. The Pan family had a lot of jewelry, which was all looted. The homeowner's own possessions were not spared either. Then they forced Mr. Pan to hand over the key to the safe, stole 20,000 yuan in cash from the safe, and fled. After the robbery, Mr. Pan reported it to the police. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station began investigating. Many believe that Mr. Pan is a pro-Japanese figure.

### Rickshaw Industry Firmly Opposes
### Cutting Handles and Changing to Wheels
### Letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association
### Another Appeal to the Municipal Council

The Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association of this city sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday, asking it to send another letter to the Municipal Council protesting the cutting of handles and changing of wheels. The letter stated that the association had previously sent a letter to the council on December 13 of last year, arguing that the council's decision to cut short the handles of rickshaws was unreasonable and would affect the livelihoods of its members. The letter strongly stated the reasons why the handles should not be shortened, asking that they still be allowed to be used as usual, and that the council should prescribe the style for new cars manufactured in the future, gradually improving them to maintain the livelihood of the coolies. The letter also requested your association's assistance in this matter. More than a month has passed, and the council has not only failed to reply, but in addition to shortening the handles, it has also forced the installation of two-inch wide iron rims, causing the members' vehicles to be unable to obtain licenses to operate in recent days, causing panic. They have flocked to the association, begging for

Ways to Relieve Their Suffering

The association, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, convened an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors on January 15. They all agreed that the rickshaw industry is made up of poor coolies who cannot afford the high cost of living in the concession. As a result, many live in the outlying areas of Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City. Therefore, during the

Outbreak of the August 13th Incident

they bore the brunt of the fighting, with numerous deaths. Although Shanghai is more prosperous than before the war, in reality, it is due to the large number of refugees from the interior, resulting in abnormal development. The rickshaw industry relies on commercial transportation for its livelihood, but it has not

Achieved Development

Opportunities. The rickshaw industry was previously dominated by natives of Nantong, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou. After August 13th, new members from Pudong, Suzhou, Chongming, Songjiang, Jiading, and other places were discovered, indicating that the number of members in the industry has increased rather than decreased after the war, and the hardship of life has become increasingly tragic. In recent days, members who have registered with the association and requested that the council be negotiated with have been found to be living in refugee shelters. Therefore, it is obvious that they cannot afford the cost of the

Unreasonable

Improvement of vehicles by cutting short handles and retrofitting iron rims. However, while the association cannot fully agree with the council's style of vehicle improvement, it should do its best to support it in a way that combines law, reason, human feelings, and mechanics, without harming the principles of business operations and livelihoods. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to send a letter to your association, asking it to forward it to the Municipal Council,

Striving for the Cancellation

of the decision to cut short the handles and retrofit iron rims. Before the market recovers after this war, existing rickshaws should still be allowed to operate as usual. If the council believes that rickshaws do need to be transformed, then the council should prescribe the style and gradually improve it when new cars are manufactured in the future, so that the truly obsolete cars will be eliminated invisibly, without affecting the livelihood of the coolies.

### Heavy Fog in the City Yesterday

The weather in the city was very warm for the past few days. The highest temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer during the day rose to over fifty degrees, like the weather of early spring. Unexpectedly, after a rain the day before yesterday, heavy fog suddenly appeared yesterday morning. From six to seven o'clock, you could not see your fingers. Trams, buses, and businesses operating on the roads all turned on their electric lights. The northwest wind gradually tightened in the afternoon, and the weather was also colder. Although it did not rain, the sun did not appear all day, and the fog did not dissipate all day.

### Japanese Transport Ship Sinks Two Fishing Boats
### Two Fishermen Missing

At 0:30 PM the day before yesterday, a small boat towed five fresh fish boats out of the South Huangpu River. Each boat was full of fresh fish caught from the upper reaches of the various inland rivers in the Pujiang River, intending to be towed to the puppet "Fish Market" in Yangshupu for sale. Unexpectedly, when passing through the blockade line at the 16th pier, a small Japanese transport ship was heading south from the north at that location to supply the Japanese army with food in the South Huangpu River. Because it was traveling too fast, it was unable to turn in time and suddenly collided with the last two fish boats, capsizing them together. The fresh fish carried by the two boats were all dumped into the river, causing losses of about two or three thousand yuan. Two fishermen were also missing.

There has been no news of him ever since. His family is very anxious. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please notify them immediately so that they can be reunited as a family. It would be a great merit.

### Family Members of Political Figures
### Abuse Their Adopted Daughter

The wife goes out to play mahjong late at night, instructing her adopted daughter Lian Zhen to wait and open the door, and beats her severely if she is not compliant. The court will hear the case soon.

The Shanghai office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association received a report from a concerned person on the fourteenth of this month, stating that Mrs. Liang, who lives at No. 60, Lane 363, Gordon Road, was abusing her adopted daughter, and requested prompt assistance. The office sent staff members Liu Wenlin and Xia Shi to investigate at the Liang residence that afternoon. When they arrived, Mrs. Liang had gone out to play mahjong. Her biological daughter and adopted daughter Lian Zhen were both at home. They questioned them in detail. Liang's biological daughter was sixteen years old and studying in junior high school at a certain school. From her tone, she expressed great dissatisfaction with the adopted daughter. She said that my mother

Goes out to play mahjong

and doesn't come home until eleven o'clock. She told Lian Zhen to wait and open the door, but she is naturally lazy and falls asleep before Mom comes back. People like that deserve to be beaten. During the conversation, the biological daughter's face revealed a fierce and arrogant demeanor. Then they questioned the adopted daughter, Lian Zhen, and learned that she was eleven years old. They asked why she was beaten by her mother. At first, she was unwilling to speak, but after repeated persuasion, Lian Zhen burst into tears and said that she left her home in Nanjing in May of last year. A person she didn't know very well took her to Mrs. Liang's home to be an adopted daughter. My

Real Father's Surname is Zhang

My mother has also studied. At my own home, I have an older sister and four younger sisters. My father isn't just annoyed because there are too many girls. He sold me to Mrs. Liang as a servant. I didn't know that here. I have to do everything by myself. If I accidentally do something wrong, my older sister will twist me down, cover my mouth with a towel, and then my mother will punch me with her fists or pinch me with her fingers.

The Scars on My Body

Always heal on this side, and then a new one is added on the other side. I still have a scar on my thigh now. Just now, when you two gentlemen came, I was downstairs boiling water to wash my older sister's feet. Now my mother likes to play mahjong, and sometimes she wants to play jai alai. I have to guard the door for her all the time, and I can't sleep. Lian Zhen, as she recounted this, exposed her right thigh, and there was indeed a large scar on the inside of it,

Showing a Purplish-Black Color

The staff members sent by the Children's Welfare Association, seeing this situation, believed that there was factual proof of Mrs. Liang's abuse of her adopted daughter, and that her biological daughter was also involved in the abuse. Why would fellow Chinese people on this isolated island harm their own people in this way? In addition, Mrs. Liang's husband is currently working in Chongqing. When the family brought Lian Zhen here in May of last year, was it really an adoption or the purchase of a girl

As a Servant?

Since the name is one thing and the reality is another, it is natural to request that the police and judicial authorities conduct a thorough investigation. The staff members immediately reported the case to the Gordon Road Police Station, and Chief Detective Zhu rescued the adopted daughter Lian Zhen and temporarily sent her to the Jiliang Institute, awaiting the Special District Court's interrogation of the criminal. The trial is scheduled to begin soon. At the same time, according to staff member Liu Wenlin, he deeply regretted Mrs. Liang's abuse of her adopted daughter. According to the orders on respecting children's welfare and prohibiting slavery and raising servants, the government had issued them long ago. We sincerely hope that

Family Members of Officials

will take the lead and earnestly comply with the orders issued by the government. The Special District Court will hear this case soon. We hope that those who abuse adopted daughters will be taught a lesson, and that the future happiness of the girl Lian Zhen will be effectively protected.

### Colds and Coughs are Prevalent
### A Gift of Rapidly Changing Weather
### "Weiling" Effective Medicine Shows Rapid Effect

Colds and coughs are a very common ailment among Chinese people, and they are most common during periods of rapidly changing weather. Because there is usually no danger of life in the short term, everyone regards it as a trivial illness and allows it to heal on its own. In fact, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often start from extremely ordinary colds and coughs. Tuberculosis is definitely initiated by a cough, and the danger is unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, turning into old age cough, asthma, and excessive phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Europeans and Americans regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. Once they start, they are immediately diagnosed and treated to ensure a speedy recovery. Among the common medicines, White Pine Cough Syrup is a natural remedy for coughs. White pine is abundant in northern Europe, and Europeans with lung diseases often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling its aromatic air, which has a miraculous effect. So it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit those who are equally afflicted. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Weiling Drug Store has specially formulated a compound white pine syrup according to the constitution of Chinese people, with the functions of reducing acid, relieving cough, suppressing spasm, and relieving asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, and suitable for both the old and the young. Its effectiveness is more than doubled compared to pure white pine syrup. Those who suffer from colds and coughs should not hesitate. Quickly purchase Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup. The price is one yuan per bottle, a special price of 75 cents. It is sold at the Weiling Drug Store at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Ma Road. The telephone number is 92525. Purchases are not delivered.

### Two Dancers Take Poison
### Wang Aina's Life is in Danger
### Li Mingfei is Likely to Be Safe

Yesterday morning at about ten o'clock, two dancers from the Daxin Dance Hall came to the Continental Hotel at No. 69 Yu Qiaqing Road to rent a room. They were registered in Room 202 on the second floor. The names on the registration book were Wang Aina, twenty years old, and Li Mingfei, eighteen years old, both local women. After ordering tea from the waiter, they immediately closed the door. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, groaning sounds were heard from the room, reaching outside. The on-duty waiter tried to open the door and saw the two dancers lying across the bed in short clothes and small pants, with disheveled hair and bare feet, staring blankly. He knew that they had taken poison. He reported the situation to the accounting room, which reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Detectives rushed to the scene and called an ambulance to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, it was learned that Wang Aina lived at No. 16 Ma'an Lane, Marius Road. She had taken too much poison, and her life was in danger. Li Mingfei's condition gradually improved after being injected and given a stomach wash by the doctor. She refused to reveal her address. The police are currently investigating why the two dancers tried to commit suicide.

### Year-End Approaches, Flower Market Begins Activities, Flower Nurseries are Barren and Supply Decreases

The city is noisy, coal fumes are suffocating. Shanghai has become an isolated island. The desire for ancient trees, clear streams, and simple thatched cottages is unattainable. In summer, there are a few parks to alleviate worries, but in the harsh winter, citizens, besides gathering around the stove, only have fresh flowers in vases as decorations for bedrooms and studies. Therefore, as the year-end approaches, the flower market in this city is extraordinarily prosperous. Florists rely on their earnings from this period for their sustenance throughout the year. Before the war, Shanghai had about 200 flower sheds and nurseries. After the war, flower sheds were destroyed, and with no one to care for the nurseries, they were also in decline. Currently, there are only about 20 flower shops operating as usual in the concessions. According to those involved in the trade, the fresh flower industry is roughly divided into three types: (1) flower shops with nurseries, (2) flower shops without nurseries, and (3) nurseries without flower shops. Most of the 20 or so flower shops in the concession area have their own nurseries. There are still many nurseries without shops scattered in the suburbs, but they have sharply decreased compared to pre-war levels, almost halved. The flower shop business declined sharply in the year after the Shanghai war, but then revived. However, only fresh flowers are available; saplings of woody flowers are virtually nonexistent because the production areas have been cut off, and there is nothing to sell. Now, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the flower market has started to become active. Narcissus and plum blossoms are the most popular flowers. This year, due to increased transportation costs and a double decrease in supply, flower prices will have to rise by 30%. Most flowers entering the concessions now come from Caohejing, whereas previously they came from the Pudong area. The nurseries that used to supply Shanghai from Suzhou and Wuxi have been abandoned and will not be able to recover for a year or two, so the amount transported to Shanghai will decrease.

### Case of the Robbery of a Huge Sum from Yitaixing Coal Depot - Strict Orders to All Police Stations to Apprehend - Total Amount Robbed Reaches 51,000 Yuan

The Yitaixing Coal Depot at No. 184 Xinzha Road was invaded by five armed robbers at 11:10 PM on the 15th of this month. They forced the accountant to hand over the key to the silver chest and robbed the tens of thousands of yuan in cash inside. This was reported in this newspaper. After a detailed investigation by the depot, it was found that the amount of cash stolen reached a huge sum of 51,000 yuan. The matter was immediately reported to the police station for record. The Xinzha Police Station in charge of the area has now issued a strict order to all Chinese and foreign detectives and requested all police stations to pay close attention to the apprehension of all the criminals involved in the case, so that they can be detained and brought to justice for interrogation.

### Truck Accidentally Kills Jiang Pan - Family Demands Compensation - Orphaned Child, Four Years Old, Circumstances Pitiful - Court Hearing Concluded, Verdict Scheduled to be Announced

Jiang Pan, a local young woman residing at No. 4 Renji Lane, Xujiahui Town, was 25 years old. On April 25th of last year, at around 9 AM, she went out to buy vegetables and was walking from north to south in front of Xintai Coal Store at No. 2064 Haige Road. Suddenly, a cotton truck owned by Wu Hengji at No. 9 Youyi Lane, Xinxin Bridge, driven by Wang Rongsheng, came speeding from behind due to

Incorrect Route

and ran over Jiang Pan's left foot, knocking her to the ground. She was taken to Guangci Hospital by ambulance, but died despite treatment. Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, confirmed that Jiang Pan died from the accident. The injury and criminal aspects have already been judged separately. Now, Jiang Junlian, the family representative and legal guardian of the deceased, Jiang Pan, acting on behalf of Jiang Mojuan, has hired lawyer Shen Yide to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special Court, accusing the driver Wang Rongsheng of negligence, resulting in death.

Request for Compensation

The case was heard by Judge Li Liang at 10 AM yesterday. The defendant was absent. Lawyer Shen Yide, representing the plaintiff, stated that the deceased, Jiang Pan, was the wife of Jiang Keji and the eldest daughter-in-law of the plaintiff, Jiang Junlian. She came from a respectable family, was literate, and usually supported herself by making lace gloves. Unfortunately, Keji also died less than a month later, leaving behind a granddaughter, Mojuan, who is only four years old and has no one to care for her.

Pitiful Situation

Moreover, they are now refugees in Shanghai, and the family is extremely poor. The defendant, Wang Rongsheng, was negligent in his duties, resulting in death, and should bear joint responsibility. Therefore, they are seeking damages amounting to 1,560 yuan in national currency. The court examined the evidence and found the case clear. The hearing was concluded and a verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 21st.

Investigation of Counterfeit Goods Sold by the Refugee Vocational Training Center. The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Gordon Road, has been registered with the government and has been in operation for more than a year. It has repeatedly received commendations from the Relief Committee of the Executive Yuan. All its products are known for their low price and good quality and are labeled with the center's trademark to prevent counterfeiting. All service personnel are required to wear badges and carry detailed price lists, and there is never any price gouging or forced sales. Recently, it has been found that a "National Goods Service Cooperative for Unemployed Compatriots on the Isolated Island" is producing inferior towels and other goods, pretending to be products of the center, and sending letters to households forcing them to buy. If this illegal activity is not stopped, it will harm the center's reputation and the refugee production industry. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will immediately call the center at 36403 if they discover such activity so that it can be reported to the authorities for punishment according to the law.

### Bonds - Unprecedented Downturn in the London Translated Bond Market - Customs-Guaranteed Foreign Debt Drops by 5 Pounds

Other Foreign Debts Fall by 4 Pounds to 1.5 Pounds - Domestic Debt Still Wavering, Market Remains Small

The London Chinese foreign debt market on Monday, the 16th of this month, was hit hard when the Ministry of Finance's announcement that it would no longer allow the government to provide overdrafts for customs tax-guaranteed debts if the due funds were insufficient reached London. All bonds guaranteed by customs taxes and the Boxer Indemnity, as well as Anglo-German loans and Daqing Railway bonds, fell sharply by 5 pounds each, while others also fell by 1.5 to 4 pounds. Prices fell to old levels, and the market came to a standstill. Specifically, Anglo-German continued loans and Anglo-French bonds each fell by 5 pounds. The current price of Anglo-German continued loans and Anglo-French bonds is 71 pounds. Sino-French US dollar bonds, excluding interest, have a new price of 68.5 pounds (a fall of 7.5 pounds compared to the previous weekend; subtracting the 2.5 pounds of interest, the actual fall is 5 pounds). Anglo-French loan Anglo-French bonds are priced at 50 pounds. Post-reorganization bonds Anglo-French bonds are priced at 47 pounds. Daqing Railway bonds are priced at 21 pounds. The price of Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds fell by 4 pounds to 20 pounds. Both the original and continued issues of Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds fell by 3.5 pounds to 12.5 pounds.

Longhai Railway bonds are priced at 11 pounds. The price of the Fick Flight Aircraft Bonds and the German-issued Hubei-Guangdong Railway bonds each fell by 2 pounds. The former is priced at 11 pounds, and the latter at 18 pounds. The price of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds fell by 1.5 pounds to 17 pounds. The supply of physical goods in London is still lacking. However, there are still inquiries about the British gold post-reorganization bonds, with 5,000 pounds of Russian-issued unprinted bonds being purchased at a price of 36 pounds, and 1,000 pounds of French-issued printed bonds being purchased at a price of 42 pounds, and another 2,500 pounds being purchased at a price of 42.5 pounds, a drop of 6 to 5.5 pounds compared to the previous weekend. As for Anglo-German continued loan bonds, there is also an appetite for 5,000 pounds at a price of 70.5 pounds, a discount of half a pound to the market price. However, although there are buyers, due to the excessive drop in market prices, it is not certain that they will be able to purchase as desired.

The informal securities market initially showed a change for the better yesterday due to news of remitting payments. However, rumors of deductions for remittance fees caused the bond market, which was starting to recover, to be hit again. According to reports yesterday, although Shanghai can collect on behalf, remittance fees from Sichuan to Shanghai need to be deducted, or payments will be made in installments over six months. In the Ministry of Finance's announcement, it was further stated that the principal and interest of the unified bonds due at the end of this month have already been drawn and overdrawn by the Central Bank for the amount of 17.5 million yuan, so payment will be approved. Rumors are rife, and no one can agree. Before the official announcement, fluctuations are inevitable. To sum up the above statements, there are two points: one is that in addition to income tax, there will be an additional loss of 15% on the principal and interest due this time; the other is that after the principal and interest due this time are paid off, there is an implication regarding the seventh interest payment in the current announcements, which has aroused great suspicion among the general public. As a result, the expected price increase yesterday was thwarted again. However, since remittances are being made, remittance fees should not be deducted. If remittance fees are deducted, then legal tender should be paid. Neither of these two statements makes sense. The installment payment method is too troublesome for the banks, and the government is unlikely to adopt this method. If legal tender is paid, it would conflict with the independent suspension of foreign debts. Therefore, these rumors are unlikely to materialize. In short, the problem with the principal and interest of public debt is already an undeniable fact; the only question is the size of the loss to the bondholders. When the market first opened in the morning, major players such as Gu and No. 11 bravely absorbed bonds, with prices improving by 1 to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Just as things were looking good, most retail investors, Xieda, and No. 35 continued to sell, and the market felt an oversupply, causing prices to gradually decline. The smaller the market price, the stronger the selling trend. In the morning, only A and E bonds improved slightly by 0.05 to 0.03 yuan, while the rest fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The situation became even more chaotic in the afternoon. Xieda and No. 35 continued to sell, mostly day traders exiting positions. No. 20 exclusively sold A bonds. The panic in the market did not diminish. On the buying side, only Hengde had a larger appetite, while the rest were not eager. The situation was extremely chaotic, showing the uncertainty of the people. However, the general consensus is that the government will do its best to maintain domestic debt. The sellers who are creating trouble themselves will inevitably be ridiculed for being foolish. The market will not stabilize until the official measures are announced in detail. As a result, market prices continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Stock trading remained sluggish. Only a small number of shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 57 yuan.

### Finance - Hong Kong Turns from Selling to Buying - Exchange Market Experiences Turmoil

US Dollar Once Reaches 16 Yuan - Sassoon's Sales Cause Slight Relaxation

The exchange market yesterday experienced fierce turmoil due to news that Hong Kong had stopped selling and started buying, as well as strong absorption by Chinese merchants such as yarn and cotton groups and continued settlement by foreign firms. The underlying trend continued to be tight. British gold became extremely tight at 8 1/8 2.1875, the US dollar almost broke the 16 yuan mark, and the Hong Kong dollar also reached 55.25 yuan. It finally relaxed slightly after Sassoon started selling. Transaction volume remained strong throughout the day.

Early in the morning, long-distance and short-distance rates in London were declining, the New York spot rate was unchanged, and London bullion was also declining by 1/8. The exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar was 0.06, against the French franc it was down 0.12, and against Shanghai it was unchanged. The US dollar fell 0.01875 against the British pound, 0.0625 against the French franc, and 0.07 against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates remained unchanged. At the early opening, the selling price of the spot market was 8 1/8 3.328125 for the British pound and 16.21875 yuan for the US dollar, tightening by 0.015625 for the British pound and 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams indicated that selling had stopped and buying had started, and foreign firms also started buying to settle accounts, causing the underlying trend to tighten. The US dollar immediately weakened to 16.21875 yuan, while the British gold only settled at 8 1/8 3.3125. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices remained unchanged, and the published silver equalization tax was down 0.075. Afterwards, Chinese merchants, such as yarn and cotton groups, competed fiercely to absorb currency, while banks' supply intentions remained sluggish, but their appetite for buying was stronger. As a result, the process became increasingly weak, with British gold weakening to 8 1/8 2.1875 and Chinese banks doing internal trades at 16.125 yuan. The US dollar weakened to only 16 yuan when Datong sold to yarn and cotton groups. Near noon, Sassoon suddenly started selling, and the banks' absorption capacity was not strong, so the situation turned slightly looser. Sassoon sold at a favorable February price of 15.875 yuan. At noon, spot British gold appeared at 8 1/8 2.28125, and the US dollar at 16.125 yuan. At the afternoon close, the continuation was looser, with British gold settling at 8 1/8 2.28125 and the US dollar at 16.15625. The Hong Kong dollar rate was also volatile, with foreign merchants and banks absorbing vigorously, tightening the underlying trend from 55.75 yuan straight to 5 yuan. Later, the currency exchange industry gradually hardened to 5.5 yuan.

In the after-market, foreign firms settled accounts again, so the underlying trend tightened again. It ultimately stabilized as Sassoon started selling again and the banks' appetite for buying was not smooth. A certain British bank was willing to sell at 8 1/8 2.296875, while the US dollar had to be sold at 16.1875. The Hong Kong dollar gradually went from tight to loose, falling to 55.625 yuan. By the late close, the banks' selling prices were 8 1/8 2.296875 for the British pound and 16.15625 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, the British pound weakened by 0.046875 and the US dollar tightened by 0.09375 compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar rate tightened by 0.5 yuan.

### "Crossed" Checks Also Added to Clearing - Effective from January 16

Originally, check clearing was limited to remittance checks. However, starting from January 16 of this year, all "crossed" checks will also be included in the clearing. They will first be deposited into the money industry's reserve, and a receipt will be issued before the accounts are reconciled.

### The Hong Kong Syndicate and Wealthy Households' Desire to Buy Resurges, Spot Prices Climb Again, Reaching $2027 Yesterday, Resulting in Another $10 Increase

Yesterday's spot gold bar market saw an initial rise, but fluctuations were frequent. Generally, prices moved from rise to fall and then rose again, entirely dependent on the buying and selling momentum. Initially, the market continued the previous day's upward trend. News spread that foreign exchange was tightening due to aggressive buying by Hong Kong, foreign firms, and speculators. Furthermore, the Hong Kong syndicate, which had been inactive for some time, also engaged in large-scale buying, causing the opening price to reach beyond the $2020 mark. Later, as foreign exchange stopped tightening and began to ease, the buying momentum temporarily subsided. However, as gold shops and securities firms rushed to sell, prices declined slightly. Eventually, due to the resurgence of the Hong Kong syndicate's desire to buy, prices rose again, closing at the day's highest point. While there was considerable maneuvering during the day, no excessively large fluctuations occurred. Confidence among all parties remained firm. Trading was brisk in the morning but turned quiet in the afternoon. Gold jewelry shops also marked up by one dollar in the evening. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline slightly.

Gold Bars Close at Peak

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened firm and strong, continuing the previous day's momentum. Foreign exchange also gradually softened, and the Hong Kong syndicate's buying interest was very strong. It was reported that buyers initially bid $2030, while sellers asked for $2035. Subsequently, a certain cash firm suddenly began selling heavily, while buyers hesitated. As a result, prices were lowered by about ten dollars before a cash firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2022, the opening price. Following this, a money exchange business bought another fifty taels from a cash firm for $2024, then fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2025, and fifty taels from a gold shop for $2024 (reportedly, all these purchases were on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate). Later, gold shops began selling again, and securities firms also showed interest in selling, causing a slight drop in prices. A gold shop sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2023, and a securities firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2022. In between, a certain jewelry shop suddenly absorbed supply on behalf of wealthy local households, causing prices to rise by several dollars. A jewelry shop bought fifty taels from a fellow shop for $2025, and fifty taels from a money exchange business for $2024. After this, foreign exchange stopped tightening and began to ease, causing a further decline. Prices were lowered to around $20, but it was still difficult to find buyers. At this point, the Hong Kong syndicate suddenly instructed a certain money exchange business to aggressively buy at the low prices, causing prices to rise again. A gold shop bought 100 taels for $2021, a jewelry shop bought fifty taels from a money exchange business for $2024, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2025, and then fifty taels from a gold shop for $2027. Finally, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a gold shop for $2025, the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange was very stable, both price fluctuations and trading volume decreased. At 2:45 PM, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a gold shop for $2025, and then another fifty taels from a fellow shop at the same price. After this, supply and demand became even scarcer. It wasn't until after 4:00 PM that a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2027, the closing price for the evening session, which was ten dollars higher than the previous day's closing price (a cumulative increase of thirty-two dollars over three consecutive days). The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was $2035, and the buying price was $2020. The current bid gold was listed at about fifty dollars lower than the listed gold, but no transactions took place.

Jewelry Gold Marked Up by One Dollar in the Evening

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael did not change initially. However, at 4:15 PM, due to the firm stability of gold bars, the price was marked up by one dollar. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qing Yun, and others revised their selling prices to $206, while new firms set their prices at $204, and the buying price was $198.

English Pure Gold Further Reduced by One Penny

London, 16th: English pure gold continued to decrease by one penny, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, eight and a half pennies, causing the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold (gold bars) to also decrease to $1214. The listed customs gold also fell by two points, calculated as two dollars, three dimes, nine cents, nine mills. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also decreased by six jiao, calculated as one thousand two hundred and nine dollars, three dimes.

### There Is No Shortage of Foreign Currency Collecting

Yesterday, English pure gold continued to fall by one penny, and the exchange rate between English and American currency continued to rise by 0.1875. Due to nervous sentiment, foreign exchange opened weakly. Later, as the supply from foreign telegrams was smooth, even though demand was urgent, supply still exceeded demand, and market prices eased, but were still tighter than the previous evening. Gold bars opened at a high point, and although jewelry shops and gold shops took advantage of the high prices to sell, the absorption by wealthy households was very strong, and the Cantonese syndicate searched relentlessly, so market prices remained high throughout and there was no possibility of a fallback. Because the supply of chips was exhausted, it was difficult to resist the search of wealthy households, so the price was raised very high, and the trend was firm. Unless major players emerge, it is difficult for market prices to fall back. Because foreign exchange was weak and gold bars rose sharply, foreign currency prices were very strong, and retail investors who absorbed English, American, and gold pound tickets to collect were very active. Trading in Japanese gold tickets was also particularly strong, and the upward trend was sharp. Association transactions were rare, only Chen Tai sold fifty pounds of English gold tickets to Chang Tai Jin, Chang Tai sold twenty pounds of English gold tickets to Zhen Xing Jin, and Chen Tai sold thirty pounds of English gold tickets to Zhen Xing Jin. Yesterday's market price was up four jiao for English gold pounds, up one jiao two fen for English gold tickets, up jiao jiao for American gold pounds, up two fen five li for American gold tickets, up one fen three li for Hong Kong tickets, up half a li for French franc tickets, up one fen for Singapore tickets, up two fen for Dutch tickets, up five fen for Canadian tickets, up two fen for Philippine tickets, up four fen for ruble tickets, up five jiao for Australian gold tickets, only German gold tickets, Italian tickets, Annam tickets, and Siamese tickets did not change.

### Price of English-Indian Silver Falls Back

London, 16th: Speculators once emerged, lacked maintenance, market conditions were still flat, and after the close, there was flatness with sluggishness. Sellers were willing to go six and a quarter points below the list price, but buyers had no appetite. The near and far term prices for large bars of silver both fell back one and a quarter points. New York silver telegraph: The price of American silver is still active without a market. Also, Bombay silver telegraph: The market conditions for Indian silver are calm, spot prices fell back three annas, and near and far term prices also fell back one anna.

### Discount Rate Gradually Stabilizes

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn notes gradually stabilized, fluctuating between thirty-six and thirty-seven dollars per thousand yuan throughout the day, and finally thirty-six and a half dollars, which was slightly higher by two jiao five fen than the previous day.

### Oil Cakes. Soybean Oil Prices Are High. Only Fifty Barrels Are Traded. Futures Speculators Are Selling Back

Dalian spot soybean oil: Yesterday's market continued the previous day's soaring trend, rising another half a jiao, with the price at twenty-eight yuan four jiao and a half. However, only fifty barrels were traded, causing futures speculators to also sell back. A total of 120 barrels were traded for delivery at the end of January, with the price at twenty-seven yuan nine jiao and a half. Fifty barrels were traded for delivery on January 20, with the price at twenty-eight yuan one jiao. One hundred barrels were traded for loading on ships in the second half of February, with the price at twenty-seven yuan seven jiao and a half. Other Yantai Qishan oil still held at the original price of twenty-one yuan, with 150 pieces traded. Dalian Qishan oil was 50 pieces, with the price at twenty-six yuan, which was three jiao higher than the market the previous day.

Yesterday, 300 pieces of raw oil came from Yantai.

### Scattered Soybean Cake Transactions. Still Not Deserted. Both Incoming and Outgoing Cake Beans

Soybean cake has recently seen scattered transactions in Wentai, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and other places, which are quite lively, so market prices have frequently risen. Yesterday, the Dayou Yu Factory's Four-Brand Cake opened at three yuan, one jiao, one fen. The Changzhou Xie Feng Factory's Four-Brand Yuan Long Cake also opened at three yuan, one jiao, one fen. The Dayou Five-Brand Cake was further built up by one fen, to two yuan, eight jiao, nine fen. In total, 3,000 pieces of various cakes were traded.

Yesterday, 2,160 pieces of small soybean cake, 490 pieces of large soybean cake, and 150 bags of soybeans were shipped from Che Ning.

Also yesterday, for export, 170 tons of soybeans were shipped to Bombay and 30 tons were shipped to Columbus.

Also, today, 900 pieces of soybean cake and 300 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Xiamen, and 1,500 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk Market: Overseas Silk Markets Are All Soaring

One Theory is That the Number of Silkworms Raised in Japan Has Decreased. The Local Silk Market Has Also Become Very Active.

Yesterday, overseas silk markets all soared. The New York Exchange recently opened at $1.855, a huge increase of four and a half points. The long-term price was $1.79, an increase of one and a half points. New York Japanese silk was 83.75 points, each soaring four points. Shanghai silk 78 points also rose three points, Guangdong silk rose four points, Lyon Japanese silk rose 2.50 French francs, Shanghai silk AB grade each rose from one French franc to 1.50 French francs, while Guangdong silk rose two French francs. The reason, it is said, is that the amount of silkworms raised in Japan this year may be affected by the war and decrease. However, this statement has not been confirmed by reliable sources. The local silk market was greatly stimulated yesterday. The price of white factory 78 points held above $1350, and because the February futures had already been sold out, no sales were heard. The French exchange was very enthusiastic yesterday. White factory B-character uneven silk sold for $1310-$1320, a sharp increase of about 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The fine grade of the Golden Leopard grade has approached the $1500 mark. Ji Xinfu, Cheng Chang, Kaili, and others competed to buy 80 dan in total. After being quiet for a long time, Ji Li Jing was very active yesterday due to the soaring prices of white factories, such as Qilin, Racing Horse, Jin Yang, Spring Water, and other cave numbers, selling for $810 (it had recently fallen to $780), an increase of 30 yuan compared to the beginning of the month. By the afternoon, the asking price for Ji Li Jing had risen to $830. Therefore, yesterday's silk market was said to be very hot. Yesterday, 554 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to France, and 100 tons of tea were shipped to Europe.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Less Than 300 Bales. It Is Also Difficult to Raise the Price of Cotton Yarn

The yarn market initially opened up and then returned, and the resulting upward trend rose and fell inconsistently. It is difficult to break out of the consolidation situation. The reason is that in recent days, the securities market has been turbulent, causing general speculators to be distracted and uncertain. However, speculators are still active and market prices are rising. At the same time, certain colleagues, in view of the chaotic domestic cotton production areas, considered it difficult to see a loosening of prices, and factories earned meager profits. The idea of buying on the rise arose spontaneously, and they suddenly came and received when the price was low, so the market price fluctuated, rising and falling from time to time. Because the price was too high, customer sales were quiet and actual needs were scarce. Also, because the end of the year is approaching, there is usually a closing period in commercial practice, so although speculators are very thoughtful, actual digestion has never started. Therefore, the market price has not been very solid, and the peak returns as soon as it is seen. In the end, it is difficult to be firm without Bao Qing coming to support it.

Yesterday, the opening was based on the same interest payment for public bonds, and people's hearts were shaken. Colleagues and speculators were very active. It was also said that those with abundant financial resources sold public bonds and put them into cotton yarn. The buying interest was strong. The opening price of 20s Double Horse jumped four and a half yuan to 386 yuan. A colleague traded 25 bales, and before long, the Shantou gang came to buy 30 bales, adding another one and a half yuan, to 387 yuan and a half. The market situation was still hard. Although mutual transactions among colleagues could still be supported, customer sales were not healthy. Apart from the Shantou gang buying 200 bales, there were very few other purchases, and the Yunnan gang had no development atmosphere. Market prices turned from high to low, step by step. Finally, the 20s Double Horse yarn was 383 yuan, a decline of four and a half yuan from the high price. It was found that the turnover of 615 bales in the morning was more than half traded by colleagues. As a result, the market price of 20s Double Horse yarn rose by one and a half yuan compared with the previous day, Tiannv rose by one and a half yuan, Te Jin Cheng rose by one yuan, and Double Earth rose by one and a half yuan. Ten-count coarse yarn was also tight. The factory, Yong An Factory, opened 15 bales of 20s Te Jin Cheng, with the price at 390 yuan. Today, forty pieces of yarn were sent to Xiamen, and twenty pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 1,050 pieces of cloth and cotton yarn were shipped from Tianjin, and various gangs bought them.

The sales of Japanese yarn were narrow and people's hearts were calm. 20s Shui Yue yarn was 308 yuan and a half, this month was 306 yuan and a half to seven yuan, and 20s Lan Feng yarn was 306 yuan, this month was 304 yuan seven jiao and a half to 03 yuan seven jiao and a half.

### Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Quiet. White-Wrapped Cotton Is Still Lively

The local cotton business is relatively smooth, but white-wrapped cotton is still hot. Selling prices are still not very different from the previous day, and there is no glory or disgrace to be divided. The situation is increasingly deadlocked. Yong An Factory bought 500 bales of Yao cotton. There was no other major buying appetite. Yu Feng Factory also bought 400 pieces of packed cotton. This cotton is used to mix with Indian cotton for spinning because of its color and luster. As for the source of fine Tianjin velvet cotton, it is solid and lacking.

Foreign cotton market prices: American cotton, because Washington has not yet resolved the issue of selling loan cotton, speculators are hesitant and the banking community is temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. Domestic yarn factories are still keen on importing raw cotton due to the brisk sales of cloth, and they have been actively purchasing spot goods in the market for several days. Yesterday, in New York, the New Orleans gang sold long-term contracts, causing the market price to fall by four or five pounds of sound. Long-term contracts fell sharply by thirteen or fourteen pounds of sound. India, together with forecasts, fell by one and a half robies. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds of sound. Yesterday, the exchange rate was affected by public bonds and could not be extended. Converted into legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by two jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by one jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than one yuan.

The local foreign cotton trade was very quiet. In terms of Chinese factories, in addition to Hong Zhang purchasing 300 bales of Indian cotton and 200 bales of Brazilian cotton, New China also purchased 300 bales of Indian cotton. De Feng also traded 200 bales of Brazilian cotton. The combined price for delivery to the factory was 87 yuan. Japanese factories are still the main buyers. The transaction amount and cotton prices are listed below.

Yesterday, all factories did not adopt the appetite for the number of transactions. Chinese and Japanese factories purchased American and Indian cotton with the Japanese. Therefore, the local cotton position has been completely encroached upon. Therefore, the daily turnover is only a white-like flower embellishment. Although the number of packages is not bad, the carrying fee is very low. However, the purchase by colleagues is still lively every day. It is said that most of them are transferred to a certain factory, and they are mixed and over-reported in the business of colleagues. There is also news that Yao flowers continue to arrive in Shanghai. The amount of arrival is increasing day by day. When they arrive at the factory, the source along the Su North Road is not bad. It is estimated that 2,516 bales of coarse and fine velvet arrived in Tongzhou, and 390 were made in Funing. The transaction volume and price are listed on the left.

The market price of foreign cotton converted is listed on the left.

### Grain: A Foreign Wheat Ship Will Be Imported Today. The Amount is 8,600 Tons. The Spot Flour Market Has No Change

Flour

Yesterday's spot flour market has no change. The sales of this customer are not unique, but scattered embellishments are still not deserted. The Jin Gang and Qinhuangdao and other places shipped 120,000 packages per day. Each ship position for the Nanyang Fu Gang gang also shipped about 10,000 packages. Therefore, the daily turnover is no less than 230,000 packages. The current market of the Second Flour Factory is stable for a long time and is still at 4 yuan and 9 jiao. The market is in a state of brewing.

Today, 2,600 packages of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 packages will be shipped to Weihaiwei, and 8,100 packages will be shipped to Xiamen.

Wheat

Yesterday, the source of wheat, including wheeled vehicles, was no less than 4,000 packages. Each factory's import appetite has been sharply reduced. The market is not unique. It is heard that a foreign wheat ship previously ordered by a certain factory has been loaded and transported to Shanghai by the Jardine Matheson "Bellerby" ship. It will probably be imported today and can arrive at the wharf the day after tomorrow. It can be unloaded early next week. Its amount is 8,632 tons. The local wheat market will inevitably be slightly affected. Yesterday, the Fuxin and Fufeng factories only handled 3,000 packages each, with a total of 6,000 packages traded. The highest price was 6 yuan and 7 jiao. The market continued to be stable.

### There Are Many Japonica Rice Arrivals and Few Sales. Senior Customers of Indica Rice Insist on Not Opening

Japonica Rice

The source has changed and the arrival has increased. There are more than 10 ships down the river and 67,000 packages of wheeled vehicles. The early market was good at the beginning because the weather was cloudy and rainy. Later, the source of arrival gradually increased and the sales market slowed down. The going path of packages from this street and speculators has greatly declined. The market is stable. Thick japonica keeps the original market price and there is no glory or disgrace. And because the going path of thin japonica is allowed to be light, the price is stable and soft. Du Yang埠 sharp japonica follows the japonica market to stabilize. The exchange continues to see a scarcity of goods, and the going path is still hot, but the selling price is already outside 14 yuan, so it is difficult to be higher.

Indica rice

Although the arrival is endless and the inventory is sufficient, this street's various households are still concerned about this sharp cargo due to its high price. Yesterday's market decline was slightly reduced and the market remained stable. The Nanjing sharp tip of Te Gao is still asking for a price of 11 yuan, and the Gao Wu Indica rice is also asking for a price of 10 yuan 7 jiao 8 jiao. However, the incoming households are not as greedy as they were a few days ago. The transactions in the market are all high-quality goods in the large market, Gao Wu Indica rice is 10 yuan 6 jiao and a half, and 10 yuan 5 jiao and a half. The middle and secondary ones range from 10 yuan 34 jiao to about 9 yuan 9 jiao. The total market transaction was more than 1,000 packages.

### Coal: Hongji White Coal: More than 1,000 Tons Arrive

The sales of Hongji white coal have increased sharply, but the accumulation of lump coal here is very rare, so that the supply does not meet the demand. The market continues to be excellent. Yesterday, more than 1,000 tons of the righteousness Thai and Yuding goods in this port arrived, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. The market price tends to be stable. The dismantling price for colleagues is estimated to be 45 yuan per ton for general lumps, 47 yuan for decorative lumps, and 49 yuan for test lumps. For goods leaving the warehouse, add another vehicle force to deliver.

### Piece Goods: Trends of Colored Cloth and White Goods Diverge. The Sales of Fine Twill Are Sluggish and the Selling Market Is Chaotic. The Colored Cloth Market Is Firm and the Output Is Insufficient

Domestic Cloth

The trends of white goods and colored goods diverge, due to different stomach needs and huge differences in sales. The trend of fine cloth and fine twill is sluggish. Only this street bought 50 packages of dyed billet bottom-end fine twill, and the Sichuan gang bought 25 packages of rich and noble fine cloth. The Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shantou, and Hong Kong gangs all have scattered transactions. The market is chaotic. Retailers sell their hand goods for about one jiao cheaper per piece according to the market. The sales of coarse cloth are also good and the price is still firm. The price of fine yarn fabrics is increasing due to the high price of raw materials. The Guangzhong Factory's tribute is offered at 3 jiao, 9 fen, 2 li and a half per yard, and the serge is 3 jiao, 8 fen and 7 li and a half, an increase of 5 li per yard compared to last week. The business of blue cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth is the most brilliant. The Shu Gang added more than 3,000 pieces, and the Yunnan Gang also added nearly 2,000 pieces. The Subei Funing Gang bought 1,300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, serge and Gongni. Shantou's demand is the strongest. Yesterday, they continued to add more than 100 boxes. Tianjin and Wen Yong Gang, and Quanzhou Gang also continued to purchase, so the colored cloth market is firm and the output is insufficient.

Dongbu

The market is firm and stable. The morning market softened slightly, but was aided by the Tianjin Gang's purchase of a large number of transactions. The dyeing cloth industry on this street also immediately tracked and purchased because the sales of colored cloth were not bad, and the price returned to firm. As a result, the middle and upper grades of fine cloth rose by two and a half to five fen compared with the previous day. The prices of bottom-end fine cloth and fine twill of each brand are flat. The Tianjin Gang bought nearly a thousand pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand. The dyeing billet on this street and the wholesale and retail of customer gangs traded about 500 pieces. The tribute and serge of the inner and outer four gentlemen rose by 1 li 2 hao and a half per yard. The import appetite of the wholesale number on this street is still healthy. More than 50 boxes were traded.

Export

### Fujian Education Department: Limiting the Age of Admission to Junior High School. This Year's Junior High School Admission Is Limited to Seventeen Years Old.

(Yong'an Correspondence) The Fujian Education Department, in order to limit the age of students entering junior high school this year, instructed all middle schools in the province, saying, "The standard age of students in junior middle school is 12 years old to 15 years old, which has been stipulated in Article 4 of the revised Middle School Regulations. In recent years, most schools have not complied with this, and it is allowed to be based on the age of students newly recruited this year. According to reports, there are occasionally those who are 18 or over 20 years old, which seriously affects the efficiency of education and should be restricted. Now, in accordance with the regulations and with reference to the actual situation, it has been decided that the age of admission for junior high school students this year should be limited to seventeen years old. Students who are 18 years old or older will not be admitted. Those who have already been admitted should be refunded all fees paid and ordered to withdraw from school. In addition to distributing it, the school principal is ordered to strictly comply with it.

### Experiments in Wartime Education in Hubei (1)

— Chen Jianxiao

Is wartime education the same as normal education? This is a question that educational scholars have debated most fiercely. Those who advocate that wartime education is the same as normal education believe that the two are essentially the same. They believe that the role of education is nothing more than to provide young students with sufficient and sound knowledge and skills so that they can succeed as good individuals and citizens, be able to serve society, and be able to strive for the survival of the country and the nation. In general theory, education is also a tool for continuing the life of the country and the nation, and its function is to store and enhance the spiritual and material strength of the country and the nation. This is the greatest purpose of education, and everyone will agree with it. Education is like this in peacetime, and education should be like this in wartime. Related basic preparation work, like scientific training, only seeks to strive for the construction of systematic knowledge, and then apply it to all aspects to explore the truth, which can naturally respond to infinity. However, this represents one school of thought. Others argue that wartime education and normal education should be somewhat different. In recent years, due to the imperialist ambitions of Japan, demands for education in extraordinary times, national crisis education, and national defense education have been repeatedly put forward. Since the War of Resistance, the call for wartime education or education during the War of Resistance has become even louder. The Ministry of Education has also established a wartime education research association, and educational circles have also initiated the organization of a national wartime education association in Hankou. It can be seen that wartime education and normal education do have some differences. The motivation is nothing more than wanting to use educational methods and forces to adapt to the period of war, or, like China's War of Resistance, various urgent needs, and to implement various temporary training. Therefore, a joint establishment method for secondary and higher schools in Hubei was drafted, which was approved by the Provincial Government Committee and reported by the Provincial Government to the Ministry of Education for record. Moreover, during the summer vacation, Minister Chen expressed his appreciation in person, believing that the principle was excellent and that special attention should be paid to the formulation of the method. Therefore, the work was started. Now, let’s give a general report on the operation of this joint school: (1) The distribution of branch schools dates back to the third phase of the War of Resistance. After the double achievement of Wuhan, the rear became an important town, and all military activities were centered here. Air raids were frequent, and the normal progress of education became almost impossible. Moreover, many educational and cultural institutions in the three towns of Wuhan were destroyed by enemy aircraft, resulting in very large losses. In order to plan for the long-term safety of faculty and students and to facilitate teaching, we planned to establish a large-scale joint secondary and higher school in early August, and set up high school, junior high school, girls’ high school junior high school, normal school, girls’ normal school, rural normal school vocational school, girls’ vocational school, agricultural college, senior agricultural school, senior technical school, senior commercial school, junior agricultural school, junior technical school and other branch schools in remote counties in western and northern Hubei, a total of twenty-two branch schools. Unfortunately, most of the branch schools are still concentrated in the counties of Badong, Enshi, and Jianshi, but this was indeed unavoidable. (2) The planning of branch school buildings: Immediately after the decision to establish the joint secondary and higher schools in early August, the Education Department successively sent nine staff members, including Shu Wenbo and Li Jianqing, to various counties in western and northern Hubei in August and September to survey the school buildings of the branch schools. Later, due to various difficulties such as food supply, transportation, security, and the current situation, except for a few locations that have been changed, the rest have found school buildings in the original towns. Most of them are temples, ancestral halls, or mansions of wealthy families. The Education Department issued repair funds to rush repairs and arrangements. Fortunately, they successively started school from the end of November to December 1st. The repair fee for each school ranged from one thousand yuan to four thousand four hundred yuan, and there were also a few exceptions that exceeded this amount. (3) The establishment of teaching affairs: All teaching facilities of the joint school have an experimental nature, but its curriculum content completely refers to the methods of national middle schools. Through spiritual training, all secondary school students understand a little military subject science, and all college students have a considerable understanding of various departments of job taking. At the same time, the painting, Chinese, and music subjects of umbrella high schools are appropriately reduced, and the time freed up is used to increase military training. Some provinces have even increased the time for military training to seven times that of peacetime. Such examples are too numerous to mention. In short, as the situation has evolved to the present stage, everyone has to believe that in order to win the War of Resistance and build the country, all school rules must be militarized, and all national salvation work must be educationalized. We have already reviewed the training outline for extraordinary times previously stipulated in Hubei, and we have also formulated military training teaching materials. The military training teaching materials for high school mainly focus on soldier training in the first academic year, with eight hours per week, and all students must participate. The second and third years mainly focus on junior officer training, and the time per week is also eight hours. As for students who are physically weak or for other reasons are not suitable for the above training, they are asked to freely participate in one of the five groups of air defense, guard, rescue, civil training, and engineering to achieve so-called rear service training, also eight hours per week. Therefore, from the perspective of facilities, education has indeed become wartime-oriented to meet wartime needs. After I arrived in Hubei at the end of June this year, I engaged in the reform of secondary and higher schools, which was also due to the environment and the situation of the times. All the changes regarding secondary schools do not dare to boast as our original insights, but are just products of the new environment of the great era. The biggest point of this reform of secondary and higher schools in Hubei is to jointly establish all public and private secondary and higher schools in Hubei (commonly referred to as the Hubei Joint School) to unify the will of the education community, value practical education, enhance educational effectiveness, and plan to develop the culture of remote counties in the province, relieve poor and out-of-school youths, and cultivate the vitality of the country and the nation to establish a foundation for the War of Resistance and national construction. Since Mr. Chen Cixiu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, put forward this great proposition, focusing on physical training, academic training, production labor training, and wartime rear service training, he promised not to reduce the original normal education level as a principle, and paid special attention to moral education. In addition to setting up a moral education team leader in each branch school, the number of moral education assistants was set up according to the number of classes in the branch school: one for six classes, and six for twenty-four classes. In addition, the tutor system was strictly implemented in accordance with the Ministry's order, with one to three grade tutors set up in each grade, and the moral education team leader seemed to be a head tutor.

School Overview

### Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School

Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School in this city was founded by Mr. Feng Mingquan of Xiehu and was established on July 7th of the seventh year of the Republic of China. It was initially named Shanghai North Public School, renting school buildings in Sanduoli, North Sichuan Road. The following year, it moved to Yileli and set up a branch school in Qipu Road. In the spring of the thirteenth year, it moved to Qiujiang Road again. In the sixteenth year, it was located in Taichangli on the same road and received rewards and assistance from the Shanghai North Engineering Patrol Donation Bureau. School affairs were developing day by day. In the seventeenth year, the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau approved a monthly subsidy. In the spring of the eighteenth year, Principal Feng Mingquan resigned due to old age, and the board of directors elected Feng Yixian to succeed him. Subsequently, a kindergarten was added and the school buildings were expanded. With the approval of the Municipal Education Bureau, the school was registered and the school name was changed to Private Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School. In the nineteenth year, a girls' department was established, and the number of students reached four hundred. The January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, and the school was hit hard, suffering considerable losses. After the ceasefire, the school was reopened at No. 587 on the same road. Soon after, it was ordered to be renamed Shanghai North Junior High School and Shanghai North Primary School. In May of the twenty-third year, new school buildings for the primary school department were added. In the twenty-fifth year, the number of students exceeded one thousand. The girls' department was rebuilt on the adjacent land. When the August 13th Incident began in the twenty-sixth year, the entire school was destroyed by artillery fire, with losses of nearly 100,000 yuan. In the spring of the third year, at the request of students' parents, a temporary school building was set up at No. 541, North Shanxi Road, and classes were resumed. In response to environmental needs, the Ministry of Education of the National Government was requested to add a high school.

The existing temporary school building is less than one-eighth of the pre-war size, so it can only accommodate more than 500 people (half as many as before the war). There are more than 30 faculty and staff members, such as Feng Zhen and Qi Juechen, who are all former employees. Although the school buildings and equipment are not as good as in the past, the teaching spirit of teachers and students is thousands of times better than before the war. Observing the school, it is progressing more and more. The future development should be limitless.

### Charity Football Match During the Abolished Lunar New Year: Li Huitang Will Come to Shanghai to Join the China United Team as Center Forward. There Will Be Two Charity Matches, Both at Yiyuan.

The charity football match co-organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association has been progressing smoothly since it began to be planned. The preparatory authorities recently consulted with Western football clubs, the person in charge of Yiyuan, and Chinese sports leaders. The result was very satisfactory. It was decided to hold two matches during the abolished Lunar New Year, roughly between the China United Team and the West United Team, and between Donghua and Lido. The dates are the 20th and 21st of January in the Gregorian calendar. The match venues are both at Yiyuan Stadium on Albert Road. The ticket revenue will be used to fund refugee relief, and the International Relief Committee will send a special letter to Zhou Shouchen, inviting the football prodigy Li Huitang to come to Shanghai to participate. It is said that Li has agreed generously. Mr. Li has been away from Shanghai for a long time. His return to Shanghai will definitely cause a sensation, increase revenue, and benefit the victims. Football prodigy Li Huitang has generously agreed to come to Shanghai to participate, representing China United as center forward. This is his original position, and he will definitely attract a large number of fans. In the past two years, he has repeatedly considered giving up his football career, but he has been persuaded by all parties to continue to appear on the green field. This season, the Hong Kong football scene has been extremely excited because of Li's return. However, in addition to participating in charity matches, he does not often play. His performance is still as impressive as it was in his prime. Although he is not as sharp as he used to be, his goal-scoring skills are still amazing. Therefore, every time he appears on the field, there are records. Since Li has been invited to come north during the abolished Lunar New Year, it will be difficult for him to participate in the Hong Kong-Manila inter-port match, because that match is also held at that time.

### New Six Cup Table Tennis Tournament: The Final Will Be Held Next Monday: Qingyun A vs. China United

The tournament committee has decided to hold the final at the Lake Society at 7:00 pm on the 23rd of this month (Monday), and the awards will be presented on the spot. The previous spectator tickets are still valid. The points of sale are Yiqihui of the Silver Coin Association (3rd floor, China Industrial Bank, No. 334 Nanjing Road) and the inquiry office of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jilong, and Li Shuxiong, prominent figures in this city, have jointly sent invitations to more than 50 Chinese and Western friends of the late Mr. Xu Xinliu to attend the final to commemorate him. The prizes for this year's competition will be on display in the window of Sanyou Industrial Company on Nanjing Road from the 21st of this month.

The last match between Zhi Zhi and Muir will also be fiercely competitive. The order for tonight is as follows: Mai Ling Hong - Mai Ling Jin 7:00 PM Aurora Team - Bumping Wall Team (replay) 8:00 PM Zhi Zhi Team - Muir Team 9:00 PM

### To the Fourth District of Guoyang

——A Memoir of Breaking Through from Xuzhou

After half a day of fierce fighting, we finally arrived at Xulu at nine o'clock last night. As we passed through Xulu at night, the enemy who ambushed us abandoned three or four hundred corpses and a large number of guns and ammunition, and fled in a panic.

We shared the captured spoils of war, and the team continued to advance mightily.

The sky was so clear that there wasn't a single cloud. The sun was terribly scorching, and the sand and soil on the road were baked as hot as a red-hot iron pot. The wheat seedlings in the fields lay quietly under the gentle caress of the sun.

There was no wind at all. I dragged a tree branch, and with my feet, which were covered in blisters that had broken and re-formed, then broken a second time and re-formed, I limped along the scorching hot dirt road. I was terribly thirsty, and sweat kept pouring down.

Suddenly, an enemy plane appeared in the sky. The advancing troops immediately hid under the trees and in the wheat fields.

The enemy plane circled overhead once, and when it found nothing, flew away. Then, the troops reassembled into a stream of iron and continued to advance.

As soon as we encountered water, even if it was very dirty, people swarmed around it like a hive of bees, fighting to drink it.

It was already past five o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the fourth district of Guoyang County. This was a fairly large ancient city, but it was already empty, with not a single resident left. It is said that the enemy had occupied this place a week ago, and the enemy's telephone lines were still left outside the city...

I couldn't find anything to eat in the city. Carrying the unbearable hunger and fatigue of not having had a good night's sleep or a decent meal for several days, I went to a stone bridge more than ten zhang long and more than two zhang wide outside the city and sat down to wait for the team to depart.

At this time, the sun had just set below the horizon, and the western sky was a brilliant rosy glow. The evening breeze brought a refreshing coolness that made people feel light and relaxed, gently blowing. Under the bridge was the half-clear water of the Guoyang River, and three or four ducks, whose owners had probably fled to who knows where, were leisurely swimming in the river.

Looking at this poetic scenery, my tense heart, which had been living in battle every day, suddenly became leisurely, and I almost forgot that we were breaking through.

Suddenly, a group of people came across the bridge. Among them were Northeastern soldiers, Sichuan soldiers, Guangxi soldiers... Watching their difficult way of walking, like little old women, twisting their waists as they walked, I almost couldn't help but laugh.

In fact, the way we walked was no different from them, but we had forgotten our own pain.

After midnight, in the bright moonlight, the team solemnly set off towards Guoyang along the highway.

### Morning

— Liu You

The fully grown, large tree, although it has no fruit, is decorated with clusters of green leaves, making it look very young. The small bird, with its newly grown feathers, can already sing very lovely songs, showing that it is a clever little animal. This tree, this little bird, they are the matured buds, they symbolize the morning.

Every morning, I always look forward to it, hoping that this day, this precious day, will not be in vain in my striving journey.

Every morning, I always have a dedication, blessing one day of my life; at this time, I am the most refreshed, the happiest, and it can be said that I am the greatest, the most sincere!

In the morning, I have washed away my sins of yesterday. In my innocent heart, I am about to grasp my perseverance, break out of the thorny bushes, jump out of the rugged paths, and wait for the new dawn to arrive.

From the faint light of dawn until the sun rises high, the radiant sunshine indicates to us a bright future. The high crowing of the rooster is a wake-up call, or an exhortation. The morning will not make us sad or despair in the slightest.

There is a morning every day, and every morning is equally precious. It is deeply loved by everyone.

Every morning is a symbol of us obtaining beautiful fruits!

### Village Chief Chen

— Shan

Dusk and drizzling rain. In the dilapidated hall, the light of day will withdraw its last rays from the window on the table. Three or four villagers, shivering, received certificates from the village chief's hand, blinked their red eyes, and quietly slipped out. Bullets were flying huffily in the sky, landing on the tiles like sparrows. Village Chief Chen put down his pen, looked at the sky, and sighed, as if he had completed a great feat, and became intoxicated with himself. Rain flew in from the half-open window, dripping on the roots of Village Chief Chen's unshaven beard, and he felt cold. At this time, everyone in front of and behind the village had already fled, leaving a few dogs wagging their tails at the village chief by the roadside. The sky darkened further, and the rain showed no sign of stopping. Nearby, it was as quiet as death, while in the distance, there was a constant sound of gunfire, forming a harmonious pattern like falling hail. The dog took a stance and pounced to one side. Following its gaze, it was one of our soldiers, looking around and coming this way. The dogs stood far away, watching him, retreating and barking. Village Chief Chen asked the soldier and learned that he was lost and wanted to go to Taiping Bridge. He suddenly felt the urgency of the situation. He went back inside and saw his old mother fingering Buddhist beads and chanting, with his wife and children standing beside her, each holding a bundle of clothes, preparing to take refuge. Someone rushed in from outside, it was the voice of his close friend Mr. Xue:

"The soldiers are very close, aren't you leaving yet? Don't get caught!"

"We'll leave soon, but I'm afraid there are still villagers who are reluctant to leave. I have to tell them to take refuge temporarily."

Village Chief Chen asked Mr. Xue to sit and wait for a while, then put on his galoshes and hurried out to the bridge. Village Chief Chen himself agreed to be the guide, and turned back and ran home.

"Shen Geng, Shen Geng, light the lamp and come with me, to send a soldier to the front line!"

His son silently lit the lamp and darted out. Mr. Xue stammered that he wanted to go, but Village Chief Chen wouldn't allow it, entrusting him to accompany his old mother at home.

Thus, three people, an umbrella, a lamp, swayed and disappeared into the darkness, gradually only seeing the lamp shaking like a firefly, and then disappeared altogether.

Mr. Xue stayed with Old Mrs. Chen and waited until midnight without seeing the village chief return. Everyone became anxious. The gunfire grew closer and closer, and bullets even fell from the roof, forcing everyone to lie flat on the ground.

It was dawn, and they couldn't move anymore. Enemy soldiers had already covered the village, and the whole village was filled with bullets. Everyone hid, not daring to show their faces. Fortunately, they were not found by the enemy soldiers, but Village Chief Chen had not returned.

After another day, the battle line had shifted. Mr. Xue risked going out and followed the road towards Taiping Bridge. At Yangjia Bridge, the old man in the teahouse cracked open the door and beckoned to Mr. Xue. Mr. Xue flashed inside, and the old man closed the door, widened his eyes, and whispered:

"Has the village chief returned home? That night, he accompanied a soldier and passed by here. The lamp ran out of oil, and he added some here. The gunfire at that time was really frightening. I said let me lead the way, but he wouldn't let me work hard, saying the outside was quite slippery, saving the old man from wearing boots and carrying an umbrella. Since then, I haven't heard of him coming back, and I'm always worried, worried..."

Mr. Xue became anxious and, disregarding the old man's rambling, slipped back onto the street. There were many corpses on the street. After a while, he finally encountered a living person, Wang Si. Wang Si said he saw the village chief sitting by the roadside.

"At this time, sitting by the roadside?"

"Yes, sitting by the roadside. I saw him from afar, it was Village Chief Chen."

The two men went around the piles of corpses and arrived at a place. Village Chief Chen was sitting by the roadside, his eyes lowered and closed, as if he were sound asleep. Shen Geng was lying on the ground, stark naked, covered in blood and gore.

"Village Chief, Village Chief, have you gone to heaven?" Wang Si cried, and Mr. Xue also knelt down.

"Village Chief, Village Chief, we will always remember you!"

### Captured Alive

— Qin Wen

In the evening, two men wearing plasters as badges came to Daotiao Alley to take a look. As soon as they saw the person standing at the door, they rejoiced together, thinking, "We know there must be a young woman here; haha! You escaped us several times before, but this time you can't escape!"

Grinning maliciously, they quickened their pace and headed straight for the target.

As they approached, the woman turned and went into the house, slamming the door shut behind her.

"What! Not letting us in!"

Slightly annoyed, one of them said, and the other kicked the door open, seeing the woman still running in the hall, they grinned again.

There were two men husking rice in the gatehouse, and two men weaving bamboo ware under the porch, but they were so blinded by lust that they were oblivious to everyone else. Their eyes were only on the woman, and they went straight inside to chase her.

The woman in front turned after passing through the hall, stepped into the inner room, and closed the door. The door was not as sturdy as the main gate, and it was easier to kick open. Like an eagle catching a chick, two strong men catching a weak woman was supposed to be easy. They pinned her to the bed.

"Good! Where do you think you can escape to now! Saying you were already dead, are you a ghost?"

"She is pretty, not bad! Even if she's a ghost, a pretty ghost, we'll do it!"

Just four days ago, these two men with plasters as badges had come here under the pretext of investigating household registration to search for people. At that time, the mistress of the house, having been notified by the lookout at the village entrance, was lying in the field, not caring that her shoes, socks, and clothes were dirty, covering her head and face with straw. But although she had not been discovered, because she was busy hiding, she had left a pair of fashionable square-toed leather shoes in the room, forgetting to tidy them up. When they saw them, they were convinced that there was a young woman in this house. The family repeatedly said that the shoes were relics of the dead, but they didn't believe them. They investigated in various ways, using biscuits to lure the children: "Where is your mother?" and using words to threaten them. Therefore, they came here every day.

The woman pinned to the bed naturally struggled, but she did not shout or panic, but instead gave a cold smile.

"Good!"

Saying this, she grabbed the mouths of the two men pinning her down with one hand each, and immediately the curtain behind the bed suddenly lifted, and four strong hands reached out. At the same time, two strong men jumped out from behind the cabinet, quickly tied up the two men with plasters as badges, and tightly gagged their mouths so they could not make a sound. Two warriors tying up a licentious villain was like wielding a knife with ease; even if they couldn't hold them, the main gate had long been tightly closed, and there were warriors outside the room pretending to husk rice and weave bamboo ware, ready and waiting.

It turned out that, because the matter of the shoes causing them to come looking for a woman every day was known to the patriots operating in the lost territory, they recognized it as a good opportunity and immediately contacted the guerrilla fighters, agreeing on this plan. The original mistress of the house was so frightened that she fell ill and hid in the mountains. The mistress who was used as bait was also disguised by a brave female patriot.

To intimidate the common people, these two prisoners were both fully armed. Taking away their guns and ammunition could be used to help the guerrillas. But their mouths were even more worth using. Without worrying about language barriers, there were many people in the guerrilla team who were proficient in foreign languages; therefore, they first made it clear to the tied-up men that they also had beloved wives, and were driven by others, which is why they had become depraved and trapped in a desperate situation. They were moved, and their bonds were released. They voluntarily reported the military situation in the town. Using this clue, they soon caused the enemy's military vehicle to derail and cut off the railway, achieving a great victory.

### My Singing

— Du Mao Xiang

Damn it!

I've been doing this for so many years,

But I've never seen the changes in the world today.

When I was a young lad, I wandered around Shandong,

Later I went to the edge of the East Sea to stroll,

After I grew up, I floated in Taihu Lake.

In the green mountains, dense bamboo, and sparse pines,

In the white pond, rice seedlings, and reeds,

In the wilderness, ancient tombs, and creeping grass,

Is where my home is.

When times are hard, I warm up a casserole to sprout soybeans,

When I'm happy, I smuggle salt and move earth a few times;

When I have blood money, I relax,

Play with flower girls and drink from big cups.

Who doesn't recognize me, Mao Xiang, running around the Jianghu!

Life is flavorful! Exhilarating!

If it hadn't been for my younger brother Xiao Shandong getting into trouble that year,

I would never have been framed and sent to my maternal uncle's house to sit in jail.

×××

Last year, the ×× soldiers came to attack, and I was granted amnesty,

Hoping to have a good time.

Who knew those damn planes, cannons, and bombs,

A wildfire burned away all the high-rise buildings, foreign houses, thatched huts, fields;

Watching my compatriots separated from their wives and children,

Brothers beheaded,

Daughters violated;

The ××'s military music is melodious,

The troops advance horizontally and vertically:

My ambition, Mao Xiang, can no longer be aroused,

I regret that I did wrong in the past,

Bullying my own people instead of pointing my gun outwards.

Brothers!

Now the land has changed color,

The home country has fallen,

Nothing will ever be exhilarating again.

Look at those Koreans, Taiwanese, and Indian A-sans,

If you have a bit of humanity,

You should recognize clearly, reflect again and again.

The ××'s won't leave,

They will never give up;

Only bastards become traitors,

Cowardly grandsons kneel to others.

Come! Come! Come!

Drink a cup,

We are all our own people,

Let's use our brains,

And do something exhilarating.

Let's swear an oath with blood,

To drive the ××'s out!

Spring and Autumn

### Ill-gotten gains never prosper

— Lishi

Every cause has an effect, and every effect has a cause; the same cause will produce the same effect. This is the law of all natural phenomena.

As the saying goes, "Plant melons and you get melons, plant beans and you get beans." Planting melons and planting beans is the cause, and getting melons and getting beans is the effect. Therefore, "What comes in unjustly will go out unjustly." Having the cause of unjust gains, one cannot escape the effect of unjust losses.

Planting melons and getting melons, planting beans and getting beans, is the harvest of cultivation, the reward of labor, and belongs to what is normal. And in general, only those undertakings that are created successfully through a normal and arduous process can be preserved permanently. As for those who obtain gains unjustly, these are unexpected encounters, temporary strokes of good fortune, and are abnormal. Because of these unexpected and fortunate gains, the parties involved are tempted by chance, leading to a blurred understanding. They fall because of the effect, so they lose unjustly; some even suffer ruin, lose their reputations, and their family property is swept away, getting to the point of being beyond repair.

Stories of ill-gotten gains never prosper are most often found in gambling dens. The act of gambling is inherently prompted by chance, and moreover, when gamblers gamble wildly, their reason has long disappeared, and they no longer understand this cause and effect of ill-gotten gains never prosper. Therefore, the money won at first is still lost in the end. Some don't count their losses and continue to gamble, and the more they gamble, the more they lose. The so-called winning makes them want to win more, and losing makes them want to recoup their losses. Who knows, the deeper they try to recoup, the deeper they sink. This is the psychology and the cause of the downfall of gamblers.

Our eastern neighbor, the "friendly nation," its rise can be said to be mostly accidental and fortunate. It went through the Sino-Japanese War, then the Russo-Japanese War, and then the World War, and thus gradually became stronger. It knew that they neglected objective factors, but used war as a magic weapon for becoming stronger, leading to years of militarism and warlords in power, intending to complete the delusion of a "continental empire," and starting the fire of aggression at the Marco Polo Bridge. Who would have thought that, as the facts now show, the strength they gained from war in the past has now been lost in war.

Yes, they were unjust gainers in the past, so they cannot avoid being unjust losers now. They wanted to win more after winning in the past, and they want to recoup their losses now after losing, so they will inevitably fall into the tragic situation of trying to recoup but sinking deeper and deeper.

### Returning After Seeing Liu Haisu's Recent Works

— Xinan

Looking at paintings is not an easy matter, because looking at paintings requires understanding painting. To not understand painting and yet pretend to be elegant and go to look at paintings, is truly like "a blind man looking at a painted wall." But I am indeed one of those people.

When I was in school, I had two hours of drawing a week. The teacher was also a somewhat famous painter in Hangzhou. Because schools had only just started being established in the late Qing Dynasty, and painters who graduated from schools were still being trained, most of what was drawn at that time were brush-style pencil drawings, which later turned into what was then called geometric drawing. But in drawing class, I only saw the teacher drawing rustlingly on the blackboard, and me, I often drew mice that looked like rabbits, and goats that looked like white dogs with whiskers. If the teacher hadn't added a few strokes for me, I would never have been able to hand in my work!

In recent years, I often go to art exhibitions for sightseeing, which is nothing more than killing time. Moreover, where we live, there are no gardens to stroll in. We have neither the time nor the money. What I can sit and lie down and admire is limited to a few old paintings and calligraphy in my small room—new ones are too expensive to buy, and I can't find anything else pleasing to the eye. So, if there is a calligraphy and painting exhibition to browse, whether I understand it or not, I'm happy to take a trip. Going to see Liu Haisu's recent works was also with this intention.

The four words "artistic traitor" had already been shocking. Moreover, his works were universally praised, so there was no need to say more. I will only write out the situation of the exhibition.

This so-called recent exhibition was dominated by traditional Chinese paintings. According to his exhibition catalog, there were a total of one hundred and forty-nine pieces, with only twenty oil paintings and one hundred and twenty-nine traditional Chinese paintings. Oil paintings accounted for only about 14 percent, showing that Haisu's recent works are gradually focusing more on traditional Chinese painting. Perhaps it was to allow the Chinese people to see them, so he deliberately reduced the number of oil paintings on display to the minimum.

Haisu's traditional Chinese paintings seem to have been learned from Bada Shanren and modern artists such as Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting, so-called rough brushwork. Rough brushwork not only requires charm, but also requires boldness. Many modern people who learn from Wu and Wang see only "a black mess," which is a big mistake. Although it is said to be rough brushwork and not focused on meticulousness, the standards still cannot be reduced. The more sparse the strokes, the more extraordinary the work. This is also something that comes naturally with practice, and cannot be forced.

Charm, I say, is the characteristic of traditional Chinese painting, but it can be understood spiritually, not verbally. Sometimes, with a painting, subtracting a stroke is impossible, and adding a stroke is impossible. When it is just right, that is a divine work. As for the composition of the painting, it is related to the structure of a painting. For example, in one of the exhibited paintings, Wang Yiting added a bright moon. One must observe whether the composition of the painting actually needs this bright moon. The artist will naturally understand this, but as an amateur like me, I simply don't understand the logic.

Liu Haisu's imitation of Mi Fu's splashed-ink landscape painting, he inscribed himself (the original words are not clear in my memory) that Mi Fu's landscape paintings are between intentional and unintentional; his own imitations are also between resembling and not resembling Mi Fu, which are true words. Whether writing or painting, one cannot but take something as a model. But no matter how wonderful and lifelike the imitation, the result is still an imitation! Therefore, the reason why a painter is a painter, and a master is a master, whether it is landscape, figure, birds, or flowers, is always the same, the only difference is this little bit of charm. It can be seen that in imitation, one must also have one's own mastery.

The so-called recent exhibition, because most of them were recent works, but there was an inscription that seemed to have been written in the winter of the twenty-eighth year. If it is not a mistake in my memory, it is easy to cause viewers to be confused for a moment, because the general psychology of most people attributes the current winter to the twenty-seventh year. Fortunately, this is unimportant, and perhaps I am misremembering.

Among the paintings, there were also inscriptions by Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, and Ye Gongchao, which further increased their value. But I think that for appraising a painting, it is best to ask a painter to appraise it. If I could paint, I would definitely ask Feng Chaoran, Tang Dingzhi, Zhao Shuju, and Shang Shengbo to appraise it, which would be meaningful.

After all is said and done, I haven't said what Liu Haisu's recent works are like, and mostly empty talk, saying too much about him. Is it to get some稿費 from Spring and Autumn to subsidize the cost of the admission ticket? Perhaps there is also this intention in it, a smile.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 2: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses the Concept of Equality

Miss Jin Danyun snorted through her nose and said, "What you're saying is contradictory." Lin Jiancheng said, "How can you say that what I'm saying is contradictory?" Miss Jin said, "Let me ask you! That eight-story Workers' First Building at Brahma Ferry, was it designed and built by you?" Lin Jiancheng smiled and nodded. Miss Jin said, "I've taken foreign guests to visit it before. If you're talking about standardization, there's no building more standardized than that one, and yet you say you don't approve of standardization. If you don't approve of standardization, why did you design and build such a building yourself?" Miss Jin turned to the two Miss He families and said, "That building was specially built for workers to live in, and it has countless small rooms inside. This one building can house four or five hundred families, all of them workers' families. But the houses are almost the same, the rooms are the same, and the furniture inside, like beds, tables, and chairs, are also the same. Like room 301 and room 302, they are exactly the same. Someone who is a little careless will walk into someone else's house when they go home. I asked the person in charge of the workers' residences, and he said, 'This is called standardization. When building the houses, our engineers standardized them.' I asked him, 'Who is the engineer?' Well! It's Mr. Lin Jiancheng! Now he's saying he doesn't approve of standardization, so I have to ask him." Lin Jiancheng laughed and said, "Alright, Miss! I should be subject to your criticism. But there are several reasons for building this building, and it's not that my words don't match my actions. First, it was a commission, and before the building was built, it was intended to be used as workers' housing, so it was enough to be sturdy, simple, and hygienic. Since there are so many rooms, it's impossible for each one to be different. Second, the building was built very quickly, because after the war, China's industry was booming, and there was a panic about workers' housing, so it had to be built within eight months. In order to make it faster to build, many things had to be standardized. For example, the steel windows, water pipes, and sanitary equipment in the house were all ready-made, manufactured according to certain standards, and just had to be installed in the house, wouldn't that save time and effort? Third, in that building, except for a few rooms that are used for public facilities, the rent for the rest is the same. Since the rent is the same, the houses are bound to be the same. But as you said just now, there are often some careless people who go to the wrong house and cause a lot of jokes."

### The Evolution of Nanjing Road

— Hong Tao

Nanjing Road was originally the center of the concessions, but now it is the center of the entire Shanghai. The phenomenon of Shanghai as an isolated island can be seen in its entirety from Nanjing Road. In the short span of just over a year, Nanjing Road has undergone considerable changes. The desolation of Nanjing Road at the beginning of the August 13th Incident is a far cry from the bustling and lively scene of today, truly two extreme situations that one could never have imagined. This transformation is the most unique page in the history of Nanjing Road's rise and fall.

Before the war, Nanjing Road was certainly the most prosperous place, but this prosperity was merely a superficial appearance due to its location. Its inner reality could not hide the pervasive recession. The radios, huge discount banners, and drumming of the shops only embellished a semblance of vitality. The three times of day—morning, noon, and evening—when people went to and from work were somewhat noisy, but during the rest of the time, although the road was constantly filled with pedestrians, not all shops were necessarily thriving. The impressive giants like Taifeng, Ningbo Shiye Bank, Dashengfu, and Dahu Bank were empty. However, the current situation is completely different. People crowd the street from morning till night. An unknown number of new shops have been added to the not-very-long road. The previously mentioned giant buildings have now acquired new owners and have undergone a complete transformation. The original site of Taifeng is now Qiu Tianbao Jewelry (Nanjing Road now has two Qiao Tianbao stores. The branch is across from the old Jiulun; the main store was formerly at Xiaodongmen). The original site of Ningbo Shiye Bank is now Dachang Silk Shop, the original site of Dashengfu is now China National Products Company, and a building across from Hongyi that was previously the Shanghai National Products Company before the war. After Wu Zhihao's various businesses failed, the building was left vacant. After the war, it was used as a refugee shelter, and the building was severely damaged. But now it has become a new building with a cement facade. Its new owner is Fang Jiuxia Jewelry, which has returned to Nanjing Road. The Dahu Building of Dahu Bank has now been renamed the Xin Daxiang Building. The splendid facade of Xin Daxiang has also added infinite excitement to Nanjing Road.

The new shops that have recently opened on Nanjing Road are mostly silk shops, jewelers, pharmacies, and ginseng and bird's nest stores. Among them, the pharmacies are shops featuring a northern style. The rest are mostly transferred from Xiaodongmen.

The two major companies, Zhongda Company, on Nanjing Road have both renovated their storefronts. The first to renovate was Xinxin, at the end of the year before last. The Hong Kong-style corridor was replaced, and the storefront windows were rebuilt in their original location. The facade was changed to milky yellow marble, but perhaps the construction was not very elaborate. Only a short time later, the color already looked somewhat dull. The latter was Sincere, which also changed its bottom floor facade to light yellow marble. It seems that it has not yet been fully completed, and all of Sincere's glass awnings have been changed to cement. This is presumably because the previous iron frames were bent by the impact of the bomb and could not be straightened completely, so they could only be covered with cement.

The bomb scars on Sincere seem to have completely disappeared, but the author has discovered an irreparable flaw: the two coiled dragon pillars that were replaced on Sincere's second-floor veranda have coiled dragons whose posture is the opposite of the original ones. The original ones were coiled upward, and the newly replaced ones are coiled downward. This may be a temporary oversight by the workers, but this can truly leave a trace of this trauma. In the future, if someone repairs the anecdotes of Nanjing Road, this is one of the major events of Nanjing Road. I think these words can be used as evidence, so I do not hesitate to write more about it here.

### Street Artists

— Zhang Zhenshan

In the crowded city streets, which resemble a flowing tide, there is never a moment of interruption or rest from morning to dusk and into the late night. There are idlers wandering, people rushing to make a living, those busy pursuing wealth, and the unemployed wandering about. This coming and going has created a special kind of excitement on the streets. As a result, unemployed people with artistic production skills can use their skills to barter with the public for the material sustenance of life. The diligence and enterprising spirit of these strugglers in this sphere of life certainly elevates the evaluation of the ancient saying, "Having a skill is better than a thousand pieces of gold." Therefore, I will give a brief report on some street artists:—

Silhouette Cutting In Shanghai, silhouette cutters seem to have only appeared on the streets in recent years. They hang a piece of cardboard along the edge of the street, with various cut-out portraits attached. Holding a pair of scissors and a few sheets of black paper, they do not need to shout loudly or advertise. They simply stand silently in a corner, waiting for admirers to patronize them. They only charge five or ten cents for each portrait they cut, and it can be taken immediately. Ordinary wanderers or people who have never seen it before and feel a sense of novelty will surely not begrudge these few cents and commission them to take a contour of their own appearance from the scissors. Therefore, their daily harvest is enough to fill their stomachs.

Wire Twisting Twisting various fonts with fine copper wire is also a rather interesting game. They can use a copper wire and the turning and bending of a pair of iron pliers to quickly twist out hollow Chinese or Western characters, or a phrase of several characters connected in one idiom. People who twist words have pure skills in production, because there is no opportunity to cheat. Whether it is similar or not has objective criticism. It is not like the production of silhouettes, where if it is not similar, you can still find words to cover it up. Therefore, people who are not skilled are difficult to produce. Most people who operate this kind of wire twisting sit on the ground in the corner of the road, setting up a simple stall. Twisting a three-character connected name costs twenty cents, and other auspicious idioms such as double happiness, longevity, and good fortune, as well as "long life and a hundred years," and "grand opening" are charged double. (To be continued)

### A Group of Performers on the Road

— Xin Shi

Recently, a traveling filmmaker from Sichuan and Yunnan spoke in detail about the recent situation of various artists on the road. The following is a summary:

Gao Zhanfei Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he was invited to the Wuhan Military Camp Film Division to go to Hankou with Li Lili to star in the film "Iron-Blooded Loyalty." At first, they were both hired for a short-term nature of one film. After the war broke out, they continued to serve there and did not plan to return. After the fall of Wuhan and the retreat to Chongqing, he once abandoned his work in the film industry and changed to a clerical position in the Aviation Administration. He was repeatedly strongly invited by the Central Film Studio before he returned to his old career.

Cao Yu

Playwright Cao Yu and Chen Baichen are now in Chongqing at the National Drama School, where they are in charge of teaching affairs. There are more than eighty students in the entire school, located in Shangqing Temple outside the city. In addition to their coursework, they often lead students to perform his famous works "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise" and new dramas in local theaters. Filmmakers from "China Electric" also often join in cooperation.

Sun Yu

He is working as a director at "China Electric." Since the retreat to Chongqing, his work has been hindered because various equipment has not been fully prepared. He has only made one historical film, "Yue Fei," but it does have its own unique power in anti-Japanese propaganda.

Zhao Huishen

The Amateur Theater Troupe set off for Sichuan and performed in Chongqing for a long time. After that, they transferred to Chengdu and are still continuing to perform indefinitely. Zhao Dan, Gu Er and Shi Chao, key members of the troupe, had disagreements with the director Chen Liting and others midway, and soon announced their separation there, returned to Chongqing, and transferred to "China Electric." At that time, "Amateur" was also joined by a group of actors from the Filmmakers' Theater Troupe, and was changed to be the responsibility of Chen Liting and Zhao Huishen. Zhao has been in charge of scriptwriting and acting for the troupe. She and Chen Liting had already fallen in love, and in May or June of last year, they had a crystallization in Chengdu.

Xie Yunqing

He has been wandering for a long time on the long journey. After arriving in Sichuan, his life has undergone a change. The companions of the Filmmakers' Theater Troupe are not very satisfied with this. Xie Yunqing also sought another way out and joined a song and dance troupe, wandering around Yunnan and Guizhou. Some time ago, someone met him in Kunming. He looked like a wanderer on the road and was very depressed.

Wang Ying

Wang Ying was with Hong Shen, Jin Shan, and others in the second team of the National Salvation Drama Troupe. At that time, they performed in various places such as Nanjing and Xuzhou. After arriving in Hankou, Hong Shen took a position in the Drama Section of the Third Hall of the Political Department. She and Jin Shan also joined the China Film Studio to make films for a while. Later, when Wuhan fell and the National Army retreated to the west, their news was cut off for a long time. Recently, I heard that they had already arrived in Guilin and were still bravely flying the banner of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, leading a group of partners to work hard on national salvation propaganda there.

The rest of the large group of filmmakers, Bai Yang, Chen Bo'er, Shen Xiling, and Wei Heling, are mostly concentrated in Chongqing, affiliated with the two major state-owned film studios, and their lives are generally quite good.

### After Watching the One-Act Play "Dawn"

— Yan

Performed by the Second China Vocational Supplementary School

The night before yesterday, I walked into the Ningbo Tongxiang Association with excitement, and participated in the teacher-student get-together organized by the Second China Vocational Supplementary School. In addition to the general order, the program of the get-together was followed by recreational activities. Among the eight or nine recreational performances, I believe that the drama "Dawn," performed by the school's drama troupe, was the most able to arouse the audience's excitement and raise the audience's awareness of the Anti-Japanese War, and it truly met these two principles. "Dawn" is a one-act play, and its plot is quite tense. It describes a pair of laborers who sell their blood and sweat, Fusheng and Lianxiang, whose occupations were destroyed by the flames of the "August 13th" Incident.

Fusheng is a worker in a factory. After losing his job, he stretched out his hand and hoped that the factory could resume operation. A year later, the factory finally reopened. However, the capitalists' calculations became more and more sophisticated. They tried their best to use the lowest price to buy a large number of refugees who were at the end of their rope and wandering the streets, and tried their best to abandon old friends who had exhausted their fat and blood. "Retaining jobs with suspended pay" and "hiring one by one" are, of course, the only nice and fashionable slogans for capitalists to treat old workers.

Similarly, his wife, Lianxiang, found a job as a female worker in a cigarette factory, but after only a few months, an unfortunate child was added. For the sake of life, she had to leave the child at home and ask her neighbor Yingniang to take care of him. The poor child could not get the love of his mother, and could not get enough food and warmth, and finally unfortunately became ill. Alas, God! This whip of life beat her family to pieces. Fusheng passively took the road of passive suicide. He could not bear the reprimand of his conscience, and motivated by maternal love, he could not bear to watch his poor child be born in such pain and die tragically. It was not easy to borrow three dollars of wages from the factory, and give it to her husband, to give the child medical treatment and medicine.

However, Fusheng, who had become negative and committed suicide, drank and gambled all day long to relieve his worries. Confused, he drank and lost all the money for the child's medical treatment. He was angry for a while, drank more wine, took a knife, and guarded the entrance of the capitalist he used to work for. Taking advantage of his carelessness, he killed the capitalist who had exploited the blood and sweat of the workers. He felt happy! Frustrated! Frightened! Hiding outside and wandering! Although, he really couldn't let go of his child in his heart...! The drama closed with such a tight plot. "Why are Fusheng and Lianxiang unemployed? What is the child's illness? How painful is Lianxiang after knowing her husband's behavior?..." This is probably the question that every audience member is thinking about?

### The Chinese Harmonica Community Has United as One

— Dong Er

The main people held a meeting yesterday noon. A joint celebration will be held at the Geely Restaurant on the fourth of next month.

The organization of the Chinese harmonica community has always been very loose, but it has recently united. According to reliable news, at 12:30 noon yesterday, the leading figures of the harmonica community, Wang Qinglong (Zhonghua), Shi Renwang (Dazhong), Li Houxiang (Guangming), Yu Yuxing (Hualian), Chen Jianchen (Shanghai), and Bao Mingshan (China), held a meeting on the third floor of the Jinlong Hotel to discuss all matters related to unity. It is heard that at this meeting, it was decided to hold a "Joint Celebration of All Harmonica Teams in Shanghai" at the Geely Restaurant at 7:30 p.m. on February 4 (Saturday). In addition to the participation of more than 200 members of the above-mentioned teams, harmonica team members from other schools and groups are also welcome to participate voluntarily. (The fee is one and a half yuan per person.) Those who wish to join can register with Bao Mingshan at 1234 Fuxu Road from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day from now until the 28th of this month. At that time, in addition to dinner, there will also be various recreational activities and lucky draw prizes to increase interest. It is also heard that the second meeting will be convened by Wang Qinglong of the China Harmonica Association this Saturday to report on the progress and continue to discuss various matters.

### The Characteristics of "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain"

— Sima Hua

The blockbuster "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain" shown by Guotai not only achieves unprecedented beauty in color photography, but also achieves unexpected success in the distribution of actors. The military and national affairs, as well as the love affairs of the children, of Queen Victoria during her sixty years on the throne, are all-encompassing, large and small. Director Wilcox handles these large and complex scenes with simple techniques and superb skills, making the audience feel organized and worthy of praise.

Although this film and "The Story of Queen Victoria" have the same protagonist and the same historical facts, "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain" is much greater and more magnificent than "The Story of Queen Victoria." Here are just a few of its characteristics:

When Queen Victoria married Prince Albert, members of parliament expressed their opposition, but the Queen's will was firm and she was unmoved. Anna Neagle's performance was very appropriate.

The grand ball at the Queen's wedding ceremony was solemn, magnificent, and antique.

Queen Victoria reviewed the troops on horseback, breaking the British tradition of reviewing troops in a carriage. Although the court ministers tried to stop her, the Queen turned a deaf ear. This scene is extremely flamboyant and beautiful.

The birth of Princess Victoria was celebrated with unprecedented enthusiasm throughout the country. Prince Albert hosted the opening of the Exhibition - the Crystal Palace, with its rare and wonderful displays, was a magnificent sight.

The grand ceremony of Princess Victoria's marriage to the Prussian Prince was magnificent and splendid, echoing Queen Victoria's own wedding ceremony, shining brightly one after the other.

General Gordon was besieged by Arab natives in "Khartoum." The general gave his life for his country, and his heroic situation was inspiring.

In 1897, the "Diamond Jubilee" commemorating Queen Victoria's sixty years on the throne was celebrated throughout the United Kingdom. The enthusiasm of the situation and the grandeur of the scenery are rare on the screen.

Queen Victoria passed away and the whole country mourned. The seriousness and tranquility of the atmosphere was a striking achievement of the director. Throughout the Queen's life, British science, art, literature, music, and medicine have made great progress. This film can clearly show the various achievements of Queen Victoria during her reign. Its greatness is just like Queen Victoria.

This film will be released soon, so I will extract its characteristics and tell the readers of the entertainment industry first.

Entertainment News The Minguang Club at 617 Cishu Building has been established for several months, but the number of members has been increasing day by day.

### Secret History of the Palace and Gardens of the Old Capital (7) (8)

— Xu Muyun

The strange actor Wang Fushou always gets boos every time he performs.

Therefore, from the emperor and empress to the colleagues in the backstage, they both hate him and admire him. They hate him for his bad nature and admire him for knowing all the plays. In case the main actors have an emergency and cannot perform, he can fill in; he is like a play bag, like a large play test sitting there, and all the actors feel much bolder. The Empress Dowager also heard Lian Ying and others talk about this situation, so she gave him a small punishment of kneeling, which was also out of love for his ability. A few unscrupulous ghosts fabricated rumors for him, saying that he ran a mutton shop (i.e., a mutton shop). This spread slowly to the Empress Dowager's ears, because she was born in the year of the sheep, so she naturally wanted to avoid the matter of killing sheep. Wang Fushou had served in the inner court for so many years, and the reward he received was never more than one tael of silver. Later, he sighed that he had no Buddha's fate, and he did not compete with Zheng Tan and others, and was willing to be their supporting role, only seeking food and clothing to keep him warm, which was enough for him. However, in his later years, he often complained to his colleagues, saying: "No matter where we perform, we would rather teach the art after we get the money, don't let the money suppress the art. This way, we have a clear conscience, and the master has done this all his life, and never thought of competing with others for the top or second card. Besides this old man, there is also a master of painted faces, Mr. He Jiu (Gui Shan), who is also a first-class actor. Because he is addicted to alcohol, he asks to sing the first three scenes every time he enters the backstage. After singing the play, he takes the money and goes to a small restaurant (there is a kind of two-meat shop in Beiping, which is cheap and good, and is most popular among the general scholars.) He eats and drinks a lot, and never returns until he is drunk. It is said that the income of these two famous actors outside is only forty or fifty diao of Beijing money, which is less than two yuan in the current national currency. Like Sun Juxian, the most popular at the time, the outside string was never more than ten gold, compared to the current general famous actresses who want 30,000 or 50,000 yuan, which is three or five times more than the salary of our National Government Chairman Lin, which is a bit too much. I have never liked to add flowers to the brocade and make excessive compliments, so I wrote out what Hongyan Si said, so that these younger actors can also be a little humble.
