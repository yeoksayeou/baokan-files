### German Advances Approach Warsaw, Polish Government Relocates Capital to Lublin

Polish Army Reinforcements at the Frontlines Demonstrate Strong Resistance; German Side Claims Polish Corridor No Longer Exists

Stockholm: Today, the Swedish Foreign Ministry stated that the Swedish Minister to Poland has departed Warsaw for Lublin, as the Polish government has relocated its offices to that city. This confirms previous rumors that Lublin was chosen as the temporary capital of Poland. News of the Polish government agencies and the diplomatic corps relocating to Lublin is indeed reliable. Lublin is located southeast of Warsaw and originally had a population of 120,000. (6th, Haitong Telegram)

Riga: At 12:30 this afternoon, Warsaw Radio confirmed that all Polish public agencies have withdrawn from Warsaw. From the broadcast, one could sense the great suffering of the people of Warsaw. The sound of artillery fire in the distance could be heard clearly. There are rumors that General Smigly-Rydz has resigned, but this information has not been confirmed. (6th, Haitong Telegram)

London: According to a report released by the Polish official news agency, the evacuation of the central administrative organs of Poland from Warsaw has now been completed, and the wounded in Warsaw have all been safely transferred elsewhere. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

Warsaw: According to a communiqué released here today, fierce fighting continues in Plonsk, 42 miles from the outskirts of Warsaw, and Ciechanow, 58 miles from the capital. Polish troops are now resisting a superior enemy force southwest of Warsaw. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

Berlin: The German-Italian News Agency reports that German forces have already occupied the famous Polish city of Krakow. (6th, Havas Telegram)

Berlin: According to a statement from the German Supreme Command, after destroying the resistance of the Polish army, German forces have advanced 30 miles beyond Krakow. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

Warsaw: According to a military report here today, Polish troops are now blocking the German army on a line from Pułtusk to Ciechanow northeast of Warsaw. This line is 50 kilometers long. Although the German army has launched fierce attacks, the front has not changed. However, the fighting there is very intense, so Polish troops are constantly being sent to the front to reinforce. In the southwest, our army has also stopped the enemy. In the north, German mechanized units have approached Pułtusk. At the same time, enemy planes yesterday carried out brutal bombings on various cities, train stations, and refugee columns. If the German army advances further, the Polish army will use the Vistula River as a defensive line to prevent the German army from crossing the river. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

Berlin: This afternoon, an official German statement said that Kielce, a railway and highway center at the foot of the Łysa Góra Mountains, and the Nowy Sącz district in southern Poland have fallen into German hands. (6th, Haitong Telegram)

Amsterdam: German sources here claimed today that the German mainland and East Prussia have now been connected. The so-called Polish Corridor no longer exists. Railway traffic between the German mainland and East Prussia through the corridor will soon be restored. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

The Hague: It is reported that Hitler, wearing the brown uniform of the Nazi Party, personally went to the front line yesterday to monitor German troops crossing the Vistula River near Kulm. The car he was traveling in was heavily guarded, with armored vehicles leading the way and soldiers on motorcycles following behind. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

Warsaw: The sounds of artillery and machine guns can be faintly heard everywhere. People are withdrawing along the southeastern highway. The number of people withdrawing is not very large because they believe that Warsaw is still very safe. The weather in Warsaw is excellent, and the residents are not showing any anxiety. They are wearing gas masks and walking and talking on the streets, appearing very relaxed. The family of the American Ambassador, Mr. Biddle, has left Warsaw. The government may relocate the capital to a safer area. The government issued a statement saying that the Polish army is now in an excellent position. In Monday's air battle, eight Polish planes were damaged, while seventeen German planes were shot down. It is now the fifth day of the war, and the evacuation of Warsaw is proceeding in excellent order. All embassies and other foreign businesses have either completely or partially evacuated. Enemy planes did not sound alarms this morning. Transport trucks are extremely busy on the streets, but there is no sense of panic about the evacuation. The cars of all embassies have their large national flags displayed on their roofs. Mr. Allen, a special correspondent for the Associated Press, visited the Foreign Ministry to seek information, but could not see anyone even after visiting eight people. He later saw a low-ranking official of the Foreign Ministry, who was also unable to explain the reason. Those who feel that Warsaw is in an extremely dangerous position are trying to obtain gasoline and rent small boats to cross the Vistula River for safety. However, the general public in Warsaw is not panicking. Polish troops are continuing to resist or may withdraw to the banks of the Vistula River. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

German Strategy: Blitzkrieg

London: According to British military observers, Hitler's plan is to use his main forces to destroy Polish resistance within a few weeks before British and French pressure arrives. Poland's position is originally half surrounded by Germany on three sides, a very unfavorable situation. However, it has been able to curb the long drive straight in by the German army until now, which shows one aspect of its combat effectiveness. Therefore, Hitler's desire to destroy Polish resistance in two or three weeks will be a failure. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

### Air Battles Over Warsaw Result in Mutual Losses

Berlin: The German official communiqué stated that German planes shot down eleven enemy planes during an air battle with Polish planes over Warsaw and Lodz yesterday.

Polish Naval Base: Port of Gdynia

### Bombs Inside Denmark Found to be Made in Britain

British Planes Bomb Kiel Port; Germans Claim Ten Were Shot Down

London: A squadron of British military aircraft flew over German territory some days ago and engaged in air combat with German planes. The Danish government subsequently notified the British government that bombs had fallen within the city of Esbjerg in their country, causing deaths and injuries. After investigation, it was found that these bombs were of British manufacture. The British government therefore instructed its minister to Denmark today to express its deepest apologies to the Danish government, and stated that the weather conditions at the time were poor and that a British plane, after being hit, mistakenly believed it had flown over the sea, and therefore jettisoned its remaining bombs to reduce weight, unaware that it was causing disaster within Danish territory. This was deeply regrettable. Furthermore, according to the results of the Air Ministry's investigation, the British planes that attacked German warships and returned to their base were not related to this incident, and each aircraft had been instructed before departure to respect Denmark's neutral status, and that the only targets were German warships. However, on the day of the incident, the weather was poor, and the British planes were engaged in combat with German planes above the clouds. As a result of the air battle, both sides suffered some losses. A British plane, after being damaged, lost its way, so that when it dropped its bombs, it mistakenly landed in Danish territory. This may have been the case. (6th, Havas Telegram)

Berlin: According to official sources here, the total number of British bombers that attacked Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven was between twenty and twenty-five. Ten were shot down in the East Frisia region, one of which was shot down by a German warship. It has now been confirmed that the British bombers flew over Holland. (5th, Haitong News Agency Telegram)

London: Today is the third day of Britain's war against Germany. Observers here say that the port of Kiel in Germany, which is known for its strong fortifications, was not easily bombed by the British Air Force yesterday. It is estimated that four German submarines were destroyed at that time. At the beginning of the war, Germany sent four submarines to the northwest of Ireland, which later disappeared. They probably returned to Kiel and were bombed. Furthermore, 40 British planes scattered leaflets over German territory, which was a risky operation, yet all the planes were able to return safely to their base, which is also worth mentioning. (5th, Havas News Agency Telegram)

Berlin: According to official sources, four British reconnaissance planes were discovered over Hamburg yesterday and were immediately intercepted. Two of them were shot down. (6th, Haitong News Agency Telegram)

### Strange Aircraft Discovered Over Belgian and Dutch Airspace; Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Fire

These reports will be issued even at night to warn people to prepare for bombs and fragments of Belgian anti-aircraft shells. (5th, Every News Telegram)

Paris: According to a report received by a French newspaper from the Dutch capital, Dutch anti-aircraft units fired on aircraft of unknown nationality in central Holland today. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

### British Planes Conduct Second Reconnaissance Flight Over Germany

Dropping Large Numbers of Leaflets Over the Ruhr Area

London: According to official sources, British planes flew to the Ruhr area of Germany again on the night of September 4th, conducting a large-scale reconnaissance and dropping more than three million leaflets addressed to the German people. They did not encounter any German planes. This was the second British reconnaissance flight over Germany, and both times they returned safely. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

### Three German Armed Merchant Ships Sunk by British Cruisers

Several British Ships in the Atlantic Also Bombed by German Submarines

London: The British Government Information Department announced today that the British Air Force's attacks on the German fleet were even more successful than previously reported. Three German merchant ships that had been converted into warships have been destroyed by the British in the Atlantic Ocean. The German sailors and crew are all safe. Several British merchant ships have been sunk by German submarines. British warships have attacked German submarines in several locations. The news that a British destroyer sank the submarine that sank the "Athenia" has not yet been confirmed. The Information Department also stated that the German government announced that Germany had laid mines, causing a Danish fishing boat and a Greek merchant ship to hit mines and sink. In the past 24 hours, the German cargo ship "Fritz Thyssen" was sunk by the British Navy, and the British mail ship "Bosnia" was sunk. The sailors of both ships were rescued safely. The "Bosnia" was sunk 125 miles west of the Aran Islands in western Ireland. According to the shipowner's report, the "Bosnia" was shelled by a submarine and caught fire. All the sailors were rescued by the Norwegian oil tanker "Edith Knudsen." A stoker named Woods died. All survivors will be able to land tonight. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

London: The Information Department recently issued a communiqué stating that several British cargo ships had been attacked by German submarines, and several of them had been sunk. British warships immediately bombed German submarines in various sea areas. In addition, a Danish fishing boat and a Greek cargo ship were reportedly hit by German mines in a certain sea area. A German armed merchant ship has been sunk by British warships in the Atlantic Ocean, and all crew members have been rescued. (6th, Havas Telegram)

London: Another British ship has been bombed by a German submarine on the high seas. This is definitely the Cunard Line cargo ship named "Bosnia," with a tonnage of 1,900 tons. Except for one stoker, all the others were rescued by a Norwegian oil tanker. The British ship did not report its location, and the wireless telegram was interrupted. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

### Polish War Report

Warsaw: The Polish Army General Staff recently released War Report No. 5, stating: (1) Enemy planes continue to bomb our cities and army units. Our air force also bombed enemy mechanized units in Ciechanów and Radomsko, with great success. A total of 14 enemy planes were shot down in one day today, and we also lost six planes.

### American-Made Aircraft Supplied to Britain and France

Santa Monica: According to news here today, aircraft factories in Southern California have decided to supply 100 aircraft per week to Britain and France. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

### Air Raid Alarm in London Too

London: At 6:30 this morning, the first German bombers attempted to attack Britain but were unsuccessful, as they were driven back before dropping their bombs. Today, several planes flew towards London, but it could not be determined whether they were British or German. Everything is calm at the moment. The sky is clear and sunny this morning. After the alarm sounded, many people stood outside air-raid shelters, gazing at the sky. Suddenly, the sound of anti-aircraft guns erupted, and shells exploded in the sky, filling the air with thick smoke. Several squadrons of British planes flew around in the sky, and the sound of machine guns could be heard clearly. However, the enemy planes were flying too high to be seen. At around 9:00 a.m., Chipping Ongar sent a signal to lift the alarm. The sound of anti-aircraft guns could be heard clearly in the southern region. Essex did not fire, indicating that enemy planes had not reached that area. According to an air defense worker, the air raid this morning occurred around 8:30 a.m. It was thought that German planes, flying high and fast, were engaged in intense fire. Residents in northern London could clearly hear the sound of artillery fire in the distance. Another person said that he saw six planes flying in two groups, being driven back by anti-aircraft fire, and returning shortly thereafter, only to be forced back by the gunfire again. (6th, Reuters Telegram)

### German Planes Conducted Two Air Raids; Paris Alarm Sounded Loudly; Anti-Aircraft Guns Roared; Citizens Could Not Sleep Peacefully at Night

Paris: At 1:40 this morning, enemy planes were discovered near Paris. This was the second air raid on Paris by German planes since the start of the war. The alarm sounded immediately, and residents were awakened from their sleep. In an orderly and calm manner, they carried their gas masks and hurried into designated air-raid shelters within minutes of the alarm. Many were neatly dressed, and most carried thermos flasks, food, and blankets, and some even carried chairs. At 10:47 a.m., another alarm was issued, and the all-clear was given at 11:20 a.m. (6th, Reuters News Agency Telegram)

Paris: An air raid alarm sounded in the city at 10:50 this morning and was lifted at 11:25 a.m. (6th, Havas Telegram)

Paris: The several air raids by German planes last night and this morning caused the general public to lose three and a half hours of sleep. As a result, those who went to work this morning carrying gas masks were sleepy and had tired faces. During the German air raids last night, the rumbling sound of German planes and the bombardment of anti-aircraft units could be heard clearly. In this environment, citizens clearly felt that even though they were in the rear, they were no different from those at the front, and that their lives were constantly in danger. Therefore, the people were able to actively cooperate with the authorities in air defense work. At the same time, in the past day, general life here has been greatly disrupted due to the frequent air raid alarms. The publication time of various newspapers has been delayed by several hours compared to normal. Items such as milk and cotton blankets are no longer available in ordinary hotels. Furthermore, the number of public buses here has been greatly reduced. Work normally done by men is now being done by women, and street cleaners are now being replaced by elderly people. Vegetable markets that were originally open in the morning are now open in the afternoon. At the same time, the newspapers here this morning did not mention a single word about the air raids last night and made no record of them. (6th, Associated Press Telegram)

Editorial

### The European War's Revelation to Chinese People in Shanghai

How has Shanghai been impacted by the outbreak of the European War? Our newspaper has already discussed this matter. The evolution of the future situation and the safety of society are naturally what general residents are paying attention to. However, from the perspective of Chinese residents in Shanghai, besides caring about safety, there are actually many other issues worth noting. In the past, Chinese people residing in Shanghai's concessions often had inaccurate concepts about the nation. Now, with the occurrence of the European War, there are many valuable lessons that can be learned.

The first lesson is to let the Chinese people of Shanghai know that safety is holistic: if the world cannot be safe, no country can achieve absolute safety; if China as a whole cannot be safe, no Chinese city can be safe either. Although Shanghai has extremely complex international relations, it was regarded as a safe haven during China's War of Resistance. Yet, even now, there is the so-called "safety problem." This shows that the safety pursued by most Chinese people in Shanghai is merely a temporary, escapist safety. True safety is based on the stability of the entire nation and the survival of the people. Why is Poland willing to be shattered jade rather than whole tile, rising up to resist the German army? Why are Britain and France willing to sacrifice their good and safe lives to aid Poland? If we explain it with a mentality of seeking temporary comfort, wouldn't they be the most foolish of humans? In fact, they are truly seeking genuine safety for the sake of the stable foundation of the nation and the survival of the people! The millions of Chinese people in Shanghai, witnessing such a spirit of sacrifice in European countries, should understand the value and true meaning of safety!

The second lesson that the Chinese people of Shanghai should accept is how we see people in European countries at war all over the world complying with their national laws. Since the outbreak of war, various decrees have been issued, and nationals of the warring countries, whether residing at home or abroad, have immediately complied with them to fulfill their national obligations. This phenomenon is clearly presented before us in Shanghai, such as the British government's economic controls and the military service of foreign nationals. In the economic aspect, after the British government's ban on commercial relations with the enemy was issued in Shanghai, British banks immediately stopped paying German merchants' deposits, British warehouses immediately detained German merchants' goods, and implemented the severance of British-German commercial dealings in Shanghai. Also, British ships sailing along the Chinese coast, after receiving the order to be controlled by the government, immediately sailed in accordance with the government's instructions. As for the issue of military service for European nationals in China, nationals of countries such as France and Poland voluntarily registered for enlistment with their respective consulates after the state of war was established. Such a spirit of cherishing the motherland and abiding by the law is truly admirable! But looking back at how the Chinese people of Shanghai behaved during the War of Resistance? In terms of economics: how many people in Shanghai's various industries and businesses truly complied with the government's laws? Some cunning merchants even took advantage of Shanghai's special environment to engage in various speculative businesses on a large scale: such as the black market for finance, securities, and various items, including rice, cotton yarn, and other items related to people's clothing and food. These were absolutely prohibited by the government, but they did their best to engage in such activities, boasting that they had long sleeves and were good at dancing. Now, seeing British merchants severing commercial relations with Germany in Shanghai, will it provoke a slight sense of shame in them? Although the Chinese government has not issued an order to conscript soldiers in Shanghai, there are many people who have sought refuge in Shanghai to avoid military service. Also, the government repeatedly publicly sought various technical personnel due to urgent needs in the past, but very few technical personnel in Shanghai went to the interior as a result. For example, Shanghai has a surplus of medical talent in recent years, but the most lacking thing in various war zone hospitals is doctors.

Here is another lesson that the European War gives us: that the Chinese people of Shanghai should emulate Europeans in solemnizing their lives during wartime. During wartime, European countries, in addition to mobilizing manpower and material resources, also engage in spiritual mobilization. Stopping people's entertainment is one example. After France declared war on Germany, the French Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai immediately stopped playing music. Many movie theaters in British cities have also closed down. This is an act of solemnizing life. Residents of Shanghai certainly exhibited this phenomenon during the Shanghai War: but it soon disappeared after the national army withdrew. In recent times, singing halls and dance pavilions have been filled with singing and music until dawn. Most of those who are drunk and dreaming between life and death in these places are Chinese. Even some intellectuals are not exempt. Is this phenomenon something that should be had on the path of national restoration?

The above is just a few of the important points that the Chinese residing in Shanghai concessions should emulate. Besides this, there are many other places revealed by the European War that can enlighten us. It is up to the Chinese residing in Shanghai to consider them for themselves.

### French and German Armies Deeply Entrenched: No Warfare on the Western Front

Both sides only bombard each other remotely across defensive lines, showing no sign of attempting a large-scale offensive.

Berlin:  Eastern front battles are fierce, with German forces rapidly breaking through Polish lines.  Germans here are deeply confident that German forces can recover all of eastern Poland within four or five weeks. The German Army Department issued a public statement today saying that there is no warfare on the Western front.  Germans are deeply confident that, whether in the current stage of the war or after the end of the war on the Eastern front, they will be able to stop the British and French armies outside the Western front fortresses. The British and French armies are relatively inactive for two reasons. First, neither Britain nor France has a genuine intention to participate in a major war.  It is believed here that Britain and France are waiting to see the outcome of the German-Polish war and seeking peace under acceptable conditions. Second, France is waiting for British troops to land in France because France is unwilling to take sole responsibility for attacking the western border fortresses of Germany.  It is reported that signs are posted all over the Maginot Line and expanded institutions are established, saying, "If you do not fire at our army, our army will not fire at you." All circles in Germany still find it incredible that the British guaranteed aid to Poland.  Hatred towards Britain is great, but not towards France. German morale is very good.  Although the issuance of food certificates and tax increases last night caused grumbling, the German people feel indifferent about the war.  Apart from military trucks and motorcycles speeding around the city, there is no real wartime atmosphere in Berlin. Although casualties on both sides are heavy, wounded soldier trains have not yet arrived here. The Army Department’s public statement claims, "Until 9:00 AM this morning, not a single shot has been fired on the Western front.  Apart from the British aircraft bombing Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven yesterday, there has been no air war on the Western front." (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

Beijing: According to news reporters in the areas of France, Luxembourg, and Basel, the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line are currently engaged in fierce mutual bombardment.  It is reported that the artillery fire within the city of Moselle was extremely intense all night. (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

Paris: Those responsible here have recently stated that it is not surprising that the content of the war reports issued by the General Headquarters is very brief.  It was decided that no major war occurred in Europe in early August 1914 when the war began.  Moreover, the current situation is different from the past, that is, the German Siegfried Line on the western border and the French Maginot Line on the eastern border are extremely strong and cannot be attacked lightly.  This is different from the previous war, when both sides immediately took the offensive. This is the reason why the war reports are brief. (Havas, 5th)

Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 4, stating, "Our army has come into contact with the enemy between the Rhine and Moselle rivers.  Fixed artillery positions have been built on both banks of these rivers." (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Paris:  The military department's War Report No. 5 this morning stated that the French army continued to gain victories yesterday, with local advances both day and night. (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

Paris: French officials claimed last night that, as far as they know, no warfare has yet occurred between the French and German armies on the Western front.  They denied that French troops had breached the first line of German fortresses, and stated that both sides were still engaged in reconnaissance operations before launching an offensive.  As of 3:45 PM yesterday, no real war had occurred. However, news has frequently been reported in the past few hours that fighting is occurring along a vast line, and that the German defenses have been breached by French troops. No mention has been made here of any country’s artillery units bombarding the other side or infantry opening fire. It is said that the contact between the two armies is of a reconnaissance warfare nature.  All frontline communications are controlled by the military authorities, and only official news can be sent. French official statements regarding French military actions are limited to French troops moving forward to strongholds and conducting reconnaissance operations.  German aircraft conducted reconnaissance along the French border yesterday, so Paris and other French cities sounded alarms. The French Army Headquarters released its fourth public statement, saying, "The previous public statement from France stated that the French border between the Rhine River and the Meuse River, from Sierck to Lauterbourg, has no separation between the two countries, so the two armies can directly come into contact.  Lauterbourg and Bad Bergzabern, which are bounded by the Rhine River, have French Maginot fortresses and German Siegfried fortresses six miles behind the Rhine River. The two armies are operating six miles from the Rhine River." Thousands of German refugees are concentrated in the Cologne multi-purpose stadium.  French authorities are giving the Germans individual investigations. Finally, the French authorities will decide whether to send the Germans to concentration camps or assign them to certain military tasks. (Associated Press dispatch from the 5th)

### Military Leaders of Britain, France, and Poland Exchange Messages of Respect

French President Replies to British King, Wishing to Fight Shoulder-to-Shoulder for Freedom

Paris:  The Minister of Aviation, Laurent-Eynac, "has just received a telegram from British Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood, saying, 'The air forces of our two countries are now working hand-in-hand for a common goal. At this important time, I represent the air force of my country in expressing my respect to you and the air force of your country.  I deeply believe that the officers and soldiers of our two air forces will trust each other and cooperate closely, as in the past.'" Laurent-Eynac reverently replied in a telegram, "I was deeply moved after reading your telegram and have already informed all senior generals of the air force of my country. The emotions of our country's air force coincide with what is shown in your telegram.  We all believe that the air forces of our two countries will trust each other, cooperate sincerely, and fight for a common ideal, and will definitely make contributions to maintaining various sacred principles." In addition, the Minister of the Navy, Campinchi, received a telegram from British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, saying, "I am very happy to be able to work hand-in-hand with the navy of your country on the occasion of taking office as First Lord of the Admiralty. I very much hope to have a meeting one day."  Minister of the Navy Campinchi replied in a telegram, saying, "I have received your telegram with pleasure. I am very pleased that you have stepped forward during this extraordinary period, honorably assumed the position of First Lord of the Admiralty, and continue to cooperate with the navy of our country in a friendly spirit.  If there is a chance in the future, I would very much like to receive your teachings." (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

London:  Polish Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General Smigly-Rydz, recently telegraphed British Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, General Ironside, saying, "The British Empire has joined with our country to fight against countries that violate freedom and justice. At this important time, I represent the army of our country in expressing my greatest respect to you and the glorious army of your country." (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

London:  French President Lebrun received a telegram of respect from the British King yesterday and has sent a reply telegram to Britain, roughly saying that Britain and France are now united again to defend their honor and freedom. On this solemn day in the fate of both countries, I am deeply grateful for the telegram. The British people are prepared to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the French people to fulfill the noble responsibility of resisting the most abhorrent act of aggression in history. As 25 years ago, Britain and France are rising up because of the same idea, and their trust in the solidarity of the two countries will surely make them invincible.  I sincerely pay my respects to the British people in the name of France." (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

### Britain and France Wield Economic Weapons

The two countries seek close contact, intending to put pressure on Germany

London: According to news from here today, in order to intensify its economic pressure on Germany, Britain has established a Ministry of Economic Warfare, with Cross as the minister of the department.  The British side anticipates that within a few months, Germany will be able to feel the oppression of the economic power of the British Empire. If the war is further prolonged, this pressure on the Germans will inevitably become stronger. (Associated Press dispatch from the 6th)

London:  As soon as the Ministry of Economic Warfare was established, it immediately began to maintain close contact with the French Ministry of Economic Warfare. The delegation sent by the French government, led by economist Monnet, arrived here this morning to prepare for talks with Minister of Economic Warfare Cross. (Havas dispatch from the 6th)

London:  According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Information today, the newly created Ministry of Economic Warfare is generally the same as the Ministry of Blockade established during the last war. Its main purpose is to disrupt the enemy's economy and prevent it from actively conducting war. Therefore, it will be launched in the economic, financial, and industrial fields and adjust various necessary plans. It is now regarded as an extremely important offensive weapon that can assist the operations of the army, navy, and air force. The scope of activities of the Ministry of Economic Warfare is extremely broad and cannot be completed urgently, so preparations have been made as early as the past two years.  Some of its office staff are selected from civil servants and some from experts in the City of London and other places. They began to work a few months ago. The department will maintain close contact with the French counterpart. A group of French experts has arrived in London for necessary liaison and is currently working with the department. (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

### British Authorities Discuss National Defense

London:  As people around the world quietly await a fierce battle on the Western front by European belligerents, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and British national defense leaders are secretly discussing national defense affairs. Neutral military observers here hope that Britain and France will step up bombing of German military targets, and large-scale naval attacks will be realized. Yesterday, Britain received encouragement from three important parties, namely, the Dominions, Jews, and Arabs.  The help from the Dominions this time will definitely be accelerated and expanded compared with the last war. In the first war, the Commonwealth of Australia sent five divisions, Canada four divisions, and New Zealand one division. The Dominions this time will send troops faster than last time, but when dispatching expeditionary forces, the Dominions must take into account the unstable situation in the Far East.  In addition to manpower, the Dominions also guarantee Britain large amounts of food, metals, and other major supplies such as nickel, aluminum, copper, and nickel, etc. Maritime powers are not surprised by the activities of German submarines. According to information, US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy reported to Washington last Thursday that German submarines were cruising in the Atlantic. Neutral military observers here praise the Polish army for gradually retreating to the planned defense line, but they doubt the value of Polish cavalry attacking Germany in the current stage of the war.

Washington: White House Secretary Early recently issued a statement, roughly saying that after the current Neutrality Act is announced for implementation by President Roosevelt, arms and various military supplies should be prohibited from being shipped to Europe. Americans traveling on ships of belligerent countries should also be restricted. The State Department has specially set up a department to be responsible for supervising the ban on arms and military supplies and is immediately preparing to start work. Department Director Green recently told a Havas reporter that he only needs to send a telegram to stop the shipment of arms to European belligerents. (Havas, 5th)

Washington: President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have already signed a neutrality declaration, which immediately takes effect. According to President Roosevelt’s secretary Early, this declaration is based on international law and has nothing to do with the Neutrality Act. It is said that the declaration has more than 4,000 words in 17 articles, listing various things that Americans are not allowed to do, such as enlisting in foreign armies and donating military expenses. The second declaration made in accordance with the Neutrality Act is currently under consideration. (Reuter's dispatch from the 5th)

Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he would stop transporting arms and munitions to European belligerent countries. This afternoon, he issued a declaration on the implementation of the current Neutrality Act in the United States. This decision by the President to announce the Neutrality Act a few days after the outbreak of the European war was three and a half months earlier than President Wilson during the last war. The President stated in the declaration, "Germany and France, Poland, and the British Empire, including India, Australia, and New Zealand, are at war. The United States has decided not to participate." What is noteworthy in the declaration is that Canada is not listed. Canada has not yet officially declared war on Germany. This declaration will be effective immediately after being countersigned by Secretary of State Hull. The declaration lists 17 regulations that American citizens and foreigners must abide by within the United States. These regulations do not prohibit people from expressing sympathetic opinions, etc. President’s Secretary Early said that the government has not received any confirmed news of the discovery of submarines of unknown nationality in the Caribbean islands. Early went on to say that the so-called strict neutrality of the United States is not just about implementing the Neutrality Act, but will also make all departments work together to prevent the United States from being dragged into the whirlpool of war. Secretary of State Hull announced new regulations on Monday for American citizens traveling abroad, which require people to have proper documents proving that there are urgent matters when applying to the State Department for European travel passports. (Associated Press dispatch from the 5th)

Washington: The United States' declaration of maintaining neutrality regarding the European war was recently broadcast by national radio stations. This declaration does not apply to the Commonwealth of Canada and the Commonwealth of South Africa because they have not officially declared war on Germany, so they cannot be regarded as belligerent countries. According to the full text of the declaration, which is divided into 17 articles, in addition to the neutrality regulations in international law, it also stipulates that Americans shall not join the armies of various belligerent countries or hand over armed ships to various belligerent countries. No troops shall be trained in the United States to assist belligerent countries in combat. Warships of belligerent countries shall not obtain supplies in various ports in the United States. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Washington: People close to the White House recently stated that although President Roosevelt has signed a neutrality declaration regarding the European war and put the current Neutrality Act into effect, the government still hopes to make some changes or convene a temporary meeting of Congress in the short term to discuss the revision of the Neutrality Act. The key point is to abolish the clause in the current Neutrality Act that prohibits the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, because this clause is not only detrimental to Britain and France, but President Roosevelt also believes that it is psychologically and materially beneficial to Germany. Some say that several days have passed since the outbreak of the European war, and the reason why President Roosevelt has been slow to convene Congress is that he hopes that domestic public opinion can gradually agree with his views under the pressure of the European situation. This hope seems to have been realized, because according to reports, since the President delivered a speech on the 3rd of this month, stating that he would do everything possible to prevent the United States from being involved in the whirlpool of war, more and more Americans have agreed to abolish the current Neutrality Act. People in political circles also say that the majority of isolationist congressmen are now prepared to amend the Neutrality Act in accordance with the President's wishes. President Roosevelt especially hopes that the amendment he will propose in the future can be quickly passed by Congress without debate. (Havas dispatch from the 6th)

Ottawa: The Canadian government is still preparing to support its mother country in the war against Germany. However, since the United States announced its neutrality, there has been some speculation about the way Canada will assist its mother country. The United States' neutrality declaration lists the countries to which the United States prohibits the export of arms, but Canada is not included because Canada has not yet declared war on Germany. Therefore, in order for Canada to obtain materials, arms, and military raw materials from the United States, it is best not to declare war on Germany. If Canada does not take action as a belligerent country for one day, it can obtain materials from the United States for one day to supply the United States. This is actually better than sending troops to Europe to participate in the war. (Associated Press dispatch from the 6th)

### British Ship "Athenia" Escapes Danger, Passengers Land in Succession

Still 257 People Missing, US Government Collects Facts and Evidence

Dublin: After the "Athenia" mail ship was sunk by a submarine, the ship's owner, Kirk, recently arrived here and told a Havas reporter, "The 'Athenia' was sunk by a torpedo. There is no doubt about that. One of the crew members personally saw the periscope of a submarine emerge from the sea just before the torpedo exploded. A few minutes later, a submarine surfaced and fired artillery shells at the 'Athenia'. Its goal was obviously to destroy the radio equipment." (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Washington: After the British ship "Athenia" was sunk by a submarine, American passengers who were lucky enough to escape danger have landed successively in the ports of Glasgow, Scotland, and Galway, Ireland. US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy sent a naval attaché from the embassy to ask them about their experience of the accident. It is reported that they had personally seen the submarine launching the torpedo. Ambassador Kennedy has reported the results of the investigation to the State Department. However, it is still difficult to determine at this moment how many of the 311 American passengers were killed. The State Department is currently collecting various facts and intends to file a protest with the countries concerned based on them. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Glasgow: The Donaldson Line announced today that 257 of the 1,103 passengers and 315 crew members on its "Athenia," which was torpedoed on Sunday morning, are still missing. (Associated Press dispatch from the 6th)

Dublin: After the British mail ship "Athenia" was sunk by a submarine, 428 surviving passengers arrived at the port of Galway at noon today.

According to a ship's officer, the torpedo was launched from a distance of 800 to 1,000 yards. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

London: After the British mail ship "Athenia" was sunk by a German submarine, the Labor Party's organ newspaper, the Daily Herald, reported that the ship was carrying a batch of gold worth £5 million, which was originally intended to be shipped to Canada and was said to have been recovered in full by the ships that went to rescue it. (Havas dispatch from the 6th)

London: Passengers who escaped from the British ship Athenia, which sank near Scotland, arrived at British ports last night. They told reporters that the ship did not receive a warning before being attacked by a submarine, and said that the submarine fired two artillery shells at the passengers in the lifeboats. Earl Stanhope stated in the House of Lords yesterday that there is no doubt that this unfortunate incident was caused by a submarine, and there were accurate reports from eyewitnesses that the submarine did not issue any warnings before carrying out the attack. However, news about the submarine firing artillery shells at passengers has not yet been officially confirmed. As for the exact number of deaths, it was still impossible to count yesterday. Earl Stanhope also believed that mines could not have caused the ship to sink, because "the ocean is unfathomably deep, and mines cannot be moored." According to those who were rescued, when passengers were climbing into lifeboats, a shell hit the deck of the "Athenia." According to a certain passenger, the second shell contained "poison gas." (Associated Press dispatch from the 5th)

Washington: The US government has begun collecting evidence to determine who should be held responsible for the sinking of the Athenia. The State Department announced that the US Minister to the Irish Free State telegraphed from Galway that he had met with the captain, crew, and American passengers of the Athenia. They all said that the Athenia was sunk by a submarine. (Reuter's dispatch from the 6th)

London: Of the 1,400 passengers on the British ship Athenia, which was sunk by a torpedo, 500 are still missing. Searches are continuing in all directions. The US consulate said that almost all of the 311 Americans have been rescued. None of the rescue ships have returned, and it is reported that the Southern Cross yacht has sailed directly to the United States. (Associated Press dispatch from the 6th)

### United States Expands Naval Strength, Prevents Anti-American Activities

Washington: US President Roosevelt stated at a press conference yesterday that old US warships will also be put into naval service.

(Haitong dispatch from the 6th)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently announced that the government will take strict measures to stop anti-American movements in the country, and existing laws will be strictly enforced. (Haitong dispatch from the 6th)

Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Leahy told the House Appropriations Committee that the US Navy Department is very interested in building and maintaining naval aircraft base facilities on Canton Island (a small Pacific island that both the United States and Britain claim to own). "If something happens in the Pacific, the island can be used as a base for our navy reconnaissance aircraft. Our country can use the island for Pacific exercises and study methods of mastering the environment. Building a naval aircraft base on Canton Island is an important task for the navy to defend the United States. The Navy Department is extremely interested in maintaining this facility. Britain and the United States competed for sovereignty over Canton Island, and later reached an understanding. Both sides enjoy equal rights on the island. Either side can use the island for various purposes, but it cannot prejudice the other party's sovereignty. Therefore, our country cannot allocate funds to turn the island into a naval aircraft base, and the government does not intend to make other improvements on the island at present, because our country has no right to exclusively enjoy the island." (Associated Press dispatch from the 6th)

### Pan-American Conference Scheduled to be Held

As for the reasons held by Britain, they will never change our minds." (Associated Press, 5th)

### German Farmers and Workers Do Not Want War

London The British Independent Labour Party today received a letter from members of the German Independent Social Democratic Party, sent on the eve of the war, stating that German farmers and workers do not want war, and that while they love their country, they do not share the same views as the current regime. "We have opposed Austria's occupation, the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and Hitler's policies of aggression and war in leaflets. Even workers in forts under the surveillance of secret detectives have these leaflets. This war is not our war. In the face of death and destruction, please do not forget us and the ideas for which we die by cruel punishment or in concentration camp suffering. We, like you, love our country, but our common homeland is humanity." (Reuters, 5th)

### United States Restricts Cotton Imports

Washington President Roosevelt, adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, announced today restrictions on the import of raw cotton and waste cotton in order to protect the American market. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington The International Cotton Congress today adjourned until Saturday after listening to the opening speech of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace. According to the views of U.S. officials, the current international situation makes the meeting unlikely to succeed. Representatives from nine countries came to the United States to attend this Cotton Congress, including India, Egypt, Brazil, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Peru, Sudan, and Mexico. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture stated at the congress that the European war has made the problem of disposing of surplus cotton in the United States even more difficult. According to his opinion, the military use of cotton has increased, while ordinary uses have decreased. The two offset each other, but the increase is not as great as the decrease. (Reuters, 5th)

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Reiterates Neutrality Toward European War, Advises Britain and France to Withdraw Naval and Military Forces in China

Tokyo The Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday informed the ambassadors to Japan from Britain, Germany, France, Poland, and Italy, declaring Japan's attitude of non-interference in the European war, with wording similar to that of the new Prime Minister General Abe the previous day. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

Tokyo The Japanese government yesterday requested the governments of Britain and France to "voluntarily" withdraw naval and military forces stationed in China, in order to avoid unexpected incidents as a result of the European war. The request was made yesterday when the British and French ambassadors to Japan visited the Foreign Ministry. There was no indication here of how the British and French governments would respond to the request. The Japanese side solemnly stated that Japan's request was a "suggestion" rather than a demand. (Associated Press, 6th)

Tokyo It is reported that the Japanese government has suggested to the diplomatic representatives of Britain, France, Poland, and Germany to withdraw their military forces stationed in China in order to avoid unexpected incidents. It is reported that when British Ambassador Craig accepted this suggestion, he stated that there were no German troops stationed within China, so there was no possibility of conflict. However, the British Ambassador will report the matter to the Foreign Office in London for final decision. (Reuters, 6th)

Tokyo The Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning to discuss the European situation based on information provided by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abe, and exchanged views on possible future developments. Minister of War Hata Shunroku reported that fighting in the Nomonhan region had subsided in the past few days. After the meeting, Abe entered the palace to report to the Emperor on domestic and foreign affairs. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington The Japanese government has followed the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union and declared non-interference in the European war. There are two factors in Japan's declaration of neutrality: (1) The conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact allows the Soviet Union to act freely in the Far East. (2) Japan is preoccupied with its war in China. Observers believe that Japan's current decision on the European war is similar to that of the First World War, because Japan was then allied with Britain. Therefore, some believe that the evolution of the European war may allow Britain and Japan to relive their old alliance dream, and Japan can now seize the markets of Britain, Germany, and France in the Far East. Others say that Japan will take the opportunity to improve relations with the United States, but at present, there is no optimistic hope for this. As for the European war's impact on China, some believe that it will affect China's source of military supplies, but in fact, China's military supplies can already be self-sufficient, and China's coast has long been blockaded by Japan, so the outbreak of the European war will not have an impact on self-sufficient China. (Associated Press, 6th)

Tokyo When foreign reporters asked the spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry what the significance of Japan's declaration of neutrality was, the spokesman replied, "This declaration does not indicate the meaning of neutrality in international law. Japan only expresses its unwillingness to be involved in the whirlpool of the European war." When asked if this could be interpreted as conditional neutrality, the spokesman avoided the question. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

Moscow Yesterday, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union held a long conversation, and planned to discuss a solution to the disputes and outstanding issues in Manchuria and Mongolia.

Japanese Sources Report Mongolian Border Situation, Hailar Implements Air Defense

Tokyo According to Japanese frontline sources received here today, fighting in the Nomonhan region has subsided since September 2. Soviet-Mongolian mechanized units, numbering three divisions, that crossed the border north of the Balshagal Heights and south of the Nord Heights have been blocked by the Japanese-"Manchukuo" allied forces and cannot advance. The Japanese army previously discovered that more than 250 Soviet tanks were blocked and abandoned. On Sunday, Japanese aircraft engaged 80 enemy aircraft in the border airspace, shooting down 22 of them, while one Japanese aircraft was lost. (Reuters, 6th)

Hailar Colonel Shiraki, Deputy Commander of the Japanese Army in the Nomonhan area, recently told an Associated Press reporter, "The Japanese army is willing to engage in large-scale conflict with the Soviet troops. It is quite difficult to deal with small teams of Soviet troops that sneak across at night, so we are willing to fight the other side in a decisive battle and will not be afraid." Hailar has implemented a blackout, with the entire city dark after 8:30 pm every night. In addition, the trains arriving here every night are full of Japanese troops, and the windows on the train are covered with black curtains 300 miles from the city to prevent light from leaking. At this time, passengers are strictly prohibited from peeking out the windows. (Associated Press, 6th)

### France Establishes Information Office, Emphasizes Propaganda

Paris The Director of the Information Office recently made a radio broadcast to the nation, stating: "The Director of the Information Office hereby announces to all male and female citizens of the country that this office has been established and is responsible for reporting the war situation. However, this matter is of great importance, and I am well aware of the country's thirst for news. But news concerning military strategy, except for those that do not hinder our military actions or are not enough to facilitate the enemy's army, are difficult to publish. I hope the people of the country understand this. As for the current time, it is actually a period of preparation for the great war, and no incidents have occurred on our country's border. The details of the military concentration or mobilization situation are also inconvenient to report. I am happy to inform you that General Gamelin, the Commander-in-Chief, believes that all situations are extremely appropriate. As of today, the civilized world has issued its final call, and our country's people are able to understand this and are willing to respond at the cost of sacrifice, which is greatly appreciated. For this reason, I also wish to be frank and disclose as much as possible and explain as much as possible, except for those that would harm French interests. I would like to mention that in the future, there may be situations where it is necessary to temporarily maintain silence due to the damage of broadcasting equipment or the obstruction of news sources. However, it is not desirable for the people of the country to be separated from the facts, that is, to be separated from the soldiers on the front lines. As for why I do not talk about Italy, it is because there is nothing to talk about. The reason why I do not talk about the British army is because the British army has already mobilized, the same as our country, so it is inconvenient to comment. As for the British Navy, it has already passed the mobilization stage, which I believe is well known to the people of the country. The war reports published by our General Headquarters may seem too brief and dull to the people of the country, but their true value can be understood by comparing them with the war reports of the early 1914. During 1914, our group was attacked while working and was somewhat flustered. At this time, our country has offensive and defensive weapons, and the border defense line is as solid as gold, so we can maintain calm and do not need to say much. This is the difference between now and then. Britain and France are now united and working together. Although the enemy country is extremely powerful, judging from historical precedents, it will undoubtedly be defeated. When reading war reports, I hope you will understand this intention." (Havas, 5th)

### France and Poland Sign Mutual Assistance Agreement, Stipulating the Obligation of Mutual Assistance, Signatory Countries May Not Conclude Peace Separately

Paris Foreign Minister Bonnet recently signed a protocol with Polish Ambassador Lukasiewicz, stipulating mutual assistance obligations. The relationship maintained by Britain and France with Poland is absolutely the same from now on. (Note: Britain and Poland signed a mutual assistance agreement on the 25th of last month.) The preamble to the protocol states that when one signatory country is attacked by a third country, the other signatory country has an obligation to provide assistance. This obligation is based on the current alliance treaties between France and Poland. The main text of the protocol is divided into five articles, and the contents are as follows: (1) The signatory countries shall provide mutual assistance when either signatory country is attacked by a third country. If the independence of one signatory country is threatened directly or indirectly by another European country, and therefore has to use force to resist, the other signatory country shall also provide assistance. (2) The method of implementing the mutual assistance obligations of the signatory countries shall be determined jointly by the military authorities of both parties. (3) The signatory countries shall notify each other of the anti-aggression agreements concluded with third countries. If either signatory country intends to conclude such agreements with other countries in the future, it shall also notify the other signatory country. However, the mutual assistance obligations stipulated in this protocol shall not be changed due to other agreements of either signatory country. (4) If the signatory countries join the war, they may not conclude peace separately or conclude an armistice agreement separately. (5) The effective period of this protocol is the same as the current alliance treaties between France and Poland in 1921. (Havas, 5th)

Paris Diplomatic circles here recently commented on the mutual assistance relationship between Britain, France and Poland, saying that each country promises not to conclude peace separately or conclude an armistice agreement separately. In other words, after the outbreak of war, neither Britain nor France may compromise with Germany without the consent of the Polish government, and Poland may not sign a peace agreement with Germany when the allied countries continue to fight. The steps are clear, and the meaning is very significant. Someone who recently returned from Germany claimed that Germany generally believed that neither Britain nor France were willing to help Poland. The German people were quite surprised to learn that Britain had intervened. It was only two days after France declared a state of war that the German authorities made it public to the people. According to Hitler's original plan, he would first defeat Poland and then turn to deal with the Western European countries, so that those countries would know that even if they wanted to help Poland, it would be too late. (Havas, 6th)

### British and French Ambassadors to Germany Return Safely

Woerden, Netherlands British Ambassador to Germany Henderson and his staff crossed the German-Dutch border this afternoon. The British Ambassador and others had been waiting in German territory since dawn for news that the staff of the German Embassy in Britain had safely arrived in Dutch territorial waters, as the German government would not allow the British Ambassador and others to leave the country until the staff of the German Embassy had been released by Britain. The Dutch government mediated, and the exchange procedures for the ambassadors of the two countries were completed today. (Reuters, 5th)

British Ambassador Henderson led his subordinates back home, and German Charge d'Affaires Guter led his subordinates from Oldenzaal by car back to Berlin. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

### Smuts Succeeds as Prime Minister of South Africa, One Person Holds Three Key Positions, New Zealand Has Declared War

Cape Town The new South African cabinet will be headed by General Smuts as Prime Minister, concurrently in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. Hofmeyr will serve as Minister of Finance and Education. The opposition party will be part of the former Prime Minister Hertzog government. In view of the above situation, it can be seen that the South African government is now led by General Smuts, who is doing his best to support Britain. Smuts once led troops in British East Africa during the last great war. As for former government leader Hertzog, he did not advocate declaring support for Britain, but suggested that South Africa should maintain the same relationship with the Entente and Germany. (Reuters, 6th)

London After the South African Federation severed diplomatic relations with Germany, diplomatic circles here commented that the move was extremely important, as Britain could obtain great assistance from South Africa, and the South African Federation was one of the most unrestrained outside of the British Empire's dominions. In the past, when enemies of Britain attempted to leave the dominions, they often targeted the South African Federation. This resolute support for Britain is reassuring. (Havas, 6th)

London The New Zealand Dominion Parliament unanimously passed a resolution this afternoon approving the declaration of war against Germany. (Havas, 5th)

Beijing After the Belgian government was reorganized on Sunday to include the Socialist Party in the cabinet, it has now reaffirmed its determination to maintain Belgium's neutrality. The policy statement submitted to the Chamber of Representatives yesterday stated that Belgium seeks peace, but its desire to seek peace is not only out of its own interests, but also based on emotions and human solidarity, so its efforts to avoid catastrophes do not make Belgium indifferent to everything. The statement asked the House of Representatives to immediately pass a number of special proposals, and stated that the entire Belgian army is now ready to fulfill its responsibilities under the command of the King of Belgium. (Reuters, 6th)

### Aachen, Germany, Was Attacked by Air Raid Yesterday

### German War Report, Freight Transportation in East Prussia Resumes

Berlin The semi-official German News Agency recently issued news of yesterday's war, saying that the German troops fighting in Poland are now advancing step by step according to the original plan. The combat situation of the various armies is divided as follows: (1) Our mountain army and other troops have occupied the northern slope of the Beskid Mountains and are attacking Nowy Sącz. (2) The enemy is retreating towards Kraków, and our forces are approaching the city from the southwest.

(4) On the front line of Sieradz, our troops have broken through the enemy positions and are now advancing towards Łódź along the east bank of the Warta River. (5) The enemy troops on the front lines of the east bank of the Vistula River and Kutno have begun to retreat and are being pursued by our army. (6) Our army, which attacked Poland from East Prussia, has captured Ciechanów, and the enemy troops are retreating to the south. (7) Our mechanized units will attack Narew. As of now, our northern army has captured 10,000 enemy troops and seized 60 artillery pieces. (8) Our air force destroyed many enemy joint lines and various transportation facilities yesterday. The train stations in Tczew, Walda, Skarszewy, Darlów, and Frekin were hit and burned, and many railway lines were cut off.

### President of the Executive Yuan Kong Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation; The European Situation Has No Adverse Impact on the War of Resistance; The Entire Nation Should Be More Vigilant and Strive Harder

Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the European war, all parties have been quite concerned about the evolution of the European situation and its impact on the future of China's war of resistance. Yesterday, a reporter visited President Kong of the Executive Yuan somewhere and asked for his views on the current situation. He graciously gave the following statement: Our Chinese nation is a nation that deeply loves peace. Maintaining harmonious relations with our neighbors is a consistent foreign policy of the National Government. Therefore, in dealing with neighboring countries, we have spared no effort and shown the greatest patience in seeking ways to achieve peace. However, the peace we refer to is an equal, honorable, and genuine peace. As for those who attempt to force us into humiliating surrender through violent aggression, we will not hesitate to resist with the greatest determination and the greatest sacrifice. If the Japanese militarists fantasize about destroying our country and then invading the world, then the only way we can deal with them is to resist to the end, until the Japanese thoroughly abandon their policy of aggression. As for the Japanese's constant rumors and slanders, this is their consistent tactic of sowing discord and is not worth a smile from the knowledgeable. Now, unfortunately, the European war has broken out. Standing on the position of world peace and the well-being of mankind, we can only deeply regret it. I firmly believe that the European war has no adverse impact on the future of our war of resistance. Moreover, since the purpose of our war of resistance is to fight for national independence and freedom, and to safeguard world justice and peace, this purpose cannot be stopped for a single day until it is achieved. However, the Japanese militarists may take advantage of the situation to intensify their violent acts, so our responsibility for resisting aggression and maintaining stability in the Far East will be doubled compared to the past. Therefore, at this moment, the entire nation should be more vigilant and strive harder, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, make redoubled efforts. The reporter then inquired about the recent situation of China's finance and economy. Mr. Kong replied with a pleasant expression, "You also know that the recent foreign exchange situation has slightly improved, and that the market price of public bonds has risen uniformly. It must be known that the changes in foreign exchange and the bond market are always faster and more pronounced in wartime than in peacetime, and the related factors are also very complex. The rise and fall of foreign exchange are indeed important, but such phenomena have no significant impact on the effectiveness of our legal tender in the country. We should not be overly pleased with the occasional rise in foreign exchange, nor should we be overly anxious about its decline. What should be paid attention to now is the domestic price level, and the price of food is the most important. Fortunately, our country's agricultural production has had another bumper harvest this year. The government's current problem is how to avoid low grain prices hurting farmers. Except for a very small number of cities, there is no worry about excessively high grain prices. This is enough to prove that ordinary economic theories are often not suitable for China's national conditions. China's finance and economy have entered the right track and their strength has gradually increased since the successive reorganizations in recent years. For more than two years of the war of resistance, thanks to the wise leadership of the leader and the enthusiastic maintenance of the people of the whole country, it has been able to be maintained until now and stands firm, which is something to be thankful for. In the future, we must respond to all changes in finance and economy with a calm and cautious attitude, and I believe that we will be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and fulfill the mission of wartime finance. If the people of the whole country trust the government, obey the leader, and deal with things calmly, it will be of great help to the future of the country." (Dispatch of the 6th)

### Two Million People in Tianjin Threatened by Famine

Tianjin: Two million people in Tianjin are threatened by famine due to the great flood. The flood is extremely severe, unprecedented in decades. Not only Tianjin city itself was flooded, but the surrounding villages within 50 miles have also become a watery expanse. The farmland and vegetable gardens on which Tianjin's food supply depends have all been washed away by the flood. Foreign commercial firms in the British and French concessions have suffered huge losses. In several places in the concessions, the water depth is as much as nine feet. At present, all commerce in Tianjin has been suspended. Electricity and telephone services in the concessions have been interrupted. The goods stored in the warehouses have been severely damaged, and the foundations of many houses have been destroyed. Newspapers have stopped publishing, and merchants have closed their businesses. Only a few hardy Chinese are trying to sell goods by rowing rafts. The only means of transportation in the city is boats. In places where the water is three feet deep, there are still a few rickshaws carrying passengers, but the fares are extremely expensive. Even for a very short distance, it costs silver dollars, and passengers have to sit on the hood of the rickshaw, placing their feet where the seats originally were, in order to avoid water immersion. A few Chinese who have boats are making a lot of profit, with short-distance fares as high as twenty yuan. The warehouses, tall buildings, and rooftops are now occupied by refugees. The accumulated water is becoming increasingly polluted, leading to an increase in cholera and skin diseases. In addition, with the rupture of many cesspools, the entire city is filled with a foul smell. It is heard that the Japanese suffered the greatest blow in the Tianjin flood. Not only has the thriving import business completely stopped, but also their ambitious construction plans in North China will be delayed for several months. (Special dispatch from Reuters)

### Chaoshan Chinese Troops Recapture Half of the Chaoshan Railway; Japanese Troops in Caitang City Suffer a Major Defeat; Japanese Troops Attempt to Defend Chao'an

Shantou correspondent: The Wu Qiwai unit of the 　　　Army Group launched a three-pronged counter-offensive on Chaoshan. Starting on August 23rd, they advanced sharply along the Chaoshan Railway line. The Chinese and Japanese troops immediately began to engage in battle. On the morning of the 24th, the Chinese Air Force flew from a certain location to Chaoshan and bombed the Japanese strongholds on Zhugaoshan, Hulushan, and Bijia Mountain in Chao City, and disseminated a letter from the Director of the 　　　Army Group and the Pacification Commissioner of the Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi Border Region to the people of Dongjiang, urging the people to use the unique revolutionary spirit of Guangdong to "abide by government laws and decrees, firmly believe that the War of Resistance will be victorious and the nation will be built, assist the army, defend their hometowns, and implement the twelve articles of the National Covenant. Everyone must be able to memorize them, write them out one by one, and earnestly implement the covenant, encouraging each other," etc.

On the 23rd, the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade of the Chinese army departed from east of Sangpu and recaptured the Hailian Mountain position near Pengzhou. Another team was dispatched to pursue the Japanese troops. On the morning of the 24th, they had advanced to Hong'an Township near Caitang, completing the encirclement line. Caitang City is the central station of the Chaoshan Railway. The Japanese troops occupied this station to maintain the Chaoshan land communication line and stationed 300 to 500 soldiers in Anbu, Huamei, Wuyang, Fuyang, Fengxi, and Chao'an, each with a commander and built solid defensive works. The Chinese troops set up strongholds along the foothills of Sangpu Mountain, relying on the mountain's terrain to build defenses. The outpost of the Chinese side was located five miles from the railway line. Before dawn on the 25th, the Chinese troops launched an attack on Caitang City in three directions, surprising the Japanese troops and breaking into the Japanese positions. The Japanese troops retreated in a panic to the pre-built defensive positions in the city. The Chinese troops then launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops with concentrated artillery fire. At this time, the firepower of both sides was equal, and the sounds of guns and cannons were completely consistent, making it impossible to distinguish which side was firing. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Kurokawa unit of the Japanese army was defeated and fled north along the railway line to Guanchao. The Chinese troops pursued closely, and the Japanese troops abandoned guns, cannons, and ammunition on the side of the road. Even the military supplies stored in the workers' quarters at Caitang Station were seized by the Chinese troops and carried up Sangpu Mountain. The Japanese troops stationed in Guanchao and Jinshihu heard that the Japanese troops in Caitang City had suffered a major defeat and dispatched 500 to 600 soldiers to cover the retreat of the defeated troops to Chao'an and block the pursuing Chinese troops. From noon onwards, under the scorching sun, the two sides engaged in five fierce hand-to-hand battles in the orange groves. All the orange groves were trampled into flat ground. Six Japanese aircraft flew in to drop bombs and fire guns. The Chinese troops, with no cover in the fields, were forced to disperse and fought the Japanese troops in groups of two or three. After another night of fighting, the guns and cannons fell silent on the morning of the 26th. The scattered Chinese troops returned to Sangpu Mountain and guarded the heights around Hailian Mountain. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed, and a large number of military supplies were seized. They are now being inventoried and distributed to the various local militia teams.

When the Chinese troops attacked Caitang on the 23rd, they also dispatched another force to attack Jiaoshan Township at Huamei Station in order to prevent the Japanese troops from raiding the rear of the Chinese troops from Shantou and Anbu. The Japanese troops only set up a sentry post with about 30 sentries there. When they saw the Chinese troops approaching, they did not dare to engage in battle and fled to the Zhuanglong of Anbu. At noon on the 24th, about 300 Japanese troops from Anbu attacked Xiaowei Shen by land and water in two directions. The Chinese troops launched a joint attack with the local militia. The river channel there is extremely winding, and the Japanese troops were advancing in depth by motorboat, when they were blocked by a stone bridge and ambushed by ambush soldiers on the shore. Two motorboats were sunk. The Japanese soldiers scrambled ashore but did not know the way forward or backward, and many drowned in the water. There were 40 to 50 floating corpses. The Chinese troops captured about 40 to 50 rifles. When the Japanese soldiers were defeated and fled, they arrested villagers along the way to lead the way and set fire to civilian houses to vent their anger. Since the 28th, the central section of the Chaoshan Railway, from Huamei Station to Caitang, Wuyang, and Fuyang Stations, has been in the hands of the Chinese troops, occupying half of the entire line. Local militiamen are being hired to speed up the dismantling of the rails and sleepers. Two months of construction by the Japanese side have been completely wasted. In addition, the Japanese side forced each township to send out militiamen to form road protection teams last month. If the track was damaged, the nearby townships were responsible for repairing it. Now that it has all been dismantled, the townships no longer have to bear this heavy responsibility.

The Japanese troops entrenched in Chao City are very frightened because of the advance of the Chinese troops from all directions. They have cut off traffic, checked household registration, and only allowed residents to enter and exit. They have also arrested men under the age of 50 and sent them to the suburbs to step up the construction of defensive works. More than ten strongholds have been added on the opposite bank of the East Gate, from the foot of Bijia Mountain to the Jianjin gate, with obstacles and barbed wire arranged. The interior walls of the shops and houses in the streets and alleys of the city have all been dug through. The four city gates and key points are strictly searched for pedestrians, and many small alleys and streets have been sealed off, preparing for street fighting. There are 800 Japanese troops inside the city, and more outside the city. There are 300 at Yixi Station, and 500 each stationed on Zhugaoshan, Hulusuan, and Bijia Mountain. More than 30 motorboats and 200 other civilian boats are moored at Xiangzi Bridge. The motorboats patrol the river. The large army of the Chinese side, departing from Anjie Road and Tiandongxu, is about ten miles away from the city, and small units have dispersed and besieged various points in the suburbs. The sound of artillery fire is heard in the city every day. The date of the capture of the city is not far away.

### Wuxi Chinese Troops Attack Japanese Troops at Night; Traffic on the Wuxi-Yixing Highway Interrupted

Wuxi correspondent: The Chinese troops in the four townships have been unusually active recently. At about 11:00 PM on August 28th, Zhou Hanliang, the commander of the Special Service Brigade of the West District of the Wuxi Anti-Enemy Self-Defense Corps, led the First Company and the Anti-Traitor Corps to attack the Japanese headquarters in the Xiexin Woolen Mill in Wuhebang, outside the North Gate, at night. The battle lasted for an hour. Because it was late at night, the casualties of the Japanese troops were unknown. They also set fire to and destroyed hundreds of boxes of Japanese military gasoline and several houses before returning safely. Also, a section of the Xiyi Highway from Rongxiang to Yangwan, totaling six miles, was destroyed by the team the day before. Therefore, traffic between Wuxi and Yixing was interrupted. Also, the notorious traitor Hu Jugen repeatedly led Japanese troops to harass the countryside. He was also shot and killed by the Anti-Traitor Corps in the Beitang opium smoking den the other day. It was in broad daylight, and it was located in the busy market street of Beikuang, so the traitors were very apprehensive.

### Japanese Troops Plunder the Fisheries of the Zhoushan Islands; A Puppet Fisheries Administration is Established

Dinghai correspondent: The Zhoushan Islands in eastern Zhejiang are the largest fishing grounds in China. More than 200,000 fishermen make a living from this. The annual fish production reaches 20 million yuan in national currency. Among them, yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and ribbonfish are the most important, and they are sold to various parts of the country.

Since the fall of Dinghai County in the Zhoushan Islands, the Japanese troops have successively occupied Daishan Island and Shenjiamen Town, the centers of the fishing industry. They have wooed Gao Asheng and Zhou Jimei, scoundrels in the fishing industry, to come forward and organize the so-called "Fisheries Administration" and do everything possible to control and monopolize it. The "Administration" has also formulated regulations, forcing fishermen to register and charging so-called "registration fees" of 2 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and even 50 yuan, depending on the size of the fishing boat. It has also assigned numbers to all fishing boats and issued a flag and a Japanese army flag, forcing them to be hung at the bow of each boat.

Recently, the Japanese troops have hired several large and small steamships, named "Huazhong Maru," to transport the fish products of the islands to the Shanghai "Fish Market" for sale and prohibit fishermen from transporting fish products to non-Japanese-occupied areas. A Japanese warship has now been dispatched to anchor in the Jintang waters between Dinghai and Ningbo. Whenever ice-cold ships carrying fish pass through that area, they are intercepted and set on fire.

The provincial-run Senior Aquatic Products School and a large-scale ice-making plant and cold storage, originally established in Dinghai, have made great achievements in improving the fishing industry. Since the Japanese troops entered the city, they have forcibly occupied the school and turned it into a hospital for wounded soldiers. They have also turned the ice-making plant into an ice-making company and sold artificial ice to fishermen at high prices.

### Shandong Chinese Troops Recapture Pingdu, Zhaoyuan, and Yexian; Japanese Troops Are Threatened and Will Retreat to Qingdao When They Can No Longer Hold Out

Qingdao correspondent: The Chinese troops in the Jiaodong area have now launched a large-scale guerrilla war. Local militias have also risen up in succession, waving their spears and launching attacks in coordination with the Chinese army. A few days ago, the army and civilians jointly attacked Pingdu County. The Japanese troops defending the city were caught by surprise by the Chinese army's attacks from all sides. Their mechanical weapons failed to deploy. The Chinese army then selected a brave team to climb the city walls and join the local populace in a coordinated attack from within. At that time, they seized the key positions at each city gate and erected dozens of light machine guns on the city walls to sweep the Japanese positions. More than 200 Japanese and puppet troops in the city engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army for a day and a night. The civilian houses they occupied were also set on fire by the Chinese army. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties. Except for a few who jumped off the city walls and fled, the rest were almost completely annihilated. Pingdu County was officially recovered by the Chinese army and civilians, and a large number of military supplies and weapons were seized. The Japanese troops in Zhaoyuan and Yexian have been severely threatened and are in a state of panic. The Japanese Command in Qingdao issued an order to transfer the Japanese defense forces on the Jiaoji Railway Line, concentrated in Gaomi and Jiaoxian, and dispatched more than 60 trucks to advance to Fangzitingkou, intending to counterattack Pingdu. However, the Chinese army and civilians in Jiaodong have taken strict precautions and completely destroyed the highway from Shan Gao Mi to Pingdu, cutting dozens of ditches, so that the Japanese trucks and soldiers could not pass. When the Chinese army recovered Pingdu, it also seized an order from the Japanese Commander Akiyama to Gao Yupu, the commander of the 5th Brigade of the puppet 4th Route Army in Yexian. The main points are: (1) Yu Xuezhong's and Xu Xiangqian's troops are launching a major counterattack in southern Shandong, and they are engaged in fierce battles every day; (2) Zhang Buyun's troops are gathering in Zhucheng to Gaomi; (3) If the situation in Jiaodong is tense and they cannot hold out, each unit can retreat to Qingdao and concentrate there. In this situation, the Japanese troops in Jiaodong are showing signs of wavering.

### Finance Frequent Unfavorable News; Gold Buying Resurges

Chips Suddenly Feel Insufficient; Peak Reaches Four Thousand Yuan

Yesterday, the situation in the spot gold market continued to rise sharply, the surge was very strong, and as a result, it leaped up another 415 yuan. However, the fluctuations in the middle were still quite rapid, often fluctuating around 100 yuan. However, most people, especially non-industry retail investors, have a bullish psychological view. This is because of the recent agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, and the concessions made by both Britain and Japan, so everyone fears that there may be unfavorable effects on China, so there are quite a few people who absorb on dips, which is the opposite of the situation last weekend and Monday. The overall potential throughout the day was generally a sharp rise first, followed by a sharp fall, and then a rise again. At the beginning, the remaining momentum from the previous day did not subside. In addition, the foreign exchange rate was tight, and people's hearts became more firm, resulting in a rush of buyers. The opening in the morning was as high as 3,800 yuan, and then it soared to 3,850 yuan. Later, because a certain gold firm (acting for out-of-town customers) and silver firms threw in their chips, it once fell back to a low of 3,750 yuan. Subsequently, due to tighter foreign exchange and the strong advances of a certain bank on behalf of outsiders, and the continued strong absorption by a certain gold firm, the position suddenly felt more demand than supply, and the market jumped straight up again, breaking the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching a peak of 4,020 yuan. However, before long, as foreign exchange eased, the idea of ​​floating more profits emerged spontaneously. At that time, a certain gold firm once again helped out-of-town customers with a lot of selling, which led to a sharp turn downward, plummeting to 3,810 yuan. The noon close then rebounded to 3,840 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain bank's buying became strong again, rising to 3,940 yuan, and then suddenly fell to 3,850 yuan. However, the result was a closing price of 3,895 yuan, with active trading, still around 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry finally followed suit and increased by 45 yuan. The customs gold and the buying price of Chinese cash were all rising sharply in unison.

### Spot Gold Rises Sharply Again; 415 Yuan Increase

Since this morning, each tael (ten taels), the initial opening benefited from the remaining momentum of the previous day, and with the foreign exchange rate weakening, people's hearts were even more firm. For a time, the buying interest on the trading floor was booming, and sellers disappeared. It leaped straight up, and the opening price at 9:30 was raised by 320 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a silver firm for 3,800 yuan. Then, a certain cash firm released a large amount of sales, and it soared another 50 yuan. A cash firm bought 20 taels from a certain bank for 3,850 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, a certain money exchange firm and silver firm suddenly started selling. At that time, the buying appetite seemed to weaken slightly, and the price immediately dropped by a small 100 yuan. A money exchange firm did 50 taels among themselves at a price of 3,750 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that both the official and unofficial foreign exchange rates had shrunk, and a certain bank was making strong advances on behalf of outsiders, and retail investors were also entrusting brokers circulating in the market to absorb, which caused the market to turn upward suddenly and then soar by 270 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 20 taels from a silver firm for 4,020 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had eased, so most profit-taking parties rushed to sell at high prices. Except for a certain money exchange firm that had some buying appetite, the others were not very interested in buying, so the decline was also fierce. Before long, it plummeted by 210 yuan. Silver firms and cash firms sold 60 taels to a certain gold firm, all for 3,810 yuan. At noon, it rose slightly again. A money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a silver firm for 3,840 yuan. In the early afternoon, a silver firm sold a total of 50 taels to fellow firms and gold firms, all for 3,850 yuan. Later, because a certain bank made strong advances on behalf of customers, it soon raised the price by 90 yuan. A certain bank bought 10 taels from a gold firm for 3,940 yuan. At that time, silver firms took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and a certain gold firm also sold on behalf of out-of-town silver firms, which immediately caused a drop of 90 yuan. A silver firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange firm for 3,850 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm once again raised the price to 3,900 yuan, and then a silver firm sold 10 taels to a gold firm for 3,895 yuan, which was the closing price. As a result, it rose sharply by 415 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 270 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. The current standard gold price was 55 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed High at 395 Yuan

Czech Nationals Submit Letter Volunteering

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, members of the Czech Association in Shanghai have sent identical letters to the British and French ambassadors to China. They state that as citizens of the Czech Republic, they are unaffected by the German invasion and are willing to serve the British and French governments. The full text of the letter is as follows:

"Your Excellency, we respectfully submit the resolution passed by a special meeting of the Czech Association in Shanghai. The resolution is as follows: At this perilous time when England and France have taken up arms to defend the most sacred and important human rights, the members of the Czech Association in Shanghai, representing 95% of the Czechs in China, feel it their duty to issue the following declaration for the information of all parties: (1) We still regard ourselves as citizens of the independent Czech Republic founded by the late President Masaryk. The Czech Republic has a constitution that embodies lofty principles, which were personified by the late President. Furthermore, we do not recognize as citizens of the Czech Republic those who have deemed it appropriate to exchange their original Czech passports for German ones. (2) Hitler's aggression and the so-called 'independence' of Slovakia have no impact on our legal status. We were citizens of the Czech Republic in the past, and we remain so now. (3) We solemnly declare that we fully sympathize with the democratic nations in this terrible war, which was not desired by democratic nations but has broken out. We are unanimously prepared to serve to the best of our abilities. Therefore, we unanimously await the disposition of the British and French authorities. If we receive orders from our national government specifying the extent of service, we will serve to that extent without reservation. The above resolution was proclaimed, discussed, and unanimously passed at a special meeting of the Czech Association in Shanghai on September 5th of this year and has been recorded in the association's journal.

Polish Consulate Notifies Nationals to Enlist

According to the North-China Daily News, the Polish Consulate in Shanghai has notified Polish nationals in the city who wish to serve in the military to register with the consulate. It is reported that preparations are underway to arrange convenient transportation.

According to the Continental Daily News, reliable sources indicated last night (the 5th) that Polish residents in Shanghai will be given the opportunity to register with the Polish Consulate in Shanghai to join the military and will be provided with transportation back to Poland. However, the departure date has not yet been determined. The transportation may be via Canada. There are currently 400 Polish nationals in Shanghai. The Polish Minister to China, Mr. Woytowicz, will leave Shanghai on the Japanese Empress liner for Vancouver, from where he will return to his war-torn homeland. Mr. Bohomolec, the acting Polish Consul-General in Shanghai, will serve as Chargé d'Affaires at the Polish Legation here. The previous report that Mr. Bohomolec would leave Shanghai on the Empress liner was inaccurate.

Polish Envoy's Return Home Proceeding

Polish Minister to China, Mr. Woytowicz, having been ordered to return home to take up an important diplomatic post, left Shanghai on the 3rd with his wife and daughter aboard the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress liner. However, the ship had not been authorized by the British naval authorities and was therefore unable to sail. It is now learned that the Changxing Company obtained permission from the British Navy late the night before yesterday, and the ship departed Wusong immediately. After leaving Shanghai, Minister Woytowicz plans to travel to Vancouver, Canada, and then proceed to his new post. Yesterday's Western newspapers reported that the Polish Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Bohomolec, also returned home aboard the Changxing Company's liner, but this has been reported as inaccurate.

Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Refuses to Release German Funds

Mr. Hepburn, the manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, stated that the bank received a notification from the British Embassy that Britain and Germany are now formally at war, and diplomatic relations have been severed.

Consequently, German merchants in England are no longer permitted to withdraw funds deposited in British banks. It is understood that regarding the deposits of Jewish refugees and Czech merchants in these British banks, some flexibility will be allowed due to the great hardships they have suffered.

Both Changxing Liners Depart for Hong Kong

The Changxing Company's steamships Japanese Empress and Asian Empress weighed anchor around 10 PM the night before last (the 5th) and departed for Hong Kong together. After arriving in Hong Kong, the Asian Empress will continue her original voyage to Manila. The Japanese Empress, which had arrived in Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong, was supposed to proceed to Japan from Hong Kong and return to Vancouver via Honolulu. Unexpectedly, the ship departed for Hong Kong with the Asian Empress the night before last, heading directly to Honolulu and then returning to Vancouver without calling at Japan. The reason for this is unknown.

Italian Mail Increases Passenger and Freight Charges

The Italian mail ship Romolo Gessa, which had been delayed for several days, has been ordered to set sail by its head office after Italy declared its neutrality. The ship is scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 8th to return to Europe. The company believes that sailing under the current risky conditions warrants a reasonable price, so freight charges will be increased by 20% across the board, effective immediately. Passenger fares will increase by 40%. For example, the first-class fare from Shanghai to Hong Kong, previously £9 (British currency), will now be £12 and 12 shillings. The second-class fare, previously £6 and 8 pounds, will now be £8 and 8 shillings. The economic second-class (i.e., third-class) fare, previously £4, will now be £5 and 12 shillings. Fares to Southeast Asia and other foreign destinations will be increased by 40% across the board. The company's Conte Biancamano is still scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th of this month.

The Bengloe will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong, and the Nanking will dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.

Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson Ships Depart

The ships of the British trading companies Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson, which operate along the Chinese coast, were previously ordered to suspend operations by the British Navy. As a result, all ships of both companies were completely suspended from service on the 1st of this week, creating a very tense situation. The situation gradually eased starting on Tuesday. Butterfield & Swire's Yisheng resumed service first, departing for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 5th at 6:00 PM. The Zeh Sheng, Fu Sheng, Shun 犬, and other ships have since departed the port.

The French Company's irregular ship Yangtsekiang arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow (the 8th).

German Giant Liners Still Docked in Kobe

The German ships operating on the lower Yangtze River are still operating as usual. The Norddeutscher Lloyd's Scharnhorst, which is stranded in Kobe, was rumored yesterday to be leaving Japan for another destination. According to the company, this is not the case. Moreover, the sea is too dangerous for travel, so it will remain docked in Kobe with the Eider indefinitely. The Henck Company's Ramses is currently docked outside Wusong and has another ship in Japan, the name of which is unknown. The shipping industry has been shaken by the European situation for several days, but today it can be said to have temporarily stabilized. However, the future trend is still difficult to predict.

European Mail Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Transportation Section of the Postal Administration yesterday morning that the bureau is making every effort to facilitate mail delivery to and from European countries. A large batch of mail from Europe arrived on the Minis刁 liner at 11:00 AM yesterday, and a large batch of mail from Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru in the afternoon.

As for mail destined for Russia and Europe via Siberia, it will first be shipped to Tianjin or Qinhuangdao by steamer and then forwarded.

No One Delivering Overseas Parcels

Shipping between Shanghai and European countries has been interrupted, making postal delivery difficult and preventing the transport of commercial goods. Although the Shanghai Postal Administration is experiencing difficulties due to the disruption of international transportation, it is continuing to make efforts to facilitate postal delivery to Europe. In addition to regular, registered, and express mail, which are very congested, there is a clear lack of personnel to deliver large and small parcels destined for overseas destinations. Therefore, the business of the Postal Bureau's Overseas Parcel Section has come to a standstill.

Speculation Rampant, Foreign Exchange Plummets

### Saigon Rice Arrives in Shanghai Today

Preparing for Price Stabilization, Requesting Assistance from Authorities, Hoarders Take Advantage of Market Fluctuations

Mr. Yu Qiaqing previously noted that the supply of rice in Shanghai was disrupted, causing prices to soar and creating a serious situation. To alleviate the food shortage, he first ordered 18,000 bags of Saigon rice and, together with Mr. Li Fusun and Mr. Xu Jilu, telegraphed President Kong of the Executive Yuan, requesting the provision of foreign exchange. President Kong, concerned about the people's livelihood, immediately telegraphed back approving the purchase of £10,000 in foreign exchange at the official rate. The first batch of Saigon rice was shipped from Saigon on the 29th of last month aboard the Norwegian ship Haida, operated by the Wah Lun Shipping Company. A telegram has been received stating that the ship will arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM today (the 7th). Customs has been notified, and it is scheduled to dock at the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road for unloading. It is also learned that 500 tons of Saigon rice ordered by the British company Jardine Matheson were shipped to Shanghai aboard the French postal ship Chin La Sil. However, due to the outbreak of the European war, it was ordered to return after reaching the mouth of the Song River, preventing unloading. It is reported that the cargo owners will arrange for it to be reloaded onto a neutral country's ship and shipped to Shanghai again.

Cooperating with the Rice Industry to Stabilize Prices

Of the Saigon rice, 10,000 bags were ordered by the Refugee Relief Association and will be distributed to various shelters as food for refugees. The remaining 8,000 bags will be entrusted to rice industry organizations for distribution to various stores for price stabilization. The estimated price of the Saigon rice is over 30 yuan per stone. However, with the Ministry of Finance providing legal foreign exchange and granting tax-free imports, the cost per stone is only a little over 20 yuan, which will greatly benefit the common people. A meeting with rice industry organizations will be convened in the coming days to discuss price stabilization measures, and the Municipal Council will be asked to provide assistance.

Supply Lines Open, No Worries About Food

Regarding the registration of Saigon rice orders handled by the Accountants Association, yesterday saw the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital register for 250 bags and the Woolen Fabric Industry Association register for 250 bags. Including previous registrations, the total number has reached 4,786 bags. Various trade associations are currently handling registrations separately and will soon report the consolidated figures. The organizers will continue to place orders as soon as they have collected a sufficient number, and the rice will be transported on neutral country ships, unaffected by any obstacles. As for domestic rice, there has been a bumper harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and it has already entered the market one after another. Moreover, after the Municipal Council cleared the supply lines, there are no more problems. Therefore, a large amount of rice will be transported to Shanghai in the future, and there is no need to worry about food.

Recent Rice Prices Fluctuate

Although only 250 stone arrived in He Xia yesterday, hoarders released as many as 6,770 bags for sale. However, due to the impending arrival of Saigon rice and the price stabilization measures, rice shops were reluctant to buy, resulting in no interest in the morning market and a price drop of 1 yuan. However, after the afternoon opening, hoarders took the opportunity to manipulate prices, deliberately raising them, resulting in a rebound of 2 yuan. As a result, prices were actually 1 yuan higher than the previous day. Prices for glutinous rice also rose by 1 yuan due to scarcity.

### Slaughterhouses in Two Concessions Expected to Resume Operations Soon

All slaughterhouses in the two concessions were forced to close for three days in protest against the increase in prices at the "Livestock Market." After days of negotiations between meat merchants in the two concessions and the Hongkou Meat Merchants Association, they unanimously resolved to oppose the auction system and demand the restoration of the weighing system. After repeated negotiations, the "Livestock Market" has agreed to consider accepting the demands of the slaughterhouses. Therefore, it is expected that all meat merchants in the two concessions will resume operations today, and the slaughter and sale of meat will resume.

### Japanese Consul Visits Consuls of Warring Nations, Requests Avoidance of Conflict in China

The details of the request are not yet known. Overseas diplomatic circles have expressed great interest in the Japanese Consul's visit to the British, French, and German consuls. According to Sir Herbert Phillips, the British Consul-General, the Japanese Consul-General did pay a visit, but no written statement was submitted.

### Haifang Suspends Freight Transport

Import and Export Freight Transport Temporarily Suspended, Goods Transshipped to Inland Areas Greatly Affected

Haifang is currently a crucial hub for connecting the interior of the country, and this city attaches great importance to it. However, due to the impact of the European situation, all shipping has been suspended, causing great anxiety for general business firms. It is now learned that the ship routes operated by Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have been permitted by the British Navy and have now resumed. The Taiyuan Line to Haifang has been scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 9th. However, according to a telegram received by a certain travel agency in this city from Haifang yesterday, the Haifang authorities, under the orders of the French government, have temporarily suspended all import and export freight transport. Therefore, goods transported from there to inland areas have been greatly affected.

### Shanghai Citizens' Association Suggests Stamp Tokens

Readily Redeemable, Remedying the Difficulty of Small Change Shortage, To Be Terminated After the Government's Fractional Currency Notes Arrive in Shanghai

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association yesterday suggested that various public organizations promote "stamp tokens," readily redeemable, to facilitate commerce and industry, prevent the drawbacks of price vouchers, and remedy the difficulty of small change shortage. Details are as follows:

Suggesting the Promotion of Stamp Tokens

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association yesterday sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Bankers' Association, Shanghai Money Dealers' Association, Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, and Cigarette Dealers' Association, stating: "Since the shortage of copper coins in this city, various industries have been using postage stamps as a substitute for small change. Recently, the Postal Administration has stated that it is difficult to recover the token stamps, and postage stamps have been rejected by the market. What has followed is the spontaneous price vouchers issued by various shops, which are diverse and plentiful, filling the market. The authenticity of these vouchers is mixed, and there are many drawbacks. The matter is sufficient to cause future troubles, which is very obvious. In order to facilitate commerce and industry and prevent losses to the public, this association has suggested the promotion of stamp tokens as a temporary remedy. We have long admired your association's enthusiasm for social welfare, and we have specially prepared a draft of the implementation measures for stamp tokens and the organizational outline of the stamp token management committee, each in one copy. We would like to ask for your valuable opinions. If you agree, we will schedule another meeting to discuss the matter. We hope you will consider and reply."

Implementation Measures for Stamp Tokens

(1) The issuance and redemption of stamp tokens shall be governed by these measures. (2) Stamp tokens shall be divided into two denominations: 1 cent and 2 cents. (3) A stamp token voucher shall be issued for stamp tokens. The voucher shall be made of cardboard, and in addition to the affixed stamp, it shall be sealed with transparent paper to prevent dirt and facilitate use. (4) The stamp token voucher shall be stamped by this association, and the voucher holder shall always keep the outer seal intact. (5) The redemption of stamp token vouchers shall be in legal tender, with the yuan as the unit. (6) The time for issuing and redeeming stamp token vouchers shall be from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily. (7) The location for issuing and redeeming stamp token vouchers (to be determined later). (8) Stamp token vouchers shall be redeemed by this association for cash within one month after the government's fractional currency notes arrive.

### Four Chinese Citizens in Tianjin Must Still Face Trial

Due to the Transfer to the Puppet Court, Lawyers Will Respond Accordingly

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the transfer of the four Chinese terrorist suspects from Tianjin to the Japanese-controlled court there will not affect the writ of habeas corpus hearing scheduled for Monday by the Shanghai British Assessor's Office. In light of the latest developments in this case, the lawyers at the law firm of Allis & Co. will need to slightly modify their approach at the hearing before Sir Assessor Moss on Monday. They are awaiting instructions from London. Allis & Co. represents the law firm of Ewell & Fairfoot of London in filing the petition for a writ of habeas corpus for the four defendants.

### Foreigners Register for Military Service, Municipal Council Sets Leave Procedures

Employees of Warring Nations Prohibited from Taking Long Leave, Resignations Must Be Submitted Six Months in Advance

The Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (the 6th) issued a notice to its employees stating that all employees who are nationals of European warring nations are prohibited from taking military leave, and those who have already taken leave and left Shanghai will be suspended from their positions. Employees who are nationals of the United States, Japan, and other neutral countries may continue to work as usual and have the freedom to take long leave. According to Mr. Phillips, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, this measure is not related to financial considerations but is due to concerns that those who take long leave to return home may not be able to return to Shanghai on time due to the European war. It is also learned that employees who are nationals of warring nations such as Britain, Germany, and Poland, who resign from the council to join the volunteer forces of their respective countries, will still be approved, but the resignation must be submitted six months in advance, in accordance with the Municipal Council's established practice, and will only take effect after the full term. However, those who are

Military Reservists

who are recalled by their respective national governments will be given immediate approval by the Municipal Council to facilitate their immediate return home. In recent days, many British employees of the Municipal Council have registered for military service at the British Consulate. According to Mr. Phillips, the number of military reservists among them is relatively small. Mr. Phillips also stated that any council employee who returns home to serve in the military must

Resign According to Law

But their positions will still be given to them after they return to Shanghai. This is a way to take care of both emotions and reason. The Municipal Council is a municipal organization and must maintain its operations. If all employees were to leave their posts at this critical juncture, the council's affairs would inevitably be disrupted, as it would be very difficult to hire a large number of personnel to fill the vacancies here.

### Domestic Goods Industry Organizes Production and Sales Jointly Operated Commercial Center

With the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland and the cessation of foreign goods supplies, domestic goods industries in Shanghai, such as Tang Jingzhou and others, are aware of the urgent need to expand production. They have chosen a location in the area of Nanjing Road, Henan Road, Nan Shanxi Road East to establish a jointly operated domestic goods commercial center, connecting major domestic goods factories, centralizing production and sales, cooperating to strengthen their forces, and seeking the development of domestic goods. After the renovation of the buildings is completed, it will open for business.

### Yangsi Bridge Massacre, Japanese Puppets Conduct Extensive Searches

On the morning of the 4th, a massacre occurred in Yangsi Bridge Town in Pudong, in which Li Jie, the "Town Chief" of the town, and his younger brother, as well as Zhou Helin, the "Village Chief" of Zhoujia Bridge, were assassinated by five people. Xie Zhaogen, the "Village Chief" of another Ai Fen Village, was shot in the waist and legs and seriously injured. He was sent to the Renzhi Hospital on East Chang Road for treatment, but died late at night. After the incident, the Japanese puppet "military" and "police" were greatly shocked and conducted a full-scale search for the murderers along the railway line on Shangnan Road on the 4th and 5th. People's homes were searched, and residents were frightened several times a day, but nothing has been found so far.

### Consolidation of Nisshin Company

Taking advantage of the interruption of foreign shipping lines, planning to monopolize maritime transport by taking over shifts

The Japanese "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd.," which is plotting to seize coastal shipping in China and reorganized under the orders of Tokyo, has already started operating at the original location of Nisshin Company on the Bund in Guangdong Road. All companies such as Nisshin, Osaka, and Nippon Yusen are extremely busy carrying out merger matters at a rapid pace. Starting from September 1st, the original ships of Nisshin Company will first fly the new flag. Ships from Osaka, Mitsui, Okazaki, Awa Kuni Joint Steamship Company, Yamashita, Daido, and Nippon Yusen will also change flags one after another. The so-called "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." intends to take advantage of the disruption of foreign shipping and will soon dispatch ships to take over the shifts of foreign ships. Therefore, in the future, most of the shipping along the Chinese coast will fall into Japanese hands.

### Workers' Cost of Living Index Reaches Record High

Increased by over 87% in eight months, people's hearts are unsettled, and the environment is unstable, there are reasons for this

The Industrial Section of the Public Works Department opened last month and began investigating the cost of living for Westerners in order to compile an index table. The section sent investigation letters to 2,000 Westerners and used newspapers and radio stations for publicity. Several replies have been received, and the number of people to be investigated will increase to compile a reliable index table. The cost of living for Chinese workers continues to increase, with the total index at 234.17 (based on the average cost in 1936 as the base of 100), an increase of 45.61 compared to July, creating the

Highest record in the index table for the past four years

Comparing the classified indexes for July and August, food increased by 24.66%, clothing increased by 12.60%, fuel and lighting increased by 74.07%, and miscellaneous items increased by 24.69%. Since January of this year, the cost of living index has gradually increased, rising by 87.67% in eight months. One yuan of national currency in 1936 was still worth 6 jiao 7 fen 8 li at the end of last year, but last month it was

Worth only 4 jiao

2 fen 7 li. The reasons for the soaring cost of living can be summarized as follows: 1. Sharp contraction of foreign exchange; 2. Merchant manipulation; 3. The political situation makes people feel uneasy; 4. Transportation difficulties between rural and urban areas; 5. Sellers hoarding goods to seek huge profits, and buyers also hoarding goods to prevent shortages, resulting in ever-increasing prices; 6. Disappearance of copper coins, items that could be purchased with several copper coins or copper coins in the past are now priced in jiao coins.

Residents who purchase items piecemeal

Are greatly affected. Based on the above reasons, in the past few months, there have been dozens of items with price increases of more than 20%. Here are some of the items with the highest price increases: Japonica rice increased by 104.13%, indica rice by 72.47%, glutinous rice by 45.70%, flour by 42.66%, sliced noodles by 34.02%, tofu by 100.00%, green vegetables by 181.82%, radish by 279.32%, spinach by 50.00%, beef by 20.49%, salted pork by 89.91%, fresh fish by 68.39%, white sugar by 54.38%, flannel by 43.93%, coal briquettes by 91.04%, charcoal by 81.53%, soap by 49.25%, hot water by 94.12%.

### Newly Arrived Jewish Refugees Must Bring Their Own Funds

Otherwise, they will not be allowed to disembark. Decided by the joint meeting yesterday.

Another 900 people are coming to Shanghai

The English "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reported that the Special Committee for Jewish Refugees, organized by the French, Japanese, and Public Works Departments and the Jewish authorities, held a meeting at the Japanese Consulate this morning (6th) to stipulate measures for future European Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai. No specific regulations were agreed upon during the meeting, but a temporary regulation was agreed upon, that new Jewish refugees must bring their own funds to be allowed to disembark in Shanghai. According to personnel from the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Relief Committee, they have not received definite news about new immigrants coming to Shanghai from Europe, but yesterday (5th) they received news from Manila stating that two batches of Jewish refugees have already set sail from Genoa by ship, totaling 900 people.

The "Continental Daily" reported that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai is scheduled to convene a special committee meeting on Jewish refugees today (6th). In addition to the issue of distributing and settling German refugees in Shanghai, it is expected that their status as nationals of belligerent countries will also be discussed. This committee is an affiliated organization of the International Committee for Jewish Refugees, organized by officials from the Public and French Concessions, the Japanese Consul-General, and one member of the International Committee. Yesterday (5th), an official from the Public Works Department stated that no changes are planned for the treatment of refugees who are already in Shanghai or on

The way to Shanghai. However, another person pointed out the peculiar situation of Jewish refugees, as refugees are enemies in the French Concession, people of belligerent countries in the neutral Public Concession controlled by the British, and people of Japan's allied countries in the Hongkou controlled by the Japanese. The first to request

Restrictions on immigration to Shanghai were the Japanese. The last batch of refugees to leave Europe is expected to arrive soon. Many refugees were originally carried by the German ships "Gneisenau" and "Potsdam," but both ships were forced to return to Germany when the war broke out. The Italian postal ship "Conte Verde," now sailing in the Indian Ocean, will carry hundreds of refugees. The ship originally docked in the Indian Ocean to await the development of the war, but it is now expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

### August Industrial Report from the Public Works Department

Group training is effective, labor-management disputes are resolved

Although the prices of industrial raw materials in the city have increased, most factories were quite busy last month, except for a very few. There are a total of 46 silk reeling factories in this port, of which 30 are operating. However, the arrival of fresh lotus roots is not strong and is not enough to maintain long-term production. Four silk reeling factories with new equipment are able to reel high-quality lotus silk, which is actively sold abroad. The current situation of other silk factories is also good. Rubber shoe factories are experiencing business slump due to various reasons, such as the prohibition of transporting and selling sports shoes to neighboring provinces, rising raw material prices, and seasonal factors. Small-scale textile printing and dyeing factories have reduced work, but large-scale factories have been able to maintain their original production levels, except for a few that have reduced work. Flavoring powder factories are working well, but there is a shortage of gluten (a byproduct of starch), which is used as a raw material. Several waste cotton factories have temporarily stopped work, and straw weaving factories are also experiencing sluggish business. Last month, the new factories under preparation or already in operation that are worthy of attention include two silk factories and two chemical factories. A total of 165 factories were initially inspected by the Industrial Section.

Group training

On the 18th of last month, the Industrial Section held a lecture to explain how to start a fire to reduce smoke emissions. There were 138 boiler managers who attended the lecture. The "Industrial Common Sense and Safety Training Class" is scheduled to start on September 1st, with four hours of classes per week (completed in fifteen weeks). As of August 29th, a total of 118 trainees from registered factories have registered, including 31 boiler manufacturers and foremen. The manufacturers of small light bulbs held a meeting to continue discussing business standards. Leather factory owners held two meetings successively. In addition, the Hot Water Bottle Factory Association also held a meeting. At that time, the association invited a representative from the Industrial Section to attend the meeting and provide instructions on the safe prevention methods for using celluloid paint.

Boiler management

Last month, 80 boilers that had not been registered before were applied for registration by the factory owners. The factory owners submitted 35 installation inspection certificates and 9 annual inspection certificates. Three more registered boiler manufacturers were added last month, bringing the total to 15. One of the newly registered ones is located in the Eastern District. A boiler manufacturer, despite repeated warnings, still failed to hire a qualified engineer to inspect the products, and the boiler plates used did not meet the required conditions. Therefore, the court has issued a summons and scheduled a hearing. The number of boilers sealed by the Public Works Department has increased by 95, bringing the total to 220.

Accidents

A total of 192 accidents were reported, including 11 fatalities. A total of 21 women were injured. The exact causes of the accidents are known in 185 cases. 61 cases have been thoroughly investigated and the factory has been ordered to adopt preventive measures. According to the classification of causes, accidents caused by machines driven by mechanical force were the most common, with a total of 32 cases, of which 12 cases were related to belts and gears. There were 7 cases caused by electricity, including 3 fatalities. A total of 7 workers were injured in explosions, including 1 death. According to the industrial classification, the most accidents occurred in the textile industry, including 3 fatalities. A total of 7 fires occurred in factories, injuring 3 workers, but no one died.

Labor disputes

The Industrial Section handled a total of 9 labor disputes, of which 5 were caused by requests for wage increases. As a result, the section assisted in resolving them. Several factories and businesses, in view of the increasing cost of living, have increased the treatment of workers. In the past two months, many factories have increased wages twice. However, whether the percentage of wage increases is sufficient to cover the increased percentage of living expenses.

### Mahogany Furniture Burned, Suing the Fire Starter for Compensation

Aftermath of the fire in the Rue愷自邇

Zhang Bingsheng, a 48-year-old man from Huzhou and a second landlord living at No. 6, Renchang Lane, Lane 214, Rue愷自邇 in the French Concession, ran a Kuaihuolin Film Company in his home. At around 4:00 am on the 5th of last month, a fire broke out due to careless testing, instantly piercing the roof, causing eight members of the families of Zhang Baotang and Zhang Chuqing, who lived in the same house, including women and children, to be unable to escape and buried in the fire. Later, the police found that Zhang Bingsheng had a huge amount of fire insurance and that Zhang should not have stored a large number of rosin raw materials used to make films in his home, causing an unprecedented disaster. Therefore, Zhang Bingsheng was arrested and sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, and the French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against him for causing death due to negligence in business and violation of regulations. The case was concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang, who sentenced Zhang Bingsheng to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day, and a fine of 200 yuan for the violation. During the appeal period, the defendant still paid the original security deposit of 4,000 yuan. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, Shao Lihe, Zhang Bingsheng's primary landlord, had supplied a full set of mahogany furniture for use when Zhang rented the house, which was insured by Zhang. Now that it has been burned down, Zhang has not compensated for the mahogany furniture after receiving the insurance money, and repeated demands have been ineffective. Therefore, Shao Lihe commissioned lawyer Bian Jialu to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Zhang Bingsheng for compensation for the destroyed mahogany furniture at the original price of 3,485 yuan. The court, according to the complaint, summoned both parties for trial in the Civil Court 7 by Judge Yu Changzi yesterday morning. The defendant was absent, and only the plaintiff's lawyer arrived in court to present the case. The court ordered that the defendant be summoned again for trial on a later date.

### Disobeying the Sentence for Raping a Female Disciple

Awaiting judgment after the appeal is concluded

Miao Ying, the 16-year-old daughter of Zheng Gu, a woman from Ningbo who lives at No. 12, Baoxing Lane, French Avenue, is beautiful and graceful. Starting in July of the tenth year, she hired Wang Peizhi (36 years old this year, from Shandong), an actor who lives at No. 4, Yiru Lane, Tiantong Road, Hongkou, to teach her female roles in Peking opera. By last winter, Miao Ying had successfully learned her art, so on the evening of the second day of the twelfth lunar month of the same year, Wang accompanied her to the Tianchan Theater for practice. After the event, Wang sent her back. On the way, Wang lured her by saying that if she wanted to improve her voice, she had to break her virginity before she could succeed. The girl was young and ignorant and fell into his trap, resulting in being raped several times in a row. Unexpectedly, after a few spring breezes, the girl secretly conceived. This summer, her mother discovered that her abdomen was gradually bulging. After questioning her daughter, she learned the truth and was shocked. She reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang and send him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution according to the law. The result of the first trial was that Wang was sentenced to one year in prison. Now Wang refuses to accept the sentence and has filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, together with Judges Wang and Chen, opened a collegial panel for trial. Zheng Miao Ying, heavily pregnant, accompanied her mother to court to await the hearing. The court prohibited spectators because the case concerned morality. As a result, the trial was declared concluded, and the sentence was scheduled to be announced on the 11th. The appellant was still sent back to the detention center.

### Japanese Soldiers' Truck Runs Over and Kills an Old Woman

At about 10:00 am yesterday, a truck carrying six or seven Japanese soldiers was speeding south on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai. When it reached the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway crossing (near Caoxi Road), an old woman of about 50 years old was walking in the middle of the road. Because she could not avoid it, she was knocked to the ground, injuring her abdomen and causing her intestines to flow out. She died instantly. No family members were found. It was not until the afternoon that four pseudo-police officers went to dig a grave and bury her.

### Korean Trafficking Drugs, Falsely Reporting Theft After Being Extorted

At a Korean's home at No. 9, Lane 345, Rue Poullain in the French Concession, at 8:30 pm the night before last, a thief suddenly arrived with a pistol and robbed two gold rings and dozens of yuan in cash, totaling over 100 yuan. After investigation by the French police, it was discovered that the Korean was suspected of making a false report because there was no robbery at that time and place. After strict questioning, it was learned that the Korean had been engaged in selling morphine and was extorted a large sum of money by someone taking advantage of the situation, so he falsely claimed that he was robbed.

### Complications in the Wheat Trading Case, Cao Wenyu Sentenced with Probation

Cao Wenyu, an employee of the Japanese company Huili, and Cao Xiaoti, his cousin, signed a wheat trading contract last spring. Cao agreed to sell 20,000 bags of wheat to Cai. Later, Cai paid a deposit as agreed, but Cao violated the contract and did not deliver the goods as agreed. Cai suffered a significant loss and negotiated with Cao without result. Cao was unable to cope and had a whimsical idea, forging a paper of reconciliation, saying that the wheat trading contract had been terminated. The reconciliation document was written by Cao himself, and Cai's name was also signed by Cao. As for Cai's seal, it was stolen by Cao when he broke into Cai's home. The reconciliation document

Had no proof. In May of this year, Cai filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Cao for the return of the deposit and compensation for losses, totaling more than 12,000 yuan. Cao actually presented the forged reconciliation document to the court as an excuse. Later, Cai commissioned the China Recording Company to collect Cao's confession of the crime from the telephone in order to seek collateral evidence. Cao and Cai admitted in Shanghai dialect that they had stolen Cai's seal, so Cai made the recording into a record and commissioned lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court against Cao for the crime of forging documents, and presented the record as strong collateral evidence. Cao then hired lawyer Huang Zengjie to defend him and filed a counterclaim against Cai for false accusation. The court, according to the complaint, after repeated trials by Judge Sun Pengxian, at the end of last month

Declared the end. Judge Yu ordered Cao to pay a shop deposit of 1,000 yuan and be released pending sentencing. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. Judge Sun took the bench in Criminal Court 2 and announced the judgment: Cao Wenyu's forgery of documents was sufficient to harm others, and he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, but considering that he was a first-time offender, he was granted a three-year reprieve.

### French Police Crack Down on Two Gangs of Thieves

Arresting 14 criminals and a large number of stolen goods, they were sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday for a continued hearing

They sent detectives Mao Jinsheng, Ke Enqing, Ke Enqi, Du Chengyi, etc. to rush to the address.

Before long, according to a secret report, there was also a pickpocketing gang at Room 327, 3rd Floor, Asia Hotel, No. 135, Avenue Edward VII, so the original detectives were sent to rush to the address at 12:00 noon. Unexpectedly, a large number of thieves were gathering in the room, smoking, gambling, and cheering, with their voices reaching outside. The detectives entered the room and arrested them all, including: Jiang Guixi (from Hubei), Zhang Songlin (from Nanjing), Liu Baobao (from Zhenjiang), Hong Zhengtai (from Hunan), Zhang Haiqing (from Hubei), Ma Qian (from Anhui), Wang Youcai (from Nanjing), Wang Hanqing (from Anhui), and other ten people, and confiscated most of the stolen goods, and brought the witnesses and evidence to the police station.

### Letters

To the esteemed Editor, I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Guo Zhongyue, manager of Qiang Zhong Hang, who has stated that he recently read a news item in the local news column of the Shen Bao on the 5th of this month, entitled "Employees of American Enterprise Company Collude to Embezzle Medicines," which stated that Lü Jingfang, Zhang Zhiruan, and others first stole blank order forms from a certain pharmacy related to the company, filled out the goods, and successively transported out Vaseline, cod liver oil, and Claysol oil worth 7,446.51 yuan, all of which were stored in Qiang Zhong Hang in Xin Shou An Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, prepared by Zhou Zhongyi, and sold and embezzled successively. He was shocked and horrified. He stated that the three people, Lü Jingfang, Zhang Zhiruan, and Zhou Zhongyi, not only have never had any dealings with our firm, but have never even met us. How could they store Vaseline, cod liver oil, and Claysol oil in our firm? The report in the newspaper is obviously untrue. It concerns the reputation of our firm, and we should ask you to write to the newspaper to correct it on our behalf. Your cooperation will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Lawyer Yang Qianmao.

To the esteemed Editor, Our automobile dealership is located at No. 9, Xinkaihe Road in the French Concession. Today, I read a news item in the third edition of your newspaper about Wu San and Zhu Jiuru working in our automobile dealership. After investigation, these two people have never worked in our automobile dealership, so I am writing to ask your newspaper to correct it on our behalf. Your gratitude will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Lu Lianfu Transportation Automobile Dealership, September 5, 28th year.

To the esteemed Editor, I am writing on behalf of the shareholders of the Da Shanghai Printing Factory, Luo Kaiji, etc., who have stated that they recently saw a news item in the Shen Bao of August 6 concerning our factory, which is inconsistent with the facts. The number of workers in the business is not more than 70, and most of them are paid by the piece, not long-term employees. Our factory has had difficulty supporting itself due to soaring raw material prices, and the workers suddenly went on strike and arbitrarily coerced, making it difficult to support. We had no choice but to decide to close down. We have suffered extremely heavy losses as a result. Unexpectedly, the workers are still occupying and coercing us, which is unbearable. Now, after reading the news report, there is obviously a rumor. Please write a letter to correct it on our behalf, so as to clarify the truth. Based on this, I am writing to you to ask your newspaper to quickly correct it. Sincerely, Lawyer Feng Meixue, September 6.

(Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education has revised the "Wartime Book and Magazine Review Regulations" and issued a circular to all provincial education departments to comply and implement. The details of the regulations are as follows: (1) During the War of Resistance, in order to meet wartime needs and unify national thought, the central government has established the Central Book and Magazine Review Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Central Review Authority) to adopt a manuscript review method to handle all review matters related to books and magazines.

Its organizational outline will be determined separately. (3) If there are differences of opinion regarding the review of books and magazines by the Central Review Authority, the opinion of the representative of the Central Propaganda Department shall prevail. (4) To facilitate the rapid publication of books and magazines in various regions, local book and magazine review committees (hereinafter referred to as Local Review Authorities) shall be established under the guidance of party, government, military, and police agencies in major cities (or provincial capitals) to handle the review of books and magazines in their respective jurisdictions. Establishment is not permitted if there are few bookstores and publishing houses in the area. The general rules for the organization of the Local Review Authorities will be determined separately. (5) When reviewing various books and magazines, if the Local Review Authorities discover major errors, they should order the suspension of printing, or if the content is complex and cannot be decided independently, they should submit the original manuscript along with a signed opinion to the Central Review Authority for approval before implementation. As for books and periodicals that should be revised or abridged, the Local Review Authorities may handle them independently, but must promptly report them to the Central Review Authority for record. (6) Bookstores and publishing houses in various regions must submit books and magazines for review and approval by the review authority in their location before they are allowed to be published, with the exception of natural sciences and applied sciences unrelated to national defense, and textbooks for primary, secondary, and vocational schools, and mass education schools, which should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. If there is no Local Review Authority in the location, they may submit them directly to the Central Review Authority. Purely academic works that do not involve current affairs, political, social, or ideological issues may not be required to submit the original manuscript for review, but they must be submitted to the review authority for review before publication. (7) After publication by our Party and various military and political agencies, one copy must be submitted to the Central Review Authority for record. (8) When bookstores and publishing houses submit books and magazines for review, they must submit one copy of the original manuscript or two copies of the proof. After the Local Review Authority completes the review and if there are no inappropriate contents, the original manuscript or proof will be stamped with a "Reviewed" seal and returned to the submitter. (9) If the opinions in the submitted book or magazine manuscript are completely erroneous, the process will be stopped. If a portion is erroneous, it must be revised or deleted according to the indicated points before publication is allowed.

(12) Books and magazines submitted for review that have a correct attitude, excellent content, and are beneficial to the War of Resistance may be rewarded separately. The measures will be determined separately. (13) Books and magazines approved for publication by the review authority will be issued a review certificate.

### Time

— Hong Kuangcheng

——To a friend who trusts me

What makes you live? It's time that never stops for a second. Time and life are fused together, they stand on the same track, pushing life forward. But time has a strange "temper" that surprises you. You must satisfy it, it can give you a valuable life, give you a beautiful life. Otherwise, it will turn you into an outdated person.

I can tell you about its "temper", that is: what most people dislike makes it like, and what most people are satisfied with makes it unhappy. For example, on this hot day, you work hard, and the stench of sweat makes people sick, which can gain the favor of time, it will reward your diligence. If you are surrounded by air conditioning, singing and dancing with glamorous people, and the strong fragrance of powder fills the air, even if you think this is beautiful, time hates these, it will punish you, block your path to light, and soon you will be at a crossroads, hesitating.

What I said is not fabricated out of thin air, using illusory statements to confuse you. This is the experience of countless people, the conclusion drawn from the practice of countless people.

Time gives people a serious life, creates an era for mankind, forward, great...

When time pushes the era, it is faster than anything else, you must make good use of the time that belongs to you, you cannot neglect to let it slip from your fingers, ears, and eyes. You have to grab it and run with it. You should not wait for your companions to urge you and encourage you. If you are not careful and slack off a little, in an instant, you have fallen behind!

I sincerely advise you, do not use fantasy or empty hope as materials to fill your time. You should do it practically, grasp the forward life, and overcome all difficulties.

Please don't be complacent, thinking that you have made sufficient use of your time, and admit that you have stepped up your pace in the forward horn. You should examine, what are the shortcomings, regarding time; what else is there to be hidden. Based on your introspection, transform your life again!

My words are not the most brilliant, they can only be used as some reference in life. In the process of your forward life, I hope you can write a page that is more valuable than this.

### The Confessions of a Spanish Refugee (Part 2)

— Written by Marcelino Sunhi of Spain, translated by Wang Fen

I put my shoes back on, then put on my bathrobe, and wrapped myself in a blanket, and went to bed horizontally. My pillow was a cheap cardboard bag. It wasn't soft, but it was comfortable enough.

I didn't know what time it was when the sound of torrential rain woke me up. The blanket and clothes on my body were still wrapped tightly, but soon I felt raindrops flowing down from above, passing through my abdomen and flowing straight down. The water droplets were already warm when they flowed there. I could handle it. Later I made a trough on my back, but unexpectedly there was water flowing between my legs again. There were puddles of water all around me, and the puddles were all warmed by my body. I didn't dare to move my body, for fear of splashing the puddles open, but slowly I felt unbearably cold. I wanted to find a tent where I could hide from the heavy rain. But they were all crowded with people, so I could only slowly turn around and look for the shelter in the sand cave.

Saint. Xuepolin was already overcrowded. As many as 60,000 refugees were stationed there. The death rate was probably fifteen people per day, and we felt lucky, because Daoli had no sanitation facilities or medical equipment. I talked to a French officer about it. But he comforted me:

'You Spaniards are really hardy...! When we imprison the Germans in the camp, sixty of them die every day. I don't understand. Your death rate is only fifteen people per day. It's amazing!'

We were so dissatisfied with him, we were really sorry. Maybe he hoped that the vicious "red elements" would die six hundred a day, so that the problem of France could be solved. Unfortunately, the Germans have very sophisticated camps.

He had no relatives anywhere. No one in the world would write him a short letter of sympathy. Yet morning and night, he would always go to the post office - the camp post office - and ask: Is there any mail for Manuel Espinilla? He knew that the answer would be no. Yet he had to ask! How terrible it is to feel alone in a crowd! But later he broke the rules. He actually wrote a letter to me in England:

"Can you write me a letter? Every day I go to the post office and always get the same answer: no letter from you, Espinilla. I know that I have no relatives in the world, and although you are also a prisoner in a hellish camp, you know how much comfort letters can give to our companions, please write me a letter!"

I did write back to him. And we are still corresponding. I think this is a human obligation.

### Aim

### Anchoring at Night

— Zhenghua

The setting sun sank below the horizon, and the shadows of crows in the distant sky also disappeared into the vast clouds and trees. The twilight gradually thickened and spread out; the uneven shadows of sails became as dim and hazy as gray clouds.

The gentle sound of oars rippled slightly in the clear blue waves. The water splashed by the bamboo pole slightly moistened the corners of my sleeves. The water flowed very slowly and loosely; like a tired snake struggling to wriggle, duckweed rippled out circles of grain, the large circles expanded to the shore and disappeared, and the small circles expanded again.

Our boat was rowed to the riverbank of × village and anchored. Dense green shade covered both sides of the bank. A gentle wind swayed the willow branches and slanted into the cabin, lightly stroking my disheveled hair. The croaking of frogs in the fields was like a gust of wind, creating a messy sound like rain; clear shepherd songs floated in the twilight; the varying degrees of these two sounds seemed very discordant. Deep in the muddy road on the bank were the marks of hooves and straw sandals. The shadows of farmers in bamboo hats were still moving in the distance, and finally disappeared into the green gauze curtain. A wisp of cooking smoke circled over the uneven thatched roofs, slowly merging with the floating clouds.

I had dinner on the boat, rested for a while, then climbed out of the cabin, and treading on the clear moonlight, prepared to make a tour of this quiet village. × Village belongs to the occupied × County. Harbors crisscross around it, but the area is very secluded, and the iron hooves of the enemy have not yet trampled it. — I thought so on the road.

Cows lay obliquely under the pine trees, their noses twitching, sighing. Dogs curled up on the woodpile, and seeing a stranger, they didn't bark loudly, but slowly stood up and smelled the corners of his clothes. Children were rolling and laughing in the square. Farmers were holding dry tobacco bags and sitting leisurely under the bean trellis, chatting about the abundance of the harvest, with relaxed smiles on everyone's faces.

A surprised look swept over my face.

"Eh - sir, it's so late, where are you from?"

"I came by boat from ××"

"Is the county seat lost?"

"This is absolutely true, the county seat has long been lost -"

Many people surrounded me.

"Our county seat is lost, we are waiting for the opponents to come -"

"Our army fought fiercely in Qingjiang. After Qingjiang was lost, the county seat here was no longer important in terms of military situation, so it was evacuated. - I explained excitedly, I looked at them.

"Our home is here, if they want to come, they have to fight!

I briefly explained the situation of the war again, they became calm, the people surrounding me became thicker, but I became more excited. I stared at these simple farmers, the hot blood of defending their hometown was surging in them, they were all deep in thought...

I went back to the boat with a slightly heavy step, sat by the window, staring at the undulating waves. Moonlight, starlight and lamplight were all reflected in the water, swaying, sometimes merging into one piece, sometimes rippling into thousands of points.

"The tide is rising!" The boatman shouted loudly.

I quietly listened to the sound of the tide gently flowing, and let the moonlight gently kiss my forehead. At this time, many images of simple farmers also poured out in my heart. They were all calm, very calm...

### Unrecognized People

While illiteracy is a serious problem, it's not the end of the world; but if you can't recognize people, don't even think about making a life for yourself!

The world is inherently a place where people interact with each other. To make your way in life, you have to mingle among people! But among the teeming masses, there are those who are wise, foolish, virtuous, and unscrupulous. If you're fortunate enough to encounter only the wise and virtuous, you can live a carefree and contented life; but if you unfortunately find yourself among the foolish and unscrupulous, you'll live a wretched life, causing endless harm.

Recognizing characters seems difficult, but it's actually not. Recognizing people seems easy, but it's actually not.

"Judging by appearances" inevitably leads to "missing out on Ziyu." Most fortune-tellers claim to be immortals or semi-immortals, saying they can know everything about a person in detail. This is their professional way of recognizing people; the speaker may be speaking casually, and the listener can take it with a grain of salt. As for someone like Lord Pingyuan, who seemed to be good at assessing talented people, he still missed Mao Sui. So to recognize people, you need "great discernment." As for me, I'm often confused, or even recognize people without truly knowing them, which can lead to endless trouble.

When you meet someone, you must first discern their character: are they a superior person? Or an inferior one? Are they good? Or evil? Are they learned? Or uneducated? Are they easy to deal with? Or difficult? Examine them carefully, recognize them clearly, and then deal with them appropriately. This is the general way to conduct oneself in the world. As for me, if I misjudge someone and offend them, not only might I get a slap in the face, but I might also be lectured, "Friend! Open your eyes and see clearly, who am I?" At that time, I'd be suffering the consequences of my own actions, asking for trouble, not only failing to recognize the person, but also lacking social awareness.

When making friends, you also need to recognize people; it's best to stay far away from cliques of rogues. But sometimes you also need to be careful and thoroughly understand the other person; otherwise, you might make the mistake of "befriending the wrong person" or "marrying the wrong partner." And you might even be "sold out by a friend for personal gain" or have a friend "kidnapped."

However, as the world gets worse, recognizing people becomes even more difficult. Fortune-tellers claim to have an iron tongue, but they actually have a honeyed tongue. As for assessing a person, it's also quite difficult; a slight mistake can lead to "a difference of a thousand miles," even if it's only "an error of a hair's breadth." When it comes to making friends, it's even more difficult. Sometimes you might even know that the other person is not good, but because of vested interests, or being threatened or tempted, you disregard everything and treat them as a close friend, the result of which is naturally unimaginable.

If you don't use accurate judgment, but rely on arrogance, misjudging the other person, thinking they're not worth striking at, and assuming you can make your own plans and secure victory, this kind of failure to recognize people will naturally only lead to sinking deeper and deeper into the mire, until you can't extricate yourself.

If, for the sake of temporary interests, you jointly enter into some agreement with a country that is fundamentally incompatible, treating it as a close friend, thinking you can achieve "cooperation," this kind of failure to recognize "people" will naturally end with being sold out by a friend.

Therefore, recognizing people seems easy, but it's actually not. For individuals, if you don't recognize people, you're bound to suffer for life; for a country, if you don't recognize "people," its own people will inevitably live in poverty, and the day of its collapse will be closer.

### Bai Xue Yang Chun, Guangling Jue Xiang, A Brief Account of the People of the Xian Ni Society

— Mei Xiang Shi Zhu

The stories of Kunqu opera are mostly adapted from various legends, and eight out of ten are from "Zhui Bai Qiu." Most of the southern tunes are also from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, such as the "Yong Tuan Yuan," which some say is based on real events in Tangqi, and the lyrics and dialogue are mostly in the Suzhou dialect. Now, the actors of the Xian Ni Society are all from Suzhou, and their skills are refined, so they should all reach the realm of transformation. Those who understand the art praise them for transforming the customs and correcting the elegance. However, the "family troupe" has been swaying in the wind and rain for more than ten years, and only a few remain, and even the flute players are as rare as morning stars. In addition to drinking and tapping the clapper, I will briefly record the actors' skills, adding flowers to the brocade. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope those who know will correct it.

Zhu Chuanming

Studies the role of Dan. Has a beautiful appearance, clear and gentle voice, and graceful stage presence. Recently, her voice has become even sweeter and mellower. Her interpretation of Gui Zhi in "Selling Horses" is more delicate and considerate. She is capable in many plays, and "Wandering in the Garden, Startled by a Dream," "Breaking the Willow, Yangguan," "Need for Vinegar," and "Zhao Jun Goes Beyond the Border" are her best works.

Zhang Chuanfang

Charming and flirtatious, her interpretations of "Good Date," "Thinking of the Mortal World," "Qin Pick," and "Stealing Poetry" are all witty and flavorful. Her pronunciation is clear and resonant. When she plays Fei Gongren in "Assassinating the Tiger," she is praised by music experts. She is both bold and chivalrous, and chivalrous and sad. She is amiable and has no airs of a star.

Zheng Chuanjian

Studies phonology diligently. Capable of playing Sheng, Wai, and Lai roles. Her portrayal of Li Guinian in "Tan Ci" exudes a sense of desolation and loss in her eyes, which even painters cannot capture.

Zhou Chuanying

Courteous and refined, is a talented Xiaosheng actor. His portrayal of Pan Bizheng in "The Jade Hairpin" surpasses the characters in paintings. It is said that his performance as Li Hongji in "Fighting with Knives" is extremely wonderful, but I have not had the opportunity to see it. I once saw him play Que Zhong in "What Can Be Done," and his demeanor was dignified and handsome.

Zhao Chuanqun

Has a gifted voice. Her performances in "Pipa" and "Jingchai" are like writing the "Huangting Sutra" for the first time, just right. Her interpretation of "Selling Horses" is also a masterpiece. It is better for her to not wear a beard when playing male roles.

Fang Chuanyun

Her martial arts skills have greatly improved recently. Her pronunciation is clear and round. Her portrayal of Zidan in "Sending Her Son" is extremely difficult to sing, but she can achieve perfection. "San Cha Kou," "Qianyuan Mountain," "Lin Chong Flees in the Night," and "Flaming Mountain" are all her specialties. Her appearance is very much like a young girl.

Wang Chuanqian

An outstanding Wusheng actor. His performance of "Ji Qin San Dang" is his signature. Recently, he has not been able to perform it due to the lack of supporting actors. "An Tian Hui," "Ning Wu Guan," and "Song Shi Hui" emphasize both singing and acting. Every time he goes on stage, he is willing to put in effort, and his every move is very standardized.

Shen Chuanyin

The most respected big painted face in the Kunqu troupe. Chuankun is from a theatrical family. His performances of "Fire Judge," "Marrying a Sister," and red-faced plays all have the right measure. At a time when dharma music is declining, there is no one to follow in his footsteps with such talent.

### Zhang Chuanfang's "Assassinating the Tiger"

New Film Introduction

### "The Man in the Iron Mask"

— Qi Hua

"The Man in the Iron Mask" has always been a mystery in history. Although there are many books of research by later generations, there is no definitive "search for hidden meaning." Alexandre Dumas's "The Man in the Iron Mask" is a sequel to "The Three Musketeers." His focus is on praising the Three Musketeers for their loyalty and service to the country, and not on seeking the truth about the Man in the Iron Mask. However, this legendary story reflects the obscenity of the royal palace and the cruelty of Louis. The main cause of the later French Revolution was the resistance aroused by Louis's harsh taxes and tyrannical punishments.

As a historical film, "The Man in the Iron Mask" is directed with considerable skill. He delicately writes about the two aspects of strength and mercy between Louis XIV and Philippe. For example, Louis's heavy use of the treacherous minister Fouquet and his favoritism towards the noblewoman Madame de la Vallière led to widespread resentment. When Louis was about to arrive at the church to pray, he was ambushed. When Philippe wore the royal robes and went to the church in his place, he asked about the suffering of the people and comforted them with great care, and the people shouted long live. This powerful contrast makes people deeply moved by the fact that a tyrannical ruler is bound to be overthrown one day.

Louis Hayward, who plays Louis XIV and Philippe, also gives an excellent performance. Louis's treachery and cruelty, and Philippe's bravery and vitality, are deeply portrayed in both their actions and voices, creating two absolutely different characters.

What is regrettable is that the development of the first half of the play is too calm, although the individual scenes are commendable. The second half, after Philippe is imprisoned wearing an iron mask, and Louis XIV is lured into prison by the Three Musketeers, is the most exciting scene in the whole film, with the prisoners shouting, Louis promising wealth to the jailer, and the jailer whipping him while laughing. In the end, Philippe marries Princess Marie, Fouquet informs, and the Three Musketeers die heroically. D'Artagnan also dies with a smile beside Philippe after the ceremony, which is deeply moving.

The cinematography is very beautiful, such as the shot of Louis XIV looking down at the carriage from the upstairs, the composition is very novel and beautiful; the reflection of the river light when the Three Musketeers travel in the tunnel, and the gloom in the prison are all very beautiful.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The people in the opera troupe are extremely lacking in ethics, (meaning they are lacking in virtue and shameless). Later, that brilliant old man gave these low-level opera busybodies who take kickbacks another nickname, calling them "eating flyers." Since the name has been determined, they can write in the accounts in large letters, "Paid the 'eating flyers' several yuan and several cents." The most unfortunate thing is that these people also carry the sign of a critic and often appear in newspapers. But in reality, except for a very few three or five people, the rest of the Ping opera critics in Beiping are looked down upon by the actors.

These two kinds of people have not yet been discovered in Shanghai. Although there are many people who love drama and criticize drama, the first thing is that they never watch free shows; the second thing is that all the Pingjiao who come to Shanghai must fulfill their "traveling guest visiting resident guest" etiquette. To pay a visit, they have to spend money to treat guests and reserve seats. Not only has no one ever eaten the actors, but they have all taken out money to spend on them. Sometimes the theater helps them publish special collections and special issues, and they have to write articles for them for free. The actors and theater authorities use the Shanghai Ping opera critics to do voluntary publicity and support, but the Ping opera critics never ask them to sing at the dinner table. The Da Jiao who come south from Ping also know that the real Ping opera critics are completely different from the "opera busybodies" and "eating flyers" of Beiping. I think all Ping opera critics should continue to maintain this honor and not allow the northern wind to gradually spread south. This is the glory of the entire Ping opera circle in Shanghai. If there are one or two unscrupulous people who follow famous actors day and night, or have the idea of eating actors, then the two dishonorable titles of "opera busybody" and "eating flyer" will immediately be added to the bodies of Shanghai Ping opera critics by the actors. I hope this does not happen, and I hope it never happens. This is the glory of the entire Ping opera circle in the isolated island. (94)

Interesting Stories from Film City

### Dance Instructor Loudly Appeals to Actresses Not to Neglect Leg Beauty

— Feng Xiang

Le Roy Prinz, the dance instructor expert at Hollywood's Paramount Pictures, also critiques women's beautiful legs. In the past six years, he has inspected more than 5,000 pairs, but he considers few of them satisfactory. Therefore, he has to stand up and loudly appeal, warning women, especially actresses, not to neglect the beauty of their legs any longer.

Prinz says that if women could devote half the time they spend on decorating their faces to paying attention to their legs, the world would definitely produce a few more beauties. According to his statistics, only about 5% of women pay attention to their legs.

Recently, Paramount Pictures plans to shoot a film called "Million Dollar Legs." Prinz selected an actress named Betty Grable, feeling that her leg beauty is the best among Hollywood stars and worthy of playing the protagonist in this film. It is said that Miss Betty has had healthy and beautiful legs like other girls since she was a child, but because she didn't just know how to apply nail polish and draw eyebrows when she grew up, she was also able to pay attention to her legs at the same time, wearing matching high heels, walking in a regular gait, and performing appropriate muscle-developing exercises, so she has been able to maintain the beauty of her powder legs.
