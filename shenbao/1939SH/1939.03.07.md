Editorial

### On Daladier's Diplomacy

The French Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday, where prominent party member and former Minister of the Interior, Tao Ermo (陶爾謨), vehemently criticized the current foreign policy of the Daladier government. Tao loudly proclaimed: "The policy promoted by Foreign Minister Bonnet is a policy of humiliation, weakening France's position on the one hand, but inevitably leading France down the path to war on the other. The resulting outcome will merely provide France with a future war under even more unfavorable conditions." Observing the current international situation and France's position, Tao's words are truly a "penetrating" critique of Daladier's policies and deserve deep contemplation by every French individual.

Could France's position be more dangerous than it is today? Since the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia has become a vassal of Hitler, and Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and others have exhibited centrifugal tendencies. The Little Entente, a network of satellite states that France had cultivated for twenty years, is almost completely shattered, and France is already in a position of isolation. However, the Daladier government still follows Chamberlain, continuing its "non-intervention" policy towards Spain, ultimately leading to Italy and Germany increasing their influence in Spain, placing the Spanish government in dire straits. The flames on the Iberian Peninsula have finally approached the borders of France. At this time, the Daladier government even simply followed Britain in recognizing Franco. Now, if we open a map: Hitler looms large to the east, Mussolini eyes us from the southeast corner, and Franco, a puppet of Italy and Germany, has emerged to the southwest. France is tightly surrounded on three sides.

French politicians often use the phrase "Italian and German fascists are not to be feared" to comfort the people, but Mussolini explicitly acknowledged in Genoa last May that "Italy and France are opposed in Spain." Daladier and others lightly dismissed the gravity of this statement and paid no attention to the fact that German and Italian armaments were continuously supplying Franco, merely stating to the people in a perfunctory manner: "The non-intervention policy can safeguard peace." Now, we are finally about to see the evil consequences they have created.

The Munich Conference did not bring peace, even Chamberlain, the protagonist, has unintentionally admitted this. Otherwise, why would he still repeatedly say in the House of Commons, "If war breaks out, Britain will stand by France's side?" France's appeasement diplomacy towards the fascists is clearly built on cloudy hopes. Daladier and his ilk are calculating that if France sacrifices the interests of Central and Southeastern Europe, it may be easier to protect the interests of its colonial empire.

In truth, France's European interests and its imperial interests are inseparable, because fascist aggression is indivisible. Fascist aggression in Central Europe is merely the initial stage of realizing larger-scale aggression and division.

France is not only facing the threat of a fascist front on its northern Rhine border, but it is also facing fascist threats in Africa, and even in Annam. The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is only a hundred and several dozen miles from Haiphong. In Africa, Italy has concentrated 100,000 troops in Libya, and large quantities of gasoline and food are being stored. 450 aircraft and 4,000 pilots have been dispatched there. Blackshirts and aircraft are concentrating in an area 125 miles from the borders of French Somaliland. According to yesterday's Reuter's telegram, the Italian Mediterranean Fleet's air squadron and the aircraft carrier Miraglia have arrived in Tripoli. All of this is probably a response to France's recognition of Franco. Judging from the above facts, the bankruptcy of Daladier's policy is very clear. All hopes of splitting the Berlin-Rome axis have vanished like smoke. The German semi-official magazine "Voelkischer Beobachter" stated: "Germany and Italy must work together to deal with both east and west."

From Munich to the recognition of Franco, Daladier has pursued a policy of step-by-step concessions to the aggressors, and France's position has become increasingly precarious. Why does Daladier consistently follow Chamberlain, adopting such a policy of appeasement that endangers its own interests? Regarding this, the famous French journalist Madame Tabouis recently gave a very insightful answer: "There is nothing else to it. The reason why Daladier maintains the policy of concession is purely because class interests are at play. There are three most prominent classes in France: the aristocracy, the financial community, and the laboring masses. The first two classes are currently in power, believing that war is not conducive to their class interests, and are therefore willing to sacrifice national interests for the sake of class interests."

However, France is now in an extremely precarious position, and the fists of the fascists will inevitably damage the interests of the French financial stratum. Tao Ermo said: "The war crisis is now greater than ever before. After the Italian government repeatedly concentrated troops in northern Libya, even the Swiss Confederation has taken all necessary measures to deal with the Italian threat if necessary. France, of course, cannot afford to delay any longer." Yes, to safeguard France's security, Daladier must quickly wake up in time and adopt a firm and strong countermeasure against the aggressors. At the same time, we hope that the French Socialist Party, which is currently gathering to discuss national affairs, can recognize the current crisis and urge the government to change its policy of appeasement in order to protect the motherland!

### British Government Decides to Provide Further Financial Assistance to China; Amount Estimated Between Three and Five Million Pounds; and to Join the United States in Economic Resistance Against Japan

(London) The Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent stated that the Spanish war situation will soon end, and the British government has shifted its focus in the past week to bringing the Sino-Japanese War to an early conclusion. This can be seen from the news that Britain will provide loans to assist China's currency. It is heard that this loan will be between three million and five million pounds, and it is expected that this money will be enough to consolidate China's currency system and resist Japanese destructive methods. In the current environment, due to careful economical use of currency reserves, China's difficulty in obtaining military supplies has greatly increased. Before the new loan is established, Britain will almost certainly pass a special bill, but the government's necessary actions can be implemented. This measure will be seen after the final passage of the Export Credit Act last week, from which China will also benefit, and can purchase a large number of heavy trucks and other supplies from Britain. In the past few weeks, the British and American governments have also considered direct methods of exerting pressure on Japan in strict economic terms, which would greatly hinder Japan from obtaining the supplies necessary for large-scale war. This is certainly within the power of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. The previously planned amount of twenty million pounds by Britain has now been used for other purposes. In short, Britain now intends to unite with other friendly countries to compel the aggressor countries to maintain peace and use its great financial power to achieve this goal. Restricting the Japanese goods market is also not difficult, but this matter requires the consent of all parts of the British Empire, which will take a longer time to implement. London experts have recently reviewed all aspects of this issue to provide the government with the necessary information to serve as a basis for government decisions. Regarding the loan to China, the cabinet considered it last July, but it was not passed at the time, because this measure did not have sufficient justification and there were fears that Japan would consider it an unfriendly act as the European crisis progressed. The correspondent also stated that the loan to China previously proposed last year was in the amount of twenty million pounds. Now, after the United States lent China US$25 million in debt in December last year, the British government is preparing to adopt an active plan in the Far East, which shows that the British government has a greater spirit of trust to cope with the war issues that are still disrupting the world. (6th Reuters Telegram)

(London) The Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the British government is indeed drafting detailed rules to provide financial assistance to China. However, all parties acknowledge that various necessary arrangements and negotiations will take some time. Officials in this environment are unwilling to disclose progress information. All actions by the British government will be consistent with the already announced intention to maintain interests in China. As for the rumors about how much will be loaned to assist China's currency system, they are purely speculative. However, it is believed that negotiations are now nearing completion and an announcement can be made within a few days. (6th Reuters Telegram)

(London) The relevant authorities recently declared that the British government has decided to grant a commercial loan of three million pounds to China, in order to build another railway line from Kunming to Myanmar, in addition to the recently completed Yunnan-Burma Highway. The necessary rails to be purchased should be fully allocated within this loan. The purchase price of some locomotives and vehicles should also be taken from this. The remainder, it is heard, will be sold by the United States. People in China say that the Yunnan-Burma Railway is over 500 kilometers long and cannot be fully funded with three million pounds, and continued negotiations on credit loans are needed to be of any use. At a time when Japan's attempts to blockade maritime communications are becoming increasingly active, this route is of course even more important. Financial circles in London also say that the British government, because the US government will lend China US$25 million, is now taking a further step to assist China on a larger scale than before. From now on, although China will have to spend huge amounts of military expenditure, it will naturally be easier to stabilize its currency. (6th Havas Telegram)

The living standard index for the working class in Japan's 24 major cities in February was 115.5 (with July 1937 as 100), an increase of 0.8% compared to January and 9% higher than in February of last year. The living standard index for the salaried class in Japan's 11 major cities in February was 114.6, an increase of 1% compared to January and 8.6% higher than in February of last year. (5th)

(Tokyo) After meeting here, representatives of major banks decided to restrict loans for speculation in general goods, including raw silk and silk fabrics. This move is aimed at curbing the recent rampant rise in prices of general goods and curbing the trend of currency inflation caused by the increasing speculation. The Banking Bureau of the Ministry of Finance also issued an order to the authorities of all prefectures, ordering them to strictly monitor local financial institutions to prevent loans from being used for speculation. The items that are about to become targets of speculation are raw silk, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, woolen fabrics, socks, woolen yarn, lumber, flour, scrap iron, coal, canned food, grains, eggs, and salted fish.

### Prime Minister Flees, Coup Occurs in Spain: Leftists Form National Defense Council; Striving for a Glorious Peace with All Efforts

Madrid: After Colonel Casado overthrew the Negrín government, the situation in Madrid was still calm. The National Defense Council has been organized and completed without encountering resistance. Casado also made peace overtures, speaking to Spaniards in the areas occupied by the Nationalists, saying that all that compatriots in the territory of the Republican government seek is peace, independence, and freedom. We do not fight for what we do not need. We want the country to be free from all foreign forces. (6th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid: The newly formed National Defense Council has been endorsed by General Miaja, former commander-in-chief of the Spanish Republican Army, Navy, and Air Force. Prime Minister Negrín and several other cabinet members, after fleeing Madrid, arrived in the Levant region this morning. (6th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid: The city's radio station has just broadcast news that the Negrín cabinet has resigned to interim President Barrio. The situation in the capital is extremely peaceful. (6th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: After the organization and establishment of the National Defense Council, commentators have recently explained that the National Defense Council is supported by anarchist factions and various left-wing groups other than the Communist Party. These groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the Negrín cabinet for more than a day. After the catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Catalonia, their opposition sentiment also increased. Former Prime Minister Negrín, after returning from Catalonia to this place, actually issued a large number of orders, giving important military positions to communists, seemingly claiming to be a dictator. Thus, the feeling of injustice became even more unbearable, leading to this coup and the announcement of the establishment of the National Defense Council. It immediately elected the militia representative, General Casado, commander-in-chief of the Central Army, as interim chairman. This man has a high reputation in military circles and among labor unions and will be able to unify military and political affairs. The mission of the National Defense Council is to maintain order and curb future offensives by the Nationalist forces within the entire territory of the Republican government until it obtains a "glorious peace." (6th Havas dispatch)

(London) After Colonel Mera, a key figure in the National Confederation of Labor of the Spanish anarchist faction, delivered a radio speech, British diplomatic figures recently commented that a detailed analysis of the main points of the speech is actually a call that combines the meanings of peace and compromise. If the situation in the two countries is expected, they should take this opportunity to conduct negotiations in order to end their civil war. At this time, if General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, can base his actions on Colonel Mera's suggestion and issue a general amnesty, his prestige will not be diminished, and the civil war can be ended. This is a wise move. However, Britain's previous attempts at mediation have already failed, and it currently intends not to interfere in the matter for the time being, and will try to do so again when necessary. After the establishment of the National Defense Council in Madrid, although the British authorities have not contacted it, they have allowed the consul stationed in the port of Valencia, Madrid, to act as he sees fit and to engage in mediation as soon as peace negotiations can be conducted. (6th Havas dispatch)

(Paris) According to a French report today, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, intends to give the government forces a final opportunity to surrender before launching a fierce attack on Madrid. The troops surrounding Madrid have reached 300,000, and they can attack as soon as they receive orders. However, it is said that Franco still very much hopes to avoid continued bloodshed within the scope of what is possible. (5th Associated Press dispatch)

### National Defense Council Announces Policy of Resistance: Hopes to Ensure Spanish Independence; Condemns Former Prime Minister for Ruining the Country and Harming the People

Madrid: The Republican government has already formed a National Defense Council, composed of General Casado, the militia representative, Pasterlo, a key figure of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party, San Andres, a key figure of the Republican Party, and two other members. General Casado then delivered a radio speech, stating that the government has decided to continue the war of resistance until it obtains a glorious peace. "The Spanish nation is now fighting for independence, and would rather die than surrender. Long live Spain, long live the Republican government. (5th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: After Pasterlo, a key figure of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party here, General Casado, commander of the Central Army, and others formed the National Defense Council and exercised the powers of the Negrín cabinet of the Republican government, Pasterlo issued a radio speech in the name of the Council yesterday at midnight, stating that in the Battle of Salon, the entire state of Catalonia fell, and the authorities of the Republican government fled to France, hesitating for many days. When they decided to return to their motherland, they had already lost their credibility in law and morality and were not qualified to meet the current difficulties. All of this is evident. Moreover, the various authorities abandoned their posts and fled first, and President Acha also resigned later. Furthermore, the Negrín cabinet was not only not endorsed by President Acha, but was also condemned by the people of the whole country. Therefore, the Republican government had no authority to speak of. It actually continued to obey foreign orders with little knowledge of shame, disregarding the honor of the Spanish Republic. At this critical juncture, we were forced to come forward and establish a legitimate regime, and we have also established a military and political power, calling on the people of the whole country to support it. Another member of the National Defense Council, General Casado, then delivered a speech, saying, "Spanish compatriots, I am now speaking to you with a sad mood. We have all suffered a lot. As for myself, I have never intended to command the people, but only to serve the people. I now frankly declare that I am willing to do my best for the independence and freedom of the nation. I know that the current problem is that we are not fighting for foreign countries. We want to free our motherland from the shackles of imperialists. Our policy is to defend the territorial integrity of Spain until we have peace and freedom. In short, we now have two ways, which we must choose. One is to regain freedom and make the country strong, and the other is to kill each other for foreign countries, only to make the country bankrupt. That's all. In short, we must rekindle the spirit of patriotism. What our country is concerned about is the welfare of Spain, and nothing else. If we do not obtain a glorious peace, we will die on the battlefield." According to reports, the National Defense Council is composed of six members, including General Casado, commander of the Central Army, Pasterlo, former Speaker of the House of Representatives of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party, Carillo of the Socialist General Labor Union, San Andres of the Republican Left, and Jold and Maran of the Anarchist National Confederation of Labor, all of whom are key figures of their respective parties. (6th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: Colonel Mera, a key figure in the National Confederation of Labor of the anarchist faction, recently delivered a radio speech, stating that "a part of the territory of the motherland has now been lost. The cause of this is that the rebellious behavior is the root cause. Former Prime Minister Negrín only knew how to plunder wealth and escape in times of difficulty, causing the people to be poisoned by the enemy and shaming the soldiers on the front line and the workers in the rear. This is the worst of sins." Fortunately, from this day on, Spain has a government and a definite mission, that is, to seek a glorious peace based on justice and friendship. If our call is unfortunately not understood and adopted, we will fight to the end to maintain the independence of our country." (6th Havas dispatch)

### Garrison Mutinies in Cartagena Harbor: Many Warships Also Depart

Madrid: The Prime Minister's Office recently issued a bulletin tonight, explaining the course of the mutiny of a part of the garrison in Cartagena Harbor, stating that "a small number of garrisons in the port, incited by the rebel army, suddenly mutinied this morning. After the military authorities inquired, they immediately rushed to dispatch land and sea troops to suppress it. By 6:00 PM, the rebellion was quelled, and many rebel soldiers were arrested and sent to a military court for severe punishment." (5th Havas dispatch)

Purgo: The Nationalist radio station in this city recently broadcast a message today, stating that the government army units in Cartagena Harbor have rebelled, and the government warships moored in the harbor have set sail and departed, their whereabouts unknown. The port currently has an arsenal and a naval shipyard, and its location is very important. (5th Havas)

(Paris) Well-informed sources here recently stated that after a part of the garrison in Cartagena Harbor, Spain, rebelled yesterday, three or four large warships and several small warships belonging to the Madrid city government have left the port and are sailing eastward along the coast of North African Algeria. (6th Havas dispatch)

Oran: Thirty-six officers of the Spanish Republican Army, at 5:00 PM yesterday, flew in four planes from Cartagena Harbor in the country to the town of Lashania near here. One of them, discovering that this town was French territory, immediately flew away. The other three planes and the people on board were detained by the military authorities here, and the machine guns on the planes were dismantled. It is said that they escaped by plane when a rebellion broke out in Cartagena Harbor yesterday, not knowing that they mistakenly thought this place was Spanish Morocco and landed here. In addition, it is heard that another government plane, after flying out of Cartagena Harbor, mistakenly landed at the Saida airfield near the port of Casablanca in French Morocco at 6:00 PM yesterday. (6th Havas)

Molotov is preparing to submit an outline of a report to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which will include a more extensive plan for railway construction, including the addition of 7,370 new locomotives, 190,000 vehicles, the modification of automatic hooks and brakes on 500,000 military vehicles, the electrification of 1,840 kilometers of existing railways, the construction of 11,000 kilometers of new railways, the addition of 8,000 kilometers of double tracks, and the construction of many new stations. By 1942, the volume of railway transportation should increase to 510 billion ton-kilometers, compared to 355 billion ton-kilometers in 1937. (5th TASS dispatch)

### Germany Urgently Demands Redistribution of World Resources to Overcome Financial and Economic Difficulties - Speech by Minister of Propaganda Goebbels -

Leipzig. The city market in this city has opened today. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, discussing Germany's economic and financial situation. While acknowledging that Germany's economy and finances still had many shortcomings, he strongly asserted that this was not Germany's fault. His conclusion was that Germany would not welcome any international measures intended to oppose normal trade. "Germany has a population of 80 million. If its economic foundation is too narrow, leading to an inability to live and work, self-determination cannot be considered satisfactory. This point should be recognized by all countries in the world." The full text of Goebbels' speech is translated below:

Goebbels first stated that before the National Socialist Party came to power in 1933, Germany's economic situation was deteriorating daily. The reason for this was the erroneous principles adopted by the authorities at the time. They believed that a country could easily rectify its economic situation even without the necessary power, which was a major mistake. "It must be understood that the economic foundation that Germany maintains cannot provide the necessary food to supply the entire nation. This shortage is not due to our lack of intelligence or effort. It is because Germany has not obtained its fair share of resources in the global distribution of wealth." In short, Germany is a country with insufficient resources and has no choice but to take various measures to "remedy" this. However, these measures are often not understood by the general public and often cause resentment. At the same time, democratic countries, especially England, ridicule these measures from the sidelines. They should know that these democratic countries all possess large amounts of wealth, raw materials, and colonies, while Germany does not. However, these countries are certainly not superior to Germany in terms of intelligence or in the methods of developing these resources. "As for Germany, it is not without its faults. For example, the current situation is due to the mistakes of past authorities, starting with launching wars, followed by signing the Treaty of Versailles, and then successively accepting the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. These repeated mistakes have plunged the nation into a deep abyss. It was not until the National Socialist Party came to power that it carried out its mission with the most glorious political enthusiasm, the greatest effort, and the strongest awareness. Therefore, the National Socialist government not only cannot be held responsible for the current situation but can also be proud of the economic achievements of the past six years. However, we cannot help but say that the unequal distribution of wealth among the nations of the world today is undeniable, and Germany still has no colonies to obtain raw materials, and Germany's existing space is insufficient to guarantee the nation's survival. At the same time, foreign countries are constantly trying to cut off Germany's markets. It must be understood that Germany demands survival and even has a right to survival."

Although Germany faces economic difficulties as described above, thanks to the efforts of the entire country, its manufactured industrial products have exceeded its domestic needs. It will inevitably use the surplus industrial products to exchange for all or part of the raw materials and finished products that we lack. However, there is a major principle that must be adhered to, that is, due to financial constraints, the amount of goods we purchase from foreign countries must not be higher than the amount of our goods exported. Under this principle, Germany is prepared to abandon all political prejudices to solve this problem. Some say that Germany is promoting economic autarky, but this is just a rumor. In essence, Germany only adopts economic self-sufficiency measures as a last resort within the scope of meeting national needs. Even the government's implementation of the Four-Year Economic Plan is only aimed at making the German economy free from the constraints of foreign raw materials. Germany has invented various raw material "substitutes" for this reason.

Goebbels then mentioned the issue of labor, stating that the most urgent problem at present is the shortage of labor. The current economic system must be intensified to make it more rational. What is gratifying is that the German nation has unparalleled perseverance. The major economic difficulties currently encountered are purely due to geographical and spatial shortcomings. The plan personally formulated by Führer Hitler is a good guarantee for overcoming these difficulties. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### US Defense of Guam to Be Temporarily Shelved

(Washington) A bill proposed by Congressman Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, to add naval aviation bases in the Alaskan Peninsula, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Pacific at a cost of $52,000,000, included a clause for the construction of an airfield in Guam. Although the House of Representatives decided to abolish this clause on the 23rd of last month, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, after reviewing the results, still included this clause in the original bill and submitted it to the Senate for discussion today. Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, immediately expressed his opposition, stating that the plan to build an airfield in Guam might be seen as a threat to Japan and should not be implemented at present. Political observers have commented that since this plan has aroused controversy, the government originally intended to abandon it in order to quell the situation. Now that Walsh has issued the above statement, it has been decided to abolish it. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### Romanian-Polish Talks Reach Consensus - Polish Foreign Minister to Visit England

Warsaw. After talks between Romanian Foreign Minister Chafenco and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, an official announcement was issued here stating, "The two sides have reached complete consensus. In the future, for various political and economic issues that have a common relationship between the two countries, they should act in unison." (Havas News Agency, 6th)

Warsaw. Before returning to his country, Romanian Foreign Minister Chafenco gave a speech here, stating that his talks with Foreign Minister Beck were candid and harmonious, and have achieved satisfactory results. "Our government's peaceful policies are fully understood by the Polish authorities, and are completely in line with the spirit of understanding expressed by the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente. A spirit of candor and friendship is growing and developing in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Its intention is by no means to hinder any other country from increasing its friendship with its neighbors, which is clearly evident." Foreign Minister Beck and I discussed the general situation of international affairs, especially issues related to both parties, such as the Ukrainian issue, which must be handled by considering the future trends of the situation. As for the relationship between Romania and Hungary, efforts are currently being made to establish understanding between the two sides. However, our country will treat all ethnic minorities within its borders with justice and fairness, so that they can live and work in peace and have close relationships with the countries in which they reside. Regarding the Jewish issue, Foreign Minister Beck and I both believe that this matter should be handled within the international scope. Regarding the issue of colonies, Romania has never made any demands. In addition, the governments of Poland and Romania have decided to develop transportation between the two countries. The main route is to build bridges over the Danube River to extend the railway from Warsaw to the capital of Romania to the capital of Bulgaria, Thessaloniki in Greece, and to open canals between the Dniester River and the Prut River, thereby connecting the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Cooperation with Japan - Does Not Harm Authority - British Newspaper Discusses Several Points in the Agreement - Will Inevitably Cause Much Anxiety - British Undersecretary Declares in House of Commons

(London) Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities have agreed on a workable method of cooperation. Foreign Secretary Halifax believes that this method does not harm the authority of the Municipal Council. A member of parliament asked whether the British government would continue to fully support future negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. Butler replied that it would. (Reuters, 6th)

(London) The Manchester Guardian reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council was correct in rejecting the more severe demands made by the Japanese side. Its stated reason for accepting the request for more Japanese police is that if terrorist acts can be eliminated, it will benefit both parties. Several points in the agreement will inevitably cause much anxiety. The most serious of these is the requirement that Chinese criminals and suspects be interrogated by Japanese police and gendarmes according to regulations. Anyone who knows the methods of torture used by the Japanese in their own country knows that this requirement has a sinister meaning. In practice, it will subject the Chinese living in the Public Concession to the same terror as those outside the Concession. Has a democratic country once again made a concession to the force of arms at the expense of the weak? (Reuters, 6th)

(Chongqing) Although the Japanese side calls the recent anti-traitor campaign in Shanghai "terrorism," neutral parties here believe that it is the most appropriate action and praise these assassins as model patriots. (Associated Press, 6th)

### Severe Food Shortage in Peiping

(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, the "Provisional Government" may purchase grain from Jin Province in the near future to alleviate the food shortage in Peiping. The reason for this decision by the "Provisional Government" is that it cannot purchase sorghum and grains from "Manchukuo" as expected. The "Manchukuo" government restricted the cultivation of sorghum and grain crops last year for military reasons. The "Provisional Government" recently ordered a large batch of rice from Rangoon and Saigon, which will soon arrive in Tianjin. The imported rice will pass through Tianjin Customs duty-free and then be transported to Peiping as quickly as possible. (Reuters, 6th)

(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, China Airlines will launch round-trip air service between Peiping and Dalian starting from March 1st. The departure time will be advanced to allow passengers to make the round trip on the same day. Passengers will also be able to travel to Tokyo or Changchun and Shenyang in one day, as the timetables in these places have also been revised to allow for connections. (Reuters, 6th)

### French Socialist Party Criticizes Foreign Policy - Former Interior Minister Delivers Speech - Says It Will Breed Trouble

(Paris) The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting last night. Party leader Blum was unable to attend in person due to a severe cold. Most of the committee members who spoke advocated convening an international peace conference to promote world peace. Taulmer, a key member of the party and former Minister of the Interior, strongly criticized Foreign Minister Bonnet's foreign policy, stating that domestic and foreign affairs are interconnected. "Foreign Minister Bonnet's foreign policy is no different from Prime Minister Daladier and Finance Minister Reynaud's domestic policies. Domestically, only Fascism is respected, and externally, it will inevitably lead to Fascism." The crisis of war is greater today than ever before. The Italian government has repeatedly concentrated troops in Libya, North Africa. Neutral countries such as the Swiss Confederation have also taken the necessary measures to deal with the threat from Italy when necessary. How can France continue to procrastinate? But in reality, "the government has already humiliated itself on the side of General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army of Spain, and now it must allow Germany and Italy to engage in blackmail, or say that it can at least maintain neutrality in the event of war in the future. This is childish talk. In short, the policy pursued by Foreign Minister Bonnet is a policy of humiliation, which on the one hand weakens France's position, and on the other hand can still lead France to war, with the result that France will only face the future war under more unfavorable conditions." Recently, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania have shown signs of striving to invigorate and resolve to resist. England and the Soviet Union are also preparing to approach each other. "From this, it can be seen that everything can still be saved. I don't know why the government authorities are pursuing a policy of appeasement... International problems must be resolved within the international scope and can never be resolved by two-party or three-party meetings. The situation is so serious that we must be careful and not disappoint the countries of Central and Eastern Europe." As for domestic affairs, it has become a question whether French socialists can freely govern the country without obtaining the consent of German Führer Hitler. Hitler once said that if a communist government were established in Paris, Germany would not tolerate it. Although I personally also oppose the Communist Party coming to power, "this has nothing to do with Hitler and does not require him to overstep his bounds." Socialist Congressman Grumbarsh then spoke, also advocating convening an international conference and demanding that guarantees be obtained in advance, with the participating countries mutually agreeing not to use force to resolve disputes. Former Minister of Economy Spinasse said that after German Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on January 30th of this year, the proposal to convene an international conference was more powerful. Germany and Italy both lack raw materials, and by convening a conference, they can be induced to return to the world economic system. Now is the time. If all the countries concerned can work together to organize peace and reduce armaments, the current state of the mandated territories may not be without the possibility of being revised. I now propose that the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party pass a motion unconditionally demanding the convening of an international conference. At this point, former Finance Minister Voriol held a dissenting opinion, saying that it is difficult to say whether this meeting can achieve anything. British Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that it is not yet time to convene an international conference. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

(Paris) The Socialist Party has split into two factions regarding foreign policy, one advocating toughness and the other advocating compromise. There was a dispute when the party held its annual congress in December of last year. As a result, the hard-line faction prevailed. Now, the National Executive Committee of the party held another meeting here the night before, and the two factions each presented their views and then submitted motions to the National Executive Committee separately. The hard-line faction is represented by former Finance Minister Voriol and former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Quentin, and the motion they proposed advocates adopting a policy of resistance towards all omnipotent countries. The compromise faction is represented by the party's Secretary-General Fuer and former Minister of National Economy Spinasse, and their motion advocates maintaining direct contact with all omnipotent countries. The hard-line faction has always had the support of party leader Blum. This time, Blum was unable to attend in person due to illness, and the faction's position was inevitably affected. However, it is difficult to predict the results of the voting. The main points of the motion proposed by Voriol and Quentin are outlined below. The motion first states that France has been threatened since Italy interfered in the Spanish Civil War, and accuses Foreign Minister Bonnet of pursuing a policy that has left behind hidden dangers. After the Japanese Empire adopted violent actions, the position of England and France in the Far East has also been threatened. "French socialists firmly believe that France should not continue to be passive and wait for the arrival of new crises. It must immediately launch an active and courageous policy in diplomacy so that Germany and Italy can understand that France will never tolerate those countries occupying Spain." In addition, France must adhere to all existing international commitments, especially the various commitments stipulated by the Anglo-French Entente and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. U.S. President Roosevelt's repeated declarations of sympathy for all democratic countries should be the compass for French diplomacy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### Turnaround in Palestine Problem

(London) Regarding the Palestine problem, representatives of the British government and the Arab delegation held a meeting this morning, and the Jewish delegation also held a meeting at the same time. Some people here believe that a compromise solution may be reached between the Arab and Jewish peoples, so the Palestine problem conference may have some success and not be a complete failure. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

Cairo. Osman, Undersecretary of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance, took a special plane to the capital of Syria at the end of last week to meet with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to discuss British proposals and is expected to return here today. Before leaving, he told a special correspondent from a Beirut newspaper here that the Archbishop said that in order to obtain the independence of Palestine, he would abandon all personal grudges. Political figures here are optimistic about this statement and widely believe that the Archbishop has submitted a counter-proposal to Osman, which the Egyptian government will forward to the United Kingdom, including a request to declare an independent Arab country and allow limited Jewish immigration and allow Jews to purchase a quarter of the land in Palestine.

### Grain Supply Insufficient in Guangdong Province: Ministry of Finance Approves Import of Foreign Rice; Rice Prices Soar in Guangzhou; Scarcity Also Felt in Xijiang and Beijiang

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the fall of Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, apart from the counties in the war zone ravaged by the Japanese army, many counties near the war zone have been affected by war. Farmers have migrated and been displaced, and most of the good rice fields have been abandoned. Therefore, since the autumn harvest last year, the amount of rice and grain in the inland areas has been decreasing day by day. Those with foresight have predicted that a rice shortage is inevitable during the lean months of spring. The surviving refugees, not dying in battle, will become starved corpses. This is indeed a serious problem. In peacetime, the rice and grain in Guangdong Province were already insufficient for self-sufficiency, and they relied on supplies of rice from Siam and Annam. Since the Guangzhou port was blockaded by the Japanese army, the waterway between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been obstructed for four months. When the Japanese army entered Guangzhou in October last year, it was precisely the time when the late rice crops in Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and other counties were abundant. Initially, because the Japanese army had not yet invaded the villages, the villagers in each county took the opportunity to harvest the ripened red rice. However, in some counties, the late rice had not yet reached the stage of full maturity, and farmers were still adopting a wait-and-see attitude. When Japanese cavalry arrived in the suburbs of Guangzhou (such as Shipai Township, Kangdong Township, etc.), and mules and horses lacked feed, the Japanese army grooms arbitrarily cut down the rice crops in the villages to feed the mules and horses. The farmers' half-year of hard work was watched helplessly as others used it to feed livestock, and they were filled with resentment. Once the news spread that the Japanese army was cutting rice to feed horses, farmers in other counties quickly harvested the unripe rice crops, even though three or four tenths of the rice ears had not yet formed grains. However, they did not care, as it was better to have a poor harvest than to have the Japanese army steal the crops.

Winter Harvest Suffers: Last winter, farmers suffered unexpected poor harvests of rice crops, whether landlords or tenants suffered great losses, which indirectly affected the food supply of the entire province. In areas that usually produce rice (such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Conghua, etc.), at the end of last year, because the old rice had not yet been exhausted, each yuan (Guangdong currency) could buy about six to seven catties of rice. When the Japanese army expanded the scope of its invasion, east to Zengcheng and Conghua, west to Sanshui, and north to Panyu and Huaxian, they took whatever they wanted. Pingzhou Township, which belongs to Nanhai, was originally a place where rice production was most abundant. When the Japanese army first arrived, they first looted white rice from the township, taking hundreds of bags at a time. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, white rice in the area could be bought for eight to nine catties per yuan. After the Japanese army looted it, the price of rice immediately rose, and the poor people gnashed their teeth.

Stored Rice Seized: Since the fall of the Guangzhou city area, all the rice shops in the city have been looted. The Japanese army used spies to find out that there were white rice warehouses in the two places of Xicun and Huadi in the suburbs, and then used military vehicles to transport the stored rice away. The China Rice Industry Company had hundreds of thousands of dan of stored rice, and the Chinese army did not have time to move it, so it was also completely plundered by the Japanese army as military rations. At the same time, because there was a shortage of food in the market, the Japanese army used a soft policy to resell the stored rice stolen from the local area to the citizens, stipulating that only Japanese military tickets could be used for transactions. They not only gave away other people's property generously, but also forced the citizens to exchange and use military tickets. Their plan was truly cunning. However, because of their harshness, most citizens did not trade with them. Therefore, small vendors in the city did not hesitate to travel long distances to transport local rice from Pingzhou and other places back to the city for retail, but the cost was too high, and only four to five catties could be sold for each yuan. With rice as expensive as pearls, the lives of the people left in the city became even more difficult.

Import of Foreign Rice: The war in Guangdong Province has been prolonged, and it has been four months since then. Each county lacks reserves, and the signs of famine are now visible this spring. The price of white rice is also twice as expensive as at the end of last year. The poor people in the war zone all have a hungry look on their faces. Even in counties that are not in the war zone, there is a severe rice shortage due to the lean months of spring. The Guangdong military and political authorities believe that the matter is serious and are eager to find ways to deal with it as soon as possible. They have specially submitted a report to the Central Ministry of Finance, requesting that one million dan of foreign rice be temporarily allowed to be imported tax-free from March 1. This measure has already been approved. Recently, the authorities, considering that various places in the northwest and the two rivers are also feeling a shortage of rice and grain, have specially submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, asking that foreign rice transported to Guangdong be temporarily allowed to be imported tax-free without restriction. Otherwise, at the very least, allow five million dan of tax-free foreign rice to be imported to relieve the current famine in various places and help the people's livelihood.

### Jinhua, the Anti-Japanese War Center in Eastern Zhejiang, is Making Great Strides (4): Flourishing Education and Culture; Building Warehouses to Store Food; Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang

The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang highway trunk line is 62.30 kilometers long, with the Yongkang-Jinhua section accounting for two-thirds. The reporter took a bus from Yongkang Bus Station, with only nine passengers. It is said that although there are few travelers coming and going these days, the buses can still run on time, which is indeed the spirit of the transportation industry. In recent years, with the active construction of highway trunk lines, branch lines, and county roads in eastern Zhejiang by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the planned routes have been completed, and they are quickly connected to important strongholds of various highways in Jiangxi. At that time, most of the construction was requisitioned from the people. Those who had the strength responded themselves, and those who did not have the strength hired workers to replace them. Today, the highways of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces make a great contribution to the military. Because the highway is flat, even though the car is traveling at a very high speed, the seat does not feel bumpy. On both sides of the highway are towering mountain peaks, and the car seems to be traveling between giant rocks. There are many villages along the way, and the car stops for a few minutes at each small station. When the car is about to arrive at Jinhua Station, there are many mud houses under construction on the side of the road. According to people in the same car, due to the recent increase in population, these simple mud and grass houses are being built everywhere to solve the problem of housing.

Transportation Hub

Today, Jinhua is not only the center of military activities in eastern Zhejiang, but also the transportation hub of the interior. In addition to the Hangzhou-Yushan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is centered on Jinhua, there are also the Jinhua-Wuyi Highway and the Jinhua-Lanxi Highway, which both start from Jinhua. The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway starts from the Shangqiao Bridge across the river in the south of the city, passes through Zhuzhen under the ridge into Wuyi territory, and reaches Yongkang. This road is the only important road connecting Wenzhou on the coast of Zhejiang, and its situation is important. Now, those going to the interior all pass through this road. The Jinhua-Lanxi Highway reaches Lanxi County to the west. It starts from the Jingu Pavilion area of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway and branches into Lanxi territory. This highway is parallel to the Lanxi branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, so there are no scheduled buses running now. But once necessary, its importance is no less than that of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Road. The Beishan Highway was built by the county government to facilitate tourists traveling to Beishan in Jinhua. Now, after active preparations, the joint transportation between Zhejiang and Guilin on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened, and Jinhua Station is the starting point. Therefore, today Jinhua is in a more important position in the interior transportation.

Abundant Products

The products of Jinhua County are mainly agricultural products, and the specialty products are also agricultural by-products. The total annual output of the county is 1,630,000 dan. In terms of ordinary agricultural products, the annual output is 80,000 dan of wheat, 70,000 dan of barley, 360,000 dan of miscellaneous grains, and other products such as soybeans and glutinous rice. The total annual output of ordinary agricultural specialty products is more than 1.8 million units. Therefore, although Jinhua is a large city with a concentrated population, it is self-sufficient in terms of people's food. In the urban area of Jinhua, there is a state of prosperity everywhere. The streets, hotels, and restaurants are all crowded with people. Jinhua is the most developed area in eastern Zhejiang for cultural undertakings. In terms of primary education, there are more than 180 private primary schools and 24 county-run primary schools. In terms of secondary education, there are Jinhua Middle School, a provincial school, with more than 900 male and female students and more than 70 teachers. There is the Jinhua Experimental Agricultural School, a provincial school, with more than 100 students. Jinhua County Junior High School has 384 students. There are also private junior high schools such as Zuoxin Junior High School with more than 220 students and Chengmei Girls' Junior High School with 60 students. In Jinhua, which has a large number of intellectuals, it is conceivable that their anti-Japanese sentiments are fierce and their efforts in the work of saving the nation are great. In Jinhua, not only local students have organized national salvation groups, but also many national salvation groups, singing teams, and national salvation drama troupes from Shanghai and Hangzhou have also formed a united front, awakening the entire Jinhua and the people of neighboring counties.

Popular Sentiments Are Warm

There are several wounded soldier hospitals in the urban area of Jinhua, with good facilities. Many of the nursing work is undertaken by local young women. In the anti-Japanese theater in the urban area of Jinhua, there are often performances and speeches promoting national salvation. In addition to dramas, the most popular are songs. The people of Jinhua are proud to be able to sing a few national salvation songs, such as "Strong Men Go Forward" and "Protect Our Homeland". Not only does each school in Jinhua have a national salvation singing team or drama troupe, but other organizations such as the County Women's Federation and the County Party Headquarters also have organizations, totaling no less than twenty or thirty. Therefore, today the atmosphere of national salvation propaganda is particularly strong in the entire county of Jinhua. They not only work in their own county, but also promote in various places in eastern Zhejiang. Undoubtedly, Jinhua is a center of activity in eastern Zhejiang. The most prosperous section in the city, from West Market Street to Lotus Well, is also a new atmosphere. There are more than 60,000 strong men in the entire county. All those of strong men age, regardless of class, must be organized into training groups, and the results are excellent. Every morning and evening, there are groups of trained strong men in the suburbs, practicing under the leadership of instructors. The reporter saw that each team of trained strong men was neatly dressed and moved quickly. It is worth mentioning the construction of local warehouses. The Jinhua County Government, in view of the importance of grain storage during wartime and in order to adjust the price of grain, has recently built a grain storage warehouse and two agricultural warehouses in addition to the existing warehouses, which can usually hold more than 9,000 dan of grain. There is also a new-style warehouse with an area of 7.3 mu, which can also be completed in a short period of time.

Area of Scenic Beauty

Jinhua has Beishan, whose veins come from Dabanshan Mountain in Dongyang County, winding and undulating for more than 40 kilometers. Famous monks and Taoists of past dynasties have lived in seclusion and studied here. Therefore, the ancient monuments and scenic spots of Jinhua Mountain are scattered all over the place. The Zhejiang Provincial Government used this to develop it into a scenic area, and the Beishan Highway was built for this purpose. The reporter, attracted by its scenic spots, left the West Gate of Jinhua and took the Beishan Highway on foot. After 15 li, he arrived at Luodian, and then detoured along the mountain path for 10 li to reach Shuanglong Cave and Binghu Cave. Because the weather was severely cold, he could not enter the cave. He only hired someone from Shuanglong Tea Shop to guide him around the nearby area for a week. The crystal curtain of the Binghu Cave was not seen, which was a pity.

### Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory Forced to Shut Down

German Merchants are Negotiating with the Japanese Side, Nantong Correspondence: Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company and Haimen Dasheng No. 3 Textile Company are the largest enterprises in Jiangbei. They were originally initiated by Mr. Zhang Jian and were the earliest yarn factories operated by the Chinese. In recent years, due to the expansion of business and the purchase of machinery, they owed a large amount of money to the German merchant Aegis Yanghang, so they were changed to be managed by the Yanghang's manager. Since the fall of Tonghai last year, they have continued to resume work under the management of the German merchant. However, the Japanese have long hoped to cooperate, and rumors have once occurred in the outside world because of this. In fact, the company has always operated independently and has not had any relationship with them. However, because the Japanese side delayed for a long time, they took decisive measures. On March 2, the local military and secret service agency director Hama Moto Zong Saburo issued a public notice, dispatched Chang to the factory to seal the factory buildings, and ordered the shutdown. The company had no choice but to temporarily stop work in order to value the factory's rights. After receiving the report from the German staff stationed at the factory, Aegis Yanghang, because the manager's rights and interests were involved, heard that they had begun negotiations with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels. As for the yarn and cloth that has already been manufactured, most of it has been transported to Shanghai and is still selling well in various places.

### Ministry of Education Announces: Losses of Higher Education and Cultural Institutions; Irreparable Losses to Higher Education Nationwide; University Losses Most Severe in Libraries; Unprecedented Losses of Private Book Collections; More Than 2,900 Boxes of Antiquities Lost

(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the July 7th Incident, Chinese higher education and cultural institutions have suffered the greatest damage. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Education, as of the end of December 27, the equipment, books, and instruments of various universities have been burned, plundered, or bombed, resulting in the loss of most of them. Before the war, there were a total of 108 universities and colleges in the country. In the past 18 months, 14 schools have suffered extremely great damage, 18 schools have been unable to continue operating, and 73 schools have been relocated and are barely able to hold classes, unable to utilize their original equipment. In terms of property estimates, the losses of national schools have reached more than 36.5 million yuan, provincial universities more than 6.1 million yuan, and private universities more than 22.6 million yuan. Among the national schools, Peking University, the earliest university founded in China, has suffered complete losses, and it is almost impossible to calculate. Secondly, Tsinghua University, although some books and instruments have been carried out, has also lost as much as 6.05 million yuan. Among the private schools, the losses of books and instruments at Lingnan University have reached more than 3.8 million yuan, and Nankai University has reached more than 3.75 million yuan. These are the property losses that can still be estimated numerically. As for those whose value cannot be estimated in money, there are the materials collected by Tsinghua University on the history of modern China, the archives of Peking University on the Ming and Qing dynasties, the rubbings of gold and stone collected by famous collectors, and the data collected by the China Land Research Institute over the years, all of which cannot be restored. The academic losses are even more significant.

Among the losses of various universities, libraries suffered the most. In terms of national schools, 1,119,417 volumes were lost. Provincial schools lost 104,950 volumes. Private schools lost 1,533,980 volumes, totaling 2,830,386 volumes. However, this is only based on the statistics of 40 schools in the occupied areas. The number is already so large. The schools in the war zone also suffered great losses because they were relocated too late and could not be transported out. For example, 800 boxes of books and instruments from National Shandong University, including 76,724 volumes of books, were all lost at Pukou Railway Station. The total number of losses of various schools can be seen to be enormous.

As for cultural institutions, the losses are also heavy. There are more than 2,500 libraries in the occupied areas and war zones. The minimum loss is estimated at 5,000 volumes per library, so the total loss is at least more than 10 million volumes. But in fact, the exquisite large libraries in important coastal cities have fallen into enemy hands. For example, the National Central Library of Nanjing and the Jiangsu Provincial Library, the National Peiping Library of Peiping, the National Peking University Library, and the Tsinghua University Library, all of which are rich in collections and many of which are fine editions and famous manuscripts, have been destroyed and plundered, which is especially regrettable. What is even more regrettable is that private book collections have also been almost completely destroyed this time. For example, the collections of the Wu family and the Jiayetang Liu family, the Changshu Tieqin Tongjianlou Qu family, and the Suzhou Pangxizhai Pan family are the best in the country and even surpass those of public libraries. All of them have been forcibly plundered by the Japanese. Not only books, but also the wooden printing blocks used to carve books in the past have also been plundered. The National Central Library lost more than 70,000 pieces, the Zhejiang Provincial Library lost more than 100,000 pieces, and all those in Guangdong and Hubei were also completely lost. Nearly seven or eight tenths of the wooden blocks collected in the country have been lost. It will be difficult to obtain woodcut fine editions in the future. China has only established modern public libraries for 30 years. This time, it has suffered a sudden blow. Not only has the essence been lost, but even ordinary books have been almost completely lost. Among the libraries in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces that still exist, only five have collections of more than 50,000 volumes. In the border areas of Yunnan and Guizhou, it is difficult to find those with more than 10,000 volumes. The problem of the source of reading materials is extremely serious. As for Western books, due to China's financial resources and the late purchase, the largest library has no more than 100,000 volumes, which have also been completely destroyed. No more than one-tenth of them were carried out. This time, the loss of Chinese books is so great and the looting is so heavy that it is unprecedented in the history of the country. Even if any country in the world has suffered losses due to war, it is not as significant as what China has experienced.

As for the antiquities that can be used for academic research, the valuable antiquities collected by the Peiping Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior have lost a total of more than 2,900 boxes. Private collections, such as the Zhou and Qin bronzes collected by the Pan family in Suzhou and the famous paintings collected by the Gu family in Yiyuan, have all been taken away by the Japanese army along with the aforementioned book collections of the Wu family and the Jiayetang Liu family. It can be proven that this is a planned destruction. Recently, the Japanese army also plundered more than 10 million volumes of textbooks stored in the two major bookstores, China and the World, in Shanghai, so that the lost books cannot be supplemented and the books that can be supplemented cannot be purchased. Therefore, the purpose of Japan is to completely eliminate China's cultural institutions, so that there are no books to read and no materials for research, etc.

### Shanghai Municipal Education Professors' Proposals for the National Education Conference (1)

More than ten education professors in Shanghai organized the "Research Education Comrades Symposium" and submitted several important cases to this National Education Conference. Excerpts are as follows:

Proposal to Experimentally Promote Latinized Mandarin to Eliminate Illiteracy as Soon as Possible

(Reasons) Chinese characters are difficult and there are many illiterate people. In the past, various methods were used to promote literacy education, which proved that it is not easy to achieve effective results in the shortest period of time. If this continues, illiteracy will never be eliminated and the level of culture will never be improved. It has been proven that Latinized Mandarin (also known as New Characters) has been promoted in China for many years with remarkable results. Recently, it was tested in refugee shelters in Shanghai, and the results were very satisfactory. Refugees who were usually illiterate were able to read after studying for one month and write after studying for two months. The speed of results is far better than directly teaching Chinese characters. At this time of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, it is imperative to eliminate illiteracy to enhance the power of resistance and reconstruction. Therefore, according to the principle of treating the symptoms in an emergency, we should immediately find ways to experiment with the promotion of Latinized Mandarin to promote the elimination of illiteracy.

(Methods) 1. The Latinized Mandarin Pinyin should uniformly use Mandarin as the standard, except when teaching, when the local dialect can be used as a transitional method, so as to popularize Mandarin and promote language unification. 2. According to the actual situation of the national language, divide it into Mandarin area, Guangdong area, Fujian area, and Jiangnan area to conduct experiments in order to promote it. 3. All areas where Mandarin is spoken and close to Mandarin are Mandarin areas, areas where Cantonese is spoken are Guangdong areas, western Zhejiang and Minxia are Fujian areas, and the area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang south of the Yangtze River is the Jiangnan area. 4. The Mandarin area should uniformly use the national pronunciation as the standard for teaching. In the other three areas, two classes should be opened at the same level, one class should use Mandarin from the beginning of teaching, and the other class should use local language for teaching as a transitional method. When a considerable level is reached, it should be changed to Mandarin to compare the effectiveness of the two teaching methods and then determine the pros and cons. 5. The Ministry of Education should designate several educational administration or academic research institutions in each area, and invite psychological, language, and educational experts to form a committee to be responsible for carrying out experimental promotion work.

Proposal to Organize an Examination Committee to Identify Self-Taught Youth

(Reasons) Since the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone and the loss of people's lives and property, most young people have been unable to continue their studies. Those who are ambitious can only study subjects on their own in order to remedy them. However, according to the existing education laws and regulations, young people who have not studied or graduated from formal schools cannot obtain education qualifications, so that ambitious young people are limited by their poor circumstances, and even if they study hard on their own, they will never have the hope of obtaining appropriate education qualifications. This is obviously contrary to the spirit of democracy. In order to encourage young people to study and promote the effectiveness of education, we should find ways to make the studies of self-taught young people legally recognized.

(Methods) The Ministry of Education should consider the situation in various provinces, cities, and counties and specially order the educational administrative organs of the provinces, cities, and counties to organize self-taught student examination committees, determine the examination subjects and admission standards for schools at all levels, and be responsible for handling the admission of self-taught students, so that they have the opportunity to enter schools or obtain graduation qualifications. The admission of self-taught students to universities and colleges should be handled by the Ministry of Education separately by organizing committees in different regions.

Proposal to Promote Secondary and University Education so that Poor Children and Working Youth Can Continue Their Studies

(Reasons) The admission procedures for secondary schools and universities in our country are extremely strict and the costs are quite high, so that poor children and working youth who want to continue their studies are not only unable to afford the financial resources, but also do not have the time. To remedy this defect, we should find ways to promote secondary and university education so that poor children and working youth can support themselves on the one hand and use their spare time to continue their studies on the other hand.

(Methods) 1. High schools, colleges, and universities may set up night classes, holiday classes, or other classes at appropriate times to recruit elective students, so that poor children and working youth can choose one or more courses according to their financial resources and possible time. After completing the courses and passing the examination, the school shall issue a certificate of completion of the course. If they can complete all the courses of a certain department or department and pass the examination, they shall be given a diploma in the same treatment as regular students. 2. Secondary schools, colleges, and universities that specialize in teaching at night or other spare time, if their equipment, training, and teaching results are investigated and found to be satisfactory by the competent educational administrative organ, shall enjoy the same treatment as regular schools. 3. High schools, colleges, and universities may consider the situation and admit elective students during regular class hours. The method is the same as in Article 1.

Proposal to Abolish the Grade Promotion System in Senior High Schools and Calculate Academic Progress in Units of Course

(Reasons) The current school system completely uses the grades of classes to represent the level of study. If a student fails an examination in a certain course, he must repeat the entire course for a certain grade. This not only wastes time, but also rereads the courses that have already been read, which will have a negative impact on psychology and learning efficiency.

(Methods) Senior high schools (including vocational and general courses) should abolish the grade promotion system and calculate academic progress in units of courses. Anyone who fails a certain course in the examination should only retake the course. Those who complete all the courses and pass the examination will be given a graduation certificate. Those who drop out of school or transfer schools midway will be given a study certificate calculated in courses. (To be continued)

### Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai Education Committee to Postpone Organization and Continue to Proceed According to the Original Method

After August 13, education in Shanghai developed, so the Ministry of Education paid much attention to it. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Education had appointed five selected members to organize an education committee to supervise education affairs in Shanghai. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter who learned from relevant parties in the city, an order has been received from the Ministry of Education to temporarily postpone the organization of the education committee. All education affairs in the city will continue to proceed according to the past methods until the end of the semester, and then a decision will be made.

### Actively Promoting Fundraising for Education

Qinghua Elementary and Middle School, located at 428 Baike Road, is known for its excellent management and strict discipline. The number of students has significantly increased this semester, indicating a thriving atmosphere. Recently, the school invited renowned pediatrician Dr. Zhong Yaoji to give lectures on hygiene and common knowledge, and Dr. Chu Wenhui to conduct physical examinations. Both gentlemen have been hired as school doctors, each taking on their respective responsibilities. The school is dedicated to supporting various charitable causes and has actively participated in past initiatives such as donating winter clothing and raising funds for disaster relief, achieving remarkable results. Currently, the Education Group of the Refugee Relief Association is raising funds for production and education, and the students of the school are competing to donate. They have already raised over 300 national currency yuan. Among them, Yao Xiyu, a sixth-grade student, donated the most at twelve yuan; Chun Shengyulong, a third-grade student, donated ten yuan; Yu Jiahun, a second-grade student, donated six yuan; Huang Jiazi, a third-grade student, Ying Rende, Ying Dingqiao, both second-grade students, Sheng Yuping, and Liang Youling, both first-grade students, each donated five yuan.

Soochow University and its Attached Middle School: Soochow University's three colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Law, along with its affiliated middle school, have a large student body this semester, totaling over 1,400 students. Since the beginning of the semester, all training and educational activities have been actively underway. Recently, the university has been vigorously promoting the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's fundraising campaign for Shanghai refugee production and education expenses. Fundraising has begun separately in the three colleges and the affiliated middle school, with considerable success. In the colleges of Arts and Sciences, a fundraising committee composed of faculty, staff, and students has been formed and divided into six teams to carry out the campaign. It is planned to award a prize flag to the team with the best results and to the individual who raises the most funds, to encourage participation.

### Saturday for the Scott Cup; Lidu vs. West Custody Final; Charity Match: Donghua vs. Portugal; 10:30 AM Sunday at the Racecourse

In this year's Scott Cup football tournament, Lidu defeated St. Francis 7-5, and West Custody defeated Dongseile 4-2, both securing the right to the final. The two teams are scheduled to compete in the final at 2:00 PM this Saturday at the Racecourse. Lidu recently defeated the Army United 3-2 in a charity match, greatly boosting their reputation. Although West Custody has the veteran Huo Gengsheng making a comeback and Victor returning from the Portuguese team, it may be difficult to compete with Lidu's strength. Therefore, the cup is likely to be won by Lidu. The third match of the charity football tournament organized by the International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Association, between Donghua and Portugal, is scheduled to take place at the Racecourse at 10:30 AM on Sunday morning. This week's league games, three in Group A, are all in the second round. The schedule for this week and the Scott Cup standings are listed separately below.

### Sino-Western Girls' Middle School Basketball Tournament Set to Open This Friday; Participants Include Sino-Western, Chongde, and Six Other Schools; Single Round Robin System Using Women's Rules

The first Sino-Western Girls' Middle School Basketball Tournament, organized by McTyeire School for Girls, is scheduled to kick off this Friday (the 10th).

### Finance: Northern Syndicate Stops Buying and Starts Selling; Cash Rebound Plunges Sharply; Once Retreated to 2155 Yuan

Yesterday, the off-market situation of cash *sha chi* [likely refers to gold bars], suddenly rebounded and plunged sharply. It was actually because of the saying that Britain would lend us another £50,000 of British gold, and it was heard that other new loans were still under negotiation. Because of this, foreign exchange tended to be loose, and people's hearts were weak and depressed. Sellers flocked, and the desire of Northern Syndicate speculators to come out was even more urgent than others, and the price was unsustainable and collapsed. However, in the middle of the way, because the securities syndicate and a certain foreign bank and local syndicate mutually searched and purchased, it rose slightly for a while. In the end, after hearing unfavorable news from many parties, the securities syndicate turned from buying to selling, and the upward trend was difficult to maintain for a long time. As a result, it plunged by 28 yuan, and transactions were smooth. Jewelry gold in silver shops also followed suit and returned by a small three yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also tended to be stable.

*Sha Chi* Plunges Twenty-Eight Yuan

From the morning, each bar of ten taels, the initial selling price was about 2,190 yuan. Those who entered the market were cautious and watched. Before long, the securities syndicate suddenly came to throw and plug, so the market situation was immediately tired, and it was shouted down to 80 yuan before it was opened. It was already 10:15. First, the securities syndicate sold ten taels to the money exchange industry, and the opening price was 2,175 yuan, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous Saturday. After the opening, gold shops also came to sell, so they continued to decline. Gold shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, priced at 72 yuan. Following this, the securities syndicate also sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at the same price. After this, the securities syndicate suddenly changed from selling to buying, and the local syndicate and a certain foreign bank also followed suit to search and purchase, so the price also rebounded immediately. The securities syndicate bought 150 taels from the money exchange industry, jumping to 82 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop also bought 100 taels from another money exchange industry on behalf of the local syndicate, for 80 yuan. At the same price, a certain money exchange industry again absorbed 50 taels from the same industry on behalf of a foreign bank. Before long, a certain silver shop returned 50 taels to the securities syndicate, priced at 85 yuan. It was already 11:30. At that time, it was suddenly heard that Britain would lend China another £5 million of British gold, and foreign exchange was also gradually rebounding. People's hearts were tired downwards again, and the securities syndicate stopped buying and watched. The seller shouted down to 82-3 yuan, but it was still difficult to find a match. Until noon, it was not opened, so the noon closing price was still 85 yuan. In the afternoon, although a certain money exchange industry made a profit and bought more than 300 taels, because the Northern Syndicate also entrusted another money exchange industry and the securities syndicate tended to sell, and foreign exchange was also gradually reported to be loose, the price rebounded downwards again. First, the money exchange industry mutually traded 50 taels, priced at 75 yuan, and then mutually traded 100 taels, priced at 76 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry and the securities syndicate forcibly sold more than 200 taels, and the price was lowered to 55 yuan, all of which were taken in by gold shops and money exchange industries. After this, because the Northern Syndicate stopped selling, it rebounded upwards again. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver shop syndicate, priced at 2,162 yuan, which was the evening closing price. It was heard that after closing, there were still people coming to sell at the evening closing price, but it was not opened. As a result, it was 28 yuan lower than the previous Saturday (the difference between the whole day's state yuan). The book price gold of cash shops was sold at 2,170 yuan and bought at 2,155 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no opening.

Jewelry Gold Listed at Small Three Yuan

The cash-out price of gold ornaments in silver shops per tael was not changed at the beginning. Until 10 o'clock, because *sha chi* opened lower by more than 10 yuan, it was also listed at a small one yuan. Then at 2:45 in the afternoon, because *sha chi* plunged sharply again, it was relisted at a small two yuan. Datongxing Laoqingyun and other changed counties to 219 yuan, new colleagues to 217 yuan, and bought at 211 yuan.

Customs Pure Gold Unanimously Unchanged

The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank was still 1,210 yuan and 0.9 cents. The listed customs gold was also still 2 yuan, 3 corners, 9 points and 4 mils. The Shanghai standard listed gold price was also unchanged at 1,206 yuan and 2 corners, which was due to the fact that the London telegram British pure gold rebounded to be stable on the 4th, and was still 7 pounds, 8 shillings and 4 pence per ounce.

### Britain Will Lend to China Again; The Exchange Market Suddenly Loosens After Being Tight; The Hong Kong Exchange Rate Does Not Share Glory or Disgrace

The exchange market opened yesterday, and the potential trend was weak. British gold once retreated to 8 pence 0.9375, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 15.8125 yuan (the settlement price of foreign firms). Afterwards, it suddenly rebounded and turned loose. The initial tightness was because major foreign firms and Chinese cotton yarn syndicates were competing to suck up [funds], and at that time, foreign banks' willingness to sell was quite weak. Later, because it was heard that Britain was helping China economically and would have another £5 million loan to China, foreign banks' willingness to sell became stronger, and in addition, the telegram from Hong Kong suddenly came to strongly sell, so it was loose. As a result, both British and US exchange rates were loose, and transactions were quite strong. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, although foreign firms and money exchange industries mutually bought and settled, because foreign banks' willingness to supply was also strong, the situation was still stable.

In the early morning, the large London strips, the recent term was still flat, and the long term continued to grow by 0.0625. The New York silver price was the same as before, and there was no increase or decrease in London raw gold. The exchange rate of British exchange to the US was a small three cents, and to France and Shanghai, they were unchanged. The US exchange rate fell by 0.0625 against the British exchange rate, unchanged against the French exchange rate, and fell by 2 points against the Shanghai exchange rate. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were fixed as before. The bank's selling price in the morning was British exchange at 8 pence and 125 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 843,275 mils, which was flat compared to the British and US exchange rates last weekend. After the opening, foreign banks' willingness to sell was quite weak, and foreign firms' settlement was strong, so the market trend was weak. Foreign firms settled at a Magallanes British gold rate of 8 pence and 0.9375 mils. The HSBC listing and silver balance tax were announced, and there were no changes. At this time, Chinese cotton yarn syndicates also bought Hua Bi US exchange at 15 yuan and 8125 mils. At that time, it was suddenly heard that Britain would have another £5 million British gold loan, so foreign banks' willingness to sell turned stronger, so the potential trend also gradually returned to flat. HSBC Magallanes sold British gold to foreign firms at 8 pence and 125 mils. Following this, a certain Dutch bank sold US exchange to foreign firms at 15 yuan and 875 mils. Near noon, a foreign bank, Anda, also sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 54 yuan and 375 mils, and the situation was stable. The bank's selling price at the noon closing was British gold at 8 pence and 125 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 875 mils.

Later in the market, Hong Kong Electric sold British gold to Unilever and a certain bank at 8 pence and 140,625 mils, and also US exchange at 15 yuan and 906,25 mils, so the potential trend was strong. After this, foreign firms absorbed HSBC British gold at 8 pence and 125 mils. Following this, [foreign firms] again settled a certain bank's US exchange at 15 yuan and 875 mils. Finally, the foreign bank Dutch sold Hong Kong exchange to the money exchange industry at 54 yuan and 375 mils, so the situation was slightly flat. The bank's selling price at the evening closing was British exchange at 8 pence and 140,625 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 906,25 mils. As a result, it was 0.015625 longer than last Saturday in British gold, and 0.0625 looser in US exchange. Hong Kong exchange still had no glory or disgrace.

### Discount Reaches 50 Yuan; A Crazy Increase of 9 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday

Yesterday, the exchange clearing bill discount rate increased again to 50 yuan (per thousand yuan) due to the increasing need for cash and the eagerness of those seeking it. Therefore, the market's discount rate also soared, exceeding 50 yuan. From the beginning of the morning, it was strongly at 50 yuan, then gradually increased to 52 yuan, 51 yuan at noon, and there was no change in the afternoon, still 51 yuan, a sharp increase of 9 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### Many Selling Foreign Currency; British Gold Pound Plummets 5 Corners

The British and Japanese pure gold did not move last Saturday, and the British and American exchange rates fell by 0.0625. Yesterday, the settlement of foreign exchange by foreign firms was very strong, and the supply from banks was not refreshing, and the trend was weak. Later, the Hong Kong electricity sell-off was slightly stronger, and the market price gradually flattened. As a result, the slight weakness of *sha chi* opened and showed a sluggish trend. Because the daily increase in shipping was too high, the risk to retail investors was extremely high, and the desire to come out was strong, and the price fell. The Tianjin syndicate initially pretended to maintain it, slightly absorbing it to pull up the market price. Later, they tried their best to sell and realize profits, so the market price rose and fell suddenly, and the change was very large. The whole day's transactions were chaotic and the trend was weak. Foreign currencies fluctuated with the gold price, and many wealthy people made profits and sold. British and American gold pounds fell sharply, and British and American gold notes and other undelivered drafts weakened and rose, but because the gold price fell, the size was reduced. The whole day's transactions had more sellers, and most of them fell, and the trend was weak. The association's transactions were mediocre, and the Hong Kong ticket transaction was especially large. Huitong transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 1,000 yuan, Taihexing transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 5,000 yuan, Litong transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 900 yuan, Huitong transferred Hengmao to enter the US dollar note for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market price, British gold pound fell by 5 corners, British gold note fell by 5 points, US gold pound fell by 3 corners, US gold note fell by 1 point and 5 mils, Hong Kong ticket fell by 3 mils, French franc ticket fell by 5 haos, Singapore ticket and Canadian ticket each fell by 1 point, Philippine ticket fell by 2 points, Australian gold ticket fell by 4 corners, and other currencies did not change.

### Grain: Rice Prices Soar; All for Moving Out to Foreign Countries; Rice Merchants Take the Opportunity to Hoard

Yesterday, the sources from each syndicate were even scarcer, with four or five arriving from the river downstream, and more than two thousand bags of car transport. It turns out that a certain party has been searching and handling exports on a large scale in Changzhou and Xixi and other places, and has monopolized and raised the price of brown rice to 11 yuan and 12 corners, resulting in scarce sources in Shanghai and high prices for goods. White japonica rice is already around 15 yuan. Under this environment, Shanghai customers want to protect their principal, so they all insist on high prices and are unwilling to let go easily. The market immediately began to gallop, and the situation was chaotic after being moved by the hoarders and this street. As a result, the rise in the market of thick and thin japonica rice was uneven, ranging from 2 to 3 or 4 corners. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian also raised 3 or 4 corners together, and Bian Yuan also rose more than 3 corners. Although the market limits the price to 14 yuan, it is originally a means of secretly raising the price of secondary rice. In reality, where is the limit? The advent of this situation is still in its infancy. In the coming days, it will be difficult, so it is hoped that the authorities will be able to come out to help. As for the rice and grain in the inland, it is not little. If it is not moved out to foreign countries, the people's food will not be so panic.

### Flour Mill Market Continues to Fall by 5 Points; Imported Flour Arriving in Shanghai Has Some Influence; Wheat Market Remains Stalled

The flour market has gradually weakened yesterday. It has been checked that since the end of last week, the customer syndicate has had a batch of transactions, and the market has continued to inquire yesterday. However, in the recent voice of imported flour arriving in Shanghai, the selling price has repeatedly fallen, and the future of the flour is not without influence. Moreover, 7,353 tons of Australian wheat have been newly arrived, and the raw materials of each factory have frequently increased, and the customer orders have to be given preferential treatment. It is heard that the factory price has continued to be 5 points lower, only opening at 4 yuan and 6 and a half corners. At the same time, the wholesale price in this street has also fallen from 4 yuan and 7 and a half corners to 7 corners. The city has been handled by the North and South Syndicates for a total of 50,000 to 60,000 bags of No. 2 flour of each brand of cars and ships and miscellaneous brands of flour. It is heard that the flour sold by the customer syndicate has not yet been delivered in cash, and it is generally delivered successively.

Recently, the wheat market has been short of both supply and demand, and has been stalled for many days. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, but the market was still waiting and not moving forward. The reason is actually due to the impact of the dumping of imported flour wheat. The sellers held on to the cost relationship, and the factories intended to suppress the size. As a result of the insistence of both parties, there was no transaction in a single package.

### Wuhu Rice Is Said to Be Controlled; Transshipment and Digestion Are Very Strong; Imported Rice Shouted at 16 Yuan

Yesterday, the market for customer *xian* rice and customer *hua* rice was very greedy. More than 5,000 packages of each *xian* rice in Jingwu were opened. In addition to the customer hoarders and Japanese merchants, the appetite of this street also increased. Moreover, due to the high production price, those who directly handle sales in the production area also absorbed in the Shanghai market. There was also a rumor in the market that Wuhu had been controlled by the Japanese side and that only one Japanese merchant could operate the sales, so people's hearts were even more excited, and the market rose sharply by 3 or 4 corners. Even the Saigon foreign rice, which is often silent, had a shouted price of 16 yuan yesterday.

### Securities: Public Debt Recovers in the Aftermarket; China Electric Shares Rise Significantly

The securities off-market situation was still brewing and firm yesterday morning. Because Yuanda no longer had goods to sell, a huge rebound suddenly rose in the afternoon, and the rising wind gradually strengthened. The market also rumored that a new loan had been successfully made. In fact, this kind of rumor has been around for a long time. The sudden rise in the stall was entirely because the large sellers had stopped selling, and the buyers' interest was strong. This has long been expected by this newspaper. Afterwards, because Category C has rushed out of 8 yuan and Category E has rushed out of 7 yuan, even if there is a return wind, it still has to be bullish. In the morning, Chengkang was the first to absorb, gaining the upper hand, and Tongkang followed up to do more. No. 10 and retail long positions closed, and finally rose slightly by two or three corners. In the afternoon, the market has recovered, and Tiansheng's absorption is more surging after opening. Tongkang's long positions increased again, and retail investors also bought. The money industry helped also entered more and exited less, and rose unanimously. The multi-party rose by as much as seven and a half corners, and if only the large households do not oppress them again in the future, they can continue to rise. As a result, market prices rose unanimously, ranging from 6 corners to 1 yuan. The total number of transactions is estimated to be about 1.2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock transactions: 100 shares of China Electric Power shares were traded, priced at 5 yuan, 3 corners and 5 points.

### Cotton Yarn: As the Season Turns, Dealers Scramble for Fine Yarn; Market Uniquely Rises by One or Two Yuan

The yarn market remains stable, with a slightly soft trend. This is because the actual demand is not as strong as in previous days. However, transactions of 10-count coarse yarn by the Yunnan group can still be maintained. Acceptance by the Tianjin group is slightly sluggish, and other groups show no signs of activity. This makes people feel tired. As for dealers, most believe the market will rise, and many are hoarding goods. Therefore, there is little trading among themselves recently. However, some are still taking advantage of the rising gold prices to buy in slightly, but this has not stimulated the market. Dealers are fiercely competing to buy 32-count and 42-count fine yarns. As the climate turns to summer, the demand for these fine yarns increases, and the market also has low inventory, so the market is uniquely strong.

Current Yarn Situation: At the opening of the market this morning, there was still no sign of actual improvement in transactions. No groups sent telegrams with orders, so people felt relaxed. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was still 399 yuan, not much different from the previous day. Shortly after, the Yunnan group came to purchase coarse and fine yarns again, but the volume was not large, and the market price rose slightly, a minimal increase. However, 10-count coarse yarn still showed a tight situation. By the closing of the market, it was heard that gold was still rising, and Double Horse yarn returned to 400 yuan. The market became even quieter in the afternoon, with very few people attending. Transactions by out-of-town groups were still not strong. Double Horse yarn retreated slightly by five jiao to 399.5 yuan. In the end, the total volume of transactions by all groups for the day was 1,042 bales, with transactions among dealers still accounting for more than half. The average price of 20-count yarn was similar to the previous day, but 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count fine yarn were firm and rose by 1.2 yuan each. The mills have not taken any action. The transaction volume purchased by each group is listed below:

The Japanese yarn market feels particularly sluggish because the exchange rate has soared, effectively increasing prices. Therefore, sales by out-of-town groups are becoming weaker. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 335 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 330 to 329 yuan.

### Overseas Cotton Market Continues to Rise; Cotton Firms Suspend Transactions

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In Lancashire, fabric sales are brisk, and the demand for cotton is very strong. However, there is no sign that the US government will release loan cotton. The amount of cotton on the market is not large, and Lancashire is searching everywhere to buy it. As a result, the New York cotton market is rising, repeatedly reaching new highs. Yesterday, the March price reached a new high of 8.71. Based on various reports, the cotton market is likely to continue to rise. Yesterday, New York rose by five or six points. India also suspended trading due to Gandhi's hunger strike. According to a telegram received by a major cotton firm in this city, the predicted price of White Rock cotton in April and May is 154 rupees and 7.5 points. Egyptian cotton rose by three or four points. Yesterday, the exchange rate eased slightly. Converted to legal tender, the price of US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 4 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 3 jiao.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Because the overseas cotton market continues to rise, when converted to legal tender, prices have risen sharply by 4 or 5 yuan per dan compared to a few days ago, so transactions are relatively light. However, the supply of local cotton brands is scarce, and there may be interruptions. Some firms have already purchased foreign cotton, and the profit on forward shipments is already 5 or 6 yuan per dan. All firms are taking advantage of this high price to sell. Therefore, local cotton brokers have been running around trying to sell for days. Yesterday, He Feng Factory imported 100 bales of US upland Peng Jia Pu cotton at a price of 78 yuan to the factory. Gu Qian Ji Cotton Firm imported 500 bales of Indian White Rock cotton at a price of 71 yuan, delivered to the warehouse. In addition, Shanghai Yarn Factory imported 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Da Jin imported 500 bales. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton are listed below:

### Firewood Cotton: Rises to 70 Yuan, Still Cash Price

Although the local cotton business is sluggish, selling prices continue to rise. This is because various sources of supply are subject to various restrictions, and there is a risk of disruption. Therefore, the market price has risen to the point where it cannot rise any further. However, inventories are already weak, and there is no hope of new arrivals, so the market price is difficult to ease. New highs for firewood cotton are emerging one after another, and the spot price has reached 70 yuan. The supply from northern Jiangsu is still scarce, with only 150 bales of fine short-staple cotton from Xia Sha. No transactions have been made by the factories. There are 14,000 bales of Yao cotton from Ningbo. Today, 500 pieces of organic cotton will be shipped to Qingdao. The opening market prices and quantities of spot cotton are listed on the left:

120 Pieces Exchange at Warehouse with Draft

200 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse

200 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse

160 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse

### Oilseed Cake: The Oil Market Goes Off Course; Crude Oil Has a Tendency to Soar; Dalian Guangbing Rises Another Ten Cents

The sentiment in the oil market is becoming increasingly agitated, and the confusion in buying and selling attitudes is rare. Price discussions for various crude soybean oils are going off course. Yesterday, soybean oil rose by one yuan, and peanut oil soared by 1.7 yuan, and the momentum has not stopped, with a great tendency to soar. An estimated 800 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 100 pieces of Tai Cang crude oil, and more than 700 cans of Qingdao canned crude oil were handled by local and Hong Kong groups. Currently, more than 700 pieces of soybean oil have been traded, and forward delivery orders must be over 1,800 barrels. The only soybean cake purchased and sold was 1,000 pieces of Xie Feng Factory's Yuan Long Cake in Changzhou, purchased by the Fuzhou group, at a price of 3.445 yuan, with little change from the previous market. However, Dalian Guangbing, manipulated by speculators, jumped another ten cents, with 5,000 pieces for April delivery at a price of 3.45 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: New Shan Nai Will Arrive Soon

New Shan Nai Goods: It is heard that a certain firm has already purchased dozens of pieces from Shantou, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday. It is found that the old inventory here is about to run out. Therefore, although the quality of the first batch of new goods is slightly inferior, the color is whiter and cleaner, and the output this year is not large, and land prices are high. It is predicted that the future firm offer will be on par with the recent market price (old goods selling for 25 yuan).

### Piece Goods: Urgent Need to Expedite Delivery of Goods Ordered from Afar

National Cloth White goods are turning firm. Plain bleached light-colored fabrics and fine yarn woven goods sell well, and prices are stable. Sales of dark-colored piece goods are sluggish, and prices are uniquely depressed. Due to the increase in factory prices, White Goods Ewo coarse cloth rose yesterday by 10 cents per piece for the 9-pound and 11-pound varieties, and by 20 cents per piece for the 13-pound, 14-pound, and 16-pound varieties. The price of 9-pound underwear cloth rose by 5 cents. However, interest from out-of-town groups is very weak. Fine cloth and fine twill sales have increased slightly due to firm factory prices, and spot goods have risen by about 5 cents per piece. Ningbo groups have purchased 50 bales of Cannon and Big Peng brand fine cloth and fine twill. Guangdong groups have purchased nearly 200 bales of Fugui, Shen Da, Sanhua, and Ai Zi brand fine twill. Light-colored piece goods for spring and summer, such as foreign yarn, poplin, white satin, and bleached cloth, are being purchased more and more actively by nearby groups from Wen, Yong, and Min. Goods purchased from afar in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tianjin are urgently needed for delivery. Factories are very busy with active delivery work, and most selling prices are trending upwards. Most dark-colored piece goods are in stock. Based on current yarn, thread, and grey cloth raw material calculations, the selling prices barely cover costs.

Sales of Dong cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill remained sluggish in the local market yesterday. Tianjin groups slightly increased their purchases of spot goods, and there were many forward sales. There were more floating traders with high-end fine cloth. The market is fatigued and urgently seeks to sell. Therefore, the price decline of fine cloth of Long Tou, Cai Qiu, and Fei Yu brands is the most severe, falling sharply by 20 cents per piece. The middle-grade Wu Fu and Shuang Yu are relatively stable, falling by 10 cents per piece. Approximately 800 pieces were traded today. Major local dealers still expect prices to rise.

Today, 2,680 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin.

### Woolen Cloth Spring Sales Launch

Yesterday, sales of woolen cloth and fur goods increased sharply. This is because the Lantern Festival has passed, and spring sales have officially launched. Transactions by local woolen cloth, foreign goods, and silk and satin stores are increasing daily. The business of Western-style tailors and clothing is also continuing to boom. Western-style clothing materials are selling well. There are significant sales to large wholesalers and spot foreign firms at public tea parties. Based on recent purchases by various groups, in view of Shanghai's commercial prosperity, they are confidently increasing their purchases. Brokers are also extending credit to promote business. Brokers for firms such as An Kai Di Ben Te Foreign Firm and Yi Chang Tai Woolen Firm are busy running around trying to sell fabric samples. Italian goods priced at 8 or 9 yuan per yard, similar to the quality of No. 42,000 fabrics, are selling the best.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Normal Sales

The sales market for yellow soybeans, under this soaring momentum, is instead showing signs of decline. In short, it is constrained by various environmental factors, people's minds are changing, and speculative thinking is strong, resulting in the market price rising sharply. Yesterday, more than 30 military units of April Dalian soybeans were traded, at a price of 8.4 yuan and 4.2 cents, which is 2 cents higher than the market last Saturday. Only one carload of spot soybeans was traded, at a price of 8.45 yuan. The price of Pudong Du soybeans has reached 10 yuan, with 100 bags successfully delivered. 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were successfully opened, at a price of 8.25 to 8.35 yuan. There were also 100 bags of Jiading soybeans newly on the market, at a price of 7.7 yuan and 7.95 yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Tong'an Dried Longan: Price Rises 3.5 Yuan

More than 50 boxes of Tong'an sun-dried meat that arrived before the major closing were not opened due to increased costs. According to a telegram from out of town, the price needs to rise by 4 yuan, but the firm's counter-offer has not been close, so no transactions have been made. It is now heard that price negotiations between the two parties are close to agreement, and the price will be increased by 3.5 yuan based on the previous offer.

### Silk and Tea: US and French Silk Sales Pale in Comparison; Italian Rayon Another 5,000+ Boxes Arrive

Yesterday was a holiday in New York, and sentiment in Yokohama remained firm. Prices for January and February were 1,055 yuan, up 24 yuan; April was 1,050 yuan, up 29 yuan; May was 1,032 yuan, up 21 yuan; June was 1,009 yuan, up 6 yuan; July was 1,013 yuan, up 10 yuan; the most distant August was 1,018 yuan, up 12 yuan; spot goods were 1,055 yuan, up 20 yuan. Although the prices of various futures contracts retreated slightly at the close, based on the sentiment in the morning market, the future of the silk market still seems to be firm.

Local Situation: The re-opened market price for White Factory B-grade silk was 1,920 yuan. Although transactions were sporadic, silk prices remained extremely hot due to the limited domestic inventory. Yesterday, the B-grade Golden Monkey grade opened at 1,920 yuan. It is predicted that the market atmosphere will not ease for a while. The Indian Silk Market also saw hoarding yesterday. The White Head Firm of Samsung grade imported 85 loads of Thousand Gold Silk and Reeled Silk. Market prices rose by 10 to 20 yuan. Looking back at silk sales in England and France, they paled in comparison. This is because the prices of silk in Shanghai and the US and France have been very far apart recently.

A large quantity of Italian rayon has been shipped here. It was previously reported that the Italian ship "Contro Piro Ecamanno" brought 4,800 boxes on the 21st of last month. On the 5th (the day before yesterday), another Italian ship, "Contro Rosso", arrived in Shanghai with even more rayon, totaling 5,300 boxes. This is a new record for rayon imports since the war of resistance.

### Sugar Market: Total Volume of Chaozhou Sugar Shipped in 1938

According to a Shantou dispatch, the total volume of Chaozhou sugar exported in 1938 was 800,000+6,000+ bags. Due to transportation difficulties, except for Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Ningbo, etc., which were directly shipped as usual, Hankou was transshipped via Hong Kong. There were no shipments to places such as Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Nanjing, and Jinan. However, the total volume was higher than in 1937. The details are recorded separately as follows:

In addition to the above table, there were also 35,127 bags shipped from Qingdao to Qingzhou. The total is 800,000+6,000+11+bags

### Reply to Mr. Xu's Inquiry About乙Bond Market Price

To Mr. Xu Shuming,

The market price of the B-type bond on the 1st (i.e., the one seen in the 2nd day newspaper, the same below) was 48.85, and the market price on the 2nd was 48.90, an increase of five points. However, in the newspaper on the 3rd, "8" was mistakenly printed as "9", resulting in 49.90. This error of one character caused a slight discrepancy, causing you to inquire, which is greatly appreciated! - Editor

### Alarming News in the Suburbs; Japanese Troops in Wusong Attacked; Fan Shilin's Troops Killed a Japanese Captain; Chinese Troops in Pudong Determined to Wait for an Opportunity to Launch a Major Offensive

The guerrillas of Fan Shilin's troops advanced towards Wusong last night (the 5th) in a light drizzle and encountered Japanese troops. Fan's troops charged in the rain, unstoppable, killing a Japanese captain named Yamada and more than 20 soldiers, capturing a light machine gun and more than 10 automatic rifles. Fan's troops only had three squad leaders wounded. When the main force of the Japanese troops heard the news, they rushed to the scene, but Fan had already led his troops far away.

Chinese Troops Deployed with Considerable Strength

Since the Japanese troops used the puppet "army" leader Xu Hongfa to reorganize more than 100 low-quality troops under Qin Xingyan, such as Liu Xinru, Du Tianpeng, Liu Dezhong, and Zhang Lingen, into the puppet "army" in the Shangnan border area of Pudong, they were stationed separately around Beicai Town. These people are willing to act as a barrier for the Japanese troops, cutting off the direct encounters between the Japanese army and the guerrillas in the Bailianjing area of Nanmatou. Moreover, after they joined forces with Xu Hongfa, no one controls them, their ambitions exploded, and they committed all kinds of evil. Furthermore, they have successively recruited bandits north of the railway, and the number has increased to more than 200 people. The guerrillas have repeatedly urged them to quickly turn against the Japanese and redeem themselves, but their ambitions are difficult to control, and they have not awakened. Therefore, the various units of the Chinese army have deployed considerable strength and are determined to wait for an opportunity to launch a painful suppression to eliminate hidden dangers. Therefore, in recent days, the situation along the Shangnan Railway and the Beicai area of Bailianjing Nanmatou has been tense, with alarming news, as if a war is about to break out. The more well-off villagers have been forced to move away. Both the Japanese and puppet troops are even more terrified. They are conducting extremely strict searches of land and water traffic and civilians entering and leaving the area, and anyone who does not carry a puppet "citizen's card" is shot to death. Three civilians have been tragically killed at the Bailianjing port.

Japanese Puppets Attempt to Defend Western Shanghai

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the Japanese puppet authorities are deeply concerned about the increasing activity of the Chinese guerrillas around Shanghai and have decided to send a special unit of 500 "pacification troops" from the "Public Security Department" of the "Maintenance Government" to the area bordering the concession to curb anti-Japanese elements. It is heard that the Japanese army took this action because it felt that the number of soldiers stationed in the guerrilla areas behind the lines was insufficient. According to Chinese sources, these 500 men in the special unit are all composed of bandits and undisciplined and poorly armed individuals. It is heard that a portion of the so-called "pacification troops" has already arrived at designated locations in the Japanese-controlled area of western Shanghai. At the same time, guerrilla activity in the suburbs of Shanghai continues unabated. Many railways and highways in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been destroyed by guerrillas. These land transportation lines cannot maintain regular traffic. Mobile battles occur daily in Tinglin, Yexie, and Chuansha in southern Pudong. Gunshots are heard in the western district of Shanghai every once in a while. The Japanese army is currently taking strict precautions in and around Shanghai, and passengers landing at various wharves on the Huangpu River are also being subjected to strict checks. The long-rumored suppression campaign by the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu against the guerrilla teams has been halted, because the mobile units are skilled in combat, and the Japanese army has been defeated.

### Soybean and Rice Industry Association Resolved Yesterday: Maintain the Original Price Limit; Advise Merchants to Consider the Overall Situation and Comply Together; and Send a Letter to the Authorities of the Two Concessions to Properly Plan for Solutions

In view of the fact that the rice price in Shanghai has risen to the limited price of 14 yuan per shi, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 3 pm yesterday. The members present were Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qiangeng, Cai Yukun, Jiang Hongbin, She Bingwen, Xing Zhigang, Yan Xiaoquan, Yang Heqing, etc. Xing Zhigang was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. After reporting on the association's affairs, they discussed "the issue of how to deal with the rice price rising to the original limit" and resolved that the current high rice price is entirely due to foreign merchants purchasing in large quantities in the interior, and the rice price in the producing areas is higher than in Shanghai, so that traders are hesitant, and the goods arriving gradually become scarce. However, there are still 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in stock in Shanghai, which will not be scarce for a while. For the sake of maintaining the people's food, the original price limit should be maintained, and the highest price of white rice should not exceed 14 yuan. An announcement should be made to the market and merchants should be advised to consider the overall situation and comply together. However, if the price in the producing areas continues to rise, then the goods coming in the future will become even scarcer, and the inventory in Shanghai will gradually become thin. At that time, there may be a concern about panic. The rice market situation should now be reported to the authorities of the two concessions, and they should be asked to properly plan for solutions, such as ordering foreign rice or other methods, as a precautionary measure. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.

Merchants Stop Purchasing and Hoarders Take Advantage

Due to the direct purchasing by the Japanese puppets in the producing areas, the price of No. 1 white rice in the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Market rose to the limited price of 14 yuan yesterday. Traders stopped purchasing because the cost of rice shipped from the producing areas to Shanghai was higher than the Shanghai market, resulting in only 2,000 to 3,000 bags arriving each day. General hoarders refused to sell, and market prices tended to exceed the 14 yuan limit. Although the market management committee tried its best to persuade them, off-the-books transactions exceeded 14 yuan. Retail sales in various rice stores have risen to 14.5 yuan per shi.

Separate Persuasion to Maintain People's Food

After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association resolved yesterday to maintain the original price limit of 14 yuan, committee members Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, etc. separately persuaded merchants from Changshu and other places to consider the overall situation and maintain the people's food in Shanghai. It was also decided that personnel would be sent to the Public Concession Board and the French Concession Public Works Bureau today to report on the rice market situation and request them to quickly plan for solutions to avoid panic among the people of Shanghai. It is heard that the Grain Management Committee established by the concession authorities attaches great importance to the people's food within the concession. Fortunately, there is a total of 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in stock within the concession, which is enough to supply the people for three months. Therefore, it is believed that the people's food within the Shanghai concession will not be lacking or cause panic for the time being.

North China Merchants Order Foreign Rice

A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from rice industry sources yesterday that the rice purchased by the Japanese puppets from the producing areas is mainly transported to North China. Recently, it has been widely rumored that the Japanese puppets intend to control the rice in the producing areas, and purchasers of rice must have a purchase permit. If this rumor becomes a reality, the transportation of rice to Shanghai will inevitably be further affected. In addition, North China merchants have entrusted foreign firms to order foreign rice, with a total amount exceeding 500,000 bags. They are all loaded onto ships and transported directly to North China for delivery, which has led to an increase in the price of foreign rice. The cost per bag is 17 or 18 yuan, so the price of foreign rice in Shanghai has also risen accordingly.

### After the Money Shop is Listed, the Association Holds an Annual Meeting; Stipulates the Money Shops of the North and South Markets Each Month; The Market Resumes Noon Trading and Will Sacrifice to the Former Directors

After the Shanghai Money Industry Association members' money shop was listed, the association convened an annual meeting at the association on March 3rd at 2 pm. All executive committee members and managers of various shops, Yan Dayou, Lu Shuchen, Xu Wenqing, Hu Chunxiang, Zhang Wenbo, Zhang Mengzhou, Xi Jiming, Shen Jingliang, Pei Yunqing, etc., were present. Xi Jiming chaired the meeting and Ge Huaiqing recorded it. First, the chairman reported on the association's affairs and the budget settlement. Then, the managers of various shops exchanged views on the business policies after the listing. It was decided to support factories and firms in the national goods industry to promote their development. All loans will adopt a guarantee system. The meeting adjourned at 4 pm.

Stipulate North and South Market Money Shops Each Month

The following are the money shops of the North and South markets from April 1939 to March 1940. April 1939: Yichang in the South Market, Cunde in the North Market; May: Junchang in the South Market, Yida in the North Market; June: Yichang in the South Market, Hengjiu in the North Market; July: Zhixiang in the South Market, Yida in the North Market; August: Zhengxiang in the South Market, Chunyuan in the North Market; September: Zhixiang in the South Market, Zikang in the North Market; October: Zhengxiang in the South Market, Zifeng in the North Market; November: Junchang in the South Market, Xinyu in the North Market; December: Zhixiang in the South Market, Dingkang in the North Market; January 1940: Junchang in the South Market, Qingda in the North Market; February: Yichang in the South Market, Huifeng in the North Market; March: Zhengxiang in the South Market, Anyu in the North Market.

Resume Noon Trading and Extend Exchange

The money industry market stopped trading at noon after the Shanghai battlefield broke out. Now, in view of the restoration of order in the concession and the gradual recovery of transactions in various industries, the market committee decided to resume noon trading on March 6th. The announced interbank lending rate for the morning and noon markets yesterday was 1 jiao per 1,000 yuan for daily lending. Noon trading is mainly in cash. The time for the money industry bill exchange is extended to 4 pm, because the bank bill exchange time has been extended to 3:30 pm since March 1st. For the sake of coordination, the money industry has also extended its time accordingly.

North Market Guild Hall Public Sacrifice to Former Directors

The Money Industry Association usually holds an annual meeting on the Lantern Festival every year to report on the account and discuss new business policies. The location is Neiyuan in the South Market. On the last day of the Lantern Festival, a public sacrifice to the former directors is held at the North Market Guild Hall. This year, because Neiyuan has been designated as a refugee area, all gatherings cannot be held. Therefore, the meeting was temporarily changed to the Ningbo Road Association. As for the public sacrifice to the former directors, it was decided to be held on March 9th at the North Market Guild Hall on Wenjianshi Road. At that time, all managers of the listed member money shops must attend the public sacrifice, which will be presided over by Qin Runqing and other leaders of the money industry.

### Senior Postal Workers About to be Transferred Out; A Total of 65 People

Datong News Agency reports that the Postal Administration has established an office in Shanghai because the Shanghai Postmaster Chapellain (French nationality) also serves as the director and handles postal affairs in the guerrilla area nearby. At the same time, 65 postal workers will be transferred out of Shanghai. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:

Establish an Office: The Postal Administration has now appointed Shanghai Postal Administration Director Chapellain as the general inspector of the four postal districts of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and will handle postal affairs in the four regions nearby. In order to adapt to the environment, the Postal Administration has established an office in Shanghai (located on the fourth floor of the Administration) due to the successive losses of Guangzhou and Hankou. Chapellain will serve as the director and handle postal affairs in the above-mentioned regions, and has already begun operations.

Postal Workers Transferred Out: According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the number of postal workers to be transferred out recently is 65, with 20 Class A postal workers (not 25) and 45 Class B postal workers (not 40). The transfer locations are Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces (no Changsha). However, according to the postal regulations, only Class A postal workers can be transferred out, and there is no precedent for Class B workers to be transferred out.

No Consent Obtained: It is found that there was a fact of transferring Class B postal workers out last year, but it was done with their consent. This time, it is not the case. At the same time, among the Class B postal workers to be transferred out this time, some are close to 60 years old, and the salaries of the Class B postal workers are mostly less than 100 yuan, so their family life and arrangements are quite difficult. Therefore, most of them are unwilling to be transferred out and consider it a harsh policy. They have already requested the postal authorities to exempt them from the transfer.

Postal Bureau Structure: Although the administrative issue of the Shanghai Postal Bureau has been maintained, after the addition of a Japanese bureau chief assistant, the power has already gone to someone else. The restoration of postal affairs in various guerrilla areas is planned and implemented entirely by the Japanese chief inspector. The Chinese inspectors are only filling the ranks. Okada, a retired Japanese postal worker, has also been re-employed by the Postal Bureau and is serving in Shanghai. The power of the uninvited guest is becoming increasingly evident. The entire postal structure is no longer flawless.

### Local Women Actively Participate in "March 8th" Women's Day, Celebration Suspended Due to National Crisis, Efforts Focus on Rescue Work

Tomorrow is March 8th, Women's Day. The women's community in this city, given the current national crisis, has suspended celebratory ceremonies. Recognizing that women's liberation is encompassed within national liberation, and that the shackles of the nation must be removed before true liberation is possible, they deeply acknowledge

the current responsibility lies in overcoming the national crisis. They unanimously strive for the national revival and liberation movement, sacrificing personal interests for the greater good, and dedicating themselves to society from their families, seeing this as their undeniable duty. Going forward, the women's community is determined to more actively participate in various social and rescue efforts. Tomorrow, a segment of women plans to visit several shelters on Women's Day to comfort the refugees, and to conduct

planned relief efforts for women and children in distress, fulfilling their responsibility of mutual aid. The "March 8th" Women's Day declaration is recorded as follows: 'Women compatriots from all walks of life, the great "March 8th" Women's Day has arrived again. "March 8th" is a day to commemorate women's solidarity and struggle,

resisting oppression. Our women compatriots, in this era of brutal enemy invasion and sacred resistance, should rise up enthusiastically to commemorate this great Women's Day. Our women compatriots must know that women's liberation and national liberation are inseparable. The national resistance against enemy invasion is also a struggle for women's liberation. This meaning should be deeply understood by women compatriots from all walks of life after this war of resistance. Now, "Resistance and Nation-Building" has entered

the second phase, which is, as Chairman Chiang said, "the period of turning defeat into victory, turning defense into offense, and striving for final victory." Our women compatriots should work even harder, each doing their best and exerting their utmost strength to strengthen the forces of resistance and strive for final victory. In the past, our women compatriots have either bravely fought at the front lines or diligently served in the rear, making significant contributions to the nation. However, this is not yet widespread and deeply rooted, and is far from

fulfilling one's duty. Although Shanghai is in an "isolated island" situation, there are many examples of serving the nation and saving the country. I hope that our women compatriots from all walks of life will firmly believe in the final victory of the War of Resistance, loyally support the sole national leader, Chairman Chiang, and actively develop various national salvation efforts. The so-called national salvation work is not only to strictly implement the movement of non-cooperation with the enemy, but also to actively carry out the movement of donating money and aiding those in distress. In addition, the solidarity and self-cultivation of women themselves, the promotion of children's education, etc., are all

urgent tasks for our women compatriots. Before this great commemoration of "March 8th" Women's Day, may women compatriots from all walks of life become more energized and work hard to oppose the enemy's invasion, fight for the final victory of the War of Resistance, and strive for women's liberation.'

### Passenger Arrests on the Feikang Ship: Protests Remain Unanswered; Japanese Arrogance is Unexpected; German Consulate May Take Strong Measures

The German merchant Lulin & Co.'s Feikang steamer was stopped and searched by a Japanese warship outside Wusongkou on the morning of the 24th of last month while sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou. Four Chinese passengers were arrested. The German captain, Kebei, telegraphed the company to report the situation to the German Consulate in Shanghai, requesting intervention. The Consulate immediately lodged verbal protests. The Japanese side falsely claimed that the four men were suspected of something and needed to be investigated, so they would not be released. Subsequently, the German Consulate formally submitted a written protest, but the Japanese side did not reply. According to a modern news agency reporter who inquired with relevant parties, as of yesterday, the Japanese side had not responded to the German Consulate's protest, and the four arrested passengers had not been released. The German side was surprised by the Japanese side's tough and arrogant attitude. It is rumored that the German Consulate may take stronger measures to protect the interests of German merchants in China.

### Japanese to Blockade Northern Jiangsu Ports, Monopolize Yangtze River Shipping; Only Eight Ports Open from Haimen to Yangzhou; Nisshin Kisen Kaisha to Add Merchant Ships; Foreign Shipping Companies Request Consular Protests

The Japanese attempt to control Yangtze River shipping has become increasingly aggressive. Citing military reasons, they will blockade ports in northern Jiangsu from the 10th of this month. The authorities of various foreign shipping companies, regarding this move by the Japanese as a complete monopoly of operations and a deprivation of foreign business rights, have separately presented detailed reports to their respective consuls in Shanghai, lodging serious protests. A modern news agency reporter has investigated and reported the situation as follows:

Regulations for Ship Berthing Ports

The Japanese military authorities have recently accepted Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's request to implement control over shipping on the lower Yangtze River. It has been decided to start with the northern Jiangsu line. From March 10th, only eight ports, including Qinglong Port (Haimen), Tiansheng Port (Nantong), Xinsheng Port, Zhanghuang Port (Rugao), Xin Port (Jingjiang), Tianxing Bridge, Xuan (Xu'an) Bank (Taixing), and Huo Family Bridge (Yangzhou), will be designated for ship berthing and open. All other ports will be blockaded, citing military reasons. The above eight ports will be served by additional ships from Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and a Yangtze River patrol team will be organized by the Japanese Navy to protect cargo transport at all times.

Nisshin Kisen Monopolizes and Increases Ship Services

In addition to completely monopolizing shipping on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River blockade line, refusing foreign merchant operations, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha is also actively competing for shipping on the lower Yangtze River ports in order to seize and monopolize all commercial shipping along the river. From February 25th, the company has transferred five merchant ships from the Shanghai-Wuhu-Hankou route to operate in Tong (Zhou), Ru (Gao), and Jing (Jiang) ports in the lower reaches. In addition, four new types of merchant ships, ranging in tonnage from 2,000 to 3,500 tons, have been added and allocated to operate in various ports. Transport companies have been established in Shanghai and inland areas to specifically handle cargo transport for Japanese ships. The freight rates remain the same as those of other ships. However, after foreign shipping businesses are overthrown in the future, new rates will inevitably be set and freight rates will undoubtedly be increased.

Foreign Companies Request Protests

After the news that the Japanese planned to blockade ports along the river on the 10th of this month spread, foreign shipping companies such as British, Italian, German, and Portuguese became extremely alarmed, believing that this move was clearly monopolizing shipping and encroaching on the rights and interests of various countries in China. Although the Japanese side has not yet issued any formal announcement or written notice, the date of the blockade is approaching. Therefore, they have separately presented detailed reports to the consuls of various countries in Shanghai, describing the advantages, disadvantages, and current situation of each port, requesting serious protests.

### Zhejiang Cotton to be Purchased by the Farmers Bank as Much as Possible; Running Counter to the Ministry of Finance's Prohibition, While Considering Farmers' Livelihoods

Previously, the cotton stored in eastern Zhejiang was approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to be released by various customs houses upon certification by the Chamber of Commerce and transported to the Shanghai concessions for use by various yarn factories. The United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories in this city and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have complied with the order. Now, the Ministry of Finance, considering cotton as a military raw material, has reiterated the prohibition. All cotton stored in eastern Zhejiang is to be purchased by the Farmers Bank as much as possible, as instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to maintain the livelihood of farmers.

### Japan's Monetary Policy in North China Fails (Part 1); Results in Sacrificing Bank of Japan Notes; North China's Public Faith in Legal Tender is Extremely Strong; Testimony by Japanese National Tsuchizo Mito

The Continental News Agency reports that the March issue of "Modern Japan" contains an article by Tsuchizo Mito discussing the monetary situation in the Japanese-controlled areas of China and Japan's monetary actions. The article contains astonishing revelations, such as that the counterfeit banknotes of Peiping already circulating in North China, except for a small amount of 13 million yuan, were all used to pay for Japan's military expenses, and were not issued to simultaneously recover Chinese legal tender. The article also reveals that Japan's "military scrip" was also used to pay for military expenses and purchase legal tender, and then the legal tender was used to purchase Chinese goods that could not be obtained with Japanese currency or counterfeit currency. Mito also explicitly stated that the Peiping counterfeit banknotes were not worth the officially fixed price of one shilling and two pence, which was equivalent to the Japanese yen. Mito's article clearly shows that he considers the entire monetary experiment in Peiping to be a monetary failure. Finally, he observed the strength of Chinese legal tender and the trust of the people of North China in legal tender, which is rare among the Japanese. An excerpt from Tsuchizo Mito's article in "Modern Japan" is as follows:

When the war began, no one expected its scale to develop to its current magnitude, so it was decided to use Bank of Korea notes to pay for military expenses. However, the expansion of the war zone exceeded expectations, making it impossible to continue using these notes, otherwise, the Bank of Japan notes would be subjected to an undesired heavy burden, as will be described below. This situation led to the establishment of a new bank in North China to issue banknotes. Initially, it was planned to use the Hebei Provincial Bank as the core to form a new bank, but it was immediately recognized that these compensatory plans were all inappropriate. The first step must be to adjust the banknotes previously issued by various banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jidong Bank, in order to place the monetary system on a solid and unified foundation. Therefore, the proposed

bank to issue banknotes was established, named the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China," with an approved capital of 50 million Japanese yen, half of the capital fully paid up, of which 12.5 million yen was paid by the "Provisional Government." The eight Chinese banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank, Jidong Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Jincheng Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, jointly contributed 12.5 million yen. Japanese banks also provided credit loans of 100 million Japanese yen, greatly enhancing the new bank's resources. However, difficulties arose because the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications refused to hand over the silver held as the new bank's reserve, which was stored in the British and French concessions. This silver accounted for a large portion of the "Joint Reserve Bank's" silver reserve of 58 million yuan. (To be continued)

### Wu Wenzhong Attempts to Seize the Puppet District Court

Wu Wenzhong, the puppet director of the Social Affairs Bureau and concurrent director of the Judicial Department, is attempting to seize the puppet District Court and expand it into an independent judicial organ. This matter is currently underway in secret.

### Unable to Do Evil in Shanghai, Chang Yuqing Flees to Nanjing; How to Account for 100,000 Yuan? Will Face Complaints from "Master"

The veteran traitor Chang Yuqing, after failing to organize the assassination organization "Huangdao Society" for his "master," secretly went to Nanjing to reorganize the "Anqing Alliance." Since the successive incidents of eliminating traitors in the two Shanghai concessions a few days ago, Chang immediately boasted to his "master" Harada (a senior advisor to the puppet Restoration Government) that he was willing to come to Shanghai to lead the work of clearing out "terrorists." Harada approved his request and allocated 100,000 yuan as activity expenses. After receiving the money, Chang secretly came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 27th of last month and hid in his private residence on Laobazi Road in Hongkou. Apart from ordering a few of his lackeys to spread rumors in the two concessions, he did nothing. Moreover, the authorities of the two concessions, after receiving secret reports that Chang had secretly come to Shanghai to plot evil deeds, had already taken precautions and were actively investigating his whereabouts to prevent trouble. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, Chang secretly fled to Nanjing again yesterday. However, how to explain to his "master" Harada is a big problem, because Chang only spent a few thousand yuan of the huge activity fund of 100,000 yuan, and the rest was pocketed. It is expected that Chang will be reprimanded by his "master" this time and will have to vomit out the money.

### Garrison Organizes Jiaojiang Waterway, Prepares to Resume Shipping; Most Foreign Ships Have Registered as Ordered; Golden Meda Prepares for Test Run

Since the Japanese army attempted to land at Haimen, Zhejiang, Jiaojiang has been blockaded and shipping has been cut off. Now that order has been restored in Haimen, the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has agreed to the shipping merchants' request to re-register and prepare to resume shipping from March 1st. The shipping merchants have complied with the order, and the obstacles in Jiaojiang have been removed. The details are recorded as follows:

Foreign Ship Registration

Foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou-Wenzhou-Ningbo-Xiangshan-Dinghai routes have all complied with the order to apply for re-registration and have completed all procedures with the Maritime Affairs Office directly under the Ministry of Communications. These include Ninghai, New Beijing, Yongtai, Golden, Delong, Ende, Deping, Meda, Meili, Fade, Tanglu, Hailake, Yongfu, Guangsheng, Yongsheng, Tangsai, New Xiangtai, Yongzhen, Chengdu, Zhejiang, Yongda, Xiang'an, Hana, Fusheng, Tangbei, Haifu, New Anna, Hengsheng, Anna, Minhe, Anding, Yongli, Chengfeng, etc.

Waterway Organization

Obstacles in Jiaojiang, Haimen, have been removed by the garrison. A waterway has been left on the blockade line for ships to pass through. The blockade line created by the Japanese army in Jiaojiang has been destroyed. Once the re-registration of ships is completed and the Jiaojiang waterway is organized, shipping to Haimen will be resumed. The Golden Line, represented by the German merchant Lulin & Co., will sail from Ningbo to Taizhou, and the Meda ship of the Portuguese merchant Meili Company will sail from Shanghai to Taizhou. Both have telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander for instructions. Once the reply is approved, shipping to Haimen will be resumed.

Continuing Navigation to Wenzhou and Ningbo

The foreign ships that were previously approved to operate to Haimen were approved by the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo Defense Commanders to change their routes to Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo after the Haimen Jiaojiang blockade. Initially, the operation was limited to one voyage. After requesting accommodation, they were specially approved to operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes on a regular basis until Haimen is reopened. The Hana ship sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday, and the Shantao ship will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow. The foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou and Ningbo are mainly loaded with native products from the interior to Shanghai.

### Foreign Business Cooperates in Donating Funds to Relieve Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi; Formulates Second Phase Plan; Organizes Received Donations

The Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Relief of Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi Fundraising Committee in Shanghai has received more than 140,000 yuan in national currency as of recently. 40,000 Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to more than 72,600 yuan in national currency) have been remitted to the committee's representatives in Hong Kong, Lin Bingyan and others, for proper distribution and relief. They are currently investigating the situation of those in need of rescue in the disaster areas and will continue to remit funds to provide relief. The committee believes that the disaster areas in Guangdong and Guangxi are vast, and there are many refugees in need of urgent assistance. It is necessary to step up fundraising efforts to provide widespread relief. All donations received so far have been organized, and the first report will be printed and distributed to all sectors for review. Cui Pinxi, director of the design department, has formulated a second-phase implementation plan, which has been submitted to the Standing Committee for approval and implementation. Foreign businesses in this city have also been actively donating. Jardine Matheson has automatically donated 5,000 yuan in national currency and has promised to donate another 5,000 yuan. Mr. Keswick, manager of Jardine Matheson, has also promised to donate 6,000 yuan in national currency. Their generosity is commendable. The committee is scheduled to hold its seventh Standing Committee meeting at 5:00 pm today (7th) at Feng's residence on Dunxin Road. Chairman Feng Bingnan has issued a meeting notice.

### Puppet Organization Establishes a "Special Tax Office"

The Ministry of Finance of the puppet Restoration Government will organize a "Special Tax Office" in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to control the transportation and sale of opium, morphine, heroin, etc. Gu Guiyu, secretary of the ministry, is attempting to seize this position.

### Depreciation of Legal Tender in North China Backfires; Legal Tender Can Exchange for Counterfeit Currency with Increased Premium in Tianjin

The Continental News Agency reports that since February 20th, the Peiping puppet "Provisional Government" has nominally implemented the exchange of legal tender for Peiping counterfeit currency in North China, depreciating it by 40%. In Tianjin, it has remained unaffected. During the last week of last month, the premium for exchanging legal tender for counterfeit currency in Tianjin surged to 2.5 to 3.5 per mille. This news was published in the North China Star in Tianjin. The report also stated that at the time of the nominal abandonment of legal tender in North China, the area will control the export of foreign exchange from the 11th of this month. This move is currently forcing exporters to transport any existing goods from Tianjin to overseas.

### Ningbo Defense Department Discusses Resuming Shanghai-Dinghai Fish Transport; Headquarters Has Forwarded to Higher Authorities for Instructions; Enemy-Collaborating Criminal in Haimen Apprehended in Ningbo

Regarding the resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, after the Dinghai fish merchants requested to hire ships to transport fish, the Ningbo Defense Department drafted a plan and submitted it to the headquarters for approval. It is learned that the × Group Army Headquarters has forwarded it to the highest authorities for instructions. It can only be implemented after approval. According to news from the shipping industry, when Japanese warships harassed Haimen, Zhejiang, there were traitors who collaborated with the enemy and set fire. One person named Jin Haoyou escaped to Ningbo and was apprehended a few days ago. The details are recorded as follows:

Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Still Awaiting Approval

The Shanghai-Dinghai route was cut off after the Ningbo military authorities ordered the ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route not to also call at Dinghai. Repeated requests have been made by various parties to resume it, but they have not been approved. Subsequently, the Dinghai fish merchants stated that the suspension of Shanghai ships has made it impossible to transport and sell all the fresh fish, which is of great importance to the livelihood of the fishermen. Therefore, they submitted a detailed report stating the reasons and requested instructions from the Ningbo Defense Commander. Commander Guo also considered the relief of the fishing industry to be a matter of urgency and convened a meeting a few days ago with representatives from Dinghai fish merchants and relevant agencies. Four fish transport measures were drafted and forwarded to the × Group Army Headquarters for review. It is learned that the headquarters, after receiving the report, heard that the original measures have been telegraphed to the higher military authorities for instructions. They will be implemented after approval.

Enemy-Collaborating Criminal in Haimen Apprehended in Ningbo

Since the 17th of last month, the Haimen port in Zhejiang has been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships. Local bandits also set fire to the interior, causing chaos. Subsequently, the defending troops bravely defended and repelled the Japanese warships and suppressed the banditry. According to reliable information from the shipping industry, a Haimen traitor named Jin Haoyou was shot in the mouth by the defending troops during the suppression and fled to Ningbo to seek treatment at the Huamei Hospital in Beimen. This was discovered by the foreign water police, who telegraphed the Ningbo Police Bureau on the 3rd night to investigate and arrest him. After receiving the telegram, Director Yu immediately dispatched officers to secretly investigate. The bandit Jin Haoyou was arrested at Huamei Hospital and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The bandit confessed to setting fire and collaborating with the enemy, attempting to lure the enemy to land. The bureau then summoned Wu Jinbao, the guarantor who admitted the bandit to the hospital, and sent them both into custody pending further action. The Water Police Bureau was also notified by telegram.

### French Plane Takes Off from Hong Kong Carrying Airmail

According to news from the Shanghai Post Office, the first aircraft of the French airline took off directly from Hong Kong on the 11th of this month carrying mail.

### Our Government and HSBC Stabilize the Shanghai Black Market Exchange Rate; After Consideration, China Has Special Circumstances; It is Not Easy to Ban Due to Extraterritoriality and Other Reasons

After our government controlled foreign exchange, the Central Bank supplied legal foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. For the export of major native products, foreign exchange was sold to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications according to law. The import of luxury and consumer goods was not supplied with legal foreign exchange. Therefore, merchants engaged in luxury goods and consumer goods could not apply for foreign exchange themselves and turned to foreign banks to purchase it. The black market for foreign exchange arose. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly considered the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai, believing that the black market for foreign exchange is not unique to China and exists in all countries in the world. However, China's black market has its special circumstances and is more difficult to ban. The reasons are: (1) China has concessions; (2) it has extraterritoriality; (3) it has remittances from overseas Chinese. Because remittances from overseas Chinese are small and scattered, our country has not established banks extensively overseas, so many remittances have always been controlled by foreign banks. Therefore, foreign exchange is not easy to control. Secondly, there are concessions and extraterritoriality, and the power of many local governments cannot reach them, so it is impossible to ban them. It cannot be done by a government order. In order to stabilize the black market exchange rate, we have cooperated with HSBC. Therefore, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai will not fluctuate significantly in the future. The Central Bank will continue to handle the supply of legal foreign exchange in accordance with the procedures promulgated by the government.

### Terrorists Go to Peiping to Operate; Wang Kemin Narrowly Escapes Assassination

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that a large number of terrorists have reportedly arrived in Peiping from Tianjin. On the evening of Friday, the 5th, they attempted to enter the "Provisional Government" office. They were all dressed in plain clothes and exchanged fire with the puppet soldiers guarding the gate of the puppet government before leaving. They also attempted to assassinate Wang Kemin, the Executive Yuan President of the puppet "Provisional Government," and other senior officials of the puppet regime. The editor of the "Wude Bao" (transliteration), a Japanese newspaper published by the Japanese army, who is Chinese, was also visited by two plainclothes men. The Japanese army is now taking special precautions to prevent the activities of plainclothes Chinese.

### Japanese Troops in Shanghai's Eastern District Arrest Five Chinese Yesterday; Yulin Road Police Station Sent Personnel to Negotiate; Misunderstanding Resolved Quickly

Around 1 PM yesterday, an incident occurred on Yenshan Road within the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road Police Station in the Eastern District of the Public Concession, involving the arrest of five Chinese individuals by the Japanese Naval Intelligence. Subsequent investigation revealed that the arrests were a direct action by the Japanese military. As a result, the police station only learned of the incident after reports from the families of the arrested. Considering this action to be in violation of cooperative principles, they immediately initiated negotiations to inquire about the reasons for the arrests. According to the Japanese side, the individuals were identified as anti-Japanese terrorists and were therefore arrested. However, no supporting evidence was presented. Consequently, the district chief of the police station dispatched Western Inspector Robertson to Hongkou to specifically interview the Japanese military authorities. Based on cooperative principles, they requested the release of the five Chinese individuals or their transfer to the police station for investigation. If no evidence could be presented, they should be immediately released in accordance with the original agreement. However, the Japanese military authorities did not agree to this request, and even created difficulties for Robertson. Fortunately, Chief Inspector Childe and the district chief were informed of the situation and urgently invited the Japanese military authorities to exchange opinions at the Yulin Road Police Station. The misunderstanding was resolved around 6 PM. The five Chinese individuals were still detained at the Japanese headquarters because the Japanese insisted on further investigation. Negotiations are currently ongoing. At the time of the Japanese officers' meeting at the police station, a large number of marine corps soldiers were deployed around the Yulin Road Police Station to maintain guard, which caused external speculation and made the situation appear very serious.

### Foreign Merchants' Shipping Industry Progresses; Companies Add Ships and Extra Voyages; Another Giant Ship from Italy is Coming

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese shipping companies feared interception by the Japanese Navy and automatically suspended all coastal routes. Consequently, foreign merchant ships profited from this situation and facilitated domestic transportation. Therefore, during the past period, shipping companies flying foreign flags made considerable profits, and even customs brokers enjoyed significant surpluses. As for the European and American routes, although cargo transportation was affected when the war broke out in the suburbs of Shanghai, many wealthy individuals fled overseas, resulting in a tenfold increase in passenger fares. Hong Kong was a particularly popular destination, and tickets were sometimes difficult to purchase, leading to soaring prices. Therefore, the passenger ticket revenue compensated for the cargo revenue, resulting in no losses in business. In the past year, China's foreign trade has recovered to its former state. Exports of silk, tea, tung oil, leather, and wool have even exceeded pre-war levels. However, imports of foreign goods (excluding Japanese goods) are slightly lower. Nevertheless, in the three months so far this year, cotton imports from India have been substantial, and it is said that they were all purchased by Japanese merchants. The prosperity of the shipping industry during the Sino-Japanese War was unexpected. Shipping companies are optimistic and have taken measures to add ships and extra voyages. The British company's newly built "Guangdong" ship, with a deadweight of over 17,000 tons, arrived in Shanghai last November and joined the shipping routes. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai for the third time and is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow. Furthermore, it is learned that the Italian Postal Shipping Company's four postal ships: "Conte Rosso," "Conte Verde," "Conte Biancamano," and "Vittoria," are known for their speed. It only takes 23 days to travel from Shanghai to Genoa. Recently, it was learned that the company has a new ship, "Giulio Cesare," coming to Shanghai. The ship originally operated between Italy and North Africa and has a displacement of 27,500 tons. The interior is equipped with the latest facilities. Because it used to sail in the tropics, the ship only has first and second class seats, with no third class. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai for a trial voyage on May 16th this year.

### Italian Ship Brings More Jewish Refugees; Totaling 450 People

According to the "North-China Daily News," 450 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived on the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" yesterday (the 5th) afternoon. Currently, the total number of Jewish refugees in Shanghai has exceeded 4,000. A large number of staff from the committee caring for new refugees waited at the customs pier to assist them through routine customs procedures, as before. A large number of trucks arrived at the entrance to transport luggage. It is said that those arriving yesterday will be housed in the Riverside Mansion, as part of the mansion is used by the refugee committee. As for some single men, they will be placed in the new apartment on Ward Road, which opened some time ago and can accommodate 1,200 people. It is expected that several more refugees will arrive in Shanghai in the coming months, estimated to reach as many as 6,000. According to various sources, they have already booked tickets to the Far East, mostly to Shanghai.

### Cao Jiazhen Abducted; Entire Family of Abductors Arrested; Abductor Leader Lin Xucen and Cao are Fellow Townsmen and Classmates; Old Father Delivers Letter to Lure Cao into Trap; Sister Watches Over Hostage; Interrogation Denies Abduction, Claiming Purpose was to Borrow Money for Subsistence

Qiu Youxin, a former chief writer for the "Shanghai Shangbao" and "Jiangnan Wanbao," and former magistrate of Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, now residing on the second floor of 442 Fulili Road in the French Concession, is the uncle of Cao Jiazhen. Cao Jiazhen, 27 years old, is from the same hometown as Qiu. His father, Cao Rong, who is now deceased, ran a money exchange business and owned real estate worth nearly 20,000 gold in his hometown. Cao's mother lives in Ningbo. Since the August 13th Incident, Cao welcomed his mother, wife, and sister to Shanghai to seek refuge. They rent a residence at No. 488 Jianye Lane, Fulili Road. Cao is currently employed at the Datong Shipping Company, Room 207, Guangdong Bank Building, Jiangxi Road, Ningbo Road, and goes to the company to work every day, leaving in the morning and returning at night. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Cao left his residence to go to the Datong Company to work. He went missing that night and did not return. In the afternoon of the same day, his uncle, Qiu Youxin, reported to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation into Cao's whereabouts. By 9:00 AM on the 3rd, there was still no news. While Cao's mother, wife, and sister were in a state of anxiety, a letter was suddenly delivered to the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop downstairs at 42 Fulili Road, Jia Lane, Qiu Youxin's residence, instructing them to forward it to the family of Cao Jiazhen.

Upon opening the letter, it was found to be signed by He Hongda, the leader of the Labor Iron Blood Corps. The letter stated that due to a shortage of funds, Cao Jiazhen had been abducted and a ransom of 10,000 yuan was demanded for his release. The letter specified that contact should be made between 3:00 PM and 10:00 PM on the 4th at the telephone installed at the home of Feng Bozhun, Cao Jiazhen's cousin-in-law, at No. 70 Changyun Lane, Xindagu Road. Qiu then reported the information to the French Police Station, and Inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, along with detectives Shen Jinshu, Jin Bingwen, Zhong Benchang, and Tao Ronglin, began the investigation.

Following the instructions in the letter, Qiu Youxin contacted the abductors by telephone at 6:00 PM on the 4th and negotiated a ransom of 1,000 yuan. They were instructed to place 1,000 yuan in cash inside a ten-pound biscuit tin and have someone sent by the abductors to collect it from the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop at 442 Fulili Road at 8:30 AM on the 5th. They were instructed not to tell the person delivering the biscuit tin that it contained money.

They informed the police station and detectives Shen Jinshu, Zhong Benchang, Tao Ronglin, Yang Jiaxue, Jiang Zhongjia, Wu Helin, and Chen Fusheng disguised themselves and waited. As expected, at 8:00 AM on the 5th, someone arrived at the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop at 442 Fulili Road with a note to collect the biscuit tin. The detectives arrested him and took him to the police station. Under interrogation, the man confessed that his name was

Ni Fusheng, 17 years old, from Pinghu. He worked as a tea server at the Danghu Hotel in Lane 9, Shanxi Road (i.e., Huajin Lane). He said that a guest in Room 21 had asked him to pick up the biscuit tin and he was unaware of the details. The detectives followed Ni to the Danghu Hotel and arrested Lin Xucen (29 years old, from Cixi) in Room 21. Lin confessed to planning the abduction of Cao Jiazhen for ransom. The hostage was hidden in the two-story attic residence inside the Yangjian Elementary School at No. 9, Lane 1216, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Massenet. He said that he and the abductee were

Fellow townsmen and classmates. Due to unemployment and financial difficulties, he resorted to this desperate measure. The detectives took Lin to the Public Concession Police Station and requested that detectives be dispatched to the address to rescue the hostage, Cao Jiazhen. Lin's father, Lin Jinyou (65 years old), and Lin's sister, Gen Maoren (37 years old), were found guarding the hostage. Two daggers were confiscated. When Lin Maoren was arrested, she was dressed as a man. The attic where the hostage was hidden was covered with black paper to block out light. According to the main suspect

Lin Xucen's confession, there were accomplices including his younger brother, Lin Xuxing (27 years old), who was staying in Room 3 at the Jiangxin Hotel, No. 40 Shanxi Road. They were all taken back to the French Police Station. It was found that the main suspect, Lin Xucen, had impersonated Cao's friend Chen Guangfu and written a note, which he entrusted to his father, Lin Jinyou, to take to the Datong Company, luring Cao Jiazhen to Room 429, Asia Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. Lin Jinyou was in

The Asia Hotel
waiting in the room. When Cao arrived, Lin Jinyou claimed that Chen Guangfu could not wait and had returned to his residence. He asked Lin Jinyou to accompany Cao to his residence to meet him. After Cao went to the Asia Hotel, Lin Jinyou led Cao to their residence, where he was confined. Lin Xucen then wrote a letter to Cao demanding a ransom. Yesterday afternoon, the police station transferred the four members of the Lin family, father, son, daughter, and brother, to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and requested a postponement

For investigation before prosecution. Detective Zhong Benjing then reported the details of the case and the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. The victim, Cao Jiazhen, also recounted the details of his abduction and confinement. Lin Xucen confessed that he used to run a cosmetics business, but the store was destroyed by the war and he became unemployed. He was unable to find work, ran out of money, and was suffering from poverty and illness, leaving him with no choice but to resort to this desperate measure. Lin Jinyou, Lin Xuxing, and Lin Maoren all denied knowing about or participating in the conspiracy. Judge Zhang Minsheng verified the confessions and ruled that the hearing would be postponed for fifteen days. The defendants were detained.

### Daughter-in-Law Forced to Cut Flesh from Thigh to Cure Husband; Leading to Death; Obstinate Mother-in-Law Mistreats Her in Every Way; Young Woman Commits Suicide in Despair

Zhan Honglin, a large silk and flower merchant from Fujian, is over fifty years old. He used to run the Jufengtai Silk and Flower Company. During the August 13th Incident, Zhan made a considerable profit. At that time, he purchased the residence at No. 7, Lane 274, Chengdu Road, formerly the residence of Lu Shaotang, for a large sum of money. After extensive renovations, he moved to that location, and all of his sons, daughters-in-law, etc., also lived there with him.

Servants and maids were employed, and the lifestyle was quite comfortable. However, his wife, Zhang, was an old-fashioned woman with a stubborn mind. Because she had no children of her own, she adopted four children. Her eldest son, Xin Xian, married a woman surnamed Ji. After a long time, she could not bear the mistreatment of her mother-in-law, Zhang, and her husband, Xin Xian, was also dissolute. Consequently, in 1937, she committed suicide by swallowing opium out of resentment.

This spring, the mother-in-law continued to marry off the son to Shi Rend, the third daughter of Shi Liufang, the owner of Zhaofang Photo Studio (25 years old). After the marriage, it was initially harmonious, but the old nature of the mother-in-law, Zhang, did not change. Because Xin Xian suffered from tuberculosis, she instructed Shi Rend to take care of him in every way, in addition to serving medicine. The mistreatment of Shi became even more severe. Soon, she had an absurd idea and forced Shi

To cut flesh from her thigh to cure her son's lung disease. She urged and nagged her day and night. Shi felt that the family was so dark, and her husband was like a stranger. On February 13th, she returned to her hometown in Ningbo to visit her parents, intending to tell them her grievances. However, she happened to encounter her father's illness and silently returned. But the mother-in-law's pressure started again. At that time, Shi

Was heartbroken. At 10 PM that night, she was writing a letter at her desk, and then pretended to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 12 AM, the maid found that Shi's complexion was unusual. Before she could ask, Shi was already in a coma. Her husband, Xin Xian, did not ask or hear, and ignored it. It was not until the poison took effect and she cried out that the family sent her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After examination, it was found that she had swallowed Lysol. However, it was too late, and the poisoning was too severe, so that

There was no way to save her. She died at 2 AM on the 14th. Her body has been examined by the court. However, Shi's father, Liufang, said that although his daughter's suicide was self-inflicted, the reason for her death was purely because she was forced by a dark family and sacrificed herself. Moreover, his daughter had a suicide note at the time, so why did it disappear after her death? This is very important. Moreover, there are various rumors outside, and he is eager to clear her name. He is currently secretly investigating, and the public is also paying close attention. It is expected that this case will eventually come to light.

### Dance Girl Owes Huge Gambling Debts with Lover; Suddenly Accuses Lover of Theft; Clothes Pledged Numerous Times; Complex Inside Story to be Investigated and Heard Again

Zhong Huili, a Shaoxing woman (27 years old), is said to have been a dance girl at the International Ballroom. Later, she married Yu Renqing, a Shaoxing fur merchant, and lived with him at 177 Guizhou Road. However, Yu often traveled between Shanghai and Shaoxing for business. In January of this year, Zhong suddenly rented a room at 560 Zhongnan Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. At the same time, a Shaoxing man named Guan Maotou (also known as Xiaomaotou), 24 years old, was inseparable from her. They often went in and out of gambling dens and dance halls in western Shanghai. Suddenly, Zhong reported to the Laozha Police Station, claiming that a suitcase containing clothes worth more than a thousand yuan, which she had placed in her room at the Zhongnan Hotel, had been stolen by Guan. After investigation by Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan, Guan was finally arrested yesterday in Room 335 of the Zhongnan Hotel and taken back to the police station. Guan admitted to taking the woman's suitcase to pawn it, but claimed that he and the woman had an affair. He said that this time, they went to a gambling den in western Shanghai to gamble and lost, and he had no choice but to pawn the clothes. He said that he had done this several times before. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a theft charge, stating that the inside story of the case was complex and needed to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he requested that a postponement be granted for further investigation. After Judge Fang Qinghuan questioned both parties, he ordered Guan to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed.

### Assassination Attempt on Zhu Ganting, Fake "Nanhui Tax Director," Fails; Two Strong Men Open Fire on Zhu But Miss; Zhu's Wife is Skilled in Martial Arts and Escapes Death; Iron Blood Assassination Squad Active in Western Shanghai

At 7:40 AM yesterday, an assassination attempt on Zhu Ganting, a traitorous fake "Nanhui Tax Director," failed in Qingyuli, Kangnaojiao Road, a road built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai. The gunman calmly left. The following are the details obtained by the reporter of the "Shewen News Agency."

Filled Fake Positions and Specially Extorted Money; Zhu Ganting, an Anhui native, over 40 years old, graduated from the Baoding Military Academy in Hebei Province. He once served as a company commander during the Northern Warlord era. Later, he served as a senior official in the Food Management Committee of the National Government. After the August 23rd Shanghai Incident, Zhu betrayed the country and joined the Su Xiweng department of the fake "Da Dao Municipal Government," serving as an official in the "Finance Bureau." Later, he was sent to western Shanghai as the tax director, and recently he was sent to the fake "Nanhui County Tax Director." Zhu has been in fake positions for more than a year, extorting a lot of evil money. He currently lives on the third floor of No. 25 Qingyuli, Kangnaotuo Road, a road built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai. Strong Men Come to Open Fire But Miss; At around 7:40 AM yesterday, Zhu was still asleep at home when two strong men suddenly came to visit Zhu, one wearing a suit and the other wearing a robe. After meeting, the two strong men took out an appointment letter-style envelope, which read "Zhu Ganting is willing to be a traitor and should be executed immediately," followed by the words "Youth Iron Blood Assassination Squad." After reading the letter, Zhu tried to deny it. At that time, one of the strong men took out a pistol from his sleeve and tried to shoot Zhu. At that time, Zhu's daughter entered the room from outside. She was skilled in martial arts and, seeing this situation, quickly stepped forward and hugged the strong man. Zhu was also extremely frightened and quickly wrapped a quilt around himself and jumped off the bed. Another strong man pulled out his gun and fired a shot, but missed. Zhu's daughter then shouted for help. The two strong men calmly left, saying as they left, "We'll let you live a few more days and come back to execute you." After the incident, Zhu was frightened and, according to reports, has fled to Hongkou by car. (Shewen News Agency)

### On the Necessary Care for Men's Bodies, Starting from Artificial Sex Transformation

Modern science is truly advancing by leaps and bounds; almost any difficult problem can be solved by science. We can never fully recount the great achievements in the field of natural science. The research on human reproductive glands in physiology alone is astonishing! Dr. Steinach dedicated his life's experience to arduous experiments on human reproductive glands. As a result, he successfully supplemented the human body with animal glandular extracts, achieving the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating the body. This shocked the medical world and benefited human health. His great achievements shine as brightly as the sun and moon. However, regarding the study of reproductive glands, Dr. William O. Puckett recently demonstrated his artificial sex transformation method at the American Zoological Society. He dissected the reproductive glands of very young tadpoles for public observation, pointing out that the sex of tadpoles is not yet determined at this stage. Their sex differentiation usually occurs in the late stage of tadpole development. At this time, if either female or male endocrine secretions (gonadal fluid) are injected together with the mucus gland in a small organ behind the tadpole's skull, tadpoles that prefer female endocrine secretions will become female, while those that receive male endocrine secretions will become male. The doctor conducted repeated experiments and could arbitrarily make them female or male. From the success of this experiment, it is not difficult to extend the application to humans. Indeed, after a couple gets married, having sons and daughters in their married life is closely related to sexual health. A vigorous and healthy husband is more likely to have sons soon after the wedding. Furthermore, if a man takes care of his reproductive gland fluid with various hygienic methods to keep it abundant, he can often have sons. There is truth to the saying "a pure heart and few desires lead to many sons!" However, if a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, leading to the loss of control over his semen, weakening of the sexual nerves, and resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, deficiency of the brain and kidneys, forgetfulness, and insomnia, he will often be unable to have a fulfilling married life. In this case, not only is it difficult to have children, but the marital relationship may also be difficult to maintain. Therefore, various tragedies often occur in families, or wives even confidently file for divorce from their husbands, which is common in today's society. As for the man himself, he suffers from physical weakness and experiences such misery, which is unbearable! Due to the pain within, the illness worsens, leading to premature aging or early death. How dangerous this is! Although there are many treatment methods, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the glandular extract preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Indeed, this agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate the blood within one day and night after taking it, making the man full of energy and intensifying the couple's love. Having sons and daughters becomes more assured. If continued, it can not only completely cure various male sexual dysfunctions but also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Tablets) to consolidate the semen and stop leakage for even faster results! If patients can come to our clinic and receive scientific therapies such as diagnosis by expert doctors, electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

Common Ailments of Youth

### Analysis of the Harms of Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission

— Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Zhan Nianceng

In this turbulent era, crossroads are everywhere, and inexperienced young people are wandering astray, truly facing dangers at every turn. The greatest forces that tempt young people are glamorous women and self-sexual stimulation because young people are at the stage of budding feelings and intense sexual curiosity. At this time, without good education and proper guidance, few are not lured by negative environments and fall into the abyss of filth. Taking the most common masturbation and nocturnal emission among young people, which are often ignored by society, the severity of their harm is even worse than floods and wild beasts! First, the number of young people who commit masturbation is countless. Those who truly suffer are those whose sexual nerves are damaged, leading to loss of control over the semen and hypersensitivity of ejaculation, which is followed by nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission starts, it is like having a leaky vessel, and a large amount of semen is inevitably lost from the body, causing all parts of the body to be in a state of depletion. Various symptoms of weakness, such as brain atrophy, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, and kidney deficiency, then follow. Their personal health and future happiness are then in the darkness of a confused night. Second, due to the damage to sexual function, they will not be able to live a fulfilling sexual life after marriage. As a result, the wife's youth is wasted, and happiness is ruined, as if the wife has been sent into a tomb of pain. At the same time, what about the happiness that he himself should have in life? It is unknown whether it will be thrown into a fog or beyond the clouds. Third, from childhood to youth, the burdens and cultivation given by their parents, elder siblings, teachers, and society and the nation are by no means few. In terms of the family, they hope to establish a family and glorify their ancestors. In terms of society and the nation, they hope that they can become a construction technician and a loyal and brave soldier on the battlefield to gain a capable member in the journey of resisting aggression and building the nation. However, can they actually meet this requirement? As far as we know, most young people are sinking into the low-level interests of masturbation and debauchery and cannot extricate themselves. How can we not sigh! Aware youth, at this once-in-a-lifetime moment, at the juncture of human enslavement, we must use the greatest determination to resolve our masturbation and debauchery and take the most effective good medicine, "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Tablets), to consolidate the semen, relieve the state of ejaculation hypersensitivity, and fundamentally treat nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, it is even more necessary to take the glandular extract preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood, so that health can be completely restored in a short period.

### The Value of Breasts in Love

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

High and elastic breasts are the soul of a healthy and beautiful woman.

A pair of high breasts, setting off a graceful figure, with plump hips, plus a fair and rosy face, with willow eyebrows and cherry lips, pearly teeth, and a beautiful nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only respected like a goddess by her husband at home, and the love between the two sexes is especially strong, but also when she goes out to socialize, with her appearance, she is everywhere like stars surrounding the moon, receiving enthusiastic welcome.

However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in the world. The main reason is that a woman's complete health relies on the full integrity of the ovarian function. With a sound ovarian function, a woman's characteristics, that is, good development, the most obvious is that the breast presents a firm and elastic peak-like bulge. Even if she wears tight clothes, it will not succumb so protrude on the chest, with two peaks facing each other, and a deep valley, which is so intoxicating. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, coupled with a lively willow waist, forming the most mysterious and lovely curves of a woman. However, only women with good development can enjoy these qualities. Others who indulged in masturbation in their early years or due to menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, or weakness after illness, which led to impaired ovarian function and affected metabolism, the originally high breasts will also shrink, beauty will be lost, and the complexion will become haggard. Such a woman is not only often disliked by her husband at home and has difficulty conceiving, but also in terms of her personal temperament, she is often narrow-minded, sentimental, and happiness is not related to her. Therefore, the tragedy of her future fate is unimaginable! To seek remedy, one can only rely on science. According to the experience of the world's gynecologists, such as Oansnast Konstan's and others, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation called "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Therefore, this medicine can nourish the ovaries and increase metabolism immediately after taking it. If continued, it guarantees to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, making the breasts gradually bulge, transforming ugliness into beauty.

### A New Relief for Diffuse Leukorrhea

After the venereal poison has been conquered by the newly invented special drug "Da 〇 Liu" (Great 606, referring to Salvarsan), its rampant prevalence is far less than before. The one that has taken its place is gonorrhea. It is not only as prevalent as syphilis used to be but even more so. Because of the pervasiveness of gonorrhea, in many large cities, the number of men suffering from gonorrhea is actually more than the number of healthy men, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, we must thoroughly research the treatment of gonorrhea to rapidly eradicate this raging disease. However, many city doctors who stick to old methods often stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method, such as using only one type of medicine or one type of surgery to deal with the ever-changing gonorrhea. How can we expect gonorrhea to be cured soon and return happiness to people? Now, doctors with a slightly modern mindset feel that it is imperative to treat gonorrhea, especially to deal with diffuse gonorrhea. Now, let's discuss it separately.

For stubborn and diffuse leukorrhea, the diagnosis and treatment should be studied with the greatest effort. Start with a precise diagnosis to determine whether it belongs to acute or chronic urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, etc., and then use targeted treatment to expect a cure soon. For example, gonorrheal arthritis, orchitis, etc., must be injected with German Hee-Ying serum to eliminate widespread gonorrhea bacteria, while for the initial stage of cystitis, mechanical treatment should not be used; however, if it is too difficult to treat, irrigation can be performed. For prostatitis, vibration massage, Wen's cooling method, electrical massage, and suppositories can be selected. If someone stubbornly adheres to a certain treatment method or a certain inferior medicine until old age, is it not a deception? As for electrotherapy, German Lülin's direct current electrotherapy is even more effective in treating various symptoms.

Specialty: Also treats syphilis, inguinal bubo, chancroid, and painless new method of circumcision.

Commentary

### Respectfully Announcing to Fellow Physicians, Please Endure the Pain and Generously Contribute

— Yu Yunxiu

The establishment of this rescue team is truly a matter of great urgency, and the launch of the fundraising team is truly a matter of last resort. Now, the reasons are briefly stated below. All my colleagues with a heart, whether they are members of this association or not, please carefully consider and enthusiastically donate. This is my sincere plea.

(1) Rescue Plan: A rescue team is planned to be organized and sent to the disaster area, consisting of five doctors and ten nurses, for a period of one year. In addition to the separate provision of medicines and food, the estimated cost is 15,000 yuan, specifically for the hard work and salaries of the dozen or so members of the rescue team.

(2) Fundraising Campaign: Divided into forty-seven teams, each with a dozen or so members, to raise funds in different ways. Whether members of this association or not, doctors or non-doctors, all can be encouraged to donate.

The above two points are a brief overview of the organization of the rescue team fundraising team.

(3) The Situation We Face: At this extraordinary time of widespread mourning and refugees everywhere, it is truly uneasy and inappropriate to be leisurely and adopt a hands-off approach.

(4) Professional Compulsion: We are in the medical profession. Since ancient times, there has been the saying that one would rather be a good doctor than a good minister, meaning that one can save people. Now, at this time, we should do our best to save people so that we will not fail our duties.

(5) Driven by Conscience: The disaster of war has spread to more than ten provinces. People are scattered and displaced, unable to settle down in their homes, and unable to avoid freezing and starvation even with food and clothing. In addition, wounds are not healed, poverty and illness are intertwined, and those who are displaced and on the verge of death number in the hundreds of thousands. We are fortunate to have escaped the tragedy and live day and night. If we are still alive and our hearts have not died, we should endure hunger for a moment and donate generously to accomplish the act of doing good and rescuing the disaster. Thinking about it in the quiet of the night, we feel that it is our duty.

(6) The Expectations of the Public: As doctors, in the face of this disaster, coming forward to take on rescue work is something that people across the country believe is natural, even if they have not explicitly said so. Even colleagues in Shanghai have done their best in various efforts such as saving the country and donating to refugees. However, this is ultimately helping other people's initiatives and is not a righteous act in the capacity of a doctor. This time, it is something that should be done in the capacity of a doctor. Zengzi said, "What ten eyes see and ten hands point at is awe-inspiring." How much more so when it is the collective opinion of the people across the country! How dare we not cherish ourselves?

The above four points are the motives and reasons for organizing the rescue team and launching the fundraising team. There is no excuse on either side. May all my colleagues, based on their personal conscience, and within the limits of their abilities, do their best to support this endeavor. It will not only be the good fortune of this association but also the actual benefit of the people across the country.

### On Eating Raw Foods

— Shen Gong

Eating raw foods refers to fruits or vegetables that have not been excessively processed. In a broader sense, raw foods include raw milk, raw eggs, raw shrimp, etc. The advantages are briefly described below:

Raw foods are rich in vitamins, so they do not cause vitamin deficiencies.

Raw foods can provide a large number of minerals.

Raw foods do not have the risk of excessive salt intake, so they are quite suitable for kidney, blood vessel, and nervous system disorders.

Raw foods do not contain 嘌呤 (purines), so they are beneficial for gout and those with uric acid problems.

Raw foods are low in protein, so they are good for nephritis and severe diabetes. However, if protein is insufficient, it can be supplemented with walnuts, eggs, milk, etc.

Raw foods have a large volume, are easy to fill, and have low caloric content, so they are suitable for weight loss therapy.

Raw foods contain many indigestible components, which mostly absorb water in the intestines and increase stool volume, so they are suitable for constipation.

Due to the above advantages, raw foods are suitable for constipation, nephritis, edema, obesity, gout, rheumatism, neuralgia, diabetes, neurasthenia, epilepsy, skin diseases, etc. Note: When eating raw foods, special attention must be paid to the risk of infection. Therefore, fruits should be washed before eating at home.

Common Knowledge of Diseases

### Research on Thinness

— Wang Wanbai

Healthy men and women should have a moderately fat or thin physique. Being too fat or too thin is a pathological state. It is especially important to avoid thinness in one's twenties, as it may indicate chronic diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis. After the age of forty, obesity should be avoided. Those with large bellies are often prone to high blood pressure and sudden stroke. These should be examined by a scientific doctor as soon as possible, and early prevention and treatment will easily remedy the situation.

Reasons

Whether fat or thin, the reasons should be investigated. Physiology is like economics; if income does not cover expenses, one becomes thin; if supply exceeds demand, one becomes fat. The following are some common causes of thinness:

(1) Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Also known as consumption. Before obvious symptoms such as night sweats and hemoptysis appear, weight loss may already be present. Patients often overlook this, so it is important to have an early examination to avoid regret.

(2) Intestinal Parasites: Many people suffer from this disease, especially in childhood. Like resident freeloaders, they consume a large amount of the nutrients obtained with hard work. However, evidence can be found by examining the stool.

(3) Diabetes Mellitus: Sugar in the urine makes it easy to lose weight. In the past, it was called wasting disease. However, in the early stages, most patients are unaware of it. If the urine is tested, it can be discovered immediately.

(4) Excessive Mental and Physical Labor: Some people are busy with work and lack adequate food and sleep; others engage in recreational activities and socializing day and night, which can also cause the same phenomenon.

(5) Poor Digestion: The stomach is responsible for digestion. If one suffers from chronic stomach problems, the nutrients obtained will be insufficient. Initially, only weight gain will be affected, but gradually weight loss will occur.

(6) Glandular Insufficiency: The metabolism of the human body relies heavily on the internal secretions of various glands for regulation. Therefore, when glandular function is insufficient, nutrition will be impaired. For example, atrophy of the thymus gland in children leads to infantile marasmus.

The above is just a brief introduction to the common causes. Other causes will be omitted.

Care

Once the cause of thinness is discovered, treatment should be given according to the cause. If the underlying cause of the disease is ignored, but efforts are focused on nourishing medicines, it will be ineffective. If the leak is not plugged, it will be difficult to accumulate. For example, for common intestinal parasites, medicine must first be taken to expel them before health can be restored. Otherwise, taking tonics will be useless. In addition to symptomatic treatment, the general methods of care are like increasing income and reducing expenses in financial management. The following are also a few points.

(1) Tonics: Since the body is thin, it needs the nourishment of tonics. However, it is necessary to seek those that are easily digested and contain many vitamins, such as fresh milk, fresh cheese, half-cooked eggs, strong beef broth, grape juice, soy milk, cabbage, oranges, etc.

(2) Drinking Water: Drinking more water is a new method for gaining weight. The best beverage is cold boiled water, three or four times a day, one or two large cups each time. The time should be on an empty stomach and not immediately before or after meals. If one is not used to drinking cold water, hot boiled water is also acceptable.

(3) Rest: People with busy lives should try their best to conserve energy and rest at regular times. If children are very thin, they should be encouraged to sleep more in a place with plenty of air and sunlight. However, people who engage in mental labor but not physical labor should have appropriate exercise.

(4) Massage: If the skin is dry and the limbs are thin, olive oil should be applied daily and massaged. The upper and lower limbs and the front and back of the body should be performed at different times in rotation.

(5) Taking Medicine: Internal medicine should be prescribed by a doctor. Do not buy and take medicine randomly. For ordinary care, the most economical and practical is cod liver oil. Adults can take one tablespoon after each meal, and children can take it in moderation.

(6) Injections: Injectable drugs are the greatest contribution of scientific methods. However, they must be administered by a licensed physician. For example, organ preparations related to internal secretions have a significant impact on the body's metabolism. When used properly, they have special effects. Finally, spiritual cultivation is needed, because from ancient times, sorrow leads to illness, and a broad mind leads to a healthy body. We can achieve the highest health method by having no worries of self-reproach within and the joy of benefiting others without.

Disease Statistics

### Report on X-Ray Group Examination for the Past Six Months

— Shen Zhiming

Pulmonary tuberculosis (commonly known as consumption) is a major enemy of mankind, as everyone knows. Not only are there many patients among our Chinese people who lack hygienic knowledge, but there are also many patients in European and American countries. Since the Shanghai War, the number of people in the isolated island has increased sharply, and the unsuitable sanitary environment and lack of sunshine have further spread the bacteria. However, if this disease can be diagnosed early and treated surgically as soon as possible, it may not be an incurable disease. The ancients said, "The gentleman is careful about the subtle," which is very true.

X-ray is the only effective tool for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases. This knowledge has gradually been imprinted in the minds of the people, but unfortunately, it has not yet become widespread. I serve at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, and there is an X-ray group examination every Wednesday and Sunday. Now, I have compiled the results of the examinations in the past six months into a brief report to inform readers.

Number of People: 609

People without Disease: 164

26.93%

People with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: 158

25.94%

Gender: Male 110

Female 48

Age: 7 to 20 years old 30 people

21 to 30 years old 81 people

31 to 40 years old 34 people

41 to 66 years old 13 people

Those with Cavities: 27 people 4.5%

Age: Between 8 and 44 years old

Note: Among them, there is an 8-year-old girl with adult pulmonary tuberculosis forming cavities, and an 18-year-old boy with chronic miliary tuberculosis, both of which are extremely rare.

Hilar Lymph Node: Suspected Tuberculosis 49 people

Hardened: 34 people

Age: 3 to 20 years old

21 to 58 years old

Pleural Thickening: 40 people (31 males, 9 females)

Unclear Lung Apex: 19 people (14 males, 5 females)

Deep Bronchial Shadows: 77 people

Pneumonia: 10 people

Age: 1 to 8 years old 9 people

Large Heart Shadow: 14 people (9 males, 2 females)

Large Aortic Shadow: 6 people (4 males, 2 females)

Others: 2 people (Joint Dislocation)

Looking at the above statistics, those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis actually account for 30%, and those between the ages of 15 and 30 suffer the most. It is believed that lung disease easily attacks young people. This is of great importance to the nation and the people, so anti-tuberculosis work should be vigorously promoted without any delay.

### Drops in the Sea of Medicine

— Sizhai

Intestinal Obstruction: Why Do Symptoms of Collapse Always Appear?

In the case of intestinal obstruction, symptoms of collapse always appear. There are various theories about its cause. Some say it is due to the stimulation of the peritoneum in the visceral nerve area, which reflexively weakens the function of the heart and blood vessels. Others say it is due to toxins produced by the intestine itself, resulting in self-poisoning. Still others say it is due to the large amount of water seeping into the intestine, resulting in a lack of body fluids, and the accumulation of a large amount of blood in the abdominal cavity, resulting in an uneven distribution of blood flow throughout the body.

Why Does the Stool of Patients with Obstructive Jaundice Have Such a Foul Odor?

The stool of patients with obstructive jaundice has a foul odor that makes people cover their noses because the stool contains higher fatty acids. In the past, it was mistakenly believed that it was caused by intestinal putrefaction, but it is now known that this is not the case. (To be continued)

### A Broad Discussion of Rights

— Mao Lie

Previously, I offered "A Brief Discussion of Rights," but felt it was incomplete. Now, I'll "broaden" it a bit.

I often hear people say, "Why was I born into a poor family? My ancestors left me no inheritance to enjoy." To them, I say, your very origin is your right.

I also hear people say, "Why does my family suffer from so many illnesses, causing me so much pain in caring for them?" To them, I say, your act of caring is also your right.

I also often ponder the mindset of certain people who consider themselves unfortunate to be born in a weak and aging China, rather than in a strong and prosperous foreign country. I always hint to them that being born Chinese is precisely our right.

Indeed, some people often lament, wishing they hadn't been born in this chaotic 20th century of shifting international winds, but rather in the peaceful and prosperous golden age of the past, or the harmonious and joyful world of the future. I can't help but explain to them that being born in this age of upheaval is exactly our right.

In short, in my view, all the suffering, misfortune, and any setbacks or blows in this human world are our rights.

Why?

First, humans have a desire for exclusive possession. All these things, since they are exclusively ours and cannot be shared by others, are nothing less than our rights!

Second, humans have a desire to create. However, countless people live a muddled life and die in comfort. All these things serve as stepping stones, making us the kind of people Mencius described as those "to whom Heaven is about to assign a great responsibility," enabling us to develop and progress. Their shaping of us is undoubtedly a special right we enjoy.

Therefore, conversely, if someone's environment, family, nation, and era are all comfortable, requiring no effort or thought, then I would say that person has lost the meaning of life and is merely a walking corpse. What they enjoy cannot be considered a right at all, but merely fulfilling the obligation of consumption and excretion.

Originally, life is just struggle, just progress. The opportunities for struggle and progress are our rights!

### Romance of Hong Xiuquan

— Zou Xiao

— Folk Novel Talk

The second collection, twenty-ninth chapter, of Romance of Hong Xiuquan, is kept in the Peking University and is a stone-printed version, written by Huang Xiaopei from Panyu. The first preface was written by Zhang Binglin in the year of Bingwu (Guangxu thirty-two), and there is also a self-preface, titled "The 4,606th Year of the Yellow Emperor's Reign," which shows that the original twenty-nine chapters were written in the first year of Xuantong, only two years before the Wuchang Uprising. Zhang Binglin was also a strong advocate of revolution, so the national consciousness of this book is correct, even without reading it. I remember that when the Republic of China was founded, I was in Wuhu and only ten years old. I saw a kind of thirty-six open narrow oil-slick paper book popular in the neighborhood, a fake Western-style binding, which is the common paperback binding today. The cover was thin green paper, with the three characters "Hong Xiuquan" written in large characters at the top, with three circles drawn in black ink. Below the words, there was also a line drawing. Each book was thin, with only twenty or thirty pages, and it seemed to have at least the first two collections.

However, the current popular edition has been changed to "The Legend of Hong and Yang, the Brave Heroes," and has been increased to one hundred and forty chapters, quadrupling the original book. I think the one hundred and eleven chapters added later, starting from the fifty-fifth chapter, should have been added by the Qing Dynasty remnants, such as the seventy-eighth chapter title, "Hong's Rebellious Monarch and Ministers All Die, the Zeng Brothers are All Showered with Grace." What glaring words! Hong Xiuquan is called a rebel, and Zeng Guofan and others are called "showered with grace," truly turning black and white upside down. After reading it, I felt that the writing of the first fifty-four chapters was also better. For example, the writing of Li Xiucheng's tactics is extremely clever and interesting. It also has a scholarly air, such as the thirtieth chapter, "Shi Dakai Repels Zeng Guofan with Poetry," which uses Shi Dakai's original letter and five original poems. This can be compared with the famous poems added by Mao Zonggang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Ah Ying's A History of Late Qing Novels says: "It is a pity that Huang Xiaopei's Romance of Hong Xiuquan was only completed to the fifty-fourth chapter, and the publication date was after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown."

A careful study of this novel is not only beyond the scope allowed, but I also do not have such time and ability. Jian Youwen and Xie Xingyao are probably the most qualified, because they are experts in the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Jian Youwen wrote "Miscellaneous Records of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and Xie Xingyao wrote "Collected Essays on the History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Other reference materials include Li Xiucheng's confession, Shi Dakai's diary, a collection of poems and essays from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, interesting documents from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (compiled by Liu Fu), unofficial records of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, unofficial history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc. There are truly countless materials, enough to consume several years of researchers' time. In terms of creation, in addition to Romance of Hong Xiuquan, Chen Baiqing in recent times is the most fond of drawing materials from this. I once introduced him to the two experts, Jian and Xie. His "Jintian Village," also known as "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," has been successful on the stage. "The Death of Shi Dakai" does not seem to have been performed yet, perhaps because the tragic atmosphere is too heavy, not in line with the current era of active resistance? Movies and Peking operas have also used historical events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as themes. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss it in detail in the future.

### How to Move These Two Idols Out?

— He Han Zuo

### Talking About "Cold" and "Hot"

— Tie Niu

"Cold" and "Hot" are two absolutely opposite adjectives. What kind of standards are generally used to determine whether they accurately reflect their literal meaning? The answer is: "Cold and hot are standardized through comparison."

Here, we can distinguish the lines of "cold" and "hot": enthusiasm and coldness, warm blood and cold blood, fanaticism and calmness, liveliness and desolation. If we use "life" as an analogy, then children are generally enthusiastic about "games" but indifferent to "love," teenagers are enthusiastic about "love" but indifferent to "games," middle-aged people are enthusiastic about "fame and fortune" but indifferent to "love," and old people are enthusiastic about "comfort and enjoyment" and indifferent to games, love, and fame and fortune.

What China needs now is young people with ardent emotions, holding a crimson heart, valiantly shedding fresh, hot blood, and dedicating everything to the War of Resistance. What China does not need is cold-bloodedness.

"Heat expands and cold contracts" is a law of physics, but it has lost half of its effect in China. In China today, when the flames of the War of Resistance have been ignited in every corner, the people in the rear, no matter how severe and cold the weather is, their enthusiasm for serving their country has reached its peak. Refugees displaced by enemy fire, not wearing cotton clothes and invaded by the biting north wind, can instead encourage the heat of resistance.

Another example is on the front lines: bathing in blood and fighting against the enemy in freezing weather, no matter how cold the weather is, the hearts of the warriors who share the same hatred and fight heroically are boiling with hot blood.

Everyone needs "heat," but too much heat can sometimes cause "cold." If you feel your body is getting hot, so hot that you are sweating profusely, and when you are cold, you are shivering so much that your upper and lower teeth are chattering, this "sudden hot and cold" and "inconstant hot and cold" can determine that you have a "cold and hot disease" and you must quickly ask a doctor for diagnosis and take a few "quinine pills" to drive the "malaria germs" out of the country.

Similarly, certain countries need an enthusiastic and valiant military, and need politicians with calm minds. They have a close connection with each other, otherwise, they will lose the adjustment and neutralization of ""heat"" and ""cold"". If the military is hot, it will rush around; if it is cold, the warriors will be so "tired of war" and "hang themselves". Such "sudden hot and cold" and "inconstant hot and cold" will cause the country's "cold and hot disease". But this cannot be resolved by asking a doctor to diagnose it. The people of the country suffering from "cold and hot disease" must deeply realize that their country is terminally ill, and if they do not quickly rise up to save it, they will inevitably perish together. Then they should unite the masses oppressed by the warlords, raise the great banner of resistance, and eliminate the fascist addiction germs – the warlords – completely.

### Island Trilogy

— Liu Lan

Farewell

Early morning - this metropolis is rubbing its sleepy eyes, there are only a few pedestrians on the street. I dragged my heavy steps, accompanying my friend to the ship. We both seemed to have thousands of words to pour out, but we were both silent, words of encouragement, words of farewell... all swallowed quietly, accumulating in our hearts, like a piece of lead.

"Write from over there," I said.

"Work hard here," my friend said.

Our eyes were a little red, and crystal tears were rolling, but not falling. After saying goodbye to each other, we said goodbye with affection and cruelty.

The thick chimney spewed a burst of black mist into the quiet blue sky, curling up and swirling upwards, gradually dispersing and flowing away, fading. The huge hull has also turned into a small black shadow, finally disappearing from sight. Sailing back to the vast ocean, the free coast, carrying those eager to fight back to the fields of the motherland.

Waddling on the pier, as if searching for my own way. "Another one is gone," I muttered to myself.

Nightmare

The winding and undulating peaks seem to climb forward endlessly, covered with messy thorns and rugged rocks. The steep canyons cut out a long and deep gully, and the gully water plays a sad elegy - mourning those unfortunate people who have stumbled.

The twilight is low, and a mass of black shadows is moving forward slowly - it is a marching guerrilla team, but I don't know whether they are returning in triumph or going to do a night attack. The soldiers are silent and careful on their way. "There is a bottomless abyss under the cliff," people are so vigilant, and all their energy is focused on rushing on their way.

"Ah, yo," the sound followed as a black shadow fell quickly.

"It's Ping!" - my friend's name, I don't know who said it.

"It's Ping?" I asked quickly and surprised.

I woke up in a sweat, opened my eyes, and it was pitch black. It turned out to be a nightmare.

Letter

Clusters of flowing clouds are rushing in the sky. I was just about to ask him for news about my friend, but the postman brought Ping's letter - a lucky man under the devil's hand, but also mixed with a strong bloody smell.

"×, hello, I am living happily" - it seems to be written in response to my nightmare, "We have contacted the enemy twice, none of our brothers died, we killed a total of nine enemies, and obtained a lot of arms and military supplies, I got a yellow woolen coat..."

In my fantasy, I seemed to see a scene of battle: Ping and countless warriors were chasing the fleeing enemy, one dwarf after another fell, and the plaster flag lay lazily on the ground, hugging the cold soil for a boring time. The blue sky, white sun, and red earth are waving on the wilderness.

### Song of Youth

— Zou Yaosheng

In the midst of this great era,

Why do we still sing of sorrow?

Listen, the wind and clouds are also roaring out war songs,

Flying over East Asia and flying to Western Europe.

We must ignite the raging fire in our hearts,

What does hardship and displacement count for?

How can we let the fate of youth,

Be arbitrarily manipulated by evil spirits?

Cut off our ignorant love,

Grasp our iron fists tightly!

Do it! We must seize the eternal determination,

Never raise the weary form of toil;

Everything was never dominated by anyone,

Everything was never controlled by anyone.

No one can endure this dark barbarity,

Remove that ghostly spirit of old age.

The earth-shaking thunder is inspiring our vigilance,

The dazzling lightning illuminates the light of the future;

We must pick up our pace and run wildly!

Grasp the liberation, freedom, and peace tightly.

Break through the rugged long road,

Not afraid of poisonous snakes or fierce tigers,

We must fulfill the mission of youth,

Turn the wheel of the times and transform the ancient and the modern.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

At noon, One-Eyed Li indeed arrived with Xiao Mazi for the banquet. On the surface, he did not bring any guards, but many of his followers who came to respond secretly had already mixed in, mostly lurking in the small teahouse opposite the Township Office. Regiment Commander Ye was in full military uniform, wearing a short sword, and came out to meet One-Eyed Li, and extended his hand wearing white gloves and shook hands with One-Eyed Li, and very courteously invited them to take their seats.

There were not many people at the banquet, only Regiment Commander Ye and Deputy Regiment Commander Liang. This was also prearranged by Regiment Commander Ye, fearing that other people would lack cultivation and reveal clues in their expressions, causing One-Eyed Li to see through them and causing the affair to fail.

The people at this banquet were quite mismatched. Regiment Commander Ye and Deputy Regiment Commander Liang were both regular military officers after all, with an imposing demeanor and heroic spirit. One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi, however, were from the background of salt smugglers and bandits, with wretched appearances and rough manners. However, one thing was the same, both sides had deep wariness.

After Deputy Regiment Commander Liang poured a round of wine on the table, Regiment Commander Ye raised his glass and shined it at One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi. Although the two also raised their glasses in the same way, they seemed to be afraid that the wine was poisoned. You looked at me and I looked at you, and neither dared to drink. Regiment Commander Ye laughed heartily and drank a cup of wine in one breath, put down his cup, and said to One-Eyed Li with a solemn expression:

"Now the national crisis is so severe, the enemy's brutality has destroyed humanity. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. There is only one way out in front of us, and that is to resist the war. We should all not ask about the past, and must work together to implement the National United Front, follow national policy, and desperately resist our national enemies to the end."

As he spoke, his imposing eyes, shining with light, kept scanning the faces of One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi. The two seemed to be a little intimidated, and just nodded repeatedly.

Regiment Commander Ye paused slightly for a while, and then said:

"I also know that your team is very strong, but the most important thing at the moment is unified organization and command. The so-called division is like scattered knives, and unity is strength. Therefore, I hope that your team can join us and cooperate with us, reorganize again, and the supplies and salaries will be the same as ours, and I will definitely not treat you badly. As for the detailed plan for the reorganization, I have prepared it here."

As he spoke, he reached into his military uniform pocket. One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi's faces changed, and they also reached for their waists, but later saw that what Regiment Commander Ye took out was a piece of paper, and then they let go of their minds. (26)

Spring and Autumn

### The Wonderful Use of Astrologers

— Fo

Japanese warlords have always used a kind of anesthetizing means to encourage the people's ambition to invade. Therefore, things like "amulets" and "thousand-person stitches" are their supreme treasures for using Shinto to teach and fool their people. The baseness and stupidity of this method is actually the same as Empress Dowager Cixi's use of the "Boxers" to think that guns and cannons could not enter and knives and fire could not hurt, which is equally ridiculous.

Recently, they even came up with a novel idea and invented a new way to deceive the people. According to a Reuters report yesterday, "Thirty astrologers in Tokyo have organized a guild after being instructed by the police chief, and decided to encourage those who come to ask about their future fortunes to be optimistic during this emergency period of fighting against China." This base and mediocre method is not only ridiculous, but also pitiful. In such a large Tokyo, only thirty fortune tellers are allocated, which may be insufficient. Moreover, the astrologer can lie and fabricate anything to those who come to ask about their future fortunes. Assuming that the people of Tokyo do not come to ask about their future fortunes, then the astrologer's heroism will be useless, and there will be nothing to lie about. What should we do? Here, I can also offer a supplementary method.

As long as the police chief issues an order: (1) All people living in Tokyo must go to an astrologer to ask about their good and bad fortunes. Those who do not go to an astrologer to ask about their good and bad fortunes will be regarded as harboring reactionary thoughts. (2) All people living in Tokyo, regardless of gender, age, or size, must carry a piece of "fortune-telling book," just like the people in our country's guerrilla areas must have a "pass," "smallpox vaccination certificate," and "epidemic prevention certificate." If a person's side or home has no "fortune-telling book," they can be treated as treasonous. In this way, the anti-war thoughts of the Japanese people will have no way to occur and can be fundamentally eradicated. Isn't this a wonderful method?

However, the principle of astrologers is to "ask about disasters, not about blessings." Assuming that the astrologers in Tokyo are as honest as "Zhang Tiekuo" and "Li Tiezui" according to the principles of astrologers, and tell the truth without concealment, I am afraid that all the people in Tokyo will be shaken, and most of the gunpowder stores in Japan will be as dangerous as Osaka. Even if the astrologers can obey the order and imitate the law, since the start of the war, for twenty months, the goods have been expanding day by day, the economy has been shrinking day by day, the population has been decreasing day by day, the number of widows has been increasing day by day, and the "honor" cemeteries of fallen soldiers are everywhere, and the ashes of strong men are continuously transported back from warships. Under these circumstances, I think that even if these astrologers are eloquent and say how wonderful it is, the people in Tokyo will still not be able to believe it? Therefore, this method only shows their hard work and daily ineptitude. From this, I see the boredom of the Japanese warlords and the busyness of their hands and feet.

### Loyalty and Righteousness

— Yan Hua

“Arkansas Traveler”

Paramount production, Cathay Theatre screening

Among the many small films recently shown, we must specifically single out a film like "Loyalty and Righteousness," which is clear, simple, and educational and combative at the same time, to introduce to the readers of this newspaper.

This film can be said to have diverse characteristics:

First, it teaches us how to fight calmly - in the story, the author introduced two very strong and powerful characters through latent enthusiasm, using very vivid strokes: (1) a young man who was afraid of things and avoided them at first, but later became someone who did not avoid reality and knew how to fight against evil forces, although he went through many difficulties and reefs, but in the end, he was victorious: (2) a middle-aged man who handled things calmly and had a plan, he saw the facts very clearly, did not act impulsively, was not sloppy, and fought calmly with steps and order, and as a result, he overcame all difficulties.

Second, the achievements in artistic quality - this story of the "Arkansas Traveler" that expresses a beautiful dramatic form, it is very successful in the writing of the script and the description of the center of the whole play; the reason for its success can be listed in three points: (1) the writing of the script is very compact; it introduces the characters' appearance on the stage very lively and beautifully; (2) the background is a small town in the United States, so it is very simple and full of authenticity; (3) the main characters are very solid and simple; the wanderer whose surname is unknown; the young electrical engineer; the kind mother who knows how to fight; the innocent and young brother; the sister who was once confused by vanity; these four characters, under the author's delicate and lively carving, have given us a very gentle and lovely image.

But the most lovable thing about the whole play, I think, is that the script can echo back and forth. When the young electrical engineer John was preparing to escape, the middle-aged wanderer used the crime of stealing a watch to have the town police arrest him and make him stay in the town to continue fighting; until the end of the whole play, when their radio station was completed and they re-elected the mayor and the newspaper was published as usual, when the wanderer was preparing to quietly leave the town, John also used the crime of stealing a watch to drag the wanderer back; the audience laughed loudly when they saw this.

Third, the director's technique should be inferred - we don't seem to have seen the name of the director of this film; however, he was able to pass on the emotions of the audience in this full of sincere feelings and heat.

I think the director of this film has one of the greatest advantages, that is, he has an unusually strong grasp of the emotional atmosphere. He not only makes people accept the emotions in the play, but also makes us very moved. For example: (1) at the beginning of the construction of the radio station, hundreds of workers were added from the train. They carried various engineering materials, and the workers held torches in their hands. When they passed through the streets, the men and women in their pajamas pushed open the windows, and many quickly ran to the street. The town was disturbed by the construction of this radio station project. In this commotion scene, it contains how much enthusiasm and sympathetic faces - the director expressed the atmosphere and emotions unusually beautifully in these scenes. (2) The radio station was completed, the wanderer, the mother, and John gave speeches, and the listeners in every corner of the town listened excitedly, agitatedly, and quietly to the broadcast; on the radio station, the mother was so moved that she was about to cry; John attacked the local politicians and the mayor (his father) with a fierce speech, and the wanderer made the listeners laugh with a humorous tone. These excellent effects are all the result of the director's excellent and concise picture weaving.

There are four main actors, namely Bob Burns (wanderer), Fay Bainter (mother), John Beal (electrical engineer), Joan Paige (daughter), Dick Moore (brother), all of whom performed skillfully and sincerely.

### Catchphrase

— Geng

Catchphrases are useful everywhere these days, and needed everywhere. If you don't have a catchphrase, or can't think of one, then don't expect to compete or survive in your society. Because of this, catchphrase friends are everywhere; catchphrase stories emerge endlessly. Some catchphrase friends are already born with catchphrases, while others are still desperately trying to come up with them. The catchphrases performed can be worthy of song, or worthy of tears.

The meaning of a catchphrase is novelty. What is called novelty is not falling into old patterns. Therefore, a catchphrase needs to have the condition of transcending thought or action. Having such conditions can express novel thoughts and novel actions. Only by being able to do this can it be moving to hear, and only then can it achieve victory. However, the arrival of a catchphrase not only requires the catchphrase friend to have considerable instinct, but also to coordinate with the requirements of space and time. Otherwise, if you use your catchphrase, people will ignore you, and as a result, the catchphrase is declared a failure, and you collapse along with it. Therefore, clever and skillful catchphrase friends will examine the needs of space and time when thinking of a catchphrase. If they encounter obstacles, they will also create a space and time suitable for the catchphrase. Then, they use the catchphrase for heaven and earth, using the catchphrase for what it is meant to be. From this, we can draw a conclusion. The success of a catchphrase lies in having spatial and temporal attributes; and the failure of a catchphrase lies in the disappearance of its spatial and temporal attributes. It is pitiful for those naive friends who, in order to show their ability and develop their grand plans, exhaust their minds and rack their brains thinking of catchphrases. However, they lack the subjective conditions and deny objective facts, so it is no wonder that they encounter a fate of failure.

Using catchphrases in certain situations, or for certain events, occasionally or accidentally, may not be too reprehensible; but what it induces is the deepening of social paralysis, which is truly terrible. Because catchphrases not only need to win with novelty, but also need to overcome the enemy with stimulation. Constantly showing off novelty and constantly stimulating and enticing will inevitably lead to numbness of the human heart. Therefore, we believe that frequent use of catchphrases in business will promote the decline of credibility; and frequent use of catchphrases in general work will promote the loss of faith in work, leading to a vicious change. For the sake of work and for the sake of career, catchphrases must not be used frequently. Unexpectedly, catchphrase friends are still unwilling to give up their catchphrase policy, and continue to create catchphrases, piling up the current catchphrase society, catchphrase world! It is precisely:

If catchphrases don't die, great disasters won't stop!

### Bees

— Ye Nong

Beekeeping is an inherent industry in our country. In the Han and Jin dynasties, beekeeping methods had already been invented, but due to adhering to old methods and not knowing how to research and improve, the bee species were mixed, the quality was poor, and the honey production was not high. Furthermore, the keepers let them live and die on their own, did not know how to collect and catch escapees, and did not know how to remedy the weak, resulting in no progress for thousands of years, which is truly regrettable!

In European and American countries, beekeeping is regarded as an important industry, and the government vigorously promotes it, with remarkable results. Taking the United States as an example, since actively promoting beekeeping, there are more than one million people raising honeybees, with more than fifteen million hives. The annual honey production is worth more than 80 million US dollars, and the by-product beeswax is also worth more than 4 million US dollars. Looking at our country, with its vast territory, mild climate, and abundant flowers and plants, it is definitely a very suitable place for beekeeping. If it can be widely promoted in the future, it will truly be a very promising industry.

Let's not underestimate bees. Although they are small insects, if we carefully examine the contents of a bee colony, it truly makes us admire them. They can build neat and beautiful hexagonal honeycombs themselves. The queen bee specializes in reproduction, and the worker bees are responsible for external honey collection, cleaning the hive, and raising larvae, so the inside of the hive is very clean. If foreign enemies invade, they will attack in groups. Even if they die piled up, they will continue to fight until the final victory. Bees have very sensitive senses, very brave personalities, and work very diligently. Their organization is orderly, united, and spirited, like a complete social organization. And in many places, humans are probably not even as good as them!

Beekeeping is a very interesting thing. If you do things while beekeeping, as a sideline, as long as there is abundant honey source, if everyone raises four or five colonies, the honey produced each year can also replace imported sugar.

In the past, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in our country produced two types of honey: one is the purple alfalfa honey from Songjiang, and the other is the tallow tree honey from Tongxiang. The former is white in color and can be used for consumption, while the latter is amber in color and can be used as a substitute for sugar. Currently, the candied plums and various candies and biscuits of Shanghai Guanshengyuan mostly use honey, because it is cheap and nutritious.

Before the war, there were also many private beekeeping farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with great scale and complete equipment. The annual honey production was about more than 2,000 dan. Compared with the United States, it is a small sight compared to a large one, but the tens of millions of yuan that our country spends each year on purchasing sugar, which flows abroad, has been invisibly recovered.

After the national army moved west, the bee farms in the guerrilla areas were mostly destroyed by artillery fire. Even the intact ones were stolen, and the bee colonies were lost without a trace. Even if they are restored in the future, the losses will be considerable.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 5: Spring Comes to Bilo, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Filling Lake Li

Zhu Ai'ren smiled and said: "Is our Professor Wu not only a young lady, but also a young master?" Wu Junsu also smiled and said: "Dr. Zhu is nitpicking. I am a case by association, and in fact I was still young at that time and had never been a young lady. But my family has several uncles and aunts who have enjoyed some comfortable days. Anyway, the family's annual income is enough to use. Each year, a certain amount of rent rice is collected from the fields. When the Frost's Descent season arrives, the family opens the warehouse to collect rent rice. The people in the city do not collect rent rice, but convert it into market prices. The people in the countryside will come to the city one after another to pay the rent rice, and this year's income will be considerable. In addition, we also have city houses that are rented out to people, and rent can be collected every month. We also have shops, such as money houses, cloth shops, and sauce gardens, and there are quite a few of them. Roughly these shops can make money, but some make more and some make less. Therefore, the people in our family, whether old or young, do not have to seek any work and can sit at home and eat. Needless to say, the older people, the men smoke opium, and the women play mahjong. The young people should normally study, but it is rare to find a few people who concentrate on their studies. Among them, my father is a person who devotes himself to learning, and my mother is also a high school graduate. In addition, our several uncles, nominally studying at school, are fishing for three days and drying nets for four days. Some don't even go to school. Every day after lunch, they take a very beautiful chartered car—cars were not yet popular in Suzhou at that time—the car bells jingled, and a strong driver pulled the car and rushed to Guanqian Street, which can be regarded as showing off. The most prosperous and lively street in Suzhou City is in front of the Xuanmiao Temple, called Guanqian Street, just like Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Guanqian Street has everything, either watching movies, or drinking tea and listening to books. When returning home, they buy some candies and tea snacks, and invite a few friends to play small cards, and this day is considered to have passed. What the women, like our several aunts, are most concerned about is what kind of clothes are the most fashionable recently, and what kind of hairstyle is the most modern? Everything must follow the example of Shanghai. Shanghai's style is all good. They have nothing to do, so they take a trip to Shanghai, in order to observe what kind of clothing is the most popular in Shanghai. I was still young at that time and didn't pay much attention to anything, but I only heard them discussing long cheongsams and short Manchu robes. Regarding hairstyles, there are also wave styles, airplane styles, and Mrs. Simpson styles, and I simply couldn't understand them. Even I was dressed up by them, wearing a doll-style short skirt, revealing a section of my legs." (May Fourth)

Entertainment Circle

### Southern Film News

— Nie Ge, from Hong Kong

Mr. Zhu Qingxian, the owner of the Nanyue Company, once returned to Hong Kong, and then went to Shanghai. It is heard that this trip was to continue discussing with the Xinhua Company the issue of Hu Die starring in another film after "Rouge Tears." It is also heard that the male lead may be Xue Juexian. One is the leading actress in film, and the other is a well-known star in the South. If it comes true, it will be quite a sensation. However, the issue of the ranking of Hu and Xue is not easy to resolve. Because both of them are famous for a while, who would be willing to be inferior? Some say that Hu Die will be ranked first in the Mandarin copy, while Xue will be ranked first in the Cantonese copy. This is also a compromise.

Chi Mingyou, the former general manager of Lianhua Company, and Li Minwei, the former director of Lianhua Factory, jointly founded the Zhenguang Film Company with the bishop of the Hong Kong Chinese Church, specializing in producing religious films that promote the greatness of God. However, the church insisted that each film must be 100% religious propaganda quality, which is difficult to gain public interest. They proposed the opinion of half entertainment and half propaganda, but it was opposed by the church, and the matter was deadlocked. Luo Nai and Li reorganized the International Film Company, hiring the famous director Fei Mu as a screenwriter and director. The first film is scheduled to be "The Cry of Humanity," which also contains religious flavor. It is said that Luo has recently converted to Christianity and goes to church every week to sincerely worship. Fei's thoughts have also been influenced. "The Cry of Humanity" is planned to be filmed in English, but the capital is still a problem, so the date of filming has not been decided.

Since Lin Shusen came on stage, the full version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" performed on the third night was the most popular. Before 7 o'clock, the entire theater was full. Lin alone played the three roles of Lu Su, Kong Ming, and Guan Gong, extremely hard. On that night, many people from the Hong Kong and Chinese opera and film circles also came. Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing specially sent a horizontal plaque with the words "True Spirit of National Defense Drama" written on it. There were also many others who sent flower baskets and horizontal plaques. Lin once entertained the Hong Kong press. A reporter asked him about his impressions of coming to Hong Kong. Lin replied: "This time I came to Hong Kong purely because of the warm invitation of old friends, which I could not refuse. But since I am here, I should stand on my own position and perform more meaningful historical dramas. I think this is not only in today's troubled times, but also in times of peace, we should move forward... After the performance, I plan to go to Singapore, Little Luzon and other places, because there are very few opportunities for Peking opera to be performed overseas, so this time I am determined to go overseas and use the warning function of drama to achieve publicity effectiveness."

The Yihua Company's historical film "Chu Overlord" has had good business since it was shown at the Entertainment Theater from the first to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year. Recently, the seats for Mandarin films in Hong Kong have often exceeded those for Cantonese films. Because there are many people from other provinces staying in Hong Kong, Cantonese films are restricted by language, and foreign films may not be liked. There are many theaters in Hong Kong Entertainment City, so when a Mandarin film comes, everyone flocks to it.

The film industry in South China has also recently become popular in shooting Mandarin films, or shooting Cantonese copies in addition to Cantonese, or re-dubbing Cantonese films into Mandarin, planning to seek a way out in Shanghai. However, the price difference between Hong Kong dollars and national currency is almost double. With the cost of Hong Kong dollars, the tax revenue for each film shipped to Shanghai is about a thousand yuan, so it is still uncertain whether it is cost-effective. Currently, it is all experimental in nature. The Mandarin film "A Generation of Femme Fatale," starring Li Li, cost about 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is slightly less than 40,000 national currency. The purpose of the film is to seek the business market in Shanghai. Zhang Weitao, the agent of the film's distribution affairs (also the Hong Kong distribution representative of Xinhua, Yihua and other companies), made a special trip to Shanghai to negotiate the screening of the film in Shanghai. The Lianyi Company expects the revenue of the film in Shanghai alone to be 30,000 national currency, but it is still uncertain whether it can be fulfilled.

A company in Shanghai recently sent a letter urging Li Zhuozhuo and Zhang Yi to return to Shanghai to make films, but Li and Zhang have no intention of leaving Hong Kong. Because the weather here is mild, and they are now only wearing thin jackets (Cantonese people are already wearing single cloth clothes and trousers), and the swimming season is coming soon (in fact, there are many swimmers in Hong Kong even in winter). Li and Zhang are both fond of this. Anyway, they have a lot of savings. Even if there are no plays to film in Hong Kong, the living expenses for two or three years are not a problem, so they are all happy and don't want to return to Shu.

Hollywood newcomer Corinne Calvet is said to have the strange habit of not wearing a hat and is recently playing a major role in the new "Prison Without Bats."

### New Year's Trends of Famous Peking Opera Singers in the Old Capital (Part 1)

During the Lunar New Year in the Peking opera circle of the old capital, the atmosphere of embellishing peace is no less than that of the isolated island. Therefore, the trends of each famous singer are described separately below, so that we can see a general picture.

Xun Huisheng has been performing in the Chang'an and Qingle theaters since the Spring Festival. In addition to his son Xun Lingxiang (also works in the Huashan role, inheriting his father's mantle) performing on the same stage, the entire class of famous actors includes Xu Deyi, Jin Hongkui, Lin Qiuwen, Chen Xixing, He Peihua, Wang Wenyuan, and more than sixty others. Recently, on the ninth day of the first lunar month, he performed "Flower Field Wrong Marriage" and "Three Mothers Teaching the Son" at Chang'an. On the tenth day of the first lunar month, he performed "The Complete Du Shiniang" and "Touring the Dragon and Teasing the Phoenix" at Qingle.

Cheng Yanqiu

On the evening of the Lunar New Year's Day, he performed "Part of the Beauty Trick" (Ganlu Temple, Returning to Jingzhou, Reed Flower Marsh) at Xinxin. The entire cast of supporting roles included Wang Shaolou, Zhong Mingqi, Gu Juesun, Lin Qiuwen, Zhu Guifang, Cao Ergeng, Su Lianzhang, Sun Futing, Zhang Chunyan, Ji Yanfen, Li Debin, Wu Fuqin, Zhong Xijiu, and Ci Ruiquan. After that, he did not continue to perform.

Shang Xiaoyun

He did not perform during the Spring Festival this year. He himself held a banquet for guests for his fortieth birthday last winter, which was a grand occasion for a while. Therefore, newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have published his thank-you notices in recent days, which reads: "I am ashamed of my youth. The beautiful scenery is easily thrown away. Wine and joy entertain guests. Old travels are elegant gatherings. The court is full of brocade and embroidery. The face is praised and encouraged. The eyes are full of gifts. Rare treasures are arranged. Praise is given in writing. Calligraphy and paintings are all from famous people. The favor is more constant. Huanwei seal script. Xiaoyun's half-life art. Does not compensate for the fleeting time. Forty years of time. Only increases the age. Listening to the New Year's Eve drums tomorrow morning. Unforgettable the Buddha Bathing auspicious day. Facing the spring breeze in the four seats. Still wishing the governor a long life. Especially respectful thanks. Respectfully wish you all the best. I hope you will show your concern. Shang Xiaoyun bows."

Tan Fuying

After returning to Ping from Guandi the previous year, he performed in various theaters one after another. On the evening of the New Year's Day of the God of Wealth, he performed his Tan opera masterpiece "Losing Jieting" (Kongming sits in the tent and tearfully beheads Su) at Qingle, which was specially requested by the business community. In the previous show, there were also "Cosmic Peak," "Baisuitan," and "Satisfied Fate." The cast of supporting roles included Chen Lifang, Yang Shengchun, Jiang Miaoxiang, and more than fifty others.

Li Shaochun

After his father Li Guichun (Xiaodazi) finished performing at the Tianjin China Grand Theater and came to Ping, he was introduced by a gentleman from Shanghai and became a disciple of Yu Shuyan. Once he ascended the dragon gate, his reputation soared. He has repeatedly offered monkey operas to the world, and is quite able to compete with Li Wanchun. His cast of supporting roles included Shen Kunhua, Gao Weilian, and more than sixty others. I can't list them all.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Peking Opera in the Old Capital (122)

The Secret Story of Jingzhong Temple Being Occupied by Incense Taoists

After Chang Geng, Liu Gansan, Yu Jusheng, Tan Xinpei and others successively took over as the head of the temple, they still followed the rules and regulations set by the big boss, and there was not much change. However, the temple's property has increased a lot compared to before. After the Republic of China, the head of the temple was renamed the President of the Peking Opera Guild. Lao Tan and others passed away one after another, and among the older generation, only Xiaolou, Yaoqing, and Fengqing were more well-known. Later, the Shenghang declined, and the four famous Dan became more powerful. Master Shang (Xiaoyun), who had a desire for leadership, cultivated personal labor, and there was also a capable qin master named Zhao Yankui (Zhao Si), who helped him devise plans and win over the predecessors of the industry. At the same time, Xiaoyun was really able to help the poor and the needy, and sometimes even pawned things to help the poor and old colleagues. Therefore, when electing the president, he was always re-elected. It is said that the most powerful people who secretly helped Xiaoyun's activities and took the opportunity to break up the unity of the acting world were the incense Taoist masters and disciples of Jingzhong Temple. As the saying goes, "When the snipe and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits." It turned out that Jiao Laodao, who guarded the temple, and his second disciple He, had long harbored the ambition to seize the temple property. In the past, because the heads of the temple would often come to the temple to inspect it and handle things very seriously, they did not dare to think about it. Since the Republic of China, people like Lao Tan have had very deep hobbies and get up late, so they have no free time to manage these trivial matters outside of themselves. From then on, people rarely visited the temple. Whenever there were festivals or major events, Jiao Laodao and his disciples would report to a few heads of the acting industry separately, and that was it. When the Peking Opera Guild was officially established, a new address was built on Cherry Diagonal Street, with offices for various departments inside. From then on, whenever there were matters to discuss, they would come here. Jiao Laodao had plenty of money, so he took some out to make friends in the officialdom, widely recruited disciples (An Qing disciples), and hired a Donghong teacher for his second disciple, He. When there was nothing to do, he would often talk about opera and report some news from the acting industry. Although the name of Xiaolao He was often seen in the Qunqiang and Shishi Baihua newspapers, he actually couldn't recognize a few words, and it was all written by others. Year after year, he was actually considered a member of the Ping opera circle in Beiping. How dare the actors treat them as incense Taoists? They even have a good trick, which is to become dry relatives with whatever role is popular. When Chang Maliang's reputation soared a few years ago, Jiao Laodao accepted him as his godson. No matter where Lianliang lived and performed in Tianjin and Han, Laodao always followed him, providing travel expenses himself.

### Qian Qian's Room Drama Talk

— Xiao Cang

Nowadays, when people talk about Huashan, they must mention Wang Yaoqing as the master of a generation. Yaoqing has dozens of students, especially Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, who are the most proud of him. In his later years, Yaoqing was plagued by his voice, and his situation was not good. He had to use his artistic skills to instruct the younger generation, and he was able to teach according to their aptitude, adapt to their nature, and patiently guide them. Lanfang and Yanqiu, although not completely taught by Yaoqing, were able to develop their own personalities, gradually progress, and move forward, creating today's status. It is worth praising that Lanfang and Yanqiu have worked hard on their own. It is also not impossible to say that the two Mes and Cheng have today's achievements due to Yaoqing's support. Speaking of the strengths of the two Mes and Cheng, Mei's performance is deeply studied, with delicate and appropriate touches, and the singing is clear, soft, and wide, bright and pure, without losing the palace tone, gentle and lovely, sweet and refreshing, and charming. However, it lacks a rigid tone. The singing makes people love it, makes people happy, but it alone cannot make people surprised. The clear and moving white mouth is the most resonant, and insiders say that his dubbing is also in the Gongzi tune, and he is the only one in the country. Yanqiu is known for his dignified, quiet, and skilled attitude, his melodious and tortuous singing, and his restrained expression, without any frivolous attitude. Cheng's singing is best at tragedy. His singing is melancholy, choked, sad, and heartbreaking, and can make people cry. Therefore, those who love to listen to new tunes and study tunes like to listen to Cheng's tunes. However, Cheng's tune is too sad and is not really a palace tone. Cheng himself is well aware of this point. The singing of the two Mes and Cheng can be said to have their own strengths. In terms of tone, Mei is better. In terms of tune, Cheng is good at creating new sounds alone. We don't have to force ourselves to distinguish between superiority and inferiority. Lanfang has been worthy of the title of pride of the Peking opera circle from the early Republic of China to today. Yanqiu followed suit and was able to draw his sword and establish his own banner. Nowadays, those who learn Huashan, either enter Mei or enter Cheng. Even if there are those who follow other schools, what they reveal must also contain some components of Mei and Cheng. There is no doubt about it. Among the Kun Dan, Xue Yanqin can be regarded as the one who learns Mei the most (she also extracts the strengths of Huisheng and Xiaoyun), and her swordsmanship and Hua Dan are also far above those of Eyun and Youqin. She is also the chief among Kun Dan. The one who learns Cheng is Xin Yanqiu. As for the others who combine the strengths of the two Mes and Cheng and take them for their own, it should be Zhang Eyun. Zhang Ling is proficient in both the old and new tunes of Mei and Cheng, and his dubbing follows Wan Hua, and his body movements follow both Mei and Cheng. His eyes are expressive of his feelings, and he follows Cheng's method. His water sleeves are very good, and the stability of running around the arena and the cushion behind him are indeed real skills that others cannot match. In the past, Eyun mostly used Wanhua as a model. Since Yan Mutiefen became the qin master, his singing and expression have changed to the Cheng school. Today, when talking about Kun Ling Dan, we have to recommend Eyun as the first. Eyun gets the two words "quiet and skilled," while Xin Yanqiu gets the two words "show and escape," which others cannot achieve.

### Film Snippets

— Fang Lin

According to a letter from a friend in Hong Kong, Lin Shusen's performance in Hong Kong was very popular, especially the Guan Gong play, which was the most popular. Xue Juexian of Nanyue Company plans to hire Lin to shoot a costume film of Guan Gong. It is said that Lin has agreed, and the terms of both parties have been negotiated. If so, the living Guan Gong on the silver screen will definitely cause a sensation.

The Chang and Company of the Carlton Theater Authority plans to shoot a film "Empress Dowager Cixi" and "Wen Suchen." The heroine of "Empress Dowager Cixi" has been decided as Jin Suqin, and "Wen Suchen" will be played by Jin Suwen. Everything is currently being prepared.

Yan Yuexian, who has been out of the film circle for a long time, went to Hong Kong to avoid the war after the August 13 Incident. Recently, she has returned to the film circle and has signed a contract with Guohua Film Company to play the leading role in Zhang Shichuan's "Night Pearl."

Chess News: We recently received letters from readers stating that various arts have places for learning, but the art of chess alone is lacking, which is regrettable. Since chess is one of the national quintessences, it is requested that methods be found to promote popularization and teaching, etc. We believe that teaching chess is not easy (because the teaching methods do not have a fixed scope). It all depends on the instructor having a kind of mysterious guidance that enables the students to understand implicitly before it is effective. Therefore, teaching is extremely difficult. If one is not both knowledgeable and excellent, it is difficult to have a good attraction. Therefore, when teaching, one must first examine the psychology of the students, and then provide separate guidance in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. We have received many letters from all walks of life urging us to establish the Yiyuan Correspondence Chess School with several like-minded people. Detailed rules are available. A stamped self-addressed envelope (two cents postage) should be enclosed with the request. Enrollment begins immediately.
