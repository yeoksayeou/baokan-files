(Rome) The Italian newspaper *Giornale d'Italia*, a semi-official organ, recently commented on the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, stating that, in terms of the development of Japan and the general situation in the Far East, Hainan Island occupies a very important strategic position. If the island is used to build naval and military bases, the military importance of Hong Kong Island will be completely lost, the French lease of Guangzhou Bay will be isolated, French Vietnam will face a direct threat, and the importance of the British naval base in Singapore will also be offset. Even if Japan has no intention of building naval and military bases at present, if the United States builds defenses in Guam, Britain in the northeast of Singapore, and France in Vietnam, then Japan will certainly not be willing to lag behind. It can be asserted that the democratic countries have suffered a blow in the Far East, and the situation in mainland Europe and the Mediterranean has also been affected. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)

On the morning of that day, over five hundred Japanese troops suddenly attacked from Baijiazhuang, north of the county seat. Since there were no heavy Chinese troops stationed there, the defense was weak, and the county seat fell at noon. However, Chinese troops arrived in the evening and launched a fierce counterattack, storming into the city in one fell swoop. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and fought back in separate directions. After three hand-to-hand combats, the Japanese troops suffered over two hundred casualties and fled north, leaving corpses everywhere. Chinese troops recaptured Shenze and pursued the remaining Japanese troops to Baijiazhuang before returning to their camp. (Dispatch, 24th)

(Hong Kong) Chen Cheng telegraphed a Chinese source in Hong Kong yesterday, stating that the Chongqing dispatch by Reuters on the 9th of this month, which mentioned that political figures were discussing the resolution of Sino-Japanese peace talks in an international conference in the Far East, and that if the European situation adopted a compromise policy, the international community might exert pressure to force China and Japan to hold negotiations and end the war, was completely untrue and was simply a fabrication by the reporter, which should not be believed. The Hong Kong rumors of third-party mediation are also fictitious. Our resistance to save the country will be carried through to the end. (Special Dispatch, 24th)

However, the Chinese side saw through their trick and set up an ambush. The Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on the 21st, and Chinese ambush troops killed many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese troops, believing that Yangloudong was not worth defending for long, have moved to a certain place nearby and are launching surprise attacks from time to time, making it difficult for the Japanese troops to have a moment of peace.

### Japanese Warships Repeatedly Harass Haimen, Charging into the Blockade Line and Firing Guns; Retreating After Being Counterattacked by Chinese Troops

(Ningbo) Around 3:00 PM on the 15th, three Japanese warships sailed to Haimen and anchored offshore, dispatching three or four motorboats to patrol along the coast and measure the depth of the waterway. In the evening, they used searchlights to illuminate the shore. The Haimen defense forces immediately deployed defenses, declared martial law, and prepared to fight back. Residents also evacuated on their own. By the morning of the 16th, two Japanese boats ventured to attack the Baisha blockade line at the mouth of Haimen and measure the water level. Chinese troops defended the country and added artillery fire, firing two cannons. The Japanese boats hurriedly fled back, and the Japanese warships also left. On the evening of the 17th, eight Japanese warships gathered again, colluded with bandits, and set fires on the north bank. The Chinese garrison maintained a strict defense along the coast. Five ships sailed towards the mouth of the Jiaojiang River, leaving three ships anchored outside the blockade line. At 3:00 PM, two of the Japanese warships loaded with Japanese soldiers charged into the blockade line and fired guns at the shore. The Chinese garrison fought back bravely, and the battle was fierce. Finally, due to the strong strength of the Chinese troops and the solid fortifications, the Japanese warships withdrew from the blockade line at 7:00 PM and fled north, and Haimen was slightly more stable. On the same morning, two Japanese warships also arrived in Dinghai and fired artillery towards Daotou, firing a total of eighty-one cannons, all of which were fired indiscriminately. The Chinese suffered no losses. The Japanese warships harassing Haimen completely sailed away from Taizhou Bay on the 19th. On the 20th, seven Japanese warships sailed to the mouth of the Jiaojiang River again. One transport ship charged into the Haimen blockade line again and fired guns at the shore. The Chinese defenders still dealt with it calmly, and the ships left only when the tide receded. (Dispatch, 23rd)

Editorial

### Refugee Production

Yesterday, we discussed the problem of refugee education. Today, we continue to discuss the problem of refugee production.

What, exactly, distinguishes a refugee from a non-refugee? Not gender, age, origin, strength, intelligence, virtue or lack thereof; of the same race, of the same era, encountering the same national crisis, impacted by the same war; in all respects, there is no difference. There is only a single characteristic: inability to support oneself. Because of the war, they have lost their original means of livelihood: farmers cannot till their land, merchants see capital, goods, and shops all destroyed, workers have lost tools and factories, ordinary families have suffered casualties of those who maintained the household; and thus, unable to live, they require relief, which is what makes them refugees.

Having identified the characteristic of refugees, and having confirmed that aside from this characteristic, there is no difference between them and non-refugees, one can understand that the so-called problem of refugee production is almost entirely the same as the so-called refugee problem. In other words, they have become refugees because they are unable to produce; as long as they are able to produce and live, they are not refugees, and society has no refugee problem. But this is easier said than done!

To enable tens of thousands of people to produce and live is, of course, extremely difficult. Though knowing its difficulty, it is necessary to find a way to resolve all or part of the issue. On one hand, consider the refugees: for the sake of prolonged resistance, one cannot but assume that the war will continue indefinitely. When will refugees be able to return to their hometowns? When will they be able to return to their former occupations? This is a question that cannot be answered at this time. If refugees continue to depend on others for their livelihood, it is not conducive to their self-respect; if they continue to sit idle without working, it is not conducive to their physical health; if they continue to be confined to shelters, it is not conducive to their mental health; if they continue to be estranged from work skills, it is not conducive to their instincts; if they continue to get only enough to eat, it is not conducive to their nutrition. Therefore, even if relief has no problems and can continue leisurely for three to five years, these various detrimental conditions will render the refugees of three to five years hence, if not patients, then useless! Consider also the social aspects: first, raising funds is not easy, how can it be sustained? Second, the funds raised are simply eaten up and used up, with no harvest or effect, which is too uneconomical. Third, in addition to the unproductive consumption, time and manpower must also be expended to deal with the management of the unproductive. Fourth, heartfelt compassion in relieving suffering, but instead gradually turns refugees into patients and wastelands, which is a disservice to the refugees. Fifth, after providing relief for a considerable period of time, once the war ends, it is hopeless for tens of thousands of people to suddenly find a place for themselves. The question is, will they be cared for or not? So on and so forth, there is no end to the list. There is no doubt that a negative conclusion can be reached: providing relief to refugees while barely solving their current problems of food, clothing, and shelter is unacceptable. There is also no doubt that a positive conclusion can be reached: helping refugees participate in the productive work of society is the reasonable, economical, and beneficial way to benefit the refugees and contribute to society in one stroke.

This is not irresponsible grandstanding. Nor is it fault-finding with relief agencies, demanding perfection, disregarding factual difficulties, and seeking only to speak glibly. On the contrary, the refugee problem is a public problem for society, not just a problem for relief agencies. Society should bear full responsibility for it, and it should not be entrusted solely to relief agencies. For nineteen months, the problems of food, clothing, and shelter for ten, or even more than ten, thousands of people have not been considered small or easy. Relief agencies have planned and coped with these problems, which is to say that relief agencies have already done right by the refugees and by society. Society should be grateful for the hard work of the relief agencies, and no one should criticize them further. It must be understood that relief agencies only take care of the refugees' food, clothing, and shelter, not because the relief agencies are not working hard to move towards more proactive measures, but because society is not contributing enough to enable the relief agencies to take proactive measures to solve the problem of refugee production.

Helping refugees participate in the productive work of society is a fact, not a theory; it is individual, not wholesale; it can only be advanced gradually and cannot be solved readily. Therefore, empty talk on paper and so-called plans, building carts behind closed doors and so-called solutions, are merely useless waste. But since the so-called refugee problem is not solved by merely solving the current problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and since proactive measures cannot be separated from facts, the only hope is that relief agencies will painstakingly draft refugee production plans. It is especially hoped that society will unanimously recognize the absolute necessity of enabling refugees to participate in the productive work of society, and that everyone will do their best to support the relief agencies so that the production plans can be fully implemented. This is the way to benefit the refugees, the way for society to solve the refugee problem, and the way to contribute directly and indirectly to the resistance and nation-building, starting from the refugees!

### The Japanese Army Can Never Conquer Shanxi: Five Attacks on Mount Wutai Have All Failed; The Eighth Route Army Organizes the People, Who Are All Willing to Fight for the Nation

(Chongqing) Former Wuhan Central China University professor, the American Mr. Foster, has been participating in the medical work of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi since September of last year. According to his statement to the Associated Press reporter, the Japanese army can never conquer Shanxi because the Eighth Route Army has organized the people in various places very firmly. He said that the Japanese army has apparently never controlled Shanxi. The recent Japanese attack on Mount Wutai has been the fifth since the beginning of the war, and each time it has been recaptured by Chinese troops. The Eighth Route Army is not afraid of this at all. They organize the people, pay the full value for whatever they buy, and treat the people well. They are excellent propagandists. As a result, the people are all willing to fight for their families. I have seen Chinese people wearing blue cloth long gowns carrying a few guns and going to the front line. They often say, "We are going to fight the Japanese." When I came from Yuanqu, I saw eight thousand Chinese soldiers running through the mountains to the front line because the Japanese army was attacking. The rifles, ammunition, and some of the machine guns of these Chinese troops are all excellent, mostly seized from the Japanese army. The Eighth Route Army's procedure for training the people's defense forces has three points: first, mountain climbing exercises; second, shooting practice; and third, political and patriotic education. The mayor of Liaozhou, who is 25 years old, leads the people's defense forces in mountain climbing exercises every morning from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM. This is rare among mayors in China. The purpose of this exercise is to train the people for guerrilla warfare and to forge endurance for long marches, which surprises the Japanese garrison. The people behind the Japanese front lines live as usual, and the shops are open as usual, but they are prepared to flee when the Japanese army comes. Many of the local puppets in charge fight the Japanese army at night and return to their posts during the day. Zhu De once said, "I hope the Japanese army will advance further into the interior of Shanxi because it is extremely difficult to fight the Japanese army along the railway." Zhu De likes to walk on the streets with soldiers and play volleyball. Zhu De's headquarters has a large library, which is surprising to see. The living conditions of the people in Shanxi are excellent because they are reducing rent. (Associated Press Dispatch, 24th)

### Chinese Troops Once Recaptured Wuxue

Zhongxiang Taking advantage of the Japanese troops' unsettled deployment, the Chinese Hubei-Eastern guerrilla forces launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops along the river, using the opportunity of the old lunar New Year. They successively recaptured Longping, Wuxue, and Tianjia Town, and also attacked Qichun East Gate. Except for the Japanese troops in Longping, who were completely annihilated by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops in Wuxue and Tianjia Town suffered heavy casualties, totaling no less than a thousand. More of their military supplies were either burned or seized by Chinese troops. Now, the heroic guerrilla forces that recaptured Wuxue, Longping, and other places have voluntarily withdrawn to avoid the sacrifice of being shelled by the Japanese navy. However, the Yangcheng Mountains are still under Chinese control. Over five hundred Japanese troops in Huang'an, accompanied by two cannons, recently suddenly attacked north and occupied Zhou Qijia, which belongs to Huarqi Village. The Chinese guerrillas fought with them, and the Japanese troops burned and killed the people of the village out of anger. (Dispatch, 23rd)

They are now fighting the Japanese army southwest of Fangshan. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

### Japanese Troops Are Blocked in the Four Suburbs of Tianmen

Zhongxiang Since Tianmen was abandoned recently on the Hanyi Road, the war situation seems to have become tense. In fact, this move by the Japanese troops is still a disruptive move, a show of force, and has other plans. The Japanese troops are all blocked in the four suburbs of Tianmen, and a Chinese army unit is confronting over two hundred Japanese troops in the Daijia River area, southeast of Longquan Town. There is no change in the front of Sui County. (Dispatch, 24th)

(Yichang) The Japanese troops who occupied Tianmen are now conducting a large-scale search in the city to guard against Chinese guerrillas. In fact, the Chinese guerrillas have already occupied important strongholds in the four suburbs and can threaten the Japanese army at any time. (Dispatch, 24th)

### Japanese Attack Xiao County

(Huaiyin) The Kodama unit of the Japanese troops on the Jinpu Railway attacked Xiao County on the 5th of this month. The Chinese troops dealt with them calmly. Due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire, County Chief Peng led his troops to temporarily withdraw. After reorganizing the troops for several days, they returned to the county and were combined with various civilian anti-Japanese troops. At dawn on the 17th, they launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops in Gushan and are now in a stalemate with the Japanese troops. (Dispatch, 24th)

### Lanzhou Shoots Down Japanese Aircraft: Location of Crash Confirmed

(Chongqing) The General Headquarters of the Chinese Air Force announced that thirty-eight Japanese bombers took off from Yuncheng in southern Shanxi yesterday morning and flew to Gansu in three teams. After bombing Pingliang, the first and second teams continued to fly west towards Lanzhou, but after being intercepted by Chinese fighter planes, they returned east. The third team, consisting of twenty bombers, flew to Lanzhou in the early afternoon and was immediately surrounded by Chinese fighter planes from all sides, and a fierce air battle broke out. Before long, the fuel tank of a Japanese bomber was hit and immediately caught fire, crashing into Mount Wuchuan (transliteration). After bombing the southern and northern suburbs of Lanzhou, the other Japanese aircraft flew east and returned. Chinese fighter planes pursued them to Dingxi. According to current knowledge, a total of six Japanese bombers were shot down, one crashing into Mount Wuchuan, two into Daohe, and three into Dingxi. Although the Japanese bombing destroyed two hundred houses, there were only thirty casualties. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

### Japan Plans to Blockade Tianjin Concessions Again

(Hong Kong) Tashiro, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, visited the French Consul-General Li Bili and British Consul Harperty on the evening of the 22nd, hoping they would pay attention to the activities of anti-Japanese elements in the concessions. He also threatened that if the concession authorities were unable to do so, the Japanese side would automatically take measures to deal with it. Japan's actions in Tianjin seem to echo those in Shanghai. In recent days, preparations have been made for a second inspection, and another blockade is possible. Since the 22nd, the Japanese side has added electric fences to the roads surrounding the concessions originally under repair, and at the intersections with the British and French concessions, earth bags and iron fences will also be restored.

### Full Text of Two Major Proposals from the National参政会: Enacting the National Anti-Enemy Covenant, Establishing a Democratic Political System

(Chongqing) The Fifth Session of the National Political Council passed the proposal initiated by Councilor Tao Baichuan and 25 others, requesting the government to lead the people in holding a "National Anti-Enemy Covenant" swearing ceremony to cultivate the spirit of resistance and unleash the power of resistance. The full text is recorded below:

National Anti-Enemy Covenant

(1) Purpose, Spirit, and Relationship to the War of Resistance: Speaker Jiang spoke very clearly in his opening remarks at this conference, "In the first phase of the War of Resistance, spirit and matter were equally important. In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of matter. To unleash the power of resistance, we must not only invigorate and concentrate our spirit, but also prioritize spirit and use matter for its purpose. We must first enhance the firm and enterprising spirit of the entire nation before we can overcome national difficulties and complete the mission of the War of Resistance." The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the spirit of the people, so that it can produce great and lasting effects. (2) Measures: (1) The National Government should formulate the "National Anti-Enemy Covenant," including the text of the oath and methods of swearing, and issue an order for the entire country to hold the swearing ceremony. (2) Before the swearing ceremony, the government should mobilize people's organizations and schools to conduct extensive publicity to ensure that it is known to every household. (3) The date of the swearing ceremony shall be determined by the central government, and the entire country shall swear on the same day. (4) The swearing ceremony shall be held at the township or baojia level. The township head or baojia shall convene household heads to hold a swearing-in assembly on the specified date. The household head shall swear on behalf of the entire family, young and old, and sign and affix a seal on the covenant. This oath shall be sent by the township head to the county government for record. (5) The full text of the oath and the covenant should be reprinted by the county government and distributed to households, pasted on the walls, fathers admonishing their sons, elder brothers admonishing their younger brothers, wives admonishing their husbands, and relatives and friends admonishing each other to strictly abide by it. (6) If there is any breach of the oath after the swearing ceremony, the people may report it and petition the government to punish the offender according to law. (7) The following is a draft of the oath and the covenant for the government to adopt. (We, in good conscience, swear to abide by the "National Anti-Enemy Covenant," absolutely support the National Government, obey the leadership of Chairman Jiang, and do our best to serve the country. If there is any breach of the oath, we are willing to accept the government's punishment. [Name] swears solemnly.) The attached covenant is as follows: (1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People; (2) Do not violate government laws and regulations; (3) Do not violate the interests of the nation and the people; (4) Do not become traitors or submissive subjects of the enemy; (5) Do not participate in puppet organizations; (6) Do not become officials of the enemy or traitors; (7) Do not guide the enemy and traitors; (8) Do not spy on information for the enemy and traitors; (9) Do not work for the enemy and traitors; (10) Do not use banknotes from enemy and traitor banks; (11) Do not buy enemy goods; (12) Do not sell food and all goods to the enemy and traitors."

Democratic Rule of Law System

The proposal by Councilor Zhou Lan and 50 others requesting the establishment of a democratic political system to lay the foundation for national construction was passed by the Fifth Session. The original text is recorded below: The principle that our politics should be based on democracy and the rule of law to complete national construction is also well known to the people of the country. At this time when the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly favorable and national construction is just beginning, we should particularly temper the spirit of democracy and the rule of law and establish a democratic and rule-of-law system in order to complete the period of political tutelage. We respectfully present the reasons as follows: (1) In our country's political habits, all improvements are usually carried out from top to bottom. Now, not only does the country have unprecedented unity, but also the whole country has a universally respected leader. If we can take advantage of this opportunity for the leader to lay the foundation for democracy and the rule of law and establish a permanent national system, it will be very easy and the effect will be great. This is an opportunity not to be missed. This is the first reason. (2) The establishment of the foundations of democracy and the rule of law requires at least ten to twenty years of effort. The people of the country have been advocating democracy and the rule of law for forty to fifty years, but there has never been a continuous promotion for five years. Now that we have a universally respected leader, we should hurry to make the greatest effort so that in the next ten to twenty years, China can have a solid foundation of democracy and the rule of law and advance to become an ideal modern free country. Time is of the essence. This is the second reason. (3) In the past ten years, our country has made significant progress in politics and military affairs, but this progress has been created by the perseverance of a few people. Whether in politics or economics, the necessary systems have never been established, and the spirit of abiding by the law is not widespread. For the sake of the country's long-term interests, all facilities must be institutionalized as soon as possible. This is the third reason. (4) Our country's modern facilities are becoming increasingly advanced, and the government's power is also expanding day by day. Many things that used to be within the scope of private activities are now handled by the government. If the people's right to participate in politics cannot keep pace with the expansion of government power, it will inevitably lead to an authoritarian state, which will have an extremely adverse impact on the future of the entire nation. Therefore, at this time, we must urgently seek to gradually increase the people's right to participate in politics. This is the fourth reason. (5) The major countries of the world are forming two major blocs of democracy and non-democracy. Even British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems unable to prevent the formation of these two major blocs. If we can strive to establish the initial foundations of a democratic political system at this time, then those of the same mind and heart will strengthen the democratic bloc, which will not only enhance the sympathy and assistance for our War of Resistance, but also seek common ground for world peace. This is the fifth reason. (6) The sense of responsibility of public officials at all levels must be enlightened before it can be automatically brought into play. Therefore, how to make public officials accountable depends on the political atmosphere, and especially on how those in high positions make them accountable. As for the rule of law, we must first have a spirit of abiding by the law. Abiding by the law should be a consistent habit of both superiors and subordinates, and senior officials in positions of power should particularly lead by example. Accountability is the foundation of democratic governance, and abiding by the law is the prerequisite for the rule of law. Both of these need to be cultivated as soon as possible. This is the sixth reason. Based on the above reasons, we respectfully make the following suggestions: (1) Government actions should be legalized. Since our country takes the rule of law as an ideal goal, all future government actions must be absolutely based on current effective laws. If actions and laws are separate, then the law will not be enough to show good faith to superiors and subordinates, and it will not be possible to cultivate the habit of abiding by the law. After all laws are established and promulgated by legal organs and legal procedures, before the law is formally amended, relevant government actions should take it as a guide and should not violate, ignore, or distort it for the sake of temporary personal convenience. (2) Government facilities should be institutionalized. Our country is currently in a period of reform, and many of the actual political and economic systems are not yet in place. In the past, all facilities, such as personnel employment, have been transferred with the change of the chief officer in charge, resulting in no fixed rules for affairs, no fixed positions for officials, unclear responsibilities, and unclear systems. If the chief officer trusts them, they can be allowed to overstep their authority; if the chief officer has no dispute with them, they can simply seek sustenance. This is the old system of the imperial court, not the civil service system of a modern country. This is a time of human governance, not a permanent rule of law. This trend is enough to foster flattery, but not enough to cultivate a sense of responsibility. Therefore, all future government facilities must be institutionalized so that the entire organization of the government becomes a sound function. Once launched, all departments can exert their greatest and best functions, making this entire function conform to the principles of modern government administration. The following are some important reforms that should be carried out in relation to the system: (A) The civil service system must be established. National employment must be based on talent as the standard, so that the wise are in position and the capable are in office. Historically, personnel employment in our country's officialdom has often been based on personal relationships. The promotion and demotion of personnel is based on the preferences of the chief officer. This is a long-standing practice for thousands of years. Now it has been greatly corrected, but it is still far from being completely eliminated. In addition to this, it seems that there is nothing more important than implementing the civil service system in all departments. After this system is universally implemented, it can not only limit abuse of power in a passive way, but also promote fairness and encourage talent in an active way. This is the great way to bring people into orbit. (B) The powers and responsibilities of public officials must be clearly defined. In today's political circles in our country, public officials either have power without responsibility or have responsibility without power. As a result, often no one is responsible for anything, and there is no way to hold someone responsible. In the future, powers and responsibilities should be clearly delineated, so that those with real power must have their powers and responsibilities in accordance with their position. Then everyone can do their best, and the responsibility for success or failure will also be clear. (C) The organizational system must be clear. One matter should not be entrusted to several organs for execution. Otherwise, no one will be willing to take full responsibility, be able to take full responsibility, or even conflict with each other, and nothing will be accomplished. Moreover, many Chinese government agencies act independently and have little connection with each other. If something must be done in cooperation with other agencies, it is often impossible to obtain the necessary cooperation. Therefore, the relationship between the various agencies must be clarified in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. The government system should be democratized. The fact that our country's politics should be based on democracy is a consistent demand of both superiors and subordinates. Therefore, what is currently being discussed is not this goal, but how to gradually and steadily achieve this goal. The following is a proposed method: Before our country implements constitutional government, the fact that politics should be guided by the Chinese Nationalist Party and that the government should be organized by the Chinese Nationalist Party has been recognized by the people of the country and should of course not be changed. However, the government organized by the party and guided by the party should still be responsible to the people. If the people legally express dissatisfaction with the government, and the government still cannot find a way to satisfy the people, the party should make corrections or reorganizations based on the severity of the situation. The party should use the existing National Political Council or an improved and strengthened Political Council with more representation of the people as a representative organ, and gradually make it have the power to supervise administration according to law. Are the above suggestions appropriate? We respectfully await a public decision. (Telegraph on the 23rd)

### British Foreign Secretary's Earnest Explanation: Firm Diplomatic Policy, Impeccable Anglo-French Cooperation, Franco-Italian Discord Not to Be Overlooked, Striving to Improve the International Environment

(London) Lord Addison initiated a discussion on Anglo-French relations in the House of Lords today, declaring his welcome for Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement on February 6 that "Anglo-French common interests extend to all aspects. If there is anything that endangers France's important interests, Britain will immediately cooperate." Foreign Secretary Halifax then responded, saying that the Prime Minister's words naturally represent the unanimous opinion of the entire Cabinet. The response of the people to this is also clear evidence of the nation's united feelings. There are now several parties seeking to underestimate or restrict the value of the guarantee of Anglo-French unity offered by the Prime Minister. Such attempts are regrettable, as it is a great mistake to suggest that the Prime Minister's words contain any reservations. It should be known that the Prime Minister's words are very clear and there is no misunderstanding of any differences of opinion between Britain and France. Therefore, in Britain and France, there is no need to declare their unity verbally again. We will soon have the opportunity to express the unity of the two countries practically when we welcome the President of the French Republic to visit. (Great applause). We have had to explain repeatedly in more practical and unambiguous terms what the people of Britain and France have long recognized as true, because of misunderstandings in certain quarters. Our closeness to France is not only due to the geographical relationship between the two countries, but also because of shared interests and mutual understanding. This factor is the best guarantee. There is absolutely no danger that any country will force another to accept its policies. The unity of Britain and France has never been directed against any third party, and the past performance of the two governments and their efforts to maintain peace are sufficient to prove that this is not false. The Foreign Secretary then spoke of the Franco-Italian dispute, saying that in one sense, the Franco-Italian dispute, whatever it may be, is inherently unrelated to Britain, but in another sense, the Franco-Italian dispute is closely related to Britain, because the Anglo-French relationship does not allow Britain to disregard it, and also because Britain is very friendly with Italy and wants to maintain this relationship on the basis of complete goodwill. Now, neither the French nor the Italian government has expressed any hope that a third country will come forward to mediate, so Britain is naturally unable to act as a mediator until both sides have this intention. So far, the Italian government has not formally stated what the so-called Franco-Italian disputes are.

There was a discussion abroad that although the British government advocates peace, there are many people in Britain who advocate war, so the purpose of Britain's military buildup is highly questionable. But anyone must have already admitted that there is no war party in Britain (Cheers). In fact, there is no party or politician in Britain who has ever thought of an aggressive war or could get the support of the people for this policy. Therefore, those abroad who suspect Britain's military buildup are simply showing that they have no understanding of Britain at all.

In addition, there are some people who hold the opposite misconception about Britain. They misunderstand Britain's desire for peace as evidence of British weakness and timidity. This view is also completely wrong and without basis. The responsible leaders of the governments of Europe have repeatedly stated that even if they win a war, they will gain nothing. The people of Britain and France have not forgotten the truth of this statement, so it is not surprising that Britain and France do not approve of using war as an instrument of national policy. The British government sincerely hopes that other governments will have the same mentality and adopt the policy of not using war as an instrument of national policy. He made this statement not to say that the people of Britain and France would never resist with force any action that endangers their lives, independence, or important interests.

The Foreign Secretary went on to verify the remarks made by Hitler in his book "Mein Kampf" regarding Germany's miscalculation of the British people and the British Empire before the war, and said that Britain's strength is still great today, and the spirit of the British people has not changed. We do not want to compete in strength because we believe that war is enough to cause disputes, but not enough to resolve them. We also believe that any problem can be resolved through detailed and frank discussion if it is approached in good faith. What the British government seeks is nothing more than to improve the environment so that many of the problems related to us can be handled. Anyone who knows the minds of the British people should not have the slightest doubt that the British people will uphold their freedom when necessary and will not disgrace the spirit of their forefathers. (Reuters report on the 23rd)

### British Foreign Secretary's Declaration: Clear and Detailed, Welcomed by British and French Newspapers, Severely Criticized by German Newspapers

(London) The speeches made by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the two Houses have now been commented on by various newspapers. The Manchester Guardian stated, "Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons did not seem to be taken seriously by Germany and Italy. Last night, Foreign Secretary Halifax reiterated it in the House of Lords in clear and concise terms, leaving no room for doubt. Although the Italian side does not like to hear these unpleasant words, it would be better if they deeply believe that what they say is not false." The Yorkshire Post (formerly known as the organ newspaper of former Foreign Secretary Eden) stated, "Foreign Secretary Halifax's remarks on Anglo-French relations are very commendable in terms of content and quality. After this solemn declaration, the European continent will no longer ignore Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on the first of this month (i.e., declaring that Britain and France maintain a bond and that if a war occurs in the future, if Britain and France are indeed involved, Britain will provide France with all its forces)." (Havas report on the 24th)

(Paris) The declaration made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Lords was welcomed by various newspapers here, who considered it timely. The Paris Daily News was fortunate that the British authorities were resolute and unyielding. The Republican News stated that the declaration was clear and unmistakable. The Poker News stated that the British Foreign Secretary's remarks were more detailed than those of British Prime Minister Chamberlain. (Reuters report on the 24th)

Berlin German newspapers have fiercely criticized the speech made by British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the House of Lords yesterday. The Local Guidance News stated that this speech should make France feel satisfied, but based on past experience, the establishment of consultations between Britain and France is often used to surround third countries. This newspaper cannot but pay attention to it. The People's Observer stated, "The British government authorities issued bellicose remarks, and the only reason is that France demanded that Britain restate its policy. Judging from Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech, France has already got its wish." (Havas report on the 24th)

### Hungary's Contradiction: Joins the Anti-Communist Group, But Also Bans the National Socialist Party

Capital of Hungary Foreign Minister Csáky completed the signing procedure with the ambassadors of Germany, Italy and Japan at 11:00 a.m. regarding Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Havas report on the 24th)

Capital of Hungary The government issued an order this month to dissolve the Hungarian National Socialist Party. The local police authorities immediately dispatched 600 police officers to search the party's various organs and arrested more than 100 people. It is reported that the party leader, Major Szálasi, was sentenced to three years in prison last July for conspiracy to rebel. After the party's organ newspaper was banned from publishing, it was no longer very active. (Havas report on the 24th)

Capital of Hungary The government ordered the dissolution of the extreme right-wing Hungarian People's Party. It is reported that the bomb attack on the synagogue earlier this month was carried out by this party. (Reuters report on the 24th)

Capital of Hungary The Hungarian Ministry of Interior today ordered the dissolution of the Hungarian National Socialist Party. The party's assets were dissolved from the Hungarian National Socialist Party, and all of the party's assets were confiscated and transferred to public charitable organizations. The party currently has about 200,000 members, with only two members in the Parliament. (Haitong report on the 26th)

### Entire British Army to Hold Major Exercises This Autumn: Testing "Cruiser-Style Tanks," Main Force to March Under Air Raid Threat

(London) The entire British Army is scheduled to hold large-scale exercises in West Yorkshire in August and September of this year. Since the end of the European War in 1918, this is the third time that the entire British headquarters has participated in exercises. All the latest motorized units and armored car units will be operated in accordance with wartime conditions in order to be true. The new weapon that military experts are most concerned about is a new type of medium-sized tank with extremely high speed and thick armor, which can move freely on the most rugged ground and has the elegant name of "cruiser-style tank." After participating in this exercise, it can be tested for its efficiency. According to the experts, the biggest test of this exercise is to quickly transfer the main forces of the British Army from the southwest to Yorkshire under the threat of enemy air raids. According to the exercise procedures, all heavy units, such as heavy artillery units and tank units, will march at night, while light units, such as infantry, cavalry, machine gun units, and motorcycle units, will use "camouflage" methods and march in the daytime under the cover of mobile anti-aircraft artillery units. Another part of the troops and military supplies will be transported by train, and precautions must also be taken against enemy air raids along the way. It is estimated that there will be about 60,000 officers and soldiers participating in this exercise. Certain important figures in the military and political circles even advocate referring to certain continental regiments and ordering reserve officers and soldiers to participate in the exercise together. The government authorities have not yet made a decision on this matter. (Havas on the 24th)

US House of Representatives Passes Pacific Defense Enhancement Bill; Establishment of Air Station on Guam Uniquely Rejected; Senate May Pass It. (Washington)
The House of Representatives today passed the $52,000,000 Vinson Naval Bill by a vote of 38 to 4. Isolationists from both the Democratic and Republican parties joined forces, resulting in the failure of the Guam defense section. The issue of establishing defenses on Guam has been fiercely debated, with some believing that this move would extend the US defense zone too far and may provoke hostility from Japan due to its proximity to Tokyo. Although the Guam proposal failed, the bill passed today has created a strong national defense line for the United States from Alaska, through Midway Island and Wake Island to the Philippines. (23rd AP dispatch)

(Washington)
The bill proposed by Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, which aims to add twelve naval air bases in the Alaskan Peninsula, the Panama Canal area, and the Pacific with a huge sum of $52,000,000, was recently brought up for discussion in the House of Representatives. The amendment proposed by New Jersey Democratic Congressman Suthphin, which would remove the clause on building an airfield on Guam from the original bill, was immediately passed by a vote of 193 to 146. Subsequently, the other clauses of the original bill were passed by an overwhelming majority of 368 to 4. The total cost was also reduced from $52,000,000 to $48,800,000. This bill will now be sent to the Senate for discussion. (23rd Havas dispatch)

　　（華盛頓）
(Washington)
Although the Vinson Bill was passed by the House of Representatives, the clause regarding the construction of an airfield on Guam was removed, which was beyond the expectations of political figures. Government officials commented that at a time when Japan's aggression in the Far East is increasing day by day, the further the first line of defense of the American continent at sea, the better. It is regrettable that the House of Representatives failed to see this point. It is hoped that the Senate will pass the clause on establishing an airfield on Guam when discussing this bill. Some observers in the political world said that the Democratic congressmen who supported the construction of an airfield on Guam placed too much emphasis on the needs of civil aviation, and did not elaborate on the fact that Guam is a necessary base for containing the initial offensive when Japan attacks (Rear Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, has made some clarifications to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee on this point). This is the reason why the clause on establishing an airfield on Guam was removed. However, if the Senate approves this clause, the House of Representatives may change its attitude to align with the Senate. (23rd Havas dispatch)

Both Britain and France will recognize the Spanish National Government and announce it simultaneously on the 27th. The negotiations have been very smooth. (Paris)
The Spanish situation is progressing rapidly. French Prime Minister Daladier will ask the Chamber of Deputies today to authorize the government to recognize the National Military Government without waiting for parliamentary discussions, after French representative Perard and National Government Foreign Minister Jordana hold another meeting this morning. It is expected that France's recognition of the National Military Government will materialize on the 27th of this month, as will Britain. After meeting with Jordana last night, Perard stated that today's meeting may be the last. The National Military authorities have also been favorably impressed by the progress of the negotiations. However, because of certain points that still need to be discussed, today's meeting will be held. (24th Reuters dispatch)

British officials do not believe the claim that the British and French governments will make a final effort to promote a ceasefire in Spain before recognizing the Spanish National Military Government. According to general rumors, recognition of the National Military Government is only a matter of two or three days. As far as Britain is concerned, it may not be beneficial to recognize the National Government with conditions attached. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Well-informed sources here recently declared that right-wing Senator Perard, when holding talks with General Jordana, Cabinet Coordinator and Foreign Minister of the Spanish National Military Government, this evening, consulted on the issue of France's unconditional recognition of the National Military Government. As for other technical issues, they will be studied by experts from both sides. As soon as the French Cabinet holds a state council meeting on the 27th of this month, the recognition of the National Military Government can be publicly announced that evening. Most of the deputies who oppose this move will submit a motion the next day, requesting the Chamber of Deputies to put this issue to debate, which will be opposed by Prime Minister Daladier. Generally, the voting result of the Chamber of Deputies will also reject this motion, indirectly authorizing the government to recognize the Spanish National Military Government. (22nd Havas dispatch)

(London)
Regarding the recognition of the Spanish National Military Government, well-informed sources here recently declared that the British government wants to announce it simultaneously with the French government. Since the French government has to wait until Senator Perard returns to the country on the 25th of this month before a decision can be made, Britain will naturally have to wait until the beginning of next week before issuing a statement. Regarding the cessation of the Spanish civil war, the peace conditions proposed by the Republican government of that country have been rejected by General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Military. Sir Mounsey, Director of the Western European Division of the British Foreign Office, recently informed Askarat, the ambassador of the Spanish Republican government, when he met with him today, that General Franco's reply has stated two points: (1) Spain should maintain its independence and will never allow foreign forces to control it; (2) The National Military Government is unwilling to issue an amnesty, but will be magnanimous. Ambassador Askarat immediately replied that the government army will not stop the war if it cannot obtain real guarantees. As far as well-informed sources know, no matter how hard the Spanish Republican government tries, the British government will still recognize the National Military Government as the legitimate government, but before the official announcement, it also intends to put pressure on the authorities in Madrid to urge them to stop resisting.

Britain Also Attaches Importance to Pacific Islands; Allocates Funds to Develop Three Islands as Aviation Landing Stations. (London)
The House of Commons today discussed the colonial supplementary budget案, which requires a cost of £3,044,400. Colonial Minister MacDonald advocated using £7,500 for the Gilbert and Ellis Islands, saying that the development of aviation affairs in recent years has made several islands, which have always been regarded as relatively unimportant, important, and can be used as landing sites for trans-Pacific aviation lines. One of them is Canton Island, so there are now three islands that can have an important relationship with trans-Pacific aviation operations. Therefore, we have sent officials to the three islands. The cost of their stationing on the island and the cost of carrying out the work that has already begun in the past two years will total £7,500. As for Canton Island, not only Britain, but also the US government wants to obtain it. Britain and the United States recently signed an agreement stipulating mutual management of the island for several years. Afterwards, the two governments conducted discussions on detailed management rules. These negotiations are expected to end in the near future. Currently, both Britain and the United States have representatives stationed on the island. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing will completely change its appearance within a month, demolishing a quarter of the civilian houses to prevent Japanese planes from bombing and causing fires. (Chongqing)
Chongqing will completely change its appearance within one month, as nearly a quarter of the city's houses will be demolished. This is part of the central government's air defense program to prevent Japanese planes from dropping incendiary bombs in the city center and causing rapid fires. According to Chinese sources, during the recent Japanese air raids on Guiyang and Guilin, the houses in the city that were burned down by incendiary bombs accounted for one-third of the total, and hundreds of people were killed or injured. Chongqing is not a large area and currently has a population of more than 530,000. The houses in the city are closely packed together, and the buildings are mostly extremely simple. There are no open spaces in the middle, and there are few wide streets. Moreover, the city is located on the Yangtze River and Jialing River. If Japanese planes drop incendiary bombs, the residents will have very few escape routes. Therefore, the authorities have planned for unforeseen circumstances. The Air Defense Command is currently discussing opening fire lanes in densely populated areas and widening narrow roads. However, because this program requires the demolition of a large number of civilian houses and requires huge expenses to complete, the Air Defense Command has submitted this matter to the National Military Council for review and decision.

貴州建設的現階級　農工礦各業均極猛進　形成爲抗戰後方重心　　
The current stage of Guizhou's construction: agriculture, industry, and mining are all making rapid progress, forming the center of the anti-Japanese war rear.

貴陽通信、貴州過去是一個邊僻不受人注意的少份、目下居然一躍爲朝野經營的對象、所以建設貴州、聲浪日趨高漲、不過建設的進行、經緯萬緒、如農業的改進、礦產的開發、交通的促進、工業的建立、合作的推行等等、雖然現在已不是復談計劃的時候、惟問題在如何把握核心、集中精力、從扼要處着手、這山國的社會、由於過去交通閉塞、工商業不發達、不能題言的至今還滯於農業經濟狀態中、所以就有黔省的環境言、毋寗先注重農業爲是、再就利用每一種可能利用的資源的原則來說、黔省有一千六百餘萬畝、佔全省可耕地五分之二的荒地、有待開墾、且過去農民有大部是靠種烟生活的、而今一律禁種、這些農人的生活、更得想法子補救、基於這、黔省的建設、就側重於農業改進與農村經濟發展方面、不過所謂改進、當然不是狹義的改進、而是以配合建立國防經濟爲中心工作、同時適應戰時需要、譬如注重兵民給養所需的糧食、衣料藥材、維持交通工業所需的木材、與提鍊植物油所需的原料像桐、玉罰黍改進、換取外匯的出品像絲·桐油·而工業眼前也就以農產品加工工業作爲第一步、至其他礦產·交通·除了有關國防機密不能發表外、茲當作梗槪的報道如下、
Guiyang Correspondence: Guizhou, which used to be a remote and unnoticed province, has now suddenly become the object of operation by the government and the public. Therefore, the voice of building Guizhou is rising. However, the progress of construction is complex, such as agricultural improvement, mineral development, transportation promotion, industrial establishment, cooperative implementation, etc. Although now is not the time to repeat the plan, the problem lies in how to grasp the core, concentrate energy, and start from the key points. The society of this mountainous country, due to the past traffic closure and underdeveloped industry and commerce, still lags behind in the agricultural economic state. Therefore, speaking of the environment of Guizhou Province, it is better to focus on agriculture first. Furthermore, in terms of the principle of using every possible resource, Guizhou Province has more than 16 million acres, accounting for two-fifths of the arable land in the province, which is waiting to be reclaimed. In the past, most of the farmers relied on growing tobacco for their livelihood, but now all planting is prohibited, and ways must be found to remedy the lives of these farmers. Based on this, Guizhou's construction focuses on agricultural improvement and rural economic development. However, the so-called improvement is certainly not a narrow improvement, but a central task to cooperate with the establishment of a national defense economy, while adapting to wartime needs, such as focusing on food, clothing, and medicinal materials needed for the military and civilians, timber needed to maintain transportation and industry, and raw materials needed to refine vegetable oil such as tung, jade millet improvement, and export products for foreign exchange such as silk and tung oil. The industry will also take agricultural product processing industry as the first step. As for other minerals and transportation, except for national defense secrets that cannot be published, the following is a general report:

In Guizhou Province, the Miao Nei Mountains traverse, and there are overlapping mountains, and there are very few plains. Although the total area of the province is more than 264.7 million mu, the arable land is only more than 31.5 million mu, which is less than 12% of the area. However, there are still more than 16 million mu that have not been cultivated, so that the province's food production was not enough to be self-sufficient in the past. The prohibition of planting tobacco seedlings has made the situation much better. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, the consumption in the front was huge, and the population in the rear increased sharply, and increasing production was urgent. Therefore, in the past year, in addition to strictly prohibiting the planting of tobacco, the authorities ordered that all cultivated land in various counties should not be closed, and 70% should be planted with edible items, and 30% should be planted with industrial crops. On the one hand, the "Agricultural Improvement Institute" will issue standard seeds (mainly wheat, rapeseed, and cotton), and the "Agricultural Improvement Institute" will also send people to 22 counties such as Qianxi to provide on-site guidance on planting, and set up regional agricultural fields in the four regions of east, west, south, and north, specializing in scientific research, in order to improve varieties and prevent diseases and insect pests. In this way, last year's food production increased by more than 14 million dan compared with the previous year. The organization of the Agricultural Improvement Institute was specially established by the provincial government and the Central Agricultural Institute of the Ministry of Economy in order to improve the agricultural and forestry industry in Guizhou Province. It is divided into three departments of agronomy, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine, and three offices of tussah silkworm, water and drought prevention, and agricultural economy. In a year, such as the selection of rice and wheat seeds, the cultivation of seedlings, the prevention and control of animal epidemics, the improvement of tussah silkworms, and the design of water and drought prevention, and the investigation of agricultural economy, considerable achievements and foundations have been laid.

　　貴州旣盡崇山峻嶺、氣候又溫和多雨、本極宜造林、可惜人謀不臧、造林事業、不能積極進行、於是有林地面積遠在宜林地面積之下、更不止此、人民對原有森林、不知保養、圖一時微利、戕折未成年樹幹、以致森林數量與出產每况愈下、據農林專家估計、黔省至少有八千萬畝林地可以造林、去年每年造林一百萬畝方案已施諸實行、一等縣至少應造林三萬畝、二等縣造林一萬五千畝、三等縣一萬畝、同時購雲南松·核桃·楠木·泡桐·樟樹·桐油種籽分發各縣圃播種、
Guizhou is full of mountains and ridges, and the climate is mild and rainy, which is very suitable for afforestation. Unfortunately, human efforts are not good, and the afforestation business cannot be carried out actively, so the area of forest land is far below the area of suitable forest land. What's more, people do not know how to maintain the original forests, and they try to make a small profit for a while, and cut down immature tree trunks, resulting in the decline of the number of forests and output. According to estimates by agricultural and forestry experts, Guizhou Province has at least 80 million mu of forest land that can be afforested. Last year's plan to afforest 1 million mu every year has been implemented. First-class counties should afforest at least 30,000 mu, second-class counties afforest 15,000 mu, and third-class counties afforest 10,000 mu. At the same time, Yunnan pine, walnut, nanmu, paulownia, camphor, and tung oil seeds are purchased and distributed to various counties for nursery broadcasting.

　　全省氣候、終年溫和、宜於農務、但倘晴雨不調、因河流稀少、卽能患旱災、如久雨而山洪暴發、田禾又有冲沒之虞、這都會使生產不能安定、辦理農田水利遂亦爲要圖、去年已由導淮委員會先行測定定番的小龍、安順的平昌壩、安龍的坡塘海子、着手辦理水利、另外省府與經濟部農本局農業調整處合組貴州省農田水利貸款委員會、由該處貸款一百萬元、省府貸二十萬元、舉辦各處應辦之農田水利工程、
The climate in the province is mild all year round, which is suitable for agricultural work, but if the weather is not good, due to the scarcity of rivers, it can suffer from drought. If it rains for a long time and mountain floods break out, there is also a risk of farmland being flooded. This will make production unstable, and the management of farmland water conservancy is also an important plan. Last year, the Huaihe River Guidance Committee first measured the Xiaolong of Dingfan, the Pingchang Dam of Anshun, and the Potang Haizi of Anlong, and started to manage water conservancy. In addition, the provincial government and the Agricultural Adjustment Office of the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Economy jointly established the Guizhou Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Loan Committee, which loaned 1 million yuan from the office and 200,000 yuan from the provincial government to carry out the farmland water conservancy projects that should be carried out everywhere.

　　遵義的柞蠶絲、早年非常有名、淸咸同年間、年產價值達數百萬兩、近年日趨沒落、殊爲可惜、省府有鑒於此、去年選購蠶種、貸發蠶農飼育、並虫「農改所」在該縣設地試騐負責指導、去年成績較上年已增加六七倍、共值十餘萬元、將來逐步推及湄潭·仁懷·正安·一帶、年產當可達二三千萬元以上、
The tussah silk in Zunyi was very famous in the early years. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, the annual output value reached millions of taels. In recent years, it has declined, which is a pity. In view of this, the provincial government selected and purchased silkworm eggs last year, loaned them to silkworm farmers for breeding, and the "Agricultural Improvement Institute" set up a place in the county to conduct tests and was responsible for guidance. Last year's results have increased by six or seven times compared with the previous year, with a total value of more than 100,000 yuan. In the future, it will be gradually extended to Meitan, Renhuai, Zheng'an, and other areas, and the annual output can reach more than 20 to 30 million yuan.

　　除了改良生產技術與經營方法以增加生產之外、關於物產之調整分配、物產之運銷統制、消費限制、尚有賴合作事業之推進與乎合作金融機構之建立、所以省府成立了農邨合作委員會、促使無合作社的縣份、早日設立、已有合作社的縣份、再增多其數量、以期合作事業、迅速深入農村、一面與農本局在省會成立省合作金庫、在各縣成立縣合作金庫、其資金爲四百五十萬元、先後成立計定番·安順·獨山·等三十餘縣、據農本局報告、截至二十七年十二月底止、放款總額達七十餘萬元、更設農業生產貸款委員會、以輔助辦理合作及有關農產之貸款、去年各縣豐收、又特在××等五縣設省農倉、××等九縣設縣農倉從事收集糧食、調劑穀價、兼備軍需、農民銀行、合作金庫、並舉辦糧食抵押放款以促進農邨的活潑和繁榮、爲使運輸靈活、行銷便利、有農礦工商調整委員會、桐油運銷合作委員會、小本借貸處、合作代營局、像這樣三方面同時並進、預期必可一洗過去農村貧弱的現象、
In addition to improving production technology and management methods to increase production, the adjustment and distribution of products, the regulation and control of product marketing, and consumption restrictions still depend on the promotion of cooperative undertakings and the establishment of cooperative financial institutions. Therefore, the provincial government established the Rural Cooperation Committee to promote the early establishment of counties without cooperatives, and to increase the number of counties with existing cooperatives, in order to make cooperative undertakings quickly penetrate the countryside. On the one hand, it jointly established the Provincial Cooperative Treasury with the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau in the provincial capital, and established the County Cooperative Treasury in various counties, with a fund of 4.5 million yuan. More than 30 counties including Dingfan, Anshun, and Dushan have been established one after another. According to a report from the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, the total amount of loans totaled more than 700,000 yuan as of the end of December 27th. An agricultural production loan committee was established to assist in the handling of cooperation and related agricultural product loans. Last year, all counties had a bumper harvest, and provincial agricultural warehouses were specially set up in 5 counties such as XX, and county agricultural warehouses were set up in 9 counties such as XX to collect food, regulate grain prices, and prepare for military needs. Farmers' banks and cooperative treasuries also organized food mortgage loans to promote the vitality and prosperity of the rural areas. In order to make transportation flexible and sales convenient, there are agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial adjustment committees, tung oil marketing cooperation committees, small loan offices, and cooperative acting bureaus. With such three aspects advancing simultaneously, it is expected that the past phenomenon of rural poverty and weakness can be completely eliminated.

　　工業
Industry
貴州省的工業、原來是非常幼稚的、在現在也不過纔在萌芽時代、已籌劃或建立的工廠、目前並以農產品加工工業爲主、目的不使增加農產品生產後有過剩傷農的弊病、這方面都已具有相當規模和基礎、衹要各方面努力與企業家能投資、民生工業、在貴州不難開出最美麗的葩來、
Guizhou Province's industry was originally very naive, and now it is only in its infancy. The factories that have been planned or established are currently mainly based on agricultural product processing industry, with the purpose of preventing the problem of overproduction and hurting farmers after increasing agricultural product production. This aspect has a considerable scale and foundation. As long as all parties work hard and entrepreneurs can invest, it is not difficult for people's livelihood industries to bloom in Guizhou.

　　（一）榨油廠　在貴陽已成立一處、不久卽可開始製造、×油·××油·都能製造、並擬將來在東西南北四區中心、至少須分設一廠、
(1) Oil Extraction Plant: One has been established in Guiyang, and it will soon be able to start manufacturing. X oil and XX oil can be manufactured, and it is planned to set up at least one plant in the center of the four regions of east, west, south, and north in the future.

　　（二）製藥廠　貴州的藥植物本多、且需要日廣、從前差不多一任貨委於地、現在已由衛生委員會積極設廠利用了、
(2) Pharmaceutical Factory: There are many medicinal plants in Guizhou, and the demand is increasing day by day. In the past, almost all goods were left to the ground. Now the Health Committee is actively setting up factories to use them.

　　（三）麵粉廠　雅片禁種、農產品抵補辦法、小麥卽爲幾種改種主要作物之一、現爲推廣往後小麥銷塲、定在各區設麵粉廠一處、
(3) Flour Mill: Opium is prohibited from planting, and wheat is one of the main crops for agricultural product compensation. Now, in order to promote the future wheat sales market, it is decided to set up a flour mill in each region.

　　（四）棉蔴織廠　棉布棉紗、爲黔省仰給外來的大宗物品、每年總值在一千萬元以上、自去年棉花試種成功、已飭農業改進所儘量推廣棉植、隨棉花的培植、自更須設廠紡織、蔴呢、向爲貴州大量生產的原料、能設廠精製、可供外銷、所以省府去年已努力棉蔴紡織廠的設立
(4) Cotton and Linen Textile Factory: Cotton cloth and cotton yarn are the main items that Guizhou Province relies on imports, with a total value of more than 10 million yuan per year. Since the successful trial planting of cotton last year, the Agricultural Improvement Institute has been ordered to promote cotton planting as much as possible. With the cultivation of cotton, factories must be set up for spinning and weaving. Hemp is a raw material that Guizhou has always produced in large quantities. If a factory can be set up for refining, it can be exported. Therefore, the provincial government has worked hard to establish cotton and linen textile factories last year.

　　（五）製糖廠　貴州南北邊區的氣候與土壤、使有很好的甘蔗出產、而本省用的糖、差不多反仰給廣西、於是舉辦製糖廠、亦爲省府籌劃之一、在近期內、至少可以有一部份不用外來的白糖了、
(5) Sugar Factory: The climate and soil in the northern and southern border areas of Guizhou make for a good sugarcane production, but the sugar used in this province almost relies on Guangxi. Therefore, the establishment of a sugar factory is also one of the plans of the provincial government. In the near future, at least a part of the foreign white sugar can be avoided.

　　（六）捲烟廠　貴州的菸葉、品質俱優、極適於製造捲烟、然而除杜製雪茄外、捲烟卻都自外來每年消費達二三百萬、這是極驚人的一筆漏巵、是以自應趕速設廠、俾旣得自給又能外銷、
(6) Cigarette Factory: The tobacco leaves in Guizhou are of excellent quality and are very suitable for manufacturing cigarettes. However, except for the Du-made cigars, cigarettes are all imported, with annual consumption reaching 2 to 3 million. This is a very alarming leakage, so factories should be set up quickly, so that they can not only be self-sufficient but also exported.

　　（七）其他小機件製造廠　製毛製革以及化學日用品、（如肥皂牙膏）亦在逐步籌舉中、
(7) Other Small Machine Parts Manufacturing Plants: Wool and leather manufacturing, as well as chemical daily necessities (such as soap and toothpaste), are also being planned step by step.

　　要工業發展、决不能缺乏動力的供給、這問題貴州出產的煤、也就足够解决、安順黃菓樹瀑布、是中國有名可利用的水力不過在輕工業未臻發達、重工業尚未措辦的時候、大規模水力發電、自可綏圖、雖然如此、電力供給、最近已與經濟部資源委員會合辦擴充××電廠至×××基羅瓦特、這樣供給各工業廠應用、已綽有餘裕了、至於貴州手工業品可發展者、本亦不少、如都勻等的綫、貴陽漆器、其餘竹器·陶器·紡織、前曾舉行「全省手工業品展覽會」、集中審查、以謀統籌改進發展、
To develop industry, there must be a supply of power. This problem can be solved by the coal produced in Guizhou. The Huangguoshu Waterfall in Anshun is a famous hydropower that can be used in China. However, when the light industry is not yet developed and the heavy industry is not yet in place, large-scale hydropower generation can be implemented. Even so, the power supply has recently been jointly expanded with the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economy to increase the XX power plant to XXX kilowatts. In this way, the supply of power to various industrial plants is more than sufficient. As for the handicrafts that can be developed in Guizhou, there are many, such as the line in Duyun, the lacquerware in Guiyang, and the rest of the bamboo ware, pottery, and textiles. The "Provincial Handicraft Exhibition" was held before to concentrate on review, in order to plan for overall improvement and development.

Letter

To the Editor:
I am deeply astonished to read the news about the Taiyi MSG Factory Manager Song Wenxiang's opium case in your newspaper on February 18th. Our factory is the Taiyi Seasoning Wheat Extract Powder Factory. Mr. Song is one of our factory's salesmen, not the factory manager. The information in your newspaper was inaccurate due to false rumors. However, since this concerns our factory's reputation, we are sending this letter to your newspaper and hope that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column for clarification, so as to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world.
Sincerely,
Taiyi Seasoning Wheat Extract Powder Factory
February 24th

To the Editor:
Upon reading your newspaper on the 22nd of this month, we found an article stating that Anli Transportation Company transported military supplies for the Japanese, which is inconsistent with the facts. During the trial at the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court on the 18th of this month, we surrendered and stated the events, without mentioning anything about transporting military supplies for the Japanese. It is clear that someone is slandering our reputation. We are sending this special letter in the hope that your newspaper will correct the record and reveal the truth.
Sincerely,
Chen Chuanliang and Gu Jiangsheng of Anli Freight Car Company

Commercial News and Finance
Tianjin and Hong Kong Groups Work Together
Gold Prices Continue to Rise
Approaching the 2110 Yuan Mark
Gold Reserves in the City Are Nearly Exhausted
Yesterday, the black market for spot gold saw even more intense price increases, with gold prices approaching the 2110 yuan mark. Under the influence of strong buying, prices soared, breaking the previous day's record high of 2102 yuan and reaching an unprecedented peak of 2108.5 yuan. This was due to the scarcity of gold reserves in the city and the depletion of circulating funds, coupled with aggressive buying by the Hong Kong, Beijing, and cash houses. Although a certain money exchange dealer acting for a wealthy merchant sold some holdings for profit, demand still exceeded supply, pushing prices higher. The price briefly fell due to a sudden sale by a gold house, but the limited supply quickly quelled the price drop, resulting in a sharp increase of 14.5 yuan. Market sentiment was extremely bullish, and trading volume was limited to 500 taels due to a lack of sellers. Jewelry prices also rose by one yuan, reaching an unprecedented high. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Spot Gold Up 14.5 Yuan
From the morning, the initial price per tael (ten liang) was driven up from 2096-2097 yuan to 2102 yuan by strong buying from the Hong Kong group, who enlisted a gold house to buy on their behalf, and also buying interest from the Beijing group. The opening price was 2102 yuan, with the first trade being 50 taels from a gold house to a fellow dealer. Cash houses also came to buy, but despite a wealthy merchant selling for profit, the price continued to rise. A cash house bought 50 taels from the Beijing group for 03 yuan, followed by another cash house buying 50 taels from a money exchange dealer for 04 yuan. Later, the Beijing group and a gold house each bought 50 taels from money exchange dealers at the same price. Although the Beijing group continued to buy, the price stopped rising and began to fall due to a sale by a gold house. The gold house sold 50 taels to the Beijing group for 05 yuan, and another 50 taels for 03 yuan. Soon after, a jewelry group sold 50 taels to the Beijing group for 01 yuan, and then the money exchange dealer sold 50 taels to the jewelry group at the same price. Afterwards, supply became scarce, and the price remained stagnant. Because of no trades, the closing price was 01 yuan. The afternoon session was quiet due to a lack of sellers. Buyers initially offered 2105 yuan but could not find a seller. Finally, a cash house sold 50 taels to a customer at 2108.5 yuan, which was the closing price, 14.5 yuan higher than the previous day's close. (Including the Spring Festival holiday, the price has risen for four consecutive days, totaling 52.5 yuan.) The selling price of cash gold from the cash houses was 2115 yuan, and the buying price was 2100 yuan. The actual gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no trades occurring.

Jewelry Prices Increase by Another Yuan
The initial selling price of jewelry gold remained unchanged until 10:30 am when the spot price reached a new high, leading to a one-yuan increase. Datong Hang raised its price to 213 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang to 211 yuan, with a buying price of 205 yuan. These prices also set unprecedented highs.

Pure Gold Prices Unchanged Yesterday
A London dispatch on the 23rd reported that pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 4d per ounce. Consequently, the Central Bank's buying price for cash remained at 1210.9 yuan. The listed price for customs gold also remained stagnant at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1206.2 yuan.

Gold Sovereigns Difficult to Obtain
Up 5 Jiao
Yesterday, the price of pure gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 25. Foreign exchange houses rarely settled accounts, and the supply of Hong Kong telegraphs was not smooth. Market prices were stable. The price of spot gold was strong at the opening, with Hong Kong groups continuing to absorb supply. However, individual investors sold at high prices, preventing significant fluctuations. The stable trend has pushed market prices to a high point, and speculative investors are waiting on the sidelines, resulting in limited trading volume. In the afternoon, a wealthy merchant entrusted a money exchange dealer to buy, but sellers were difficult to find, suggesting further price increases in the future. Due to the strong spot gold price, wealthy merchants continued to aggressively buy foreign currencies. The prices of British and American gold sovereigns continued to rise sharply, and gold coins were scarce and easily traded at high prices. However, the increase in the price of British and American gold notes lagged behind, rising by only a fraction of a percent. The exchange rates of other currencies remained stable or fluctuated slightly. The trading volume was mediocre. The clearing rate for bills of exchange remained constant.

The clearing rate for bills of exchange remained constant at 35 yuan per thousand, with adjustments of 2 jiao 5 fen, similar to the previous day.

Spot Silver Prices Soar
A London dispatch on the 23rd reported that a few merchants sold, but the market remained unchanged. The market was quiet after the close, with a few sales at the listed price. The near-term price for standard silver fell by 0.0625, and the forward price remained unchanged. A New York dispatch reported that American silver prices remained stable. A Bombay dispatch reported that Indian silver prices were mixed, with the spot price rebounding by 15 annas, while the near- and forward-term prices fell by 1 anna.

Foreign Exchange Remains Stable
North China Foreign Merchants Settle
Hong Kong Still Selling
Although banks bought and settled accounts for foreign companies in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the supply from foreign banks in the city remained stable, and Hong Kong telegraphs also sold, resulting in little change. Although foreign companies also bought and settled Hong Kong currency, foreign banks suddenly sold, keeping the situation relatively stable.

In the morning, the near-term price for standard silver fell by 0.0625, and the forward price remained unchanged. American silver prices also remained unchanged. The price of gold in London remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 1.2, the exchange rate with the French currency rose by 4 centimes, and the exchange rate with Shanghai remained flat. The exchange rate between American and British currencies rose by 25, the exchange rate with the French currency rose by 1.875, and the exchange rate with Shanghai remained unchanged. The listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price for British currency was 8 pence 125, and the selling price for American currency was 15.875 yuan, with no change from the previous close. Although favorable companies bought and settled accounts for foreign companies in North China, the situation remained unchanged because HSBC was still willing to supply currency. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was reduced by 5 li, calculated at 8.00%. Although foreign companies settled accounts, the situation remained stable because foreign banks were still willing to supply currency. A foreign company bought American currency from a bank for 15.875 yuan. Trading became lighter near noon, with only a few trades in Hong Kong currency. The process was uneventful.

Securities
Government Bonds Expected to Have a Second Wave of Price Increases
The securities black market was expected to rebound yesterday, but there were rumors that new British and American loans would be established. It was also rumored that a certain bank could discount unified Class A red tickets and various Phase 6 interest tickets at 8% interest, but this has yet to be confirmed. As a result, market sentiment became excited. The rumors of an official opening of the stock exchange also contributed to the market's stability. Based on various observations, government bonds are expected to experience a second wave of price increases soon. At the opening yesterday, Tiansheng Hang was the first to buy, and prices immediately strengthened. No. 5 focused on buying Class B bonds, and retail investors were also actively absorbing supply. Sellers included Tongkang, Lemao, Lianhe, and No. 52, all of whom sold small amounts. Xieda Hang sold less frequently. Buyers slightly dominated the market, and the trend was promising. As a result, market prices rose slightly by 5 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen. There were no trades in Class A, Class D, or No. 96 bonds. The total transaction volume was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simple table is provided below.

Cotton Yarn
Poor Market Conditions
Double Globe Yarn Plunges 10 Yuan
The yarn market remained weak due to sluggish sales and a lack of demand from various groups. As a result, market sentiment was weak. However, dealers remained firm and bought when prices fell, providing some support to the market. However, due to poor market conditions, many speculators continued to close out their positions, leading to a downward trend in the market. 20-count Double Horse yarn broke the 400 yuan mark, with the lowest price reaching 396 yuan, a 7 yuan decrease from the previous day's closing price. After some buyers came back to buy, the market rebounded and closed at 400 yuan. Based on market conditions, most opinions are positive, but the lack of real demand is a drawback.

In the morning, the initial market was characterized by little actual trading and a concentration of retail investors. Sentiment was weak, and the situation in eastern Zhejiang was tense, causing market prices to decline step by step. 20-count Double Globe yarn experienced the most severe price drop, falling to 390 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day. This situation was somewhat exaggerated. Afterwards, some people came to sell spot goods, and the market rebounded in the afternoon, returning to 394 yuan. Double Horse yarn also rebounded by 3 yuan. In total, various groups bought 1080 bales, with dealers accounting for 70% of the transactions. 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, Special Jincheng fell by 2 yuan, Double Globe fell by 6 yuan, Tiannu fell by 5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn fell by 2-3 yuan.

Yesterday, 124 bales of yarn arrived from Tianjin, and 30 bales of cotton yarn were transported to Xiamen, 200 bales to Hong Kong, and 400 bales to Guangzhou Bay.

Yao Flowers Arrive at 16,000 Bales
Factory Demand for Chinese and Foreign Cotton Increases
The foreign cotton market was stable, with slightly active spot trading and some short covering. The issue of loan cotton sales remains unresolved in Washington, and the cotton market is showing signs of fatigue. Without the stimulus of the loan issue, cotton prices would be unimaginable. Yesterday, New York rose by 3-4 points, India rose by half a rupee including forecasts, and Egypt rose by 8-9 points. Exchange rates were relatively stable. Calculated in legal tender, cotton prices for American and Brazilian cotton rose by 1-2 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by over 3 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by over 6 jiao.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, a large batch of Indian cotton previously ordered by Chinese factories arrived in Shanghai during the holidays and is currently being cleared and sent to factories. The new flowers of Indian cotton white Locke area this year are fresh and clean due to the suitable rainfall, and the fiber can be used for spinning 20 counts or more. However, its selling price is cheaper than the usual Yinsha local cotton. Hongzhang still purchased 500 bales of White Locke yesterday, with the factory price being around 70 yuan. Japanese factories ordered about 2000 bales of Indian cotton yesterday, including 500 bales each for Gongda, Yufeng, Daliang, and Neiwai. Cotton prices are listed below.

The local cotton business is gradually improving, and factory demand is expanding. Hongzhang Factory set 500 pieces of 20-count raw materials for Indian cotton. Japanese factories are also purchasing, but sources from all regions are still declining. Market prices are firm. The Japanese factories mainly purchase 20-count raw materials, also white-packaged flowers, to match the color of white jade. Recently, Japanese factories have been purchasing a large amount of Indian cotton to meet the spinning needs of Chinese cotton with white packaging. Only the Tongyi and Chongxin factories in China specialize in spinning coarse yarn, so Yao flowers have a large consumption volume. Cotton merchants are trying to request the Zhejiang cotton that was blocked, and 16,000 bales have already arrived, which have been purchased by the factories. Tongzhou flowers have not yet arrived in Shanghai because the villagers are still enjoying the holiday. The amount of spot cotton currently being produced by each factory and the market conditions are listed below.

Piece Goods
Cotton Cloth is Dull
East Goods Also Fall Sharply
The cotton market's sales channels to distant customers have not yet been activated. The nearby Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Wen, and Ningbo areas are in a state of standstill due to the tense situation. Therefore, wholesale customers in this street are also waiting on the sidelines. The market situation is dull. Although the selling price of domestic cloth has not changed, it has tended to be sluggish. East cloth has the fastest price fluctuations. With the end of the month approaching, the trend is sluggish, and retail investors are eager to sell, causing a chaotic market situation yesterday. Speculators took the opportunity to apply pressure, causing the price of fine cloth and fine twill to fall sharply. Fine cloth fell by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao per piece, and fine twill fell by 1 to 1.5 jiao. The selling price for 12-pound Caiqiu, Feiyu, and Yanghe fine cloth was 12.2 yuan, and the selling price for Longtou and Wufu fine cloth was 12.15 yuan. The selling price for Longtou, Feiyu, and Wufu fine twill was 11.65 yuan.

Today, 200 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, 300 pieces to Yantai, 6 pieces to Xiamen, and 5 pieces to Hong Kong.

Grain
Flour Sales to Southeast Asia Remain Strong
Factory Prices Expected to Continue to Fall by 5 Fen
The spot flour market continued to be soft yesterday. After the initial sales of red market transactions, customer demand seemed to be full. Due to the impact of foreign flour arriving in Tianjin, the demand for Shanghai flour is difficult to be strong. However, lower-grade flour continues to be purchased. Sales to Southeast Asia remain strong. Quanzhou merchants specialize in operating Yuan Yuerong Weng and Feng Mudan brands, Fuzhou merchants are interested in buying Tianzhu Blue Ship and other flour, with transactions of more than 10,000 bags each. Tianjin, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao, and other places operate Che Chuan and other brands, and Red Caishen and Red Taohua flour, totaling about 30,000 bags. Retail sales in this street are about 7-8,000 bags. No. 2 flour is 4.75 yuan, No. 3 flour is 4.55 yuan, and No. 4 flour is 4.2 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that factory prices would continue to fall by 5 fen. The current price of wheat bran is high, so factory shipments are still profitable and very lucrative. Today, 4,000 bags of flour are being transported to Tianjin.

Wheat Prices Increase by 5 Fen Before Transactions Occur
Transactions have begun in the wheat market yesterday. Prices in various places remain high, and the supply is scarce. Holders are holding prices high due to low inventory, while factories are unwilling to lower prices to buy. The market was once in a deadlock. Yesterday, the market slightly lowered prices, resulting in an increase of 5 fen before transactions occurred. A total of 3,000 bags of Jingzhen, Wuyang, and other wheat were purchased, with Fufeng Factory purchasing 1,000 bags and Fuxin Factory purchasing 2,000 bags. The highest price was 6.8 yuan.

Glutinous Rice Sales are Strong During the Season
Red Market is Good for 2-3 Jiao
Customers' Xian Rice Also Rises by a Corner
In the red market for domestic rice, over 40 companies arrived at Hexia, and the wheel-drag baozi rice was not available because a certain party banned exports at Hupukou. Only 1,000 bags arrived by car. In terms of sales, most of the transactions in the red market are for social occasions. Demand is weak due to the abundant store inventory from last year. The market lacks vitality. The price of thick japonica rice is the same as the closing price of the previous year. Duyang Jian and Bujian are also stable. Due to the lack of delivery last year for special baozi rice, the price is slightly better by 1-2 jiao. The Hexia goods are arriving steadily. The price of Biayuan and Yinyu rice is rising, with 1-3 jiao increases.

Transactions in the red market for customer's Xian rice are relatively lively. A total of 2,700-2,800 bags were opened, which is more active than the local jian rice. Customer's Xian rice has better price increases, which is popular with people from other provinces and factories. Due to the unavailability of allocation during the market closure period, the sources from various places are scarce. Although there is an inventory of 200,000 bags, the owners intend to hold firm, and the line of storks and Southeast Asia continue to inquire. Therefore, the selling price in the Ji market has increased by 1 jiao. Nanjing Xian opened at 11.4 yuan, Wu Xian Chongjing Xian opened at 11 yuan, ordinary high-quality goods were 10.089 yuan, and medium-quality goods were 10.056 yuan. Buyers yesterday included stores, factories, lines, and customer storks.

Miscellaneous Grains
Attempted Monopoly of Wheat Bran
Counterproductive and Stifling
The monopoly of wheat bran by a multi-headed company is actually bestowed by the factories. The factories first announced the abandonment of stack rent, but the stack orders issued before the red market still had to be collected. Therefore, multi-headed companies with a background took the opportunity to collect cash and sign closed-door agreements with the factories, while spreading rumors that a certain party had exclusively contracted the business, causing drastic changes. However, although the market was disturbed for a time, people understood the situation and could not afford it, so the market was quiet. Yesterday, only Huafeng Factory released 2,000 small bags at a price of 4.15 yuan, and Fufeng's old stack orders for small bags were recovered for 4.175 yuan. Yesterday, 700 bags of wheat bran were transported to Xiamen.

Oil Cakes
Japanese Merchants Continue to Sell
The Future for Soybean Oil and Soybean Cake is Bright in Southeast Asia
Yesterday, the soybean oil market was sluggish due to weak actual sales. In the morning, only 50 barrels of spot Dalian oil were opened at a price of 28.7 yuan, a further decrease of 3 jiao from the previous day. Afterwards, it was learned that Dalian reported a price increase, and the situation tightened. The transaction volume increased sharply to more than 300 barrels, but the price remained unchanged. Japanese merchants continued to sell March shipments loaded by ships from the origin, with the price at 28.7 yuan. As a result, the price rose to 28.8 yuan, with a total of 700 barrels traded. Other return trades included ordering 250 barrels for delivery in March, 600 dan of Dayou Factory oil, and 200 pieces of Yanqi oil.

Quanzhou merchants are keen on soybean cakes, and prices have risen again by 1-2 fen. A total of 8,000 pieces of four-brand cakes have been completed. Another 1,000 pieces are being transported to Xiamen today, and 630 bags of soybeans are being transported to Hong Kong, and 580 bags to Xiamen.

### Soviet Red Army Soldiers Swear Allegiance in Unison; Celebrate 21st Anniversary; Red Army's Strength Is Now Unprecedented

(Moscow) Today, the entire Soviet populace celebrates the 21st anniversary of the Red Army. In commemoration of the eve of the anniversary, Soviet institutions and military representatives from Moscow, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Karagandy held joint celebratory gatherings. On the 23rd, countless articles were published in national newspapers, recounting the glorious history and development of the Red Army. The "Pravda" newspaper published an editorial entitled "The Irresistible Red Army," stating that 21 years ago, imperialists attempted to harm the nascent Soviet Republic due to its weak military strength. However, the great revolutionary power of our country was brought to bear, thwarting the enemies' designs. Thus, our glorious Red Army was created by the Lenin-Stalin party during the war against intervention. In recent years, the Soviet Union's national power has grown stronger day by day, and its national defense has become increasingly consolidated. As the 21st anniversary is commemorated, the Red Army has become a first-class military force, having achieved countless glorious victories and earned the love of the entire population. The Red Army is the world's first victorious socialist army, a military that serves the people entirely. Currently, the capitalist world is rife with disturbances and chaos, while the Soviet Union stands out like a crane among chickens, a pillar in midstream. Across our vast territory, our power is firmly established and unshakable. Our victorious socialism has created new warriors, warriors unseen in history. The Red Army, Navy, and Air Force will hold a swearing-in ceremony today. In this glorious and solemn oath, the image of a soldier of our socialist motherland stands tall. This soldier is loyal, brave, and disciplined, dedicating his entire life to the motherland. The anniversary of the Red Army is a festival for our entire populace and the working masses of the world, because the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force are filled with the spirit and significance of internationalism. In every capitalist country, there are countless friends—workers, farmers, and progressive intellectuals—who know that the Red Army, the fortress of world peace, never threatens others and never fears the threats of others. When the demise of capitalism arrives, the Red Army will have the united international proletariat as its backing. The malicious instigators of world war will ultimately tremble and surrender before the armed people. (TASS, 23rd)

(Moscow) All officers and soldiers of the Soviet Union's three branches of service, from People's Commissar of Defense General Voroshilov to ordinary soldiers, took an oath today to pledge allegiance to the nation. General Voroshilov also delivered instructions to Red Army commissioned officers, stating, "We have now sworn an oath, willing to contribute our lives and blood to the state and the People's Government. I firmly believe that you will, at any time and place, willingly defend with your lives and blood the great cause advocated by Lenin and Stalin, and defend the Soviet worker-peasant government. Moreover, we hold leading positions in the Red Army, and our responsibilities are even more arduous. We must be diligent, endure hardship, and overcome missions, so that the glorious Red Army can fulfill its duties to the fullest. The Red Army must be invincible in order to survive; this is what history has shown, is now, and will be in the future. We must especially devote ourselves to improving the Red Army's military and political training, so that it becomes a powerful force for workers and peasants, to uphold and promote the great historical cause advocated by Lenin and Stalin." (Havas, 23rd)

(Moscow) Officers and soldiers of the Soviet Union's three branches of service, from People's Commissar of Defense General Voroshilov to ordinary soldiers, took an oath today to pledge allegiance to the nation. National newspapers also published articles praising the strength of the three branches of service. People's Deputy Commissar of the Navy Frinovsky published an article in "Pravda," stating that Soviet shipyards have the capacity to build a large number of warships. According to the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Navy will add many powerful, giant warships equipped with long-range cannons. In addition, naval officers and staff have received rigorous training and are capable of performing all tasks. Frinovsky also published an article in "Maritime Transport Daily," emphasizing that the Soviet Union's shipbuilding program cannot fall behind other countries. All of Germany's small submarines are accustomed to operating in the Gulf of Finland. The country's main battleships, the "Schlesien" and "Schleswig-Holstein," are also there. Furthermore, German National Socialist Party members are actively operating in various Finnish ports, preparing to invade the Soviet Union, which is already plainly evident. People's Deputy Commissar of Defense Schchyodenko also published an article in "Pravda," stating that "The Soviet border, from Lake Ladoga in the north (adjacent to Finland) to the Black Sea in the south, is protected by reinforced concrete fortifications, which no enemy can break. The same is true in the Far East. In addition, the military academies are performing excellently, having trained tens of thousands of officers in recent years." Furthermore, Air Force Deputy Commander General Shimokevich published an article in a certain newspaper, stating that the Soviet Air Force is prepared for any eventuality. After the Changkufeng Incident last August, the Soviet Air Force has already achieved glorious battle results. Pilot Sprinayev, acting alone, fought against nine Japanese aircraft, shooting down one of them. The thickness of the Soviet Air Force's strength can be seen from this. (Havas, 23rd)

(Moscow) The Deputy People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union recently published an article in "Pravda," stating that the Red Army has become a completely new army in the world in terms of organization, training, and the quality of military equipment. Our army has now completed its technical transformation, adding brand-new infantry weaponry, powerful artillery units, transportation vehicles, superior tanks, and aircraft. Everyone knows that the quality is excellent. Our country's borders, from Lake Ladoga to the Black Sea and the Far East, are all defended with steel and reinforced concrete, which can only be passed in one direction: to attack the enemy. When the Tsarist government began the imperialist war, it had only 48,516 officers. In recent years, our military academies have successfully trained and are training hundreds of thousands of commanders. The Red Army annually sends tens of thousands of reserve lieutenants and hundreds of thousands of second lieutenants to enlist. In fact, it has become a great Lenin-Stalinist school. The Red Army's auxiliary organization, the Air Defense Association, trains countless reservists for the Red Army every year. The Red Army has become the world's first-class, strongest army. Hundreds of thousands of sharpshooters, machine gunners, tank crewmen, artillerymen, and pilots will guarantee that we will defeat the enemy in any battle under any conditions in the future. (TASS, 23rd)

(Washington) Today, the entire Soviet worker-peasant Red Army, border guards, troops of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, and naval soldiers, commanders, political commissars, and contingents held a solemn ceremony in an extremely fervent atmosphere to swear allegiance to the motherland, following the oath stipulated by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In addition to verbal oaths, they also signed the oath one by one. After the oath ceremony, the soldiers all congratulated each other, and their parents also sent letters and telegrams of comfort and encouragement. The mother of Soviet hero Ivan Porsyatsky, who died in the Changkufeng battle, sent an open letter to all soldiers and commanders of the Volga Military District, saying, "As the mother of a fallen hero, I now implore you, after taking the oath, to be as loyal to the motherland as my son was. I wish you to be prepared at all times, and as soon as you receive orders from the government and Comrade Stalin, immediately defend the motherland to the death." Before the oath ceremony at the Frunze Military Academy, Second-Rank Army Commander Khosin delivered an address, saying, "Thanks to the will of Lenin and Stalin, our country has created a powerful army, which not only possesses modern technology but also has the great socialist truth as its weapon. This army will surely defeat any aggressor in the future." It is reported that many of the academy's students are veterans of the Changkufeng battle. In addition to soldiers, high-ranking generals also took the oath on the same day, including People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Voroshilov, Deputy Commissar Marshal Budyonny, First-Rank Army Political Commissar Mekhlis and Schchyodenko, First-Rank Army Commander Kulik, Chief of General Staff Shaposhnikov, and others. (TASS, 23rd)

(Moscow) "Pravda" published an article written by Mao Zedong (?), titled "The Victorious Path of the Red Army, A Model for the Chinese Army," which stated, "We deeply know that to defeat Japan, the Chinese army must, in addition to strengthening modern technology and combat training, also acquire political training. After studying the experience of the Soviet army, the Chinese army will surely overcome all difficulties. For ten years, the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union have consolidated their unity, becoming a pillar of resistance against imperialist war. The two peoples oppose fascism and strive for peace. China has encountered many difficulties in the War of Resistance against Japan, and it is especially necessary to strengthen and expand its friendship with the Soviet Union. The historical example of the Red Army makes us deeply believe that final victory will never belong to fascism." (TASS, 23rd)

(Moscow) "Pravda" published an article titled "Trophies from Lake Khasan (Changkufeng)," which stated, "During the Lake Khasan battle, the heroic Soviet border troops seized countless trophies, including machine guns, hand grenades, cannons, rifles, officers' weapons, etc. From these, a complete set of Japanese military equipment has been assembled, including diaries and letters from Japanese soldiers and officers. In these documents, the Japanese soldiers felt that they would inevitably be defeated in the Lake Khasan battle, and there was no belief in victory, nor were there any pleasant words. Everything was filled with descriptions of decline and pessimism. The Japanese army clearly did not dare to attack and did not dare to fight the Red Army." (TASS, 23rd)

### Japan Buys Large Quantities of Military Supplies from Czechoslovakia

Prague: Japan ordered a large quantity of military supplies from Czechoslovakia in January of this year, and it is expected that this situation will continue for several months. It is reported that the goods exported from Czechoslovakia to Japan in January were worth 43 million crowns, while the total for the last three months of last year was only 3 million crowns. (Reuters, 24th)

### Netherlands Builds New Cruiser

The Hague: The Dutch government has recently decided to build a new cruiser to replace an old ship that has reached the end of its service life. This new cruiser will have a displacement of 8,350 tons, a speed of 33 knots per hour, and will be equipped with six-inch cannons, twelve machine guns, and six torpedo tubes. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1941. (Havas, 23rd)

### Large Numbers of German Troops and Military Supplies Head to Italian Africa; Preparing Tropical Military Uniforms; Planning Large-Scale Actions

(London) The Manchester Guardian recently reported, "German authorities have transferred a large number of troops to Italian territories in Africa. At the same time, large quantities of military supplies and tropical military uniforms have been transported to the Italian port of Genoa. Within the last ten days, four large batches of heavy artillery have been transported to Genoa and will be successively transferred to Italian Libya. A German construction company is constructing a type of mobile barracks that can be assembled and disassembled at any time. The German authorities have distributed maps of British Kenya, the British Mandate of Tanganyika (formerly German), and Italian Abyssinia to the German troops and have prepared them for use by air force personnel. Judging from these preparations, the German authorities may be planning large-scale military action. Otherwise, if the country were only morally supporting Italy, sending a small number of troops to Libya would have been sufficient. There would be no need to manufacture large quantities of tropical military uniforms and transport huge amounts of military equipment." (Havas, 24th)

### Harvard University Physics Professor Forbids People from Dictatorial Countries from Entering Science Laboratories

(New York) Renowned American physicist and Harvard University Professor Bridgman recently declared that citizens of totalitarian countries are not allowed to practice in the science laboratories that he oversees at Harvard University. "Citizens of totalitarian countries have lost their freedom. They may be forced to engage in certain activities to promote the policies of those countries, the goals of which are diametrically opposed to the goals of free countries. In my personal opinion, if we stop exchanging scientific knowledge with totalitarian countries, there would be two benefits: First, it would be difficult for those countries to use scientific knowledge to carry out their sinister intentions. Second, it would express our deep disgust for the actions of totalitarian countries." However, the regulations I have recently decided are completely voluntary and have nothing to do with Harvard University. (Havas, 23rd)
