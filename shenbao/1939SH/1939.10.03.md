### Churchill Explains Britain and France's War Aims: To Ensure Hitler's Aggression is Taught a Lesson; Soviet Troops Enter Poland with the Aim of Defending Against German Power; British Army Deploys to the French Frontline, Not Ceasing Until Victory is Achieved

London – Naval Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address at 9:15 PM tonight, stating that since Britain and France declared war on Germany, only a month has passed, and while the war has not reached a critical stage, at least three major facts have emerged: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union, who previously partitioned Poland for 150 years, consistently failed to subdue the Polish people's spirit of independence. Now, these countries are said to be partitioning Poland again. Looking at the heroism of the soldiers and civilians of Warsaw in this resistance, it is clear that the Polish national spirit cannot be destroyed. It is like a rock at sea, sometimes submerged by huge waves, but it remains a rock and will eventually reappear above the sea. (2) The Soviet Union has extended its borders into Poland. Although we hope that the country will enter this new border line as a friendly nation of Poland or an ally of Poland, not as an aggressor, the deployment of the country's troops to this border is a necessary step to resist the German threat, which is also a real situation. In any case, this boundary now exists. In other words, the Eastern European front has now been established. Nationalist Germany does not dare to cross this line. The mission of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was recently summoned to Moscow, was none other than to listen to the Soviet Union's demands, that is, Germany must abandon its plans for the Balkan Peninsula and Ukraine, and Germany must accept these demands. I cannot speculate on how the Soviet Union will act in the future. The future is changing and enigmatic, but there is still a key, that is, the national interest of the Soviet Union. In short, allowing Germany to expand its power to the Black Sea coast, or allowing it to invade the Balkan countries and control the Southeastern European Slavs, is obviously inconsistent with the Soviet Union's national interests. However, regarding this, we can at least say that the interests of the Soviet Union and Britain and France are the same, because none of the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union wants to see Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, or even Turkey under the German iron heel. Therefore, in this chaotic and uncertain situation, we can at least discern that the interests of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are completely consistent in preventing Germany from spreading the war to the Balkan countries. Based on this view, I firmly believe that Hitler cannot extend his power to Eastern and Southeastern Europe again, which is the second major event since the start of the war a month ago. (3) In the past month, our implementation of merchant ship inspection methods has been extremely effective. We have successively intercepted a large number of enemy food, kerosene, ore, and other goods, which is 150,000 tons more than the total amount of goods lost by our country's merchant ships after being sunk by enemy submarines. Our country's navy and air force have been searching for enemy submarines day and night, which is very effective. These submarines seem to have felt their precarious situation, so they would rather shift their targets and attack neutral countries' transport ships. It is hoped that the British Admiralty can one day invite transport ships from various countries to enjoy the benefits of escorting domestic merchant ships, which would be great. In short, the British government has now decided that no matter what happens, it will go to war with all its strength and will not stop until the final victory. A large number of our country's army troops have been sent to France to assist in the war. The British nation has decided to quickly join the excellent French army, but bear all the responsibilities. As for the government's previous statement that we have made sufficient preparations to deal with a three-year war, it does not mean that we cannot win in the short term. When we will win depends on how long Hitler and his corrupt and cruel bandits can enslave the German nation. Although the start of the war originated from Hitler's challenge, the end of the war cannot be decided by him. In other words, the outbreak of the war can be decided by him alone, but the end of the war must wait until we believe that he has received sufficient lessons before we can stop. Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly clarified our war aims, saying, "The reason why Britain and France resolutely went to war is to remove the constant threat of aggression for European countries, so that all nations can maintain their independent sovereignty. We have now begun to act. It is our duty to defend civilization, and we will never look back until we achieve final success. Moreover, Britain and France, in terms of their population, have a total of 85 million people, who are united and determined to fulfill their obligations. In Germany, there are only 85 million people, and at least some of them are Austrians, Czechs, and Slovaks, who have not been conquered for long, and who still need to be suppressed by violence. In addition, we have an advantage in the ocean and can obtain a large amount of manpower and material resources from the territories of Britain and France. The citizens of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, totaling 20 million people, automatically support us. The people of India also support our actions in spirit and in heart. All countries in the world, especially the United States, have respect and sincerity for us. The neutrality of our great Italian ally is especially admired. In history, the most glorious war for mankind was the American Civil War eighty years ago. Both sides fought with great confidence. The war lasted a long time, and the war was extremely difficult. Although the Southern troops fought very bravely, they could not wash away the shame of advocating slavery. Today, although the Germans are said to be brave and good at fighting, the infamous name of Nazi brutality will eventually be washed away. This is the same as the fate of the Southern Army in the United States eighty years ago. The leader of the Liberal Party in our country's Victorian era, Blat, said that after the end of the American Civil War, the terrible black shadow (referring to the slavery system) that enveloped the entire American continent has disappeared forever with the war." How wonderful are these words! (Havas wire, 1st)

### Great Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the Siegfried Line; Battle Lasts 35 Minutes; Three British Planes and Two German Planes Shot Down

London – The Ministry of Aviation has just issued a communiqué stating that five of our reconnaissance planes engaged in combat with fifteen German Messerschmitt fighter planes over the Siegfried Line today. Although our pilots suffered losses, their combat skills have been demonstrated during this first time in battle. Previously, our military authorities ordered these reconnaissance planes to fly to the strongest fortifications in the Saar region to reconnoiter enemy positions. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce along the border, our planes were still able to safely cross over and fly into enemy territory at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Soon after, nine enemy Messerschmitt fighter planes appeared in the clouds, 2,000 feet higher than our planes, and at the same time, six enemy planes flew from the right to attack. Although the disparity in numbers was great, our planes had to complete their reconnaissance mission and had no choice but to continue to advance in formation. In an instant, the air battle began. The enemy's tactics were to scatter and take turns firing densely at our planes, while their individual combat method was to quickly descend below our planes and then attack the abdomen from below. In total, the battle lasted 35 minutes. Three of our planes were shot down on the ground, and another was forced to land. Out of the twelve pilots, eight escaped by parachuting. The last plane, in addition to trying to complete its reconnaissance mission, also swept the enemy planes with machine guns from the plane, and finally hit two of them. They caught fire and crashed to the ground one after another. Our side spent only 259 bullets. The remaining thirteen German planes immediately stopped fighting and flew away. The last plane of our army also turned back, with the fuselage full of bullet holes, totaling eighty-nine. The gasoline tank was also pierced, and the pilot had to use a handkerchief to plug it and barely fly back to his country. When it landed, the fuselage tilted, touched the ground and caught fire. Fortunately, all the pilots were unharmed. (Havas wire, 1st)

### French Army Captures Important Area in the Saar River Delta; Controls Several Towns Such as Saarlautern; Some Artillery Battles on the East Bank of the Saar River

Paris – According to French sources, the French army has made progress on the line southwest of Saarlautern (i.e., Saarlouis) by one and a half miles at the end of the week. It has captured an important area in the delta where the Nied River and the Saar River converge. The area is a plateau that can control several towns such as Saarlautern in the Saar basin. After the French army occupied this area, it can bombard the Bolinus River basin, which is an important transportation line to the front line on the right. According to the latest French communiqué, the war was quiet on Sunday, and there were artillery battles on both sides of the Saar River. (Reuters wire, 2nd)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued the 55th communiqué, which is brief, stating only that "Our two armies had artillery battles on the east bank of the Saar River today. Other than that, everything was calm on the entire line." (Havas wire, 1st)

Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued the 56th war report, stating, "Yesterday was relatively calm. Our army shot down several enemy planes in many places on the front line." (Havas wire, 2nd)

### Royal Decree: Youths Enlist; Ages 20 to 22

London – The British King has issued a decree that all British men aged 20 to 22 residing in the United Kingdom on October 1 must enlist for service, with some exceptions. Those who are qualified to be called up must register at the local office of the Ministry of Labor on the date to be announced later. British citizens aged 20 to 22 residing outside the United Kingdom will be called up as soon as they return to the United Kingdom, and register at the local office of the Ministry of Labor within seven days of their return. It is expected that according to this order, the number of men aged 20 to 21 and men who reached the age of 10 on May 3 who are called up will be approximately 250,000. It is heard that no formal call-up notice will be issued to these men before November. In addition, 8,000 members of the militia will be transferred to the navy, and another 14,000 will be transferred to the air force. (Reuters wire, 2nd)

### Dykes in the Dutch Province of Polders Once Breached; Testing Existing Arrangements

Amsterdam – According to sources familiar with the situation, the Netherlands breached the dykes of a portion of the small province of Polders just two weeks ago, allowing water to flow in, in order to test the existing arrangements and raise the water level to a certain height, so that it would be easier to continue to raise the water level when necessary. There are only 200 households in the area. In addition, no part of the Dutch defense system has been breached to allow flooding so far. It is also heard from those responsible that the authorities have not yet made a decision on continuing to allow the water to flow in. Some parties believe that the authorities will not take this action. Competent parties in The Hague have no knowledge of the German army concentrating on the border between the Netherlands and Germany. (Reuters wire, 2nd)

### Predictions for the Future of the European War; Time Favors Britain and France

London – The war has entered its second month. Predictions from all sides about the possibilities for the future unanimously believe that time is actually in favor of the Allied countries. "Waiting for the opportunity" is the best strategy for the Allied countries, that is, to let the German army attack the Maginot Line to exhaust its strength, while the Allied countries intensify their economic blockade of Germany. Regarding this, a certain German official publication once published a warning from Colonel Hiss of the German Economic Bureau, saying that the railways in the Soviet Union, which is more than thirty times larger than France or Germany, have narrower tracks than France and Germany, and are even completely unsuitable for domestic needs, which will greatly hinder the economic assistance that the Soviet Union intends to provide to Germany. It is reported that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has now allowed newspaper reporters to go to the front line, saying that "the time to lift the veil of silence has come," which shows that the commander-in-chief may have considered the Allied position to be quite satisfactory, and it is okay for newspaper reporters to take a look. The number of German planes appearing in the skies over the Western Front is increasing day by day, and their number is greater than that of the Allied planes, but the losses are at least evenly divided at present. British aviators often pretend to be shot down when they encounter overwhelming odds, and then fly straight after leaving the pursuit range, and often escape by this means. Aviation critics are now discussing the new problem of the height that new aircraft can reach. These aircraft can all safely ascend to an altitude of 20,000 feet above the ground, and many can reach 30,000 feet. Aviators may soon need to prepare not only oxygen, but also pressure chambers to resist air pressure. This is not impossible. The aerial battles in Albania, Spain, and China have not provided standards that can be followed in the current aerial battles, because the great powers participating in the current aerial battles have air forces with comparable offensive and defensive equipment.

### Situation in the Baltic Sea Turns Sharply Downward; Lithuania, Latvia, and Finland; The Soviet Union Will Sign Treaties with Them; Latvian Foreign Minister Flies to Moscow; Lithuanian Envoy Meets Soviet Foreign Minister and Returns Home; Situation in the Baltic Sea Takes a Sharp Turn Downward

The Latvian capital's Foreign Minister Menders departed by plane this morning for Moscow. The Soviet Union's envoy to Latvia, Zotov, accompanied him. (Havas wire, 2nd)

The Latvian cabinet held a State Council meeting today, at which Foreign Minister Menders reported on the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Estonia. The cabinet immediately decided to send Foreign Minister Menders to Moscow tomorrow to hold talks with the Soviet government. (Havas wire, 1st)

Latvian capital – Regarding the fact that Latvian Foreign Minister Mendes' visit to Moscow is in line with the wishes of the Soviet government, it is difficult to know for sure at present, but what can be said with certainty is that the Soviet government seems to intend to sign the same agreement with Latvia as it did with the Soviet and Estonian states a few days ago. It is said that the Soviet government is now paying attention to obtaining the privilege of handling the Latvian port of Ribaya. According to this port, it belonged to Russia before the World War in 1914, and it was only after the war that it belonged to Latvia. People in political circles here claim that the government held a special meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to accept the Soviet request. (Haitong, 2nd)

Berlin – The semi-official German News Agency has just received news from the Finnish capital stating that the evolution of the Baltic Sea situation is being closely watched by Finnish political circles. It is said that Latvia is about to be forced to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union, the nature of which is not much different from the mutual assistance treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Estonia. In other words, Latvia will allow the Soviet Union to use the ice-free ports of Riba and Wende, but not Riga. The port of Riba is not far from Germany's new border and can be reached by car in just one hour. (Havas wire, 2nd)

Berlin – According to news from the Lithuanian capital, the country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Battis, has returned home to report on his duties. This has nothing to do with the rumor that the Soviet Union has expressed to the country its desire to sign a friendship treaty, but not a mutual assistance agreement, so it is not the same as the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Estonia. (Havas wire, 2nd)

Moscow – Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Molotov held a long talk with the Lithuanian envoy yesterday, and it is said that the content was to discuss the issue of Vilnius. According to Vilnius, it was originally Lithuanian territory, but it was occupied by Poland after the World War. However, the city is still designated as the capital of Lithuania in the Lithuanian constitution. Recently, the city has been assigned to the Soviet military occupation zone. (Haitong wire, 2nd)

London – Radio Rome broadcast this morning that, according to official information from Moscow, the Soviet government will propose to the governments of Finland and Latvia in the near future to sign a mutual assistance treaty, the content of which will be similar to that signed by the Soviet Union and Estonia.

These proposals include the establishment of a small buffer state between Germany and the Soviet Union. This new Poland will be entirely inhabited by Poles, with Warsaw as its capital. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin this time was to clarify the new situation so that Italy's cooperation could be secured when this peace proposal was put forward. (Reuters wire, 2nd)

Berlin – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to his country by special train at noon today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the station to see him off. The official has just issued a communiqué stating, "Foreign Minister Ciano's trip was at the invitation of the German government." After listing the names of the dignitaries who were greeted at the station, it also said, "Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said goodbye in a very sincere manner." The radio station here added a word, saying that the Italian and German foreign ministers also held a conversation this morning. As for the content, the government did not say anything.

The German Foreign Minister was also present. He left at 9:15 and went to the German Foreign Minister's residence for a banquet. (Haitong wire, 1st)

### Chamberlain Seems to Be Waiting; Postpones Declaration to Today

London – At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Labor Party leader Major Adly asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he could explain anything about the statement to be issued by Germany and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that he did not intend to make any statement today, but would wait until tomorrow. (Havas wire, 2nd)

London – Several newspapers today commented on Hitler's "peace offensive." The Times stated that if the special peace conditions that Germany and the Soviet Union are prepared to put forward are not much different from those announced in Moscow on Friday, then the public's opposition to this barbaric declaration has predetermined our reply. Any conditions put forward by Hitler cannot change the main purpose of the Western European powers, that is, for the sake of ensuring future security, Hitler's power must be deprived so that he cannot repeat his crimes. The world knows that Hitler's credibility can no longer be trusted, so overthrowing Hitlerism should be a prerequisite for all negotiations. The Daily Telegraph said that this "peace proposal" must be attached with conditions that no country with the power of free choice can accept. Forcing countries that are still seeking to submit to consider peace proposals will inevitably fail. The Daily News also said that Hitler's request for peace is due to his weakness and inability to simultaneously enemy Britain and France. We must not allow the aggressor to keep his loot. There will be no peace until the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia are free from the tyranny of the National Socialist Party. The Daily Express stated that the peace conditions proposed by Hitler may not be acceptable to us, because democratic countries now know the value of what Hitler said. They have realized what Hitlerism is. There will be no room for negotiating peace with Germany when Czechoslovakia has not been freed from the shackles and Poland is bleeding. (Reuters wire, 2nd)

### London Rumors; Hitler Prepares to Step Down

London – According to today's Daily Mirror online, Hitler will express his intention to step down when the German Parliament meets this week. It is said that this is Hitler's cleverest way to retreat. Approximately, Hitler will say to the parliament that others have stated that the war objective is a way to deal with, approximately Hitler will say to the Parliament that others have stated that the war objective is to strike Hitlerism. Now I am prepared to step down and have created a great Germany. I hereby transfer the important task to Goring. Also, according to the Daily Chronicle, rumors about Hitler considering stepping down have been very prevalent in recent days. (Associated Press wire, 2nd)

### Editorial: Developing the Southwest and the Inflow of Capital

Since the outbreak of military resistance against Japan, the coastal and riverside provinces of China have suffered greatly. The major commercial ports such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have almost ceased to be international trade hubs, and the Yangtze River, once known as the economic artery, has lost its function of regulation. China's economic center has moved west along with millions of people from the southeast. The voices of "developing the Southwest" and "self-reliance" have spread far and wide.

The so-called Southwest refers to the six provinces of Sichuan, Kang (former Xikang), Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi. Its area reaches over 5.7 million square miles, with a population of 130 million. The natural resources are abundant, yet much remains undeveloped. It is shielded by mountains and lakes, advantageous for military offense and defense. It also borders Myanmar and Vietnam, providing convenient international transportation. To the northwest are the provinces of Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu, offering a vast and magnificent world. With the war of resistance still ongoing, the Southwest is an inexhaustible source of manpower and resources. The key to victory lies here. However, discussions on the Southwest often mention that it has all the conditions for development except for a shortage of capital. But if we observe the Shanghai market, the trade deficit is huge, and speculation is rampant. Isn't this a sign of abundant floating capital? The so-called shortage of capital for developing the Southwest is not because China lacks capital, but simply because the capital does not flow to the Southwest. Why is this the case? Those who possess capital: lack foresight, firstly; lack ambition, secondly; ignore the dangers of speculation, mistakenly believing it to be a shortcut to wealth, thirdly; Shanghai and the Southwest have long had a lack of connection, with insufficient understanding of the Southwest, fourthly; the lifestyle and habits that make those accustomed to Shanghai life regard the Southwest as a daunting path, fifthly. These five reasons are not only true for Shanghai residents. Many wealthy overseas Chinese are extremely loyal to their homeland, but they know more about treaty ports and less about the situation in the Southwest. However, there are those like Chen Shouming, who organized the "China Western Reclamation and Industrial Company," and Hu Wenhu, who prepared the "Yunnan Border Overseas Chinese Industrial Model Zone," and there are many others whose plans are reportedly underway. In comparison, it is still not as enthusiastic as foreign financiers: In April of this year, the British Chartered Bank held its annual meeting, and its chairman strongly emphasized the importance of investing in the Southwest. American Standard Oil and British Asiatic Petroleum, two major oil companies, have established branches in Sichuan and Yunnan. Ford Motor Company and Dunlop Rubber Company are also planning to establish factories in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. All these concrete facts are not only limited to business operations, but also demonstrate confidence that the Chinese government has the power to ensure the safety of their investments, and that this vast virgin land has a bright future. Shanghai's floating capital has turned to speculation, mainly through buying and selling foreign exchange and hoarding goods. This directly leads to the soaring of the black market for foreign exchange and indirectly increases the burden on citizens. This is a painful reality. The root cause is the conflict between insufficient national consciousness and the pursuit of wealth. The phenomenon of forgetting righteousness for profit is unavoidable even in countries that implement economic control policies. However, the situation in Shanghai is particularly severe, so we must focus on Shanghai and find a way to remedy it. The way to remedy it is not to rely on scolding people for being greedy. Nor should we take this moral concept as the only starting point. We must understand that when examining the advantages and disadvantages, benefit and righteousness are inherently intertwined. The future trend of Shanghai is unpredictable. If Shanghai is like this today, it may not necessarily be like this in the future. Speculation may be tolerated today, and it may seem like there are many opportunities, but if there is a drastic change in the situation, all speculators will inevitably be sacrificed by this change. It is a pity that these people are too eager for profit and too short-sighted to see this. Therefore, we dare to loudly call for the awakening of Shanghai's speculators: The rise of speculative activities is enough to prove the decline of Shanghai's economic future! Speculation is essentially gambling, with gains and losses, and the danger is even greater in this volatile foreign exchange market. Furthermore, let's observe the reality of Shanghai's normal industry and commerce: soaring prices affect the purchasing power of citizens and reduce market demand, firstly; floating capital is almost exclusively occupied by speculative activities, and financial institutions are wary of lending to enterprises, making it increasingly difficult to circulate capital, secondly; products from the occupied areas are shipped to Shanghai, and the production equipment within the area is monopolized and manipulated, creating a "borrowing a corpse to return the soul" situation, which Shanghai's normal industrialists and businessmen cannot compete with, thirdly; domestic sales channels are closed due to blockades, fourthly. From all these, it can be seen that the "abnormal prosperity" within the isolated island is declining. Shanghai's floating capital is most likely to perish along with the speculative market. Why are those who possess capital so confused and staying in Shanghai? Leaving Shanghai for the Southwest is not only a matter of national consciousness. It is also inevitable to consider the advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the door to investing in the Southwest is wide open, and the National Government has taken many measures, such as encouraging and protecting private industries, developing transportation, assisting the relocation of factories to the west, facilitating financial circulation, accepting miscellaneous currencies, remitting and paying in cash, and providing free foreign exchange remittances. All these are for the sake of those who are determined to develop the Southwest.

### U.S. Naval Force Gradually Concentrating in the Pacific, Conducting Exercises in Hawaii, Strength Unprecedented in History

Washington - Since the outbreak of the European War, the main force of the U.S. Navy has gradually concentrated in the Pacific. This is the basic policy of the U.S. Navy's deployment during the war. Strategists have long held this view because after the outbreak of the war, the strength of the British Navy is sufficient to control the Atlantic Ocean. The main fleet of the U.S. Navy, led by Admiral Bloch, is still in San Pedro and Santiago. This fleet was suddenly ordered to return on April 15 during exercises in the Atlantic. This fleet has been stationed in the above two locations since March 1932, possessing twelve battleships, twelve heavy cruisers, fifteen light cruisers, four aircraft carriers, seventy destroyers, twelve submarines, and many other small ships. The naval base of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii has added fourteen submarines. The Far East Asian Fleet has two cruisers, thirty-six destroyers, and many submarines, gunboats, and small ships. Therefore, the naval strength of the U.S. Pacific Fleet is extremely strong. There is also a new Atlantic Fleet, led by Rear Admiral Deyo. The main force of this fleet is concentrated in Norfolk and Virginia, with three battleships. The already decommissioned battleship Wyoming has also been added. In addition, there are four heavy cruisers, one aircraft carrier, nineteen destroyers, plus fourteen submarines from the submarine bases of New London and New London. In the Caribbean region, there is also a naval task force with eleven destroyers and eleven gunboats. The Coco Solo base in the Panama Canal Zone also has six submarines and many small ships. The special European fleet, newly formed during the Spanish War, is now stationed in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. After the completion of the great naval plan, it will dominate the globe, and its strength will be stronger than any other country. The newly completed heavy cruiser Wichita and light cruiser St. Louis will soon join the service. There are currently one hundred and two battleships under construction. (Reuter's report on the 2nd)

San Pedro - The U.S. Naval Headquarters announced last night that the government has dispatched fifteen battleships to Hawaii to participate in a major exercise. The departure time will not be announced due to the preservation of military secrets. The Fourth and Sixth Cruiser Squadrons, one aircraft carrier, and the "Florida" Destroyer Squadron will be the first units in the exercise. The cruisers heading to Hawaii are the "Northampton," "Salt Lake City," "Pensacola," "Houston," "Minneapolis," "Astoria," "New Orleans," and "Indianapolis." The "Florida" Destroyer Squadron has a total of thirty-four destroyers and two transports. According to observers, in recent months, the Navy Department will transfer about one hundred battleships to Pearl Harbor. The Navy Department's announcement stated that the Hawaiian exercise will be calculated in fleet units. The first unit will not leave before the second unit arrives. If the strength of the second unit exceeds the first unit, then one hundred battleships on the U.S. West Coast will be concentrated in Honolulu. The Navy Department's announcement stated that this major exercise is a "cruiser training" and that this matter has been under consideration for several months before it was held. This major deployment of naval forces has aroused different speculations from all walks of life, mainly to strengthen the Far East Asian Fleet. According to naval experts, in two months, the concentration of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, in terms of quantity and strength, will be unprecedented in history. After Congress passes the new Neutrality Act, which prohibits U.S. merchant ships from transporting munitions to belligerent countries, more than one hundred U.S. merchant ships will also be transferred to the Pacific for shipping. (Reuter's report on the 2nd)

Tokyo - The U.S. Fleet Commander announced that the United States will dispatch eight Eastern cruisers, approximately thirty destroyers, and one aircraft carrier to concentrate in the Hawaiian Islands. After the news spread, it aroused the attention of military and political figures in Tokyo. The spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that Japanese Admiral Kanazawa clearly stated last Thursday that the Japanese Navy need not worry about the United States increasing its Hawaiian fleet. Under the current circumstances, it is not unusual for neutral countries to hold naval exercises. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

### Northern Poland, Isolated Troops Cease Resistance, Defenders of Hel Peninsula Surrender to Germany, Post-War Work Begins in Warsaw

Berlin - The semi-official German News Agency reported that the defenders of Hel Peninsula in northern Poland (north of the Free City of Danzig) had resisted for a long time and raised a white flag today to cease resistance. They have sent representatives to negotiate surrender with the German commander. The last center of Polish resistance has been eliminated. (Havas report on the 1st)

Danzig - The defenders of the Hel Peninsula in Poland surrendered to the German army yesterday. According to Danzig newspapers, the island's defenders include 250 Polish officers and 400 soldiers. They have now been captured. When the German army attacked Hel, in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, they did not attack with heavy weapons. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Warsaw Front - According to a report from a special correspondent of the Haitong Agency from the Warsaw front, the front line has returned to a state of calm. Not long ago, the German and Polish armies were fighting fiercely here, but now both sides are silent, with only a few sentries stationed there, giving people the impression that this is still a war zone. The German army is now engaged in post-war work. The Poles are also busy cleaning the streets and removing obstacles. The landmines buried by the army are now being safely dug out. The bullet holes in the houses are also being filled. The tram lines that have fallen to the ground are either cut or reconnected, and the repairs are mostly completed. The lives of the residents are gradually returning to normal, and many refugees have also moved back. Except for the shops opened by Jews, the rest are gradually resuming business. The supply of various food items is still difficult to fully resolve for the time being. The authorities are now taking the fastest measures to resolve this urgent task. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)

Berlin - Last night, officials here announced that the Polish garrison on the Hel Peninsula raised a white flag to surrender yesterday. The fighting ceased at 4 p.m. The German commander immediately met with the Polish envoy to conduct takeover negotiations. Since then, Poland's last base has also been abandoned. (Haitong Agency Telegraph on the 2nd)

Danzig - The Beliner Börsen-Zeitung recently published a description by a Polish girl, Hui Ti, who arrived here yesterday, of the terrifying German air raid on Warsaw. According to her, many people died and had to be buried in holes dug in the streets and squares. Many babies were born in air-raid shelters, and many people died in air-raid shelters. Poles, regardless of gender or age, all showed great courage. Whenever someone was injured, the crowd risked their lives to rush out and carry the wounded to a safe place. Boys aged 15 to 18 were all called out to guard Gaholin, 38 miles outside Warsaw. This may have been the most terrible part of the whole tragedy. A reporter for the Politische Zeitung recently flew over Warsaw. According to him, many parts of Warsaw are still burning. He was shocked by the destroyed scene of Warsaw and could not speak. The four Germans in the plane were also shocked and remained silent, with pale faces, sitting silently. (Reuters report on the 2nd)

### Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan Counterattack with Victory, Changsha Remains as Solid as a Rock, Japanese Return Route North of Fulinpu Cut Off, Fierce Fighting Between Shaguo and Huangsha Bridge in Jiangxi

Changsha - Since the Japanese troops invaded Dongting Lake and landed in Yingtian, they have devoted all their efforts to fiercely attacking the Huaxin, Xiangyin and Miluo fronts, intending to drive straight in and take Changsha in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, they have been severely attacked by the defending Chinese troops everywhere, with countless casualties. Recently, the Japanese troops have been advancing south along the Yuehan Railway north of Qiaotouyi, losing troops and generals, but have not succeeded. At the same time, in the Fulinpu and Shangshanshi areas, they have been strongly resisted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. The attacks on Jinjing were also frustrated, and all efforts were in vain. The Japanese troops have been running into walls everywhere, in a state of embarrassment. Although the war in northern Hunan has started with intense flames, after more than ten days of hard fighting by the Chinese troops, the Japanese have gained more losses than gains. Although they are approaching Changsha, in fact, their feet are sinking deeper and deeper, and they have a feeling of regretting their initial decision. At this moment, the Chinese troops around Changsha are becoming more stable and have been counterattacking in maneuvers for days, achieving great success, successively capturing key points such as Wanggong Bridge, Lijiaduan, and Shangshanshi, proving that the Chinese army is becoming stronger in the battle. The exhausted Japanese troops are in a situation of thorns everywhere and are uneasy. Given the past disastrous defeat in Taierzhuang and intimidated by the high combat capability of the Chinese troops' group operations, they are hesitating and not moving forward, fearing repeating the same mistakes. Judging from the current battlefield situation, the Chinese army will have more rapid progress. The Japanese Abe's crazy words of occupying Changsha on October 1st have been completely undermined, and Changsha remains as solid as a rock, only showing his bragging and making him a laughingstock to the world. The so-called all-out invasion of China is nothing more than that. (Hai Telegraph on the 2nd)

Hengyang - Since the outbreak of the war in northern Hunan, the Japanese have planned to invade Changsha with the strength of three divisions. After the Yingtian battle started, the Japanese troops attempted to attack the Chinese flanks and join forces in Miluo, but the Chinese troops in Xinqiang remained firm and did not move. After inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese, they began a strategic shift. In the battle on the south bank of the Miluo River, after several days of fierce fighting, more than 4,000 stubborn Japanese troops were annihilated. The price paid in this Dongting Lake battle was exactly the same as in the Lunan battle. The fierce fighting around Changsha has been unfolding for days. Because the Chinese have favorable terrain in the Yonganshi and Jinjing lines, they have been making greater use of mobile tactics and ambushes everywhere, resulting in heavier losses for the Japanese. The Japanese have been using two divisions to coordinate with northern Jiangxi, invading Tongcheng and Pingjiang. Because the Chinese have favorable mountainous terrain, the Japanese cannot exert their strength on this front. In the past two weeks, the Japanese army has suffered more than 13,000 casualties. After suffering this unprecedented blow, the Japanese attempt to invade Changsha has been clearly frustrated, and the Chinese army has achieved its predetermined goals of attrition warfare and mountain warfare. The Japanese dream of invading Changsha has been shattered by China. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

Changsha - The victorious news of the Chinese army's counterattack in northern Hunan: the Japanese divisions, totaling 100,000 troops, that crossed the Miluo River to invade the south were lured deep by the Chinese, who set up ambushes layer by layer and attacked the waist section by section. In the past five days, countless Japanese troops have been killed. The Chinese army's counterattack on the 1st was particularly fierce. The commanders personally went to the front line to command, boosting morale. The scattered Japanese troops were all defeated separately. The Chinese then took advantage of the victory to recover key points such as Wugong Bridge (northeast of Qiaotouyi) and Lijiaduan (northwest of Fulinpu), capturing many prisoners. A part of the Chinese army has advanced to the north of Fulinpu, cutting off the Japanese return route. The 2,000 remaining Japanese troops near Shangshanshi have fallen into heavy encirclement and cannot retreat. (Telegraph at 5 p.m. on the 2nd)

Chongqing - According to people in the transportation industry speaking to a reporter from the Associated Press, the railway tracks north and south of Changsha have been completely dismantled, so Changsha is now, in fact, no longer a railway center. The recent pause in the Japanese army's advance around Changsha is partly due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, but also partly because the Japanese fear that their rear will be cut off after a light advance and that they will be deeply encircled. (Associated Press report on the 2nd)

Tokyo - Military intelligence received here today states that the Japanese army has been encircling the Chinese 19th Division in northern Hunan since September 23rd. The northern Hunan campaign is currently underway, and its scope is far greater than the Xuzhou or Hankou campaigns. The Chinese army has built the first line of defense along the Xinqiang River and the second line of defense along the Miluo River. The Japanese army landed at two points on the east bank of Dongting Lake and advanced south, attacking the flanks of the Chinese army's second line of defense. Other Japanese troops advanced south from Tongcheng, and the Japanese troops further west also advanced south in several routes. The Japanese troops on the left and right sides have joined forces at Pingjiang, an important outpost of Changsha on the Miluo River. (Reuters report on the 2nd)

Changde - Telephone from Changsha at 10 a.m.: a small group of Japanese soldiers who infiltrated near Yonganshi were ambushed by a certain Chinese unit and were mostly annihilated. A few remaining Japanese troops also fled north. The Japanese troops in that area have been cleared. The Chinese and Japanese troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in the Shangshanshi and Qiaotouyi areas all day today. (Telegraph on the 1st)

Guilin - The Japanese warships in Dongting Lake have increased by 14, along with more than 80 speedboats. They are using Yueyang as a base and harassing the Chinese Huang Gongmiao and Xiaopo Town from time to time. Japanese troop transport between Yueyang and Xiangyin is frequent. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

Guilin - On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese artillery on Jinggang Ridge fired more than 30 shells at the Chinese Jinhe River south bank positions. The infantry made no movements. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

Gaoan - The Japanese troops who invaded the southeast of Xiushui from Shaguo engaged in fierce fighting at Huangsha Bridge. Huangsha Bridge was once captured by the Japanese, but after a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops retreated to Shaguo. The Chinese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese between Huangsha Bridge and Shaguo. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

Gaoan - The Japanese troops on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces invaded the border of Jiangxi province along the highway from Tongcheng a month ago and then infiltrated Longmen Factory east of Pingjiang, attempting to join the Japanese troops in the Fengxin area of northern Jiangxi and put pressure on Changsha. In recent days, the Japanese troops invading western Jiangxi have been subjected to strong attacks by the Chinese army. Repeated reinforcements have only suffered losses and have made no progress. On the 1st, a certain Chinese army launched a large-scale attack on the Japanese troops at Longmen Factory. After fierce fighting, many Japanese troops were killed. The Japanese陣動搖 retreated to Zhuxi Factory north of Tonggu. The Chinese army pursued the victory and occupied Zhuxi Factory in the evening. Currently, the Japanese on the border of Hunan and Hubei have been attacked by China, and the attempt to invade west is difficult to succeed. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

### The Aspirations of the Chinese People Will Surely Be Respected by the Great Powers - The Opinion of Chairman Chiang

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement today, saying: Regarding the rumors that some countries are willing to end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible since the outbreak of the European war, I believe that the great powers will surely respect the aspirations and goals of the Chinese people. We must wait until China completes the goals of this war of resistance before we can talk about peace. The National Government is the only legitimate and recognized authority to decide on peace and war. The great powers will not attach importance to any decision made by the puppet regime on this matter. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek then mentioned the issue of the great powers recognizing the puppet regime, only stating that he believes that no country is willing to violate the emotions of the entire Chinese people, because the purely puppet nature of such a regime is very obvious and need not be elaborated. Even if this kind of recognition is actually realized, it will not have any impact on China's position. It should be known that although Germany and Italy have recognized "Manchukuo" for two years, the Manchurian problem is still unresolved. (Reuters report on the 2nd)

### Japanese Troops in Central Anhui Occupy Luan

More than a thousand Japanese troops in Anqing divided their forces and invaded Luojialing, Huangshiling, and Yuexingshan, and shelled the Chinese positions towards Tongcheng and Liantan. They are still confronting each other. (Telegraph on the 2nd)

### Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recovers Yushe

Luoyang: There has been no fighting on the northern section of the Baigui Highway. The Japanese have recently been successful in China, occupying Yushe with more than a thousand troops. Since the 28th, after a Chinese unit braved intense Japanese artillery fire and launched a fierce counterattack with all-night assaults, causing many Japanese casualties. At dawn on the 29th, the Chinese army again selected many daredevils who charged with bayonets, engaging in fierce fighting for half a day. The Japanese were increasingly unable to withstand the attacks and began to retreat towards Wu'xiang.

### Japanese Troops in Various Strongholds in Central Hubei Extremely Panicked

Fancheng: The war situation in central Hubei has once again reached a stalemate. Although the Chinese army is still pressing forward step by step against the Japanese with a valiant stance, it is ultimately unable to break through the Japanese fortifications, which have been constantly strengthened over the months due to inferior firepower. However, the Japanese troops trapped in various strongholds are extremely panicked. Recently, a gas delivery team was transported from Hankou to Yuekou, Zhongxiang, and other places for reinforcement.

The Japanese reserve team between Guangshui and Huayuan also went to the front lines in northern Hubei to resist the Chinese army's advance.

### Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Announce Domestic and Foreign Policy: Maintain Neutrality in the European War and Focus on Resolving the Sino-Japanese War, Hoping to Gain Understanding from the United States and Resolve Issues with the Soviet Union

Tokyo: At the meeting of local governors on the 2nd, Foreign Minister Nomura delivered a speech thoroughly explaining Japan's foreign policy. He said, "At the meeting of local governors in May of this year, Foreign Minister Arita explained that the Japanese government was adopting a policy of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and was negotiating with Germany and Italy. However, the situation in Europe subsequently underwent rapid changes, centering on the Danzig issue. On August 24, Germany and the Soviet Union actually concluded a non-aggression pact, and the aforementioned negotiations were terminated. After the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the situation in Europe deteriorated. On August 31, German and Polish forces began fighting. On September 3, Britain and France both declared war on Germany in accordance with their promise to Poland. The German army swept through most of Poland with lightning speed in a matter of days. On September 17, the Soviet Union suddenly sent troops into Poland and occupied its eastern regions without bloodshed. The Soviet Union's decision to send troops into Poland was presumably the result of a prior understanding with Germany. After the Soviet army's advance, the German army gradually decided to retreat, and now the Soviet Union occupies about half of the Polish territory in the oil region. On September 29, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Moscow on demarcating the new borders of the two countries. The origins of this European war are extremely profound, and its future is difficult to predict. It is feared that it will last for a long time, but it differs somewhat from the previous European war, containing more diplomatic, economic, and ideological warfare than military warfare. After receiving news of Britain and France declaring war on Germany, the Japanese government temporarily decided on a policy of 'At this time when the European war has broken out, Japan will not join the war and will concentrate on resolving the China Incident', and announced this to China and foreign countries on September 4. In the case of a state of war occurring between third countries, any non-participating country automatically enjoys and bears the rights and obligations of neutrality under international law, regardless of whether a declaration of neutrality has been made. Therefore, the Japanese government's statement on September 4 can be said to be Japan's statement of its attitude towards the European war in a certain sense. The reason for adopting this method of expression is to imply that Japan's policy is always based on resolving the China Incident, and its foreign policy and attitude towards third countries are also determined based on this basis. The Japanese government plans to implement a multi-faceted and comprehensive foreign policy after fully considering the situation in Europe in accordance with its established policy for handling the Incident, in order to cope with the current extraordinary situation. Judging from a synthesis of various information, what Japan seeks from China is political and economic cooperation between Japan and China. It would be wrong to think that Japan intends to close the door to China and exclude the economic activities of third countries. Japan has consistently sought to eliminate the concerns of third countries on this point and will continue to take extra steps to express this attitude and induce third countries to abandon their pro-Chiang attitude. As for relations with Britain, the so-called Anglo-Japanese talks were held in Tokyo in July of this year. As a result, Britain recognized in principle that within the region under the influence of Japanese military power in China, Britain would control its actions that harmed our interests and benefited the enemy. However, with regard to the specific handling of the Tianjin issue, Britain did not agree to our demands, and the meeting broke down. Regarding the United States, Japan intends to continue its efforts in the future so that the United States can fully understand Japan's true intentions. Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, as a result of negotiations in Moscow regarding the Nomonhan Incident, an armistice agreement was concluded on September 15 between Ambassador Togo and Foreign Minister Molotov. The government plans to gradually resolve the outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union in the future." (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

Tokyo: Prime Minister Abe said in his address at the local governors' meeting: "The government issued a statement earlier, starting with the essence of the national polity. We firmly believe that clarifying the concept of the national polity, based on the spirit of Japan's traditions since the founding of the nation, that is, the spirit of supporting the imperial fortunes and the spirit of serving the public and sacrificing private interests, and focusing on all aspects of internal and external administration to guide and develop today's era, is the primary duty of the national government. The current domestic and foreign policies are based on this spirit. Hereby, I seek your understanding and cooperation on two or three of the current important tasks listed therein: (1) The current international situation is complex and delicate, and its trends are unpredictable. Japan cannot be content with complacency in this situation. It must stand on its own position, ensure Japan's position, uphold its claims, and open up opportunities for reform. Moreover, Japan's greatest problem today is the handling of the China Incident and the construction of a new order in East Asia. Therefore, it is necessary to place the core of policy in the handling of the China Incident and integrate and concentrate all internal and external policies under this objective. The fundamental policy for handling the China Incident has been decided and will not change with the change of the cabinet. The new central government will also be established soon. The Japanese government is determined to further assist its establishment and cooperate with it to complete the handling of the Incident. However, it would be a mistake to regard the establishment of the new central government as the end of the Incident. Today, our mission is not only to restore peace. The highest goal of our handling of the Incident is the integration of China, Japan, and Manchuria. No matter how the international situation changes, this goal is unshakeable. Therefore, although we have declared that we will not participate in the war when the European war breaks out, this is by no means merely to stand aloof and watch from the sidelines. If there are those who understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate in improving the situation in East Asia, Japan will regard them as friendly countries and jointly cooperate in the progress of East Asia and the world. Otherwise, Japan will also seize all opportunities and make all efforts to guide them to an appropriate position. As for countries that are unwilling to understand Japan's sincerity with malice, Japan has no choice but to resolve to deal with them with decisive measures. (2) In order to handle the China Incident, it is necessary to pay attention to the trends of other countries and eliminate matters that hinder the construction of a new order in East Asia. Domestically, we must vigorously strengthen military preparations and concentrate on cultivating national strength. The current state of affairs within the country has reached a point where various departments and levels cannot be allowed to develop arbitrarily and in a non-uniform manner. Therefore, we must make extra efforts to expand comprehensive economic power, make its use effective, and strengthen the national general mobilization system. For this reason, it is necessary to promote the implementation of the production capacity expansion plan and establish an integrated plan for China, Japan, and Manchuria. Therefore, we intend to hasten the establishment of new trade merchants and the strengthening and improvement of other trade systems. In order to ensure that the country's strength is exerted most effectively, we are currently promoting the initiation of the National General Mobilization Law and planning the wartime systemization of industry and economy. This requires the entire nation to promote its spirit of public service in order to achieve perfect results. Therefore, officials must first advocate and practice it for the people, so that the people can truly understand its purpose." (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### American Writer Talks About Japan's Intentions

Honolulu: American writer Mr. Lamb, who resided in China for 25 years, arrived here today and is about to return to the United States. According to his observations, the foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as Hong Kong, will inevitably be taken over by the Japanese during the course of this European war, but it will not be long before they are. Moreover, signs of economic collapse have already been found in Japan's war against China. (United Press of America, 2nd)

### Members of the New Polish Government Sworn In, the United States Considers the Issue of Recognition

Paris: Under the leadership of Prime Minister General Sikorski, the Polish government was sworn into office here yesterday. Former Polish President Mościcki is currently being detained in Romania. He resigned on Saturday and transferred his powers to former Senate Speaker Raczkiewicz. The new president expressed his respect for the Polish nation and people and awarded Warsaw the Virtuti Militari military cross. The government decided to invite the pianist-statesman Paderewski to cooperate. Sikorski told reporters that he intended to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier today to discuss the status of the Polish government in France. He hoped to organize six to eight divisions of Polish troops to continue fighting the German army on the Western Front. He will appeal to the 500,000 Polish people living in the United States, requesting them to join the Polish army. (United Press of America, 2nd)

Paris: The Polish Embassy in France issued a communique stating, "Members of the new Polish government paid a visit to the new President Raczkiewicz this morning and were sworn into office. President Raczkiewicz also decided to invite former President Paderewski to come out of retirement and support the new Polish government." Paderewski, a virtuoso pianist and Polish patriot, is over seventy years old and has contributed to the restoration of Poland during the last European war. (Havas, 1st)

Washington: The new Polish government was declared established in Paris, and the Polish ambassador to the United States, Potocki, has notified the US State Department. Diplomatic circles here have commented that the US government recognizes this government as the legal successor to the original legitimate government of Poland in accordance with the constitution, and it is not necessary to issue recognition procedures again. US Ambassador to Poland Biddle will continue to serve in Paris as usual, and Secretary of State Hull will also express his continued recognition in his reply. In addition, the issue of recognition is quite delicate if the talk of establishing a new Czech government in Paris comes to fruition. The US government has not decided on its attitude, because Czech President Beneš has resigned, and he has no authority to organize a new government in accordance with the constitution. However, given the circumstances of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, there is still much room for research on whether the current government in Prague is the government of our constitution. (Havas, 1st)

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after Polish President Mościcki resigned, the Polish cabinet held a meeting in Sinaia, Romania, yesterday to discuss the aftermath and then issued a communique.

Romanian political figures also stated that "Although Mościcki has resigned, he and the members of his cabinet are still political figures and should be taken care of. Romania's strict implementation of its neutrality policy will not be changed as a result." (Havas, 2nd)

### German-Hungarian Negotiations

Budapest: A Hungarian newspaper published an article on the front page yesterday discussing the fact that Hungary's northern border is now adjacent to the Soviet Union after the collapse of Poland. The "Magyarság" commented, "The territories of the Soviet Union and Hungary are adjacent to each other, becoming neighbors. This is the first time in a thousand years. Hungary is now situated between two major powers, Germany with a population of 90 million and the Soviet Union with vast resources. Which should it follow, Qi or Chu?" Former Foreign Minister Gratacz wrote in "Napló", "Today, Hungary should adjust its foreign policy in accordance with the Three Emperors' League plan drafted by Bismarck and Andrássy. Hungary should fulfill its humble mission and devote its full efforts to promoting good relations with neighboring countries and eliminating the possibility of friction." (Haitong, 2nd)

### Panama Canal Zone Strengthens Defenses to Prevent Espionage Activities

Washington: The US government has taken special measures to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone to prevent the activities of foreign spies and the labor unrest of workers in the country. However, official sources say that this is purely preventive. The government has not received any information. The great defense plan of the Canal Zone will include the construction of an air force base and the addition of anti-aircraft guns and coastal batteries at a cost of $277,000,000. Garrison troops will also be added to various key points along the coast. The details of this great plan have not been announced due to military secrets. Similar measures have been taken in aircraft factories, munitions factories, and the government throughout the United States. Secretary of War Woodring has just completed his inspection of the Canal Zone. This great plan will make the waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean safe on land, sea, and air. According to military experts, this canal is of great importance to US national defense. The opening and closing of the canal locks is a point to be noted in all cases.

### Yale University President Denounces Germany

New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University began its next academic year yesterday. President Seymour gave a speech, saying that if the strategic territories held by Britain and France in the western Atlantic were owned by Germany, the United States would inevitably suffer immeasurable and serious threats. In short, if Germany were to win, it would be a great disaster for the United States. Since international trust has been destroyed by Germany, the future of human civilization depends on what kind of courageous, wise, and unselfish spirit the United States can use to deal with the scourge of the world.

### More Than Thirty Japanese Planes Night Raid Chengdu, Chinese Side Suffers No Losses

Chengdu: Two batches of Japanese planes, totaling more than thirty, launched a night raid on Chengdu City on the morning of the 2nd. They dropped many bombs in the north and south suburbs. When the Japanese planes approached the city's airspace at 1:40 AM, Chinese anti-aircraft units were already on high alert. The brave Chinese Air Force immediately met them head-on. Chinese ground anti-aircraft units also displayed their power at the same time. In addition, the city's blackout measures were strictly enforced, and the Japanese planes were unable to find their targets, hastily dropping bombs blindly in the suburbs before fleeing. The Chinese Air Force bravely pursued and attacked along the way, and the Japanese planes were extremely embarrassed, almost losing formation. After the air raid alert in Chengdu City was lifted at 4:30 AM, a detailed investigation revealed no losses. (2nd Dispatch)

Chongqing: A large squadron of Japanese planes took advantage of a night with a bright moon and sparse stars to attack Sichuan from western Hubei. After the Japanese planes intruded into Sichuan territory, the Chinese Air Force took off to engage them. However, the Japanese planes divided into several batches and flew north towards northern Sichuan after passing through Chongqing. They also intruded into the airspace of Chengdu City, dropped bombs, and then hurriedly turned back, attempting to escape along their original route. However, it was already late at night, and white fog filled the air. The Japanese planes then scattered in groups of three or five, searching for a way out. They still fled east along the river. The Chongqing Air Defense Command issued an emergency alert, which was lifted only after the Japanese planes had flown far away. (2nd Dispatch)

Chongqing: An alert was issued here before midnight yesterday, stating that 27 Japanese planes had flown into Sichuan Province and had bombed Chengdu this morning. The fighter planes here took off to defend, but the Japanese planes did not pass through Chongqing, but instead infiltrated Chengdu. The alert in Chongqing was only lifted at 5:00 AM this morning. (Associated Press, 2nd)

Chongqing: When Japanese planes flew over Chongqing last night to attack Chengdu, the people here took shelter in air raid shelters for five hours. At 11:30 PM, Japanese planes were seen flying towards Chongqing, and an air raid alert was issued here. The Japanese bombers flew in two teams north of Chongqing, without attempting to attack Chongqing, and continued to fly west, bombing a certain place in northern Sichuan Province. Then, they flew to Chengdu and bombed it. Because the Japanese planes encountered dense fog, they circled for some time before finding their way back to their base. Chongqing lifted the alert at 4:30 AM. (Reuters, 2nd)

Luoyang: On the morning of the 29th of last month, the artillery of a certain Chinese unit shelled the Japanese troops in Qinyang, firing more than a hundred shells, most of which hit their target. The Japanese suffered heavy losses.

### Slight Chaos on the Kowloon Border

Hong Kong: The situation on the border of the leased territory this morning is slightly chaotic. Six Japanese planes attacked the area near Fangling (transliteration) yesterday and are still active. It is understood that the Japanese army still occupies several villages on the border. News in Chinese newspapers of a large-scale attack by the Chinese army seems to be exaggerated. According to independent investigations, the Chinese army involved in the battle of Shatoujiao yesterday was very small in number. However, it is understood that 4,000 Chinese soldiers have indeed arrived near the border, so it is expected that the fighting will continue to develop. (Reuters, 2nd)

Hong Kong: According to reliable sources today, Chinese guerrillas on the Kowloon border have cut off the Japanese army's transportation line between Nantou, Shenzhen, and Shatoujiao. It is also heard that Japanese naval landing forces have landed in Mirs Bay to prevent Chinese forces from Huizhou from reinforcing the Chinese forces on the Kowloon border. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Diary of Japanese Planes' Frenzied Bombing of Guangdong and Guangxi: Southern Guangdong and Liuzhou Suffer Greatly, Chinese Air Force Intercepts Over Liuzhou

Guangzhou Correspondence: Over the past month, Japanese planes have attacked towns in Guangdong and Guangxi countless times, causing severe disasters. A comprehensive record of the situation in various places is as follows:

August 29th: Twenty-one Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed Nanning and Wuming in Guangxi Province. Seventeen bombs were dropped in Wuming. The Weiwenguang Theater, the foot of the city wall north of the theater, and other places were hit. The theater was destroyed, as well as a Christian church. More than ten civilian houses were also destroyed, and one man was injured. Six bombs fell on Santang Road, including a dud bomb, causing little damage, except for three large ox carts slightly damaged by Japanese planes' machine gun strafing. At the same time, thirteen bombs fell on Xinyu Street in Sitang, destroying a certain Suo Li hall, more than ten civilian houses, killing one man, one woman, and two children, and injuring nine men and women. Three bombs fell near Wutang Road, destroying one postal vehicle. On the same day, Japanese planes flew to Fangcheng and Bailongwei to bomb, destroying two civilian houses and injuring two poor people. In the early morning of the 30th, two batches of seven Japanese planes invaded Guangxi Province and bombed Guixian, wreaking havoc before heading out to sea. A third batch of nine Japanese planes flew to Hengxian and divided into two batches. One attacked Wuzhou and wreaked havoc, bombing before heading out to sea. A fourth batch of nine Japanese planes also flew to Nanning in Guangxi Province to bomb, then headed out to sea via Santang. A fifth batch of nine Japanese planes bombed Longzhou and Pingxiang, with unknown losses. In the afternoon, another nine Japanese planes broke into Qianjiang, repeatedly bombing. At the same time, another eight Japanese planes reconnoitered Yongnao, Binyang, Douxu, Shanglin, and Qianjiang. After the previous batch of Japanese planes bombed Qianjiang, the eight planes followed and flew back out to sea.

On the morning of September 1st, nine Japanese planes invaded the county seat of Maoming County in Guangdong Province, dropping fifteen bombs, killing and injuring several people. The remaining losses were temporarily unknown. The Japanese planes, showing their ferocity, invaded Gaozhou again, circling and reconnoitering before heading south. On the same morning, six Japanese planes invaded the county seat of Lianjiang County, destroying six civilian houses and injuring two people. Another seventeen Japanese planes invaded Guangxi Province, flying from Binyang to Liuzhou and bombing. Another batch of eight planes flew northwest from Hechi to attack Guangxi, reaching Baoyang and dropping bombs twice, with unknown losses. Another eight Japanese planes invaded Huaxian County in Guangdong Province, circling and reconnoitering before dropping eight bombs. The auditorium of a certain middle school and the head seat of a vocational school were destroyed, killing and injuring more than seventy people, marking the most tragic air disaster in Huaxian since the air raids began.

On the morning of the 2nd, eleven Japanese planes invaded Guangxi, dropping eight bombs over Guixian, landing near a certain railway station, sugar factory, and in the suburbs, destroying seven or eight civilian houses and killing and injuring two people. A second batch of six Japanese planes bombed Gaoyao City in Guangdong Province, dropping fourteen bombs, with eight landing near the Guangkou factory, three in Qingguan Cemetery, and three near a certain hospital, with unknown casualties.

At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, five Japanese planes flew north from Hainan Island, passing through Qinzhou and Xiaodong, and invading Nanning's airspace in Guangxi Province, before attacking Wuming. At 8:03 AM, they invaded Binyang's airspace, dropping many bombs, before heading south via Hutao. At 7:46 AM on the same morning, six Japanese planes arrived at Longtan, part of Bobai County in Guangxi Province, and invaded Yulin's airspace, dropping more than ten bombs, which exploded immediately, destroying nine civilian houses and injuring two civilians. The Japanese planes also fired more than a thousand rounds of machine gun fire. At 2:08 PM, they dropped more than ten explosive and incendiary bombs over Yulin again, setting three fires in the city. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes strafed with machine guns before flying west. At 2:12 PM, they dropped several bombs in Bailong under the jurisdiction of Yuye, heading south. At around 10:00 AM on the same morning, eleven Japanese planes arrived over Guixian and dropped dozens of bombs before fleeing south. At 2:43 PM, twenty-five Japanese planes were discovered over Hepu in Guangdong Province, heading towards Liuzhou. The brave Chinese Air Force took off from a certain location and waited in the air to engage them. At 3:27 PM, when the Japanese planes broke into Liuzhou's airspace, the Chinese planes engaged them in an aerial battle, lasting for more than ten minutes. The Japanese planes then hastily dropped dozens of bombs before rushing back to their original routes. At 4:22 PM, they passed through Guixian again and dropped several bombs before heading out to sea. This time, the Japanese planes attacked Liuzhou, setting fire to civilian houses in the north and south of the river several times, which were only extinguished at night. It was found that the Japanese planes had dispatched a total of fifty-two planes to bomb Baoyang, Yulin, Guixian, Liuzhou, and other places that day, demonstrating their increasingly fierce acts of aggression.

### Severe Rice Shortage in Zhangzhou, Price Per Catty Reaches 1.5 Yuan, Authorities Have No Relief Measures

Zhangzhou Correspondence: Zhangzhou has fertile land and abundant products. The amount of grains, fruits, and other agricultural products transported to other ports each year reaches several million yuan. In the past, the amount transported to Quanzhou and Xiamen each year also reached tens of thousands of yuan. After Xiamen Island fell, maritime transport was blockaded by Japanese warships, and the rural economy showed signs of exhaustion. This summer, Zhangzhou has suffered repeated floods, especially in mid-June when the early rice was just ripening and was flooded for several days, resulting in the greatest losses. The early rice harvest was sharply reduced. After the late rice was transplanted, it was repeatedly flooded, resulting in many losses as well. As a result, rice merchants and wealthy farmers, who were experienced, knew the inevitable trend of rising rice prices and rushed to buy and hoard large quantities. Smuggling merchants, because of the high profits from selling rice in Gulangyu at high prices, disregarded national laws and popular outrage and stepped up smuggling, transporting rice to Gulangyu. In addition, the neighboring areas of Quanzhou and other counties could not self-supply rice, and both military and civilian food supplies had to rely on Zhangzhou. Under these circumstances, an unprecedented rice shortage was created, creating the ridiculous situation where people in rice-producing areas had no rice to eat.

In the past, during the summer and autumn seasons after the early rice harvest, the price of rice in Zhangzhou was about one yuan for two "dou". Even if it was slightly more expensive, it would only cost a few extra cents. Even during the winter, when rice prices were high, it would only be about one yuan. At that time, many people were already complaining, but who knew that this July, the price of rice in Zhangzhou would break a hundred-year record, with new rice selling for more than 1.2 yuan per "dou," an unprecedented strange phenomenon. And recently, there has been a tragic situation where people with money cannot buy rice. Many poor people have been without food for several days because they have nowhere to buy rice, and there have even been a few old people who committed suicide because they could not buy rice.

The local authorities have paid attention to providing relief for the rice shortage, but have never found an appropriate solution. Initially, they worked hard under the "Price Stabilization Committee," trying to lower rice prices. However, this method was superficial and played into the hands of the rice merchants. Because the "Price Stabilization Committee" nominally suppressed rice prices, large and small rice shops all announced that they had no rice. Therefore, people who wanted to buy rice had to be on good terms with the rice shop owners and sign a pledge not to reveal the secret before they could buy some rice at the "highest" price, which was more than the standard price set by the Price Stabilization Committee by 10 cents or more per person. Only a small amount could be purchased. Large quantities of rice were secretly dispersed and hoarded in the suburbs, and were smuggled out to take advantage of the price difference.

Subsequently, the severity of the rice shortage problem was beyond the power of the Price Stabilization Committee to resolve, so the authorities organized a "Grain Regulation Committee" and decided to implement grain control. However, the work was only done superficially, and the actual effects were not significant. People still had no rice to eat everywhere. Under the control, the price of rice has risen to 1.5 yuan for new rice and more than 2 yuan for old rice. If this situation continues, who can say that social order will not be affected?

### Common Required Courses for University Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Colleges (Part 1) Recently Announced by the Ministry of Education

(Chongqing Supplement): The Ministry of Education has previously formulated and promulgated an order for the common required courses for the three colleges of arts, sciences, and law. Now, it has formulated the common required courses for the three colleges of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and promulgated an order. The details are as follows:

College of Agriculture: The common required courses are prescribed as follows: Chinese Language, Agronomy or Horticulture, each 4 credits; Foreign Language, Chemistry, each 6 to 8 credits; Botany, 6 credits; Zoology, 3 to 6 credits; Geology, 3 to 4 credits; Economics and Agricultural Economics, 4 to 6 credits; Farm Practice, 2 credits, totaling 38 to 44 credits. The distribution is divided into two years, for example, in the first academic year: Chinese Language, 4 credits, divided into 2 credits for the first semester and 2 credits for the second semester; Foreign Language and Chemistry, each 6 to 8 credits, with 3 to 4 credits for each semester. The rest can be inferred by analogy. However, Economics and Agricultural Economics, 4 to 6 credits, are listed as 1 credit in the first semester of the first academic year, and 2 to 3 credits in each semester of the second academic year. In total, each subject has 17 to 21 credits in the first semester and 17 to 21 credits in the second semester of the first academic year, and 2 to 3 credits in each semester of the second academic year. (Note): Chinese Language and Foreign Language require writing an essay every two weeks. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits. Physics and Mathematics are required courses for the Agricultural Engineering Department, Agricultural Chemistry Department, and Forestry Department. Each school may teach them in the first two academic years, but they are not listed in the above-mentioned courses. For subjects with 3 to 4, 3 to 6, or 6 to 8 credits, each school may decide on the number of credits within this provision, taking the circumstances into account. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits.

College of Commerce: The common required courses are prescribed as follows: Chinese Language, Mathematics, Economics, and Public Finance, each 6 credits; Foreign Language, 6 to 8 credits; Commercial History and Economic Geography, each 3 to 4 credits; Introduction to Law, 4 to 6 credits; Accounting, 8 to 10 credits, totaling 48 to 56 credits. The distribution is divided into two years, with Commercial History (3 to 4 credits) listed in the first year, and Introduction to Law (4 to 6 credits) listed in both semesters of the second year. In total, each subject has 19 to 22 credits in both semesters of the first year, and 5 to 6 credits in both semesters of the second year. (Note): Chinese Language and Foreign Language require writing an essay every two weeks. Commercial History includes both Chinese and world parts. Mathematics focuses on applications in commerce. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits. For subjects with 3 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, or 8 to 10 credits, each school may decide on the number of credits within this provision, taking the circumstances into account.

### Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (4) – The UK's Laissez-faire System

Teacher education in European continental countries, from beginning to end, has always been under the principle of national leadership, each pursuing its own policy of teacher control. However, the island nation of England seems to disregard this surging trend and maintains its consistent traditional spirit of freedom, namely a laissez-faire system. Examining the issue of teachers in the UK, initially there was Burgess, who advocated the so-called pupil-teacher system, also known as the senior student-teacher system. In 1835, Lobach proposed to emulate France and establish normal schools, but it was not approved by Parliament. In 1839, the national normal school movement was once brewing, but it was opposed by religious education groups, resulting in no outcome. Only the Battersea Training College, founded privately, was realized and subsequently received government subsidies. By 1850, as many as sixteen private normal schools received government subsidies. Students in these schools who wished to become teachers could receive government subsidies for their tuition. This pupil-teacher system was originally introduced from the Netherlands and later coexisted with the senior student-teacher system. Some traces of it may still remain today. In 1848, the government subsidized private normal schools for their construction costs and also provided ongoing maintenance fees. Therefore, in fact, the expenses of teacher education in England were already borne by the government. In the United States, Franklin founded a teacher training institute in Philadelphia in 1749, marking the beginning of normal schools in America. In 1823, a private normal school appeared in Vermont, significantly influenced by the Prussian normal school at the time. Cousin's report on Prussian public education was translated and published for Americans. The book's content provided detailed information about the public schools in Prussia, and its introduction stimulated the development of public education. Consequently, James Carter, known as the "father of American teacher education," also vigorously recommended to the Massachusetts legislature in 1838 the passage of a bill to establish normal schools. The following year, he realized his plan in Lexington. Subsequently, various states followed suit, promoting it continuously. Therefore, in form, American teacher education is not entirely the same as that in England, but in essence, it is largely similar, as the selection of subjects and the design of curricula are all left to the freedom of the school authorities.

The English government has always adopted a supportive attitude towards teacher education, not only for private educational training initiatives but also for teacher training departments attached to universities or higher education institutions, which also receive subsidies to promote their development. From 1902, secondary schools in larger university districts were also permitted to establish normal schools, with the construction costs borne by the national treasury. As a result, those aspiring to become teachers could study at secondary schools, and the pupil-teacher system gradually disappeared. Currently, the common background of elementary school teachers in England is to transfer from secondary schools to normal schools or university teacher training departments. The age of admission to secondary schools is twelve, still in early childhood, and they should not be required to consider their future and make a decision. At sixteen, they should first take the preferential student examination. Those who pass receive generous treatment such as exemption from tuition fees. Those who aspire to become teachers can enter normal schools or university teacher training departments at seventeen after passing an examination. However, the qualifications for admission primarily emphasize health certificates and identity certificates, with importance also placed on appearance and demeanor. After 1928, normal schools were removed from the supervision of the central government and were managed by local education departments. Religious and non-religious organizations could also operate them. In 1931, there were 74 two-year normal schools nationwide, including one attached to a university, 22 established by local education departments, 39 belonging to religious organizations, and 12 belonging to non-religious organizations. The construction costs of the latter two were subsidized by the education department, while the maintenance costs were raised by the founders themselves. As for university teacher training departments, there were 21 nationwide between 1930 and 1931. The duration of study was three years, which was later extended by one year due to the heavy burden of degree preparation and professional preparation. The first three years were for students to engage in degree preparation, and the last year was for professional preparation.

There are two sources of secondary school teachers in England. One is that after graduation from a university, they work as probationary teachers in secondary schools with the lowest remuneration, learning educational theory and receiving practical guidance during that time. After one year, they undergo a qualification examination and can obtain a teaching license. The other is that university graduates, or those who aspire to become elementary school teachers and enter university teacher training departments, transfer to the secondary school teacher program after obtaining a degree in a specialized subject, studying educational theory, teaching methods, educational psychology, educational hygiene, and educational history. After acquiring a foundation, the university teacher training department designates a secondary school where they undergo at least 60 days of practical training under the guidance of the school's teachers or university teacher training professors to supplement their experience. Then, they undergo a qualification examination and can also obtain a teaching license. This examination takes into account their research papers and internship records from the past year, not just their performance at the time. English universities have two types: specialized colleges and undergraduate colleges, each with its own degree. The aforementioned transfer to the university teacher training department requires first obtaining either one of these degrees. This completes the academic cultivation of teachers within the university. However, in general, secondary schools prefer teachers with specialized degrees to those with undergraduate degrees. However, in reality, the employment of teachers in secondary schools is absolutely not based on the presence or absence of degrees and licenses, but solely on their personality, athletic skills, participation in students' joint activities, and ability to guide students effectively.

Adult Compulsory Schools

Thirty Classes to Be Opened

The Shanghai Adult Education Promotion Association, in order to promote adult compulsory education, is specifically organizing adult classes for compulsory schools, divided into three types: self-operated, specially invited, and joint ventures. All three types are currently progressing smoothly. The existing thirty classes have already been opened, and it is reported that continuous progress is still being made, with fifty classes expected to be opened by the end of this month.

### Reasons for the Delayed Announcement of the List of New Students for National Colleges and Universities in the Shanghai Region: Limited Enrollment in Colleges and Universities Requires Expansion Efforts

The list of new students admitted to national colleges and universities in the Shanghai region for this year's unified enrollment was originally scheduled to be fully announced yesterday (the 4th) by Chongqing Cen Suishu, but it was suddenly terminated for some reason. According to inquiries from relevant parties yesterday, the number of Shanghai examinees applying for the six science and engineering schools in Shanghai was extremely high, and their scores were quite good. For the sake of students' academic pursuits, the Ministry of Education is also increasing the enrollment quota. However, the originally planned enrollment quotas of the colleges and universities are limited, making it difficult to expand them temporarily. Efforts are currently being made to resolve this issue within days. Furthermore, the allocation of students to various schools has also been quite difficult. It is expected that a solution will be determined within a short period, after which the list will be announced.

Business News

### Finance: The Talk of Negative News Suddenly Intensifies, Cash Plummets in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the local cash market in Shanghai first rose and then suddenly plummeted, retreating into the 4,100 yuan range. This was due to rumors of favorable news for Chinese finance, and at the same time, the formerly tight foreign exchange market suddenly eased. In the morning, helped by money changers and Hong Kong customers buying, the upward trend was further aided by the tightening of foreign exchange, once reaching a high price of 4,150 yuan. Subsequently, under the dual pressure of selling from silver shops and gold firms, it gradually became unsustainable. In the afternoon, rumors of a possible devaluation of the Chinese currency spread widely, which would benefit Chinese finance as a whole, causing foreign exchange to suddenly ease. Securities firms (acting on behalf of customers), cash silver shops, and gold firms rushed to dump their holdings. Although the gold firms absorbed a large quantity, the money changers sold first and then bought, but it was still difficult to reverse the already weakened trend. The price plummeted to a low of 4,035 yuan at the close, falling 65 yuan. The market sentiment turned from firm to weak. The total volume of transactions increased from sparse to large, from 500-600 taels in the morning to 1,200-1,300 taels in the afternoon. Jewelry gold fell by 5 yuan to 410 yuan. Central English pure gold and Customs Gold remained stable.

Cash Falls 65 Yuan

The price of cash opened firm in the morning, due to the weakness of foreign exchange. A money changer first shouted to buy, but few sellers were willing, and the price opened 20 yuan higher. A money changer then sold 50 taels to a silver shop at a price of 4,120 yuan. After the opening, Hong Kong customers suddenly entrusted a silver shop, a gold firm, and a money changer to buy, and although some gold firms and silver shops supplied each other, the price continued to rise by 30 yuan because foreign exchange was still softening. A money changer sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,150 yuan. At this time, another money changer suddenly started selling, and the Hong Kong customer, having bought enough, became unsustainable and fell back, immediately losing 30 yuan. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,120 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms suddenly came to buy, with high prices. The price soon rose by 25 yuan, and a money changer sold 10 taels to a credit customer for 4,145 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange had slightly strengthened, and buyers immediately became wary. A gold firm then came to dump, and the price immediately fell by 25 yuan. A gold firm sold 30 taels to a silver shop for 4,120 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. It was heard that the situation was even weaker after the close, and the price of 4,112 yuan was traded. The afternoon opened relatively stable, with a gold firm first selling 30 taels to a money changer for 4,120 yuan. After the opening, due to rumors of some kind of negative news in the market, and at the same time, the sudden easing of foreign exchange caused market sentiment to weaken. A money changer and a gold firm competed to sell, and the price immediately plummeted by 75 yuan. Money changers traded 20 taels with each other for 4,045 yuan. At this time, a silver shop came to absorb on behalf of a Hong Kong customer, and a gold firm also made profits and bought back, once rising by 25 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a money changer for 4,070 yuan. After entering, many securities firms suddenly came to close their positions, and the cash gold firms also had a strong desire to sell, so the price fell again, losing 35 yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a money changer for 4,035 yuan. The closing price last night fell sharply by 65 yuan compared to the end of last week. It was heard that the trend was slightly more stable after the close, and gold firms traded 30 taels with each other at a price of 4,045 yuan. Then a money changer traded 10 taels at a price of 4,050 yuan. The price fluctuated by 115 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of cash gold, and the buying price had to be reduced by more than 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Falls 5 Yuan

The asking price for silver shop jewelry gold was initially 415 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang. At 10:07 AM, it rose by 5 yuan, and at noon it fell back by 5 yuan. At 2:30 PM, it fell by 5 yuan, and there was no change after that. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed its listing to 410 yuan, and the new shops had the same price. The buying price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.

Foreign Currencies Fall Across the Board

Yesterday, foreign currencies started firm and then weakened. The US dollar bill initially traded at 14.06 yuan, and then gradually retreated into the 14 yuan range. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market suddenly eased, and the price of gold fell sharply, so the selling pressure was great. The US dollar bill fell to 13.7 yuan, down 0.23 yuan from last Saturday. The English gold bill fell by 0.7 yuan, the English pound fell by 2.5 yuan, the US pound fell by 2 yuan, and the Hong Kong bill and the Canadian bill and Philippine bill each fell by 0.1 yuan. The Singapore bill and the Dutch bill each fell by 0.2 yuan, the Annam bill and the Robi bill each fell by 0.05 yuan, the Japanese gold bill fell slightly by 0.001 yuan, and the Korean bill remained at 1.172 yuan. The rest were unchanged.

Discount Rate Falls

Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts and notes fell again. This was because foreign exchange eased, cash fell, and there were few buyers, so cash supply exceeded demand. The rate was still around 70 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon it fell to 73 yuan, eventually rising back to 75 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from last Saturday. The interest rate for money changers' public association remained at 0.2 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Greatly Eases

The foreign exchange rate has risen back to 4.02 yuan, which is the same as the standard exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar. Therefore, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's US dollar exchange rate in this city has increased by 0.0125, reaching 6.25 yuan. The French franc exchange rate has also increased slightly, while other exchange rates such as the British pound exchange rate have remained unchanged. However, the domestic market was not greatly affected because the telegraph exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound on Saturday was not very high. The situation was slightly softened in the morning, but it suddenly eased in the afternoon. This was because Chinese banks and foreign banks were buying, and Chinese merchants were also buying current US dollar exchange rates, so the potential trend was once tight and soft. The British pound was the tightest, reaching 4 pence and 0.375, and the selling price of US dollars at the bank also exceeded 7.3125 yuan. Later, because the Japanese bank suddenly came to sell, the situation stopped tightening and slightly recovered. In the afternoon, rumors of some kind of negative news in the market were rampant, and foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank had a strong desire to sell. Although the Japanese spinning mill came to absorb, the head position was still felt to be in oversupply, so the trend suddenly eased. The hardest British pound had been shouted over 4 pence and 0.53125, and the US dollar had also been called over 7.59375 yuan. However, the result was that it closed at 4 pence and 0.515625 and 7.56225 yuan, with the British pound easing by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthening by 0.0125 compared to Saturday. The easing trend for October futures was very strong, because interest from many parties faded under the influence of negative news, and the settlement at the end of September had passed, so it was seen that the difference narrowed. The late closing price for the British pound was only 0.046875 apart, and the US dollar was only 0.0125 apart, and the combined monthly interest rate (excluding commission) was slightly less than 0.016, and in reality it was still difficult to obtain. The overall volume of transactions was still strong.

US Dollar Exchange Rate Increases by 0.0125

The initial foreign exchange rates in the morning did not include telegrams from London and the price of US silver. The price of raw gold in London remained stable. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar and between the British pound and the French franc was flat, and the exchange rate between the British pound and Shanghai increased by 0.0125. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound and between the US dollar and the French franc increased greatly by 0.025, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and Shanghai did not change. The central bank's listed exchange rates for each currency remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence and 0.4375 for the British pound and 7.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which was the same as last Saturday. After the opening, Chinese banks and foreign banks came to buy, and Chinese merchants also absorbed the current US dollar exchange rate, so the situation was slightly softened. Chinese banks first closed and bought spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.40615 and 0.375, and then Chinese merchants and foreign banks also bought and closed the foreign bank's spot US dollar exchange rate at 7.4065 and 0.375. When the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were announced, the British pound was flat and the US dollar increased by 0.0125, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, there were no changes. After that, Chinese merchants bought the foreign bank's spot US dollars (bills) for 7.125 yuan, and also closed and bought Datong's October US dollar exchange rate at 7.1875 yuan, while the spot US dollar exchange rate of 7.375 yuan was difficult to close. The bank once asked for 7.325 yuan. Then, the Japanese bank's Zhengjin suddenly came to sell, so the situation slightly returned to normal. The Japanese bank sold the spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.40625 and the spot US dollars at 7.375 yuan to the foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank. Later, the bank's buying price was once 4 pence and 0.421875 and 7.40625 yuan. Until the afternoon, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence and 0.40625 for the British pound and 7.375 yuan for the US dollar, which was slightly tighter by 0.03125 for the British pound and slightly softer by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.

Foreign Commercial Banks Have a Strong Desire to Sell

In the later market, rumors of some kind of negative news were quite rampant, and foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank had a strong desire to sell, so the market situation greatly eased. The foreign banks sold the spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.4375 and 0.5 pence to the same banks and the Japanese spinning mill, and the spot US dollars were hardened from 7.4375 yuan to 0.5625 yuan. The hardest British pound had been shouted over 4 pence and 0.53125, and the US dollar had also been called over 7.59375 yuan. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence and 0.515625 for the British pound and 7.56625 yuan for the US dollar, and the October British pound was 4 pence and 0.46875 and the US dollar was 7.4375 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound eased by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.0125 compared to Saturday, and the October British pound increased by 0.01875 and the US dollar cheapened by 0.03125.

September Deposit Interest Rate: Banks and Money Changers All Open at 6 Yuan

The bank's preparation committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, setting the September draft deposit interest rate at 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan (i.e., a monthly interest rate of 0.06), and the money changers' public association also decided to set the rate at 6 yuan at a regular meeting yesterday, so the two have become consistent.

### Securities: Public Debt Takes Advantage of Low Prices, Not Lacking Buyers

The securities dark market yesterday was still extremely chaotic. Powerful figures in many parties were still able to maintain their positions, but some were slowly emerging, causing the market sentiment to be depressed. However, although the market price was slightly lower, there was no shortage of buyers. Yesterday's situation was that there were many scattered buyers and few sellers. Datong, Dafeng, and Runli all had many buyers emerging or dumping their holdings. The market price fell by a few corners in the morning, and was slightly firmer in the afternoon. The result was a rise or fall of 0.02 to 0.045 yuan. The total volume of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.45 yuan per share.

In addition, the Public Stock Exchange reported that the stock market trend yesterday was extremely firm. All of the more reputable stocks were traded vigorously, and almost all of them closed at the highest price of the day. The transaction price of Chinese Business Company stock was 0.04 yuan. Calculated in the same proportion, the current value of its bonds converted into new shares should be 105 taels, but the former does not rise with the latter, which is truly puzzling. The telegraph report on the rubber statistics for August is as follows: 85,000 tons were produced, a decrease of 11,000 tons compared to July; 94,900 tons were consumed, an increase of 9,800 tons compared to July; and the world's reserves were 371,000 tons, a decrease of 24,000 tons compared to the previous month. In general, the statistical position is extremely strong and is still improving. However, the local rubber stocks are slightly different and are being ignored. This is probably because the general public's attention has recently been focused on industrial stocks.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Rebounds, with Coarse and Fine Yarn Rising by 0.1 to 0.2 Yuan

The yarn market, which has been shrouded in rumors for days, is now back in the hands of the factories, and market sentiment has been restored. The sales to customers are still flat and weak, which is a bit of a shortcoming. Therefore, the rising trend is still moderate, but 10-count coarse yarn is more stable. This is due to the depletion of inventory, the increasing demand from handicraft weaving factories in the inland Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, and the absorption by Hong Kong, so the market situation is more outstanding than that of fine yarn. Currently, considering the actual transactions in the yarn market, it is flat due to the sluggish demand from all parties, but there is no hope for the price of raw materials to fall, and there are quite a few who are bullish.

The current yarn market opened in the morning due to premature peace predictions, and the popularity was good. The buying momentum in the market was slightly stronger, and 20-count Double Horse warehouse stocks immediately rose by 0.15 to 0.16 yuan, to a price of 7.45 yuan, and the spot price was 7.75 yuan. The price then rose by another 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Later, due to weak sales to customers, there was a slight decline. At the time of closing, it was still stable. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 1,265 bales were traded, and the market prices of 20-count Double Horse rose by 0.15 yuan, Double Globe rose by 0.18 yuan, and Tiannv rose by 0.2 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn also rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 260 bales of 10-count Special Golden City at a price of 6.5 yuan. The amount of bales bought by each gang is listed as follows:

### Scarce Sources, Cotton Prices Difficult to Relax, Trade Among Peers Still Lively

Current cotton transactions are still reasonably strong, but the mills' appetite hasn't improved. The advantage lies in trade among peers. Only Rongfeng Mill has made some purchases, while others haven't taken action, so the market remains stable and quiet. Various sources feel particularly difficult to obtain, so sales prices don't relax. Ginned cotton is quoted at 155 to 156 yuan. Rongfeng Mill's purchase of ginned cotton has been of a relatively good grade, with a price of 160 yuan. 380 bales of Tongzhou white wrapped cotton and 500 bales of straw wrapped cotton arrived at the wharf. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton market was active again yesterday. The stock of raw cotton on the market is visibly drying up. Recently, due to a surge in demand for coarse yarn, the price of 10-count Indian "Pingguo'er" cotton jumped by more than 20 yuan. In recent days, 12-count raw cotton has become almost unavailable. Therefore, 42-count cotton yarn rose sharply by 40 to 50 yuan yesterday. However, although the stock of 20-count to 32-count raw cotton in various mills on the market is still sufficient for one or two months, the demand for this type of raw cotton is the most eager. It is expected that the prices of West Indian and Brazilian cotton will skyrocket.

Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton cloth was very calm early in the morning. Cotton prices didn't fluctuate significantly. Later, due to widespread rumors of British and American rejection, speculators took the opportunity to buy, and prices rose accordingly. Trade among peers also became more active. The stock market situation was strong, significantly affecting the cotton market. As a result, the closing price rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than one rupee.

### Grains: Foreign Currency Flows In, Supply Exceeds Demand, Japonica Rice Still Fluctuates

Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various routes totaled more than 4,000 bags of cartwheel packages. Goods from Hexia still haven't arrived. Therefore, at the beginning, the prices in various spot markets tended to stabilize. Later, because the local and rural markets were both sluggish, various spot markets showed supply exceeding demand. Only japonica rice remained a rare commodity and was exceptionally firm. Special common japonica rice was still 43 to 44 yuan, special tin japonica rice was 42 to 43 yuan, medium was 41 yuan, Suzhou and Kun japonica rice was 41 to 40 yuan, Kun and Zhuan new japonica rice was 37 to 38 yuan, Fengjing Baige was 40 to 39.5 yuan, Kun Jia and other new Yangjian special was 26.3 yuan, decisive at 25 yuan, special Lujian was 26.5 yuan, decisive at 25.5 yuan, Sichuan Jian was 25 to 24 yuan, Jiangbei Jian was 20.78 to 22.5 yuan, Wuhu Jian was 23.2 to 22.5 yuan, hard Jian was 21.5 to 21 yuan, Bian Yuan was stable at 34 to 35 yuan. The total transaction volume was 5,600 to 5,700 bags.

Another report: Yesterday, there were still 4,000 to 5,000 bags arriving from various routes. Sources from Jiangbei and other places have become smooth. Moreover, Hubei Province had a bumper autumn harvest this year, and a whole batch of brown rice has come to Shanghai. Market sentiment is becoming softer. Although local merchants and domestic suppliers still have social obligations, the market still sees a slight decrease of half a yuan. 1,000 bags of newly arrived Hankou brown rice were quoted at only 19 yuan. Nanjing brown rice was also only 19.5 to 19.6 yuan. High-quality Jiangbei Wuhu indica rice was also only 23 yuan, and medium quality was only 21 to 22 yuan. If the supply continues to arrive in an endless stream, the sales price may decrease again.

### Flour Mills Urge Delivery of Orders, Stockpilers Return Goods, Japanese Mills Also Resell Futures Flour

The current flour mill situation hasn't changed. It's still holding at the 7-yuan mark. Returned goods don't have significant price fluctuations. However, due to the mills' strict urging of delivery and the issue of increased storage rent after the expiration of the contract, some speculators continue to release goods, with prices ranging from 6.9 to 6.95 yuan. The market can still stand firm. As for Japanese mills' futures flour, there are many sellers in the market. This is all because of the atmosphere of peace, which has led speculators outside the industry to seek to get out. The price for October is only 6.85 to 6.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 2 to 3 yuan compared to last weekend. 20,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the second, and 7,300 bags on the third.

The source of wheat isn't abundant. Arrivals in the past two days totaled about 20,000 bags. Because there have been many rumors recently, suppliers have mixed feelings, and mills are watching and waiting. Stockpilers are all planning to choose cleverly and take advantage. The market feels quite lonely. Unified market purchases have been suspended. Only stockpilers have slightly purchased a total of four or five cars from Chuzhou, Nanjing, Wuyi, and other places, with prices ranging from 9.9 to 9.65 yuan. The market is similar to the previous week.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Prices Lower Than Mill Prices

Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants and local retail sales of domestic cloth continued to be smooth. Cotton yarn rebounded. Current market prices are lower than mill prices. Market sentiment is stable, so the quoted prices for various cloths have risen instead of falling. White goods and coarse cloth are the firmest at 13 pounds and 10 pounds. Products from mills such as Ewo and New Ewo have increased by 2.5 jiao per bolt. Ewo 11 coarse cloth has also increased by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Medium and low-grade fine cloth has increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Fine twill has increased by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth has increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Line flannel, broadcloth, and velvet have increased by 1.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Local transactions include more than 400 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, gray cloth, and coarse cloth, and nearly 10,000 bolts of bleached and dyed printed cloth and velvet. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 10,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, line flannel, satin, and colored satin. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants purchased more than 200 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, printed velvet, coarse cloth, and patterned goods. Yesterday, 205 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin.

East Piece Goods

White fine cloth and fine twill continued to be in strong demand due to the local demand for dyed gray cloth, with 800 to 900 pieces traded. Low-grade fine twill is firm, increasing by another 4 to 5 jiao per bolt. High-grade fine cloth is stable. 12-pound Dragon Head still sells for 23 yuan per bolt. However, the market is quite tight. Futures for this month have already opened at 24 yuan. Wufu fine cloth is 22.5 yuan, Trumpet is 22.25 yuan, with 200 pieces ordered. Four Gentlemen broadcloth has risen again to 7.25 fen per yard, straight tribute is 7.3 fen. Market sentiment is particularly high.

### Oil Market: Speculative Activities, Soybean Oil Rises Sharply After Falling

Yesterday's soybean oil market situation: Early in the morning, it still followed the soft trend of last weekend, opening down 4 jiao. Later, because market sentiment was influenced by rumors, local buyers launched a buying spree, causing stockpilers to eagerly push up prices. In the afternoon, it was completely controlled by manipulators. As a result, it rose by 2 yuan compared to the opening price. Statistics show that 20 barrels of Dalian oil were traded (prices are detailed in the market price column), 100 barrels of Kobe oil, 50 pieces of Yantai oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 20 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil, and 39 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil. It was found that 380 bags of soybeans were shipped to Tianjin today.

### Silk and Tea: Qilijing Silk Opens at 2,000 Yuan

Local silk market: Qilijing silk exports have become active again. Dachang and Xinfu jointly purchased 210 loads. Kirin, Racing Horse, Green Dragon, and White Horse grades sold well, with silk prices opening at 2,000 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to last week. Therefore, white filature silk trading will also be stimulated. It is a fact that there is not much Qilijing silk in the mainland. However, a large part of the raw materials for white filature silk are still shelved in Hongkou, and the autumn cocoon situation is not good. The output of white filature this year and market sales will be even more acute. Therefore, it is predicted that the current trend of the local silk market will continue to remain high. Yesterday, New York had no market, and Yokohama fluctuated slightly. Spot was 1,610 yuan, with no fluctuation. Near term was 1,576 yuan, and deferred was 1,530 yuan, with only a fluctuation of about 5 yuan. Therefore, the foreign silk market is still in a flat state.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Stable

Yesterday, foreign sugar didn't fluctuate much. The guild's price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods at this warehouse increased by half a yuan to 55.5 yuan. Goods from foreign warehouses also reached 55.5 yuan at the beginning of the market, then softened, reaching 54.8 jiao. Transit was still 42 yuan. Taikoo's cart white didn't fluctuate. B mark was 59 yuan, CW mark was 58.5 yuan, CX mark was 58 yuan, DY mark was 57.5 yuan, HX mark was 57 yuan. Cart red and Dutch red were both at the original price. Transit Dutch red was reported to be lacking. Local cotton white increased by another 5 jiao. Zhenji No. 1 was 56.5 yuan, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were discounted as before. Local crystal sugar was also tight, with the same increase. No. 1 was 67 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was 68.5 yuan.

### North and South Goods: New Dates and Walnuts Offered, Black Fungus Tightens, Chinese Olive Arrives Sparsely

New dates: The local dealers' own goods have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the market sold them for 90 yuan per dan.

New walnuts: More than ten packages recently arrived. Haozhou walnuts opened at 60 yuan, and southern walnuts at 50 yuan. Because the initial supply is small, prices are relatively high.

Black fungus: The market has tightened slightly recently. Hankou miscellaneous fungus opened at 277 yuan in cash. Ordinary Sichuan fungus opened at 285 yuan yesterday. High-quality remittance transfers couldn't be accommodated, and still needed about 300 yuan.

New Chinese olives: There have been continued arrivals recently, but only about 200 boxes. The market trend shows signs of continuing to rise.

Seafood: New Western Sea Cucumber, Second Batch Already Sold

Western sea cucumber: Since the new goods came on the market, the second batch has already been sold, and the trend is still firm and high. However, the Longya was the first batch to arrive, with the opening price nearly double that of last year. The prices of various grades of goods are compiled as follows:

Longya selected strips jade 287 yuan, outgoing purchase 267 yuan, No. 1 251 yuan, No. 2 237 yuan, No. 3 212 yuan, No. 4 197 yuan, medium jade 186 yuan, large medium jade 166 yuan, small jade 131 yuan, Xianda Port selected strips jade 214 yuan, outgoing purchase 211 yuan, No. 1 208 yuan, deputy No. 1 203 yuan, large No. 2 194 yuan, positive No. 2 184 yuan, No. 3 168 yuan, No. 4 156 yuan, agarwood selected strips jade 282 yuan, outgoing purchase 263 yuan, No. 1 246 yuan, large No. 2 230 yuan, positive No. 2 218 yuan, No. 3 204 yuan, No. 4 197 yuan, No. 5 183 yuan, medium jade 159 yuan, Makassar large jade 200 yuan, No. 1 188 yuan, No. 2 185 yuan, No. 3 177 yuan, No. 4 166 yuan.

Metals: Antimony, Over 6,000 Yuan

Hunan pure antimony (commonly known as "Antimony"): Recently, due to the small amount of goods arriving and the insufficient stock in Shanghai, and the actual sales are still good, local peers have a very firm sentiment, and prices have risen frequently. In one day, the price increased by 800 yuan and 1,000 yuan. It was found that the price of the goods was only about 3,500 yuan a month ago. Since the outbreak of the European War, the opening price has been rising day by day. Recently, it has risen to over 6,000 yuan.

### Sexual Hygiene: The Most Sound Marriage

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor Medical School

Dominated by Superior Reproductive Power

As a result of human evolution, the history of marriage has transformed into a new and strange face. The system has evolved from polygamy and polyandry to monogamy. The mode of union has also evolved from plunder, buying and selling, and agency to contract. The world is moving in a turbulent and chaotic direction, and all marriages also show a symbol of wandering and unease. In the great era of the twentieth century, other revolutions may be said to have achieved success, but the future of marriage is still bleak!

What is the reason for this? In a word, this is entirely because people do not understand the importance of health, the greatest main force of love. German physiologist Stoltz-Strass said: "A sound marriage is entirely based on sound energy." Marriage is about seeking the satisfaction of love and desire, and this love and desire is also the medium for the continuation of offspring, which is undoubtedly true.

The six meanings of a sound marriage are that each person's body and mind are fully and continuously developing. The protagonist of a bad marriage includes a broken mind on one side and a weak body, and is the destroyer of a sound marriage. Eugenists believe that the main reason for the creation of bad marriages is that love is not focused and realistic. Unlimited pursuit of love is most likely to damage physiology, such as early marriage, polygamy, premarital self-pollution, and postmarital indulgence, all of which cause the function of reproduction to decline, the function of metabolism to slow down, and the brain and kidneys lose the guarantee of prosperity. Hundreds of diseases arise, premature aging, spermatorrhea, impotence, premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, back pain, forgetfulness, and insomnia gradually form. Such people either die young or are always accompanied by medicine. Isn't it heartbreaking!

Speaking as a doctor, the treatment of this kind of disease can only be actively taken with the old German brand of testicular essence preparation for men and women, "Boti Kang", to have hope of rejuvenation, but on the one hand, it should also strictly observe health, and at the same time, it should avoid mistakenly purchasing similar counterfeit drugs. Although there are preparations with the same ingredients on the market that call on patients, most of them are aphrodisiacs in disguise, or supplements similar to aphrodisiacs. Only the "Boti Kang" drug is a truly potent animal testicular essence supplement, and it also contains brain-supplementing phosphorus. The female version is a pure ovarian endocrine preparation, which has the functions of regulating menstruation and seeds and treating anemia and premature aging.

Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn

### If a Couple Has Gonorrhea, They Should Both Be Treated

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The suffering of gonorrhea can only be known by those who suffer from it, and it cannot be described in writing. However, general old gonorrhea sufferers, because their treatment has been ineffective for a long time, cannot help but be disappointed with general drugs. Therefore, many give up hope of treatment, and because they cannot bear long-term abstinence, they inevitably engage in sexual behavior with their wives. Therefore, history causes them to infect their wives. Therefore, if a wife is infected by someone with gonorrhea, the white discharge from the lower part suddenly increases, the vagina is eroded, and it further threatens her reproductive function. If the patient is not yet married, it is best to cure it completely before marriage. Otherwise, even if the husband has been cured, the wife is still poisonous. Then the husband's gonorrhea is as good as not being cured. In other words, if a married man is treated for gonorrhea until he is completely cured, it is inevitable that he will waste all his previous efforts after sleeping with his wife who is infected with gonorrhea. Repeated infection.

Now that the urgent need for safe treatment for gonorrhea patients has been clearly explained, the remaining question is how to make effective treatment. Regarding this issue, there is now a satisfactory solution. Because in terms of internal medicine, the German Dr. Peter has invented the gonorrhea special medicine "Ke Lin Nong". This medicine is made according to the latest non-specific therapy, using a mixture of protein and pigments. After experiments by experts in venereal disease hospitals in various countries, the results show that taking "Ke Lin Nong" produces anti-gonococcal phage effects within a few hours. It has anti-inflammatory, diuretic, analgesic, and clear lymphatic effects in the early stages of gonorrhea. Chronic gonorrhea can also completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria deeply hidden in various places, and thus all changes will also be effective. As for those unfortunate wives who also have gonorrhea, they can also take "Ke Lin Nong", and use "Ka Er Xuedi vaginal tablets" for external use as a suppository, which is easy to succeed.

Gonorrhea Symposium

### Points That Should Be Paid Special Attention To

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

The points that should be paid attention to in the radical cure of gonorrhea and turbidity are whether the patient chooses a doctor and medicine carefully and cautiously, or casually. If someone suffers from gonorrhea, if they can be treated properly, then the so-called stubborn gonorrhea that cannot be eradicated is actually a deceptive statement. However, if they do not follow scientific methods of treatment, or do not observe health, it often becomes a difficult disease to treat, which is a point that must be paid special attention to. Only because most gonorrhea patients encounter this situation for the first time, and most have no medical knowledge, so they often suffer a lot, and they cannot help but abuse the general over-the-counter drugs on the market that are rich in side effects in order to seek temporary pain relief. How can they know that most of these analgesic drugs contain a kind of anesthetic ingredient. Readers must know that the painful phenomenon of our initial infection with gonorrhea is a kind of natural physiological reaction, and it cannot be effective with anesthesia. Moreover, most anesthetic products have the effect of reducing the patient's original resistance, this is one. Another is that patients are affected by environmental factors and still勉强 support their usual work. They should know that the first health condition for gonorrhea is quietness. Now they are doing the opposite, so how can it not be harmful to the sick body? Therefore, the reason why the gonorrhea I have cured over the years is faster than others is that the patients, in addition to listening to my treatment, also accept the health methods I have instructed. As for the treatment method, among internal medicines, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" is the best, because the bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" can directly reach the lesion, surround the gonorrhea bacteria and destroy it. On the one hand, German static electricity therapy is used to make the gonorrhea bacteria attached to the front and rear urethra also get static electricity and have no place to stand. Therefore, in acute gonorrhea, this method is used because of the thoroughness of the sterilization power, and there is no way to leak the net, so it is treated quickly, and the use of this method for chronic gonorrhea can fundamentally solve the problem and never recur. During the consultation, from 10 am to 6 pm, a consultation is sent every day on the 20th. Each number only takes a number fee of 5 jiao, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth 1 yuan is given away.

### Usually Less Self-Pollution, More Happiness After Marriage

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Almost every young person in the world is envious of marriage, because marriage is happy; beautiful; sweet, but, dear readers? I want to tell you, in fact, it is not that simple. Anyway, many young people feel annoyed, painful, and even commit suicide because of marriage. What is the reason for this? Because marriage has certain guarantees, that is, a healthy body and abundant energy. If young people lose these two guarantees, even if the marriage is established, it will inevitably go bankrupt. Therefore, young people with self-pollution habits should start from today to actively abstain, so that there will be more guarantees of happiness after marriage, but if there are those who suffer from spermatorrhea, brain weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and all kinds of divine red weakness due to self-pollution, please also engage in treatment, I am more and more trapped, and premature ejaculation often occurs after marriage, so treatment should be started early. Regarding the most effective treatment, nothing is better than taking "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets". This medicine has the effect of stopping spermatorrhea on the same night, and the effect is lasting and never relapses. In addition, if there are those who have been injured due to self-pollution, they should immediately take the German testicular essence preparation for men "Boti Kang" to make up for the losses.

### How to Treat Consumption?

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Coughing before consumption is a precursor to formation. Therefore, coughing has a great relationship with the health of our lungs. Therefore, it is necessary to cure the symptom of coughing in order to ensure the avoidance of lung disease first. However, coughing is not as difficult to treat as most people imagine. In today's era of flourishing medicine, when the tubercle bacillus has frequently reached the end of its life, coughing has indeed been successfully and quickly cured. No matter whether it is a cough due to influenza or a cough due to catarrh of the lungs, you can take the lung disease holy medicine "Bu Fei Na Er", which can relieve cough and resolve phlegm within three hours, and is incredibly effective. Therefore, its efficacy is the first choice among lung disease medicines.

### British Yangtze River Fleet Decides to Withdraw Five Ships, Deploying Them to Meet Military Needs Elsewhere, Ships Patrolling in the Xiang River Area Continue as Usual

Reuters, Shanghai: The British government, in view of urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats stationed in the Yangtze River. This arrangement will enable many trained soldiers to serve more beneficially in actual combat. The establishment of this decision recognizes that when military demands elsewhere are more important, the current situation on the Yangtze River does not require the stationing of ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou.

Associated Press, this port, 2nd: The British naval authorities here announced today, "Due to urgent military needs elsewhere," five of the ten British gunboats anchored in the Yangtze River have been withdrawn. The announcement stated, "The British government, in view of urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten gunboats anchored in the Yangtze River. As a result, a large number of trained officers and soldiers can be placed in active service where they are more useful. The reason why the government made this decision is because the government feels that when there is an urgent need for military affairs elsewhere, there is no need to retain ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou on the Yangtze River."

Xiang River Gunboats Continue to Be Stationed

The English-language "Demei Evening Post" said that the British Embassy officially announced this morning (2nd) that five of the British Yangtze River defense gunboats will be withdrawn so that officers and soldiers can serve in active service in other places. It is understood that this only refers to the gunboats in the Yangtze River that are now under Japanese control. The British Yangtze River defense gunboats in the Yangtze River (or northern Hunan and Dongting Lake) in "free China" are not within the scope of this order.

British Embassy Announcement Original Text

The announcement announced by the British Embassy is as follows: "The British government, in view of the urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats from the Yangtze River. This move will enable a large number of skilled officers and soldiers to serve more useful active service. The British government made this decision because it believed that when military needs elsewhere are more urgent, the current situation on the Yangtze River does not require the retention of ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou."

Current Anchoring Locations of British Ships on the Yangtze River

According to reports, the British gunboats currently anchored in Shanghai include the Scorpion, Dragonfly, Grasshopper, Aphid, and Ladybug. It has not been announced that these gunboats will be withdrawn. Other British ships in the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou include the Gold Bug, Mantis, Jiao, Gull, and Petrel. Those in "free China" include the Tang'e (anchored in Yichang), Eagle (anchored in Changsha), and Waterbird (anchored in Chongqing).

### Requesting Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Native Products Transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai; Ningbo Merchants Establish a Shipping Company

Shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo: Since Reiss & Co.'s Moufu steamboat first created the opportunity to stay outside the Zhenhai estuary to wait for unloading, it returned to Shanghai to carry passengers to Zhen, because passengers can be loaded and unloaded in Zhen as soon as they arrive, but goods must be sent to anchor for transfer according to the order of arrival. However, it was not actually implemented, so at present, passenger traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo is extremely congested.

Increased Passengers

When the Deping steamboat sailed to Zhen on the 30th, it felt very crowded with passengers, and some passengers did not have time to buy tickets and boarded the ship without permission, causing late-arriving ticket-purchasing passengers to be rejected on the shore. It is learned that these passengers were arranged by Zhongyi Company to change their tickets to China Steam Navigation Company's Dapu steamboat, which has been scheduled to sail to Zhen on the 4th to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Also, Reiss & Co.'s Haifu steamboat has been scheduled to sail to Zhen at 4 am on the 3rd, and it is also very crowded with passengers.

Limited Foreign Exchange Settlement

Since the Ningbo Zhejiang Customs received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, native products transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, no matter what kind of goods, have been required to purchase and settle foreign exchange since the 20th of last month. However, the goods loaded on the Deping and Moufu steamboats in mid-last month were returned to the customs due to wind and waves. The batch of goods has been requested to be allowed to be exported. Also, various industries in Ningbo are telegraphing the Ministry of Finance for relief regarding the foreign exchange settlement of native goods, so as not to block the export of native products. However, no reply has been received yet. The volume of goods transported from Ningbo to Shanghai has been sharply reduced in recent days.

Shipping Company

The Ningbo shipping industry, in view of the gradual increase in the number of Shanghai-Ningbo steamboats, believes that it is necessary to comprehensively adjust the shipping vessels. It has initiated the organization of a shipping company, which has now been formally established with a capital of 50,000 yuan. Zhou Dalie, chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, and shipping merchant Zhu Meixian have all participated, so the internal organization is very sound. It is expected that the supply of lighters will increase, which will be of great benefit to travelers.

### Italian Ship Leaves Shanghai to Return Home

"Zi Lin Bao" said that the Italian cruiser "Carlo Mirabello" weighed anchor yesterday (1st) before noon and left Shanghai to return home.

### Polish Charge d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai to Take Office

The English-language "Demei Evening Post" said that the newly appointed Polish Charge d'Affaires to China, Mr. Rosset, arrived in Shanghai with his family last Saturday. After Mr. Weidengtao left China to take up a new position as Polish Ambassador to France, Mr. Bohomolec took over as Polish Charge d'Affaires. Now Mr. Rosset is succeeding Mr. Bohomolec and concurrently serving as Consul General.

### Two Instances of Damage to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Confirmed by Japanese Sources; Denial of Casualties

According to the Shanghai Times, a Japanese military spokesman issued a statement last night (the 1st) regarding the recent incidents on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, claiming that on the morning of September 12th, at 9:40 AM, a section of the railway line between Xinfeng in Dongfu and Zazhe was blown up. However, the damage was minor, with only one side of the rail slightly damaged. Repairs were completed by 11:58 AM, and railway operations to Nanjing were not disrupted. The second incident occurred at 8:30 PM on September 28th, when a mine exploded near a railway bridge between Henglin and Qishuyan. A mixed freight and passenger train was passing by at the time, and some carriages derailed, with the engine and four or five freight cars falling into the river. However, there were no casualties. The damaged railway was repaired on the same night. During the repairs, passengers walked across the bridge and transferred to another train on the other side, so traffic between Shanghai and Nanjing was not interrupted. In both incidents, there were no casualties.

### Increased Security in Western Shanghai; Migration Trend Intensifies; Shanghai Municipal Council Continues Negotiations; Puppet Municipal Government Imposes Illegal Business Tax Yesterday

Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement in western Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been negotiating with the Japanese puppet regime to find a solution. However, with the support of the Japanese, the puppet regime's actions infringing upon rights are escalating. Ragtag troops are conducting widespread activities. The Settlement Police are unable to exercise police authority, and the puppet "Finance Bureau" has also independently established tax regulations and begun collecting business taxes yesterday. Local residents are trapped under dual pressure, facing a dilemma. Therefore, families with some means are choosing to relocate. As a result, the trend of moving is intensifying. To prevent disturbances on the border, the Settlement authorities have mobilized the armored car units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to patrol the border area. The following are various news items:

Negotiations Still in Progress

At a reception for Western reporters yesterday, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy revealed that the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an are currently negotiating over the issues of road construction beyond the boundaries and taxation. When a reporter asked what action the Japanese side would take if residents refused to pay taxes to the puppet regime, the Japanese Embassy spokesman said, "We have not considered that yet."

Situation Tense in Western Shanghai Area

The authorities of the two settlements in this port have recently intensified their defense measures. The armored car units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have almost all been deployed to defend the western border of Shanghai. Red patrol cars of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department are taking turns searching pedestrians and vehicles at all traffic entrances and exits within the settlement. Yesterday, Indian mounted police were seen patrolling the area of Caoyang Road in the road construction area beyond the border in western Shanghai. Puppet police were still stationed in front of Zhaofeng Park. The puppet police's preparedness at the Difeng Road intersection was stricter than before yesterday. Five people lined up in three rows at the four corners of the intersection, checking passing pedestrians and vehicles. The situation at No. 121 Bailinan Road remained the same as the day before, with unarmed puppet police on guard.

Puppet Regime Implements Business Tax Collection

After the puppet "Finance Bureau" announced that it would implement the collection of house tax and business tax in the area of road construction beyond the boundaries on October 1st, due to the strong opposition from residents and businesses, the house tax was not levied yesterday. The puppet "Finance Bureau" also changed the business tax rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% to 1%, 2%, and 3% due to the opposition from various businesses, and began collecting yesterday. A general tax of 1% or 2% is levied on daily necessities, while a tax of 3% is levied on luxury goods. Small business owners, unable to resist, are all complaining bitterly.

Rumors of Forced Vaccination

After being instigated by a certain party, the puppet "Municipal Government" ordered the "Police Brigade" of puppet police to invade the section of road construction beyond the boundaries and occupy the positions on various roads. In recent days, puppet troops have also had armed patrol cars patrolling the roads, causing the situation in the western district to appear tense. At the same time, the puppet "Finance Bureau" also decided to forcibly collect winter taxes starting on the 1st of this month. As a result, the general residents all felt a major threat. Yesterday, it was rumored that after the Japanese forcibly collect house tax in the western district of Shanghai, they also intend to imitate the method used in District A of North Henan Road and force residents to undergo vaccination. Upon hearing this news, the residents became even more uneasy.

Majority of Residents Moving Out

The residents of various lanes on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai have felt uneasy since the puppet police invaded. Quite a few people have moved out. After the puppet regime announced the forced collection of house tax and rumored forced vaccination, the residents became even more panic-stricken. Therefore, starting yesterday, the trend of migration has become even more widespread.

Chinese Face the Most Suffering

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, a Shanghai Municipal Council official expressed his views this morning (the 2nd) on the recent developments between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Grand Avenue authorities, saying that unless the authorities involved in the various disputes in the area can reach a mutual understanding, the various incidents will pose insurmountable difficulties for the residents of the roads outside the boundary. It is not impossible for both the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Grand Avenue authorities to notify the residents of the area to pay taxes. In fact, this is the result of the current situation. Residents of the area outside the boundary who are currently paying taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council have recently received notices from the Grand Avenue authorities to pay taxes. This matter must be resolved through negotiation. There is no other method that can be adopted for the time being. Those who are most affected by the recent developments are mostly Chinese. Unless both parties reach a compromise, it will be difficult for these Chinese to cope with this. Foreign residents in the area have already requested assistance from their consulates.

### Local Goods Industry Expresses Solemn Position on Controlled Vegetables; Taking Reducing the Burden on Citizens as a Principle; Paying Close Attention to Future Developments

The Japanese puppet regime's plan to control the vegetables in the two concessions may soon be implemented. The following is the actual situation obtained from various sources:

Japanese Organizations Support This Move

It is the consistent policy of the Japanese puppet regime to control the main food supplies in the two concessions. Fresh meat and fish have already been placed under the control of the "Livestock Market" and "Fish Market." The control of vegetables was launched in the spring of this year, but it was not implemented due to the firm opposition from the local goods industry and other parties. In mid-August, there were repeated incidents of intercepting vegetable vendors in Pudong and transporting the vegetables to the Hongkou market, which was suspended due to criticism from public opinion and internal conflicts. Now, the old matter is being brought up again, and the Sixing Warehouse at the new garbage bridge is selected as the "Vegetable Market" in order to realize control. It is said that it has obtained the consent of the "Asia Development Board" and the Japanese Navy.

Sixing Warehouse Undergoing Major Repairs

According to a reporter's investigation, the goods and all items stored in the Sixing Warehouse have been gradually moved out. Because the warehouse underwent a bloody battle during the isolated army's defense, the outer walls are full of bullet marks, and the interior is also mostly damaged. Therefore, it is planned to carry out major repairs for application. This project will begin soon, and it is planned to build a new house next to the warehouse to supplement the shortage. It is also heard that markets will be set up separately on Hongqiao Road or Bailinan Road and at the Sixteenth Concession to control the transportation and sale of vegetables in western Shanghai and Pudong.

Local Goods Industry Has a Solemn Attitude

According to a Mr. So-and-so from the local goods industry, the price of vegetables in the concessions has made it unbearable for the citizens. The industry should adopt the principle of reducing the burden on the citizens and eliminating the damage caused by vegetable vendors and carpetbaggers, and should carefully and solemnly deal with this future crisis. Once control is implemented, if the local goods firms do not cooperate, the so-called vegetable market will not be able to operate. Therefore, it is necessary to take the interests of the citizens as the premise and go all out. As the water fruit industry has always been closely connected with the local goods industry, if vegetables are controlled, fruits will of course be included.

French Police Search Anle Palace Hotel

At around 9 PM last night, the French police ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the Anle Palace Hotel on Edward VII Avenue to conduct a large-scale search, which lasted for half an hour. As a result, nothing was found.

### Japan Builds Railway in Zhenru; Muslim Cemetery Faces Disaster; Attempts to Occupy the Land to Build a Road Directly to Baoshan; Officials Sent to Decisively Notify the Removal of Graves

According to Da Guang News Agency, the Muslim cemetery and Cattle Industry Association in Zhenru, a suburb of Shanghai, occupy more than ten acres of land and are not far from Zhenru Railway Station. Before the war in Shanghai, Muslims held a public memorial service every spring. After the Chinese army moved west and the area fell, it became an important area for Japanese military train transportation. The issue of Muslim cemetery worship has long been a problem. Only a few people are left there to guard the cemetery. Today, the Japanese side wants to occupy the land to build a railway directly to Baoshan. Officials were sent to decisively notify the removal of graves. The cemetery guards, whose duty is concerned, have already reported the information to the Muslim Church on Fuyou Road, the competent authority.

Public Outrage; Gathering to Discuss Response

Upon hearing this news, the church immediately notified all Muslim groups in Shanghai. Upon learning this news, the Muslims were extremely indignant. They believed that the Japanese move was purely intended to destroy the historical sites of Chinese religions. According to the spokesman of the Muslim church to the Da Guang News Agency reporter, there are more than ten churches in the Muslim community in Shanghai, and there are even more Muslim restaurants and noodle shops. The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery and the Qingzhen Villa on Xujiahui Road both have a long history. Today, the Japanese side has blatantly done this. We can only temporarily endure it, and we will hold a board meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss the aftermath. The removal of the tomb will be decided at the meeting.

Notice to Cemetery Relatives; Solicit Opinions

The Shanghai Muslim Church (currently located at Qingzhen Villa on Xujiahui Road) issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that it has been reported that the Zhenru Muslim Cemetery may be built into a railway. This matter concerns the public cemetery of our religion. It is specifically scheduled to discuss the matter at 7 PM on the 4th of this month (Wednesday). Those who have tombs there are welcome to submit their opinions for discussion. This announcement.

### Coal Balls Drop in Price; Coal Ball Association Stipulates; Reduction of Two Yuan per Ton

The Shanghai Coal Ball Industry Association held a joint meeting of various factories at its association on Tianjin Road at 3 PM yesterday. More than ten representatives from various factories, including Yuan Wenqing and Li Youhua, attended. Chairman Chen Cuifang recorded Zhang Yizhi. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss one item. The chairman submitted a proposal, stating that the joint meeting of various factories on September 2nd decided that the selling price of coal balls was 67 yuan per ton and 3.7 yuan per load. However, as the prices of all commodities increased and the market was chaotic, the Appraisal Committee on September 14th determined that the selling price was 76 yuan per ton, and 4.2 yuan per load, which has been maintained until now and is considered fair. Now, it is found that the coal market has loosened somewhat, and the price of raw coal dust has fallen by 2 yuan per ton. The market price of coal balls also seems to need to be changed appropriately. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision on the case. It was resolved that from October 1st, the factory coal ball bills of lading, wholesale, should be priced at 74 yuan per ton, and retail at 4 yuan per load. The warehouse rent and truck labor are still handled according to the resolution of September 23rd. (That is, the warehouse rent of each factory is exempt for ten days from the date of wholesale. After the expiration, 5 jiao should be paid for every ten days. If it expires for one day, it will also be counted as ten days. The truck labor for trucks is uniformly 2.4 yuan per ton.)

### Famous Chinese and Western Doctors Establish a Consultation Clinic

It has recently been heard that Dr. Ranna from Austria, Dr. Mei Zhuosheng, who studied in the United States, and Dr. Zhu Weiju, a Chinese medicine practitioner, have jointly established a consultation clinic. Each patient will be jointly diagnosed and treated. Based on their past achievements in cooperation, they will seek the greatest possible safety in the protection of patients' lives. This kind of organization is a pioneering effort in the medical field. The address will be located at Nos. 103-104 Sassoon House, Nanjing Road.

### Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Groups; Revised Market Trading Rules; Rectification of Dispute Resolution Committee; Resolved to Implement from the 16th of This Month

The Bean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Store Association, Rice Milling Industry Association, Rice Sales Industry Association, and the Changshu Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Rice Industry Association, and Shanghai Northbound Rice Merchant Union of this city held a joint meeting at 3 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Grain, Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Edward VII Avenue.

Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss the revision of the market trading rules.

At that time, Chairman Fu Qiangeng will report on the revision process of the "Market Trading Rules" and the transactions that each store and customer should abide by thereafter, and there should be no out-of-bounds actions to maintain market order and avoid disputes. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter inquired about the future food supply for Shanghai citizens from the leaders of various rice industries, or it will decline, because each rice-producing area has decided to dredge the source. Yesterday, two or three ships came from Hebu, and the carriage wheel buns were loaded with 6,000 buns. Because the transaction in this street was light and people's hearts were weak, the rice price fell back. A total of 4,500 buns were traded in the morning.

### Food Supply for Refugees in Nanshi Adjusted; More Than 4,000 Residents; Three Shelters Established

The adjustment of the food supply for refugees in Nanshi has been completed since the 1st of this month. The reliable news obtained is as follows:

More Than 4,000 People Separately Sheltered

There are currently 19,209 refugees in Nanshi, with 88 shelters established. Each person is given 6 liang of rice per day. There are also 19,700 residents in the area who also enjoy the same food supply as the refugees. Since the 13th of last month, half of the food has been issued, and registration and adjustment have been carried out at the same time. It is now known that from the 1st of this month, the issuance of rice to these residents has been completely stopped. After careful investigation, it was found that about 4,700 of them are completely unable to maintain a minimum standard of living, and three shelters have been set up separately to enjoy the same treatment as refugees.

New Shelters Slightly Different in Organization

The 88 refugee shelters in Nanshi were managed by the head office in eight districts, but these three newly added shelters are directly under the head office, so the organization is slightly different. However, in terms of management and content, it is completely the same as the existing 88 shelters. It is also known that the locations of the three shelters are: (1) Changsheng Street, (2) Old Site of the Flour Exchange on Minguo Road, (3) Seaman's Guild on Wutong Street.

Saving Expenses; Improving Life

After this adjustment, the expenses of the refugee area in Nanshi can save the food supply for 15,000 people. If the economy is generous, the surplus can be used to improve the lives of refugees. As for the 15,000 residents in the area who have been eliminated, it is known that they are indeed able to support themselves. However, this nearly 10,000 refugees cannot be repatriated for a while, or the problem of finding a job for them cannot be solved.

### Japanese Puppet Troops Withdraw from the North District Vaccination Site; Shanghai Municipal Council Police Sent to Replace Them; Japanese Will Still Investigate Households

Since the Japanese side forcibly implemented vaccination in District A of the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road in the north of Suzhou River, the original deadline was the 30th of last month. However, because there were still many people who refused to be vaccinated, the Japanese side announced an extension of one week, changing the deadline to the 10th of this month. Therefore, the tent vaccination site on North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road is still continuing its work today. In the past few days, due to the large number of people, it was inevitable to be crowded, causing residents who went to the site for vaccination to be whipped by Japanese puppet troops and police. The Shanghai Municipal Council police learned of this and specially sent more than ten Chinese police officers and one Japanese police officer yesterday to replace the Japanese troops and puppet police to maintain order at the site. Residents entered in an orderly manner, and there was no crowding yesterday. It is heard that after the vaccination is completed on the 10th, the Japanese side will investigate the households from the 11th and issue passes. Thereafter, residence and movement in the area will be subject to various inconveniences and restrictions.

### British Ships Traveling to the Far East; Route Changed to Pass Through the Cape of Good Hope; Long Voyage and Reduced Schedule; Decline in European Cargo

After the outbreak of war in Europe, the ships of belligerent countries sailing on the Far East route have been greatly affected. For business reasons, they have to maintain navigation. Fearing accidents in the middle of the voyage, they strictly keep the schedule and route secret. It is heard that the British ships are taking a detour for safety, passing through Mumbai and then turning to the Cape of Good Hope. The voyage is long. Previously, it only took 445 days to reach London from Shanghai, but now it takes more than two months. Therefore, the number of ship schedules has been reduced, and the cargo transported to Europe has also declined. However, the cargo transported to various parts of Southeast Asia is more congested than before. Today, a British ship is returning to Europe and will travel according to the new route.

### British Overseas Service Association: Seeking Collaboration with Soldiers, Requesting Opinions from British Communities, Hoping for Joint Action

The "North China Daily News" reports that the committee of the British Overseas Service Association, organized by British residents in Shanghai who participated in the World War, held a meeting early last month. They unanimously resolved to consider raising funds in Shanghai to assist British troops serving in various war zones during this war, especially those about to leave Shanghai and other Chinese ports to return home for active duty, and to maintain contact with them. With this purpose in mind, to avoid conflicting with the efforts of other British organizations, the committee has sent letters to leading figures in various British organizations, seeking their opinions and suggestions. The registration office of the British Overseas Service Association has now been opened to register all British residents about to leave Shanghai and other Chinese ports for war service. The committee intends to communicate with British residents who go to war and wish to maintain contact with Shanghai. The committee will decide on the detailed proposals for its war fund after receiving replies from other British organizations. However, the committee strongly opposes fragmented action and believes they will gain the support and cooperation of the British community in Shanghai and British people in China in general. The British Women's Association is also engaged in very useful wartime work, and its appeals for donations and purchases have received the full support of the British community.

However, the film has given viewers a deep impression of the difficulty for invaders to break through the country's defenses.

### Fire in Hongqiao Road Slum: Forty to Fifty Houses Destroyed, Three Residents Injured and Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Civilians Slept on the Streets Last Night, a Tragic Sight

After the "August 13th" incident, poor people who could not afford the high rents in the concessions and had nowhere to live, built shacks or wooden houses on the vacant land of Xu Wu's family residence on Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui.

Gradually, more and more people gathered, and now there are hundreds of households, row upon row. There are also several small factories built on the site. Unexpectedly, at 3:45 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in one of the households in the slum, and the fire spread rapidly, engulfing the surrounding households. All the residents carried the old and helped the young, and hurriedly fled for their lives.

The cries and screams shook the neighborhood. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigades of the Public Concession and the French Concession rushed to the scene. After the firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire using fifteen fire trucks, the fire was finally brought under control at around 5:00 AM. Because there was no running water in the area, they had to connect water pipes to Haig Road, which made firefighting very difficult. As a result, about

forty to fifty shacks and bungalows were burned down. Rumors that thousands of houses were burned down are not accurate. When the fire was raging, three residents were burned. One was Pan A'san (33 years old) from Yancheng, who was injured in the head and legs; one was a local child, Niu Xiaoshu (11 years old), who was injured in the head and face; and the other's name is unknown, and only suffered minor injuries. All were sent to the

hospital by car for treatment. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police. However, thousands of civilians are exposed to the heavy dew in this deep autumn, and last night they all slept on the streets next to the fire scene, pale with hunger and cold, which is very tragic.

### Failure to Affix Stamps: Fined

The Longgong Hotel, opposite the Xiaocai Market in the French Concession's Ba Xian Qiao area, was reported to the French police for violating the wartime regulations by failing to affix stamp tax stamps to passenger notification and payment slips in early last month.

Later, Ding Sheng, also known as Ding Zishu (41 years old, from Linhai), the manager of the hotel, was summoned to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After questioning by Wu Kechou, he was ordered to pay a fine of 200 yuan. Ding Sheng claimed that as the manager of the Longgong Hotel, he has always handled the affixing of stamps in accordance with the Stamp Tax Law and has not violated any regulations. He has stated his reasons for disagreement and filed an appeal to the original court, requesting that it be transferred to a higher court for fair handling.

### Qingyu Lane Dispute: Tenants Fined, Sentences Suspended for Two Years Each

The manager of the houses in Qingyu Lane, Chongqing Road, the Women's Bank, taking advantage of the current period of high demand for housing, ordered all 3,000+ tenants in the lane to vacate the premises under the pretext of needing to rebuild new houses, resulting in a lawsuit. Although the Women's Bank won the case and reached the stage of enforcement, disputes arose repeatedly due to the tenants' opposition. On October 22nd, before the Women's Bank received the court's order for compulsory enforcement, it surrounded the lane with bamboo fences, attempting to start demolition. This led to another dispute as tenants removed the bamboo fences. The Women's Bank reported this to the police, and the police arrested Gu Jiren, Jiang Jinkui, and Lu Dongyang, tenants who were removing the fences at the scene. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, also prosecuted lawyer Ping Jin'ya and painter Qian Huafu on charges of instigating the incident. The defendants hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend them. The interrogation has been completed, and the details have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the Fourth Criminal Court and announced the judgment: Gu Jiren, Jiang Jinkui, and Lu Dongyang were each fined 200 yuan for damaging the property of others, and their sentences were suspended for two years. Ping Jin'ya and Qian Huafu were acquitted.

### Bomb Explodes: Entire Flock of Ducks Killed

Lu Yong'sheng, a farmer from Yangjing Town, Pudong, also raises ducks for a living. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, he drove a large flock of more than 300 ducks to Huacao Da Port, about two li south of Yangjing, to forage for food. It turned out that a heavy incendiary bomb was buried by the riverbank there. It was dropped by a Japanese plane during the August 13th Shanghai battle two years ago. It had fallen into the mud and had not yet exploded. As the ducks were swimming and looking for snails near the water's edge, it is presumed that their beaks touched the detonator on the bomb. With a deafening roar, the houses in the surrounding area shook, and thick smoke and flames soared into the sky. The bomb fragments scattered. Because the bomb contained a lot of explosives, the flames burned fiercely and continuously. All 300+ ducks floating on the river surface at that location were killed or burned to death, not one was spared. After hearing the explosion and seeing the smoke, the Japanese Marines suspected that something was wrong and immediately sent a team to patrol the area, only to find out the truth. Although Lu was not arrested, he kept lamenting his bad luck.

The criminals rushed out from the roadside and surrounded the Chinese Constable. Four of the criminals each held a pistol, aiming at the constable and forbidding him to move. One of the criminals, holding a pair of sharp scissors, took the opportunity to cut the thick black silk cord attached to the handle of the constable's official pistol and snatched the gun away. They then scattered and fled without a trace. The Chinese Constable was unable to give chase and immediately returned to the Hongkou Police Station to report the incident and request an investigation.

Yuan Jiahong, the lawyer representing the French Concession administrative authorities, stated the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit on charges of negligence causing death.

### From "Natural Disposition" to "Bandit" (Part 1)

— Xiao Ren

Some things are better left unconsidered, for upon closer examination, one often gets a startling revelation.

As everyone knows, a few years ago, a group of literati suddenly "woke up!" and began shouting themselves hoarse about "natural disposition," "natural disposition," "natural disposition." Following this, there was a surge in the reprinting of literary collections from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties that "expressed natural disposition." To further realize the original flavor of "natural disposition literature," the format of the books was made particularly archaic, and there was no need for any editing: no paragraph breaks, no punctuation.

Naturally, "natural disposition literature" is good, and it is also good to evoke "ancient feelings." Some of the reprinted collections were indeed works that "expressed natural disposition." Our literati are absolutely correct in what they say about those authors: they talked about "detachment," "elegance," and even "transcendence." However, tracing the roots of why they spoke in that way can be a bit of a "downer." Some of them: saw that the Ming Dynasty was about to fall, that society was becoming increasingly uneasy, felt the danger to their own status, and had no other way out, so they had to resort to that kind of talk to fool others and fool themselves. Others of them: lived under the rule of the Qing Dynasty, either as officials or not, but dared not say anything anyway, so they also had to resort to that kind of talk to fool others and fool themselves. – Thus, works that "expressed natural disposition" were produced. Naturally, some of the works were indeed not bad, but their origin was a dead end, even lacking in ambition. Now, our literati insist on promoting that kind of literature, which inevitably gives people the impression that our literati are not only preparing to become writers in the kind of environment that existed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, but also teaching all those who can write how to maintain their literary status on that day.

But even all the works that "expressed natural disposition" are not entirely as clean as our literati say. Many of them originally not only "expressed natural disposition" but also "expressed resentment," but that resentment has long since been dug out, so we cannot see it. The digging out of resentment was naturally partly due to the "achievements" of the literary inquisition, but partly also due to the descendants of the authors secretly doing it for the sake of their own safety and official careers. – Thus, only pure "works that express natural disposition" remained. Our literati completely ignore these facts and only treat what remains, which can ensure the safety and official careers of future generations, as treasures. This cannot but make people feel that our literati are indeed very sensitive to the times, and their plans are as thorough as can be.

In addition to talking about "natural disposition," another type of young literati talking about history is also worth noting.

This type of young literati still talks about the history of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. – This is naturally correct, and no one can say that it is meaningless at the moment. Moreover, there are still many books of the "History of Pain" and "Unofficial History of the Late Ming Dynasty" type on old book stalls, and some of them have already been edited a few years ago, so it is very convenient to just copy a little to make an article. However, if we are allowed to examine it carefully, there is a flaw that is revealed. The young literati seem to be copying too faithfully, and they call the peasants who rebelled at the end of the Ming Dynasty "bandits," "bandits," "bandits," and they also see those who "surrendered to the bandits" as heavily sinful, always attaching this kind of writing style to the narration of the historical facts of the Qing Dynasty's beginning of its rule over China. Although this is admirable in terms of copying skills, it is ultimately not a correct view. At the same time, this also shows that although our young literati are another type, they are actually inheriting the literary tradition of the "natural disposition" literati.

In the early Qing Dynasty, those "bandits" were of course extremely hateful in the "writings of hermits," but the earliest Ming Dynasty was precisely built with the help of those "bandits," and after it rose, it exploited them, so that they had no way to be the peasants they were supposed to be and could only continue to be "bandits." But this time, the big shots in the court came up with an even better solution: to invite the Qing army to enter the Pass. The founding emperor of the Qing Dynasty had an extremely cunning "cultural policy": as long as you did not scold "Great Qing," it was okay to talk about the Qing army's abuse of the Han people, because that could show the might of "Great Qing."

### Serenade

— Xu Ye

Sweet Osmanthus

A paulownia leaf flutters from the vast clear sky, bringing a message to the traveler: autumn is in Jiangnan.

The bright sky always has a thin gray cast, and the scorching sun can only be lost in the southwest. Looking at the entire autumn sky from an evergreen tree in front of a window, watching the clouds lingering on the corner of the sky, like silver snakes, more like gold-woven dragons, twisting, dancing, although its brilliant time is short and fleeting, yet, therefore, I sing once the purity of the autumn sky.

Last night, silently, alone, I walked in the night street, crowded in the rolling tide of people, surging back and forth in the noisy sound of cars, I walked unconsciously for two hours, when I ran past the door of a flower shop, I was stunned by a certain kind of dazzling color.

"The sweet osmanthus is blooming!"

Greedily and lovingly, I finally sighed.

Let the owner of the flower shop look at me, let the flowers on the glass counter look at me, obviously suggesting: you should go, who gave you the stay here?

The night breeze brushed into my clothes, and the slightly drooping limbs evoked the feeling on my nerves. To see the flowers, I have to go back to my hometown, today in my hometown is the season when the sweet osmanthus is blooming on the branches.

Life once had a brilliant spring, but also had an elegant autumn; autumn is coming, I am willing to gallop on the vast farmland, listening quietly to the singing of the charming village girls, is a reed flute, is a silver bell, the breath of the September wind swaying the fragrant scent of rice. I also wish to lie high on the banks of the river, watching the night spread sleep through the seams of the sweet osmanthus leaves, the eastern moon appearing to comfort me, so, in the blue dreams, I am excited.

"Listen to the wild geese, appreciate the moon, watch the azaleas, string together your beautiful poem!"

How is the beautiful poem now? This longing is entrusted to the distant horizon. But wandering is month after month, day after day, but I am afraid to see this year's autumn moon and sweet osmanthus.

Is the sweet osmanthus still blooming all over the walls of the homeland under the flames of war?

This has become a question, I stubbornly and stubbornly pick up the pen, ready to remotely inquire about the news of the sweet osmanthus that comes once a year to the fields of my hometown...

### Flat Rice Sales (Part 2)

— Mu Chang

Old Zhou was wearing an old raincoat, a chilling draft on his chest, and he touched his forehead, feeling a bit feverish. But he waved his baton, unconcerned.

The sun peeked out from the cloudy sky, a faint light reflecting the shimmering rain. People felt a different kind of radiance and hope. They craned their necks, even hungrier.

Like a drowned rat, Little Zhang darted around on the street, tirelessly maintaining order, often using his baton instead of his voice; then he found a long bamboo pole, which made things easier for him. If anyone tried to jump the queue, he’d pull a Jiang Taigong fishing trick.

"Pig!"

Old Zhou strolled over, shifting to the "rear guard," and "lectured" a long line of cowering people: "...Hey, why are you pushing so hard? No need to shove, you can't get into the hall until eight o'clock! Yesterday, the iron gate was pushed open and people were trampled to death, who wants to be next…damn it," he threatened, brandishing his baton.

A long line, like crabs with severed claws, rested in the wet mud, sighing. They all looked eastward: Would the iron gate open? They dared not push forward, but those behind kept pushing. Some twisted their bags into ropes, straining their necks, teeth grinding. They were silent, silent. Several women huddled in a corner under broken umbrellas, weeping.

Old Zhou caught sight of them and felt a surge of pleasure: You want to eat white rice, do you! He let out a vindictive sneer, turned away, and never looked back.

He waded through the water, shouting, "Humph, you need to buy rice tickets first, dark ones are four jiao for two sheng, blue ones are one yuan for five sheng… Pigs, got it?"

The long line swayed again. They clutched their bags and baskets, examining the banknotes in their hands, only to find them crumpled. They cried out in despair. Some frantically searched their pockets, their bodies jostled back and forth… "Oh dear, my four mao ticket is gone!"

"Ouch…"

Old Zhou approached and yelled, "Bastard, check again, check your pockets."

Several panicked, rummaging frantically, then came the weeping.

"…"

"Oh dear, a string, a string, life and death matter!" Old Zhou turned his head: a rickshaw was being pulled from the street corner, carrying a terribly fat young lady, who looked at the crowd of people buying flat-priced rice. She said to the rickshaw puller, "Hey, A Shou, put up the awning, the rain is awful."

The rickshaw puller put down the rickshaw and busied himself raising the awning.

"A Shou, they are working so hard in the rain, why didn't they buy some rice beforehand and store it at home?" A surprised voice came from inside the awning.

Old Zhou found it jarring and went to interfere: "Hey, be sensible, pull over to the left of the barrier rope!"

The rickshaw puller shot a white look, rubber shoes squeaking like water rats, and pulled the rickshaw away.

Old Zhou's heart flared with anger, he felt terrible. He hysterically ran back to the iron gate, only to see a bald middle-aged man dangerously hoisting a bag near the gate.

"Trying to push again?" He waved his baton, heading forward to pull the bald man away. The man turned around, saw it was the policeman, and timidly retreated into the crowd. He harshly pulled the crowd and yelled for them to line up.

The rain stopped again, and the sunlight faintly shone on the road.

The crowd was too dense, and the bald man was pushed out again, clutching his bag. He stood on the steps, head hanging down, motionless. Old Zhou was furious and charged over: "Get out of here!" He wanted to hit him with the baton, but his vision blurred and he felt strangely empty, wanting to vomit. He stood still, observing the bald man’s haggard state.

The bald man stood blankly for a moment, then threw the bag to the ground. He then collapsed softly to the ground. His face pressed tightly against the wet ground, lying very quietly.

The crowd roared again, the long line swaying. Old Zhou hurried over, thinking: "That's odd, has this fellow not even eaten enough noodles? Or is it heatstroke? Deadly…"

He pushed through several people, wanting to lift the bald man, but suddenly heard a buzzing in his head, his ears pressed painfully. He reached up and realized that someone had thrown a basket that hit him on the head, knocking his police cap askew.

"You're the 'pig'! The sick come for rice, squeezed to death, and you still pull them, knocking them down! Humph…" A sharp roar came from the crowd, it sounded strangely familiar. He looked over: the man was tilting his head smugly - a battered black lacquer kepi perched on his head, gesticulating wildly.

He jumped up in astonishment: it was none other than Ah Mao, that little devil!

He rubbed his eyes again, confirmed it really was him, and roared, lunging forward: this little devil is getting out of control, daring to hit me? I'll smash him into "noodle cake", damn it…

As he got closer, the little devil saw it was "him," panicked, threw down his hat and dove into the crowd.

The long line roared again, snaking forward.

### Afterthoughts

Our publication has limited space and needs concise, pithy works, as has been repeatedly stated. However, most of the submissions we receive are still lengthy epics, often one or two thousand words. Although these manuscripts are dazzling and beautiful, they create layout problems, forcing us to reluctantly reject them, or shelve them indefinitely, delaying their publication. Therefore, I hope those submitting manuscripts will send shorter pieces, preferably under a thousand words, ideally five to seven hundred words, which would be convenient for both parties.

### As I Wish

— Liu You

I have countless wishes, constantly reflected in my mind, never leaving me alone. I cherish them, nurturing them with various appropriate methods. I have also inserted these wishes into my songs, constantly chanting them. I am always hoping, and I pray for success.

Will there be a day when I get my wish? I often ask myself this. I wish to be a seagull flying in the high sky, far from dark corners, looking down upon a bright world; nobility and purity will always be my companions.

I also wish to be a tree near the water, growing so large, preventing the water from rushing ashore and causing disasters, making mankind safe and even happier.

All my wishes enable me to hate darkness and depravity, to reject them, and even to drive them away.

Hoping all day long, hoping I can get my wish, I will strive with great excitement, and effort, constantly thinking, acting…to make my wish come true.

I know there are countless people who have the same wishes as me, they also hope to get their wish, and they are also working hard.

Who can understand people's aspirations, people's prayers, people's wishes? And the people in this era should be filled with the emotions of the era, moving with the times, all having great, noble, and possible wishes.

We can get our wish, we have the faith of the masses, we have the power of the people.

### Expectations for Song Dezhu: Combining the Strengths of the Four Great Dan Actresses into One, Preserving the Unique and Superb Art of the Martial Dan

— Tong Qiyu Yi

Several years ago, when I was still living in Beiping, my friend Mr. Gu Huiyin wrote a lengthy essay titled "On the Dan Actresses of the Opera School," published in the entertainment section of the Liyan Bao, which greatly interested readers at the time. Because at that time, the most popular dan actresses in the opera school were the female actress Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu was only known for her martial dan plays, and Hou Yulan had just entered the opera school and had not yet appeared on any playbills! However, Mr. Huiyin's vision was truly exceptional. In his essay on the dan actresses of the opera school, he pointed out the various strengths and weaknesses of Zhao Jinrong and Song Dezhu. His conclusion was that Song Dezhu had the greatest potential, not only in martial plays, but also in future performances of Hua Shan and other civil plays, her achievements would surpass all others. This comment, after three to five years, is still deeply imprinted in the minds of old opera enthusiasts in the former capital. Because Mr. Huiyin's prediction was truly accurate. Not only was his comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of Song and Zhao accurate, but even Hou Yulan's Qingyi plays becoming popular was within his old man's prophetic vision!

Although my eyesight is not as sharp as Mr. Huiyin's, I also believe that Dezhu's excellence is evident to all. Now, Dezhu's Yingguang Troupe has been performing at the Golden Grand Theater for several days, and everyone agrees that Dezhu's singing is sweet and melodious, her expressions are delicate, and her martial skills are solid, truly worthy of being the leader of the Four Little Famous Dan Actresses.

In fact, art has no limits. Later generations, on the one hand, must imitate the advantages of their predecessors to prevent the loss of the unique features of Chinese opera art. On the other hand, they may also innovate and create new paths themselves. For example, Mei Wan-Hua and Cheng Yu-Shuang's new tunes were derived from Chen Delin and Wang Yaoqing, but the application of the old tunes was indeed not as pleasing to the ear as the new tunes. However, new creations must have a certain scope, be disciplined, and not be merely a pretense. Although Cheng Yu-Shuang's Cheng Tune was unique, it had been instructed by Wang Yaoqing, not deviating from the scope of the beautiful art of the old opera. Although Song Dezhu's amazing skills have many sets that others do not know, they have also been taught by Jiu Zhenfeng and Zhu Yukang. With Dezhu's mastery of martial dan and Hua Shan skills, maintaining the championship of the Four Little Famous Dan Actresses from today onwards is not a problem. We are even more willing to particularly expect her to: (1) combine the strengths of the Four Great Dan Actresses into one, excelling in the advantages of various schools. (2) strive to maintain and develop the unique skills of the martial dan, without complacency or slackness! Regarding the first point, in recent years, Dezhu has personally received the teachings of Wang Yaoqing, and has been gifted with secret texts, and the famous playwright Mr. Wu Huansun has specially written famous plays for her. It can be said that she has already partially achieved the goal of integrating the strengths of various schools. Therefore, I write these two opinions not only to provide a reference for the Ping opera world, but also for the audience who love Dezhu's art, may also measure the true value of her art based on these two points.

### Continued Preview of First-Run Films for Double Tenth Festival

— Xin Li

After reading Mr. Liang's "Preview of First-Run Films for Double Tenth Festival" in yesterday's edition of this publication, I felt that there were still some errors in the content that had to be corrected, and domestic films were not mentioned. Therefore, after my investigation, I hereby report as follows.

The Double Tenth Festival film at Guotai has now been decided, and it is neither "Three Brave Men" nor "Iron Horse" (however, these two films will still be screened at the theater after the Double Tenth Festival). It is "Blossoms Beyond the Curtain," starring Dolores del Río, with the joint performance of major stars such as Jack Penny and Edward Arnold. The film is a Hollywood-style comedy. Dolores del Río's previous films have mainly focused on singing. This time she changed her style, and it is said that she has a surprising performance.

By the way, let me mention here that the "Magnificent Ambersons," starring Paul Muni and Bette Davis, which will be screened at Daguangming during the Double Tenth Festival, is rumored to increase its ticket price.

As for domestic films. Xinguang will screen "Wang Xifeng's Great Disturbance in Ningguo Mansion." The film is produced by Hua Xin, entirely in ancient costume, with a grand scale, using more capital and technical talent than "Wu Zetian." The filming was suspended twice due to the illness of the lead actress, Gu Lanjun. The director is Yue Feng, and the cast includes major stars such as Mei Xi, Li Hong, Lu Luming, and Bai Hong, in addition to Gu Lanjun. According to people in the film industry, it is rumored that Gu Lanjun may soon leave Xinhua and form a company with Yuan Meiyun and others.

Jincheng originally planned to stage "Seven Heavens," a collective work by Guohua following "New Hell," but because the filming of that film was not completed in time, it was changed to "Little Female Knight." "Little Female Knight" is also a Guohua production, and is another masterpiece by child star Hu Rongrong and Gong Qiuxia after "Song Brother Saves Mother."

### Entertainment in a Charity Dance

— Chou Cheng

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a charity dance competition at the Metropolis Ballroom on the afternoon of the first of this month, and invited entertainers to perform to add to the fun. Lü Xiaofeng and Yu Xiangming jointly performed the comic "Chopping the Scripture Hall." Lü wore armor but cloth shoes, and instead of a sword, he wore a command knife. At the opening, he said that his singing and acting were better than Qilin Tong, and everyone praised him, thanks to his old face, everyone laughed heartily. Yu wore a red skirt but was bare-chested, and two fake breasts moved as he walked, making people feel goosebumps. Deng Guoqing performed his skills with free movement, all real skills, and can be called divine. The modern couple competition, originally scheduled to be jointly performed by Zhang Yie'er, Jiang Xiaoxiao, He Shuangdai, Pei Yanghua, Lu Xixi, Tang Xiaofei and others, had already written the script, but because they were all out performing in temple fairs, Zhang Yie'er publicly apologized. They also invited Xiao Kuaile and Yang Liu Dun to jointly perform the comic couple, surprisingly the two wore formal attire, with two children pulling the veil for them, and they entered the pool hand in hand, while the bride sang a love song, and the groom reported the love process, detailing how one met in a small vegetable market, and then arranged to eat in a small restaurant and stay in a small inn, and Bao Yifei and Cheng Xiaofei, acting as guests, gave speeches, Bao spoke Pudong dialect, and Cheng spoke Wuxi dialect, with local expressions such as "big boss" and "spinning around" blurted out, being humorous and causing people to laugh until their stomachs hurt. Upon entering the venue, this comic couple also cupped their hands and shouted "Uncle" to Yuan Ludeng, nicknamed "Mr. Nice," and the guests were all amused.

### The Magistrate's Punishment of an Actor

— Shiweixuan

I previously saw the reprinting of the Yang Yuelou case in Shen Bao's old newspaper, and I was reminded of an old case. In the 27th and 28th years of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was a Hua Dan actress named Gao Caiyun, whose fame was unparalleled in Shanghai. She had dealings with high officials and wealthy people, so the concubines of officials, the mistresses of the wealthy, and even the daughters of famous families, all wanted to share a piece of her, and jealousy and competition were often heard of. Among them, the wife of a wealthy merchant had particularly close dealings with her. The merchant was afraid of his wife and did not know what to do when he first learned of it. One day, the merchant returned from outside and saw Gao whispering intimately with his wife. The merchant could not restrain himself and scolded them. Gao was not afraid, but instead threatened him with a kitchen knife on the table. The merchant left in anger and filed a complaint with the Shanghai County Office. The magistrate at the time was Wang Xinpu of Haining, who had a reputation for integrity. He immediately ordered the actor to be brought to court. Gao was fearless and composed. The initial trial was inconclusive. The next morning, when the trial was held, the spectators were packed, all wanting to see how the virtuous magistrate would punish this lewd actor! As Magistrate Fang took his seat and began questioning, a yamen runner suddenly presented two telegrams. Magistrate Wang smiled and placed them on the table, not opening them immediately. After briefly questioning, he ordered the actor to be beaten with fifty strokes of the bamboo, and displayed in the cangue for two months. The spectators all praised him. After returning to the signing room, he opened the telegrams, which were from the Suzhou Provincial Treasurer pleading for leniency for the actor. Magistrate Wang smiled and said to his attendants, "If I had read them in court, I would have been deceived by the lewd actor again, and the fifty strokes could not have been carried out." At the time, it was very satisfying, but soon Magistrate Wang was dismissed from his position, rumored to be related to this case.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Actors and Opium

Moreover, when they have to rush to the performance, if they have not smoked enough opium, and are anxious, and their liver fire flares up, plus their throat is dry after just smoking, their throat will definitely lock up and they won’t be able to make a sound, which is particularly difficult. Therefore, the throat is very delicate. Usually, you must take extra care of it, and you must use it properly when the time comes. Being able to use the precious "smoky voice" to emit a round and bright sound to please the audience, that is not in vain to violate national laws and develop bad habits, gradually creating the original intention of the "smoky voice." If you only focus on the false appearance, thinking that all famous actors and Tan school bearded men must first have the title of opium addict, as if it is not enough to show that they are "Tan school" if they do not, then that person is undoubtedly foolish, and their fundamental inability to understand the relationship between opium and the actor's throat is also an undeniable fact.

Before Gao Qingkui's voice collapsed, his voice was extremely powerful. Who knew that after he quit smoking five years ago, his voice suddenly became hoarse and he couldn't utter a word. At that time, I was in Beiping, and one night at Guan Dayuan's house, I saw Dayuan naked, with a plaster pasted on his chest, watching a blister slowly rise. Then, Guo Zhongheng's uncle (a Western doctor) took a needle and inserted it into the blister, extracting the liquid inside, and then injected it into his buttocks. At that time, Qingkui and Liankui stood aside, praising the magic of this method of quitting smoking, and comforting Dayuan with words, saying, "Yuming, don't worry, this method is very safe. My brother and I both quit smoking using this method by Guo." Qingkui's accompanist was his younger brother Liankui. The two brothers were extremely lazy during the smoking cessation period. At that time, they did not form a troupe to perform, so of course they did not need to practice their voices. (一一一)
