### President Roosevelt Cables Italian King to Mediate the European Crisis; Chamberlain Announces Poland Still Willing to Negotiate with Germany; Expresses Dissatisfaction with Secret Soviet-German Understanding

Washington - President Roosevelt has cabled King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, requesting him to offer suggestions to find a solution to the current crisis. (Havas Urgent Cable, 24th)

Washington - President Roosevelt's cable to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was read to the King by the US Ambassador at 2:00 PM (Rome time) on the 24th, with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano present. (Havas Cable, 25th)

Washington - Upon returning to the capital, President Roosevelt declared that his cable to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was an effort to eliminate the scourge of war again, while informing the Italian government that if it accepted this suggestion, it would "receive the warm sympathy of the United States." (Havas Cable, 25th)

London - The House of Commons reconvened today, and Prime Minister Chamberlain, amidst cheers, declared, "As I stated before, I now reiterate that, should an incident occur, the British government is prepared to use all its strength without delay." The Prime Minister stated that the announcement of the Soviet-German agreement was like a bomb thrown at the British government. While Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations were underway, the Soviet Union secretly negotiated with Germany to pursue activities conflicting with the British government's diplomatic policy. The government's primary responsibility is to declare that Britain's obligations to Poland remain unchanged. Hitler believes that Eastern Europe is an area where Germany should be free to act. He hopes that reason and justice will find a way out of the current crisis. The choice between war and peace is not in the hands of Britain. If we are forced into a struggle filled with the suffering and calamities of all mankind, the outcome of which no one can foresee, then our fight is not for the sake of acquiring a remote foreign town, but for the preservation of principles, the destruction of which would also be the destruction of all possibilities for peace and security for the nations of the world. The Prime Minister continued that he firmly believed that those who share responsibility with him will consider the fate of millions of lives, which now depends on their actions. As for ourselves, we now have a united nation behind the government (cheers). (Reuters Cable, 24th)

London - The House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, and Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately issued a statement on the European situation, stating that the international situation is deteriorating and the crisis of war is imminent. Our country must take new and severe measures to deal with this grave situation. The German side has issued news that Germans in Poland are being mistreated, which is the same as what happened to Czechoslovakia last year. Germany is now ready and can go to war at any time. Polish politicians are calm and restrained and are still willing to discuss current disputes with the German government, but only if they are certain that they will not be threatened by violence during the discussions and can maintain adequate confidence. As for the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, the British government was surprised and unhappy upon hearing the news. This is undeniable. Rumors of the adjustment of diplomatic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have been circulating for a long time, but the Soviet government has never notified our country or the French government of this intention. While Britain and France are conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union based on mutual trust, that country secretly conducted negotiations with Germany, and its apparent goal conflicts with the diplomatic policy we imagined. This is at least unsettling to us (cheers from the members). What is the meaning and impact of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty? We will immediately exchange views with the French government. The time is not yet ripe, and I am reluctant to make a hasty judgment. Our country is now taking defensive measures. To say that we intend to threaten is not the truth. Our past and future actions will not threaten Germany's legitimate interests. Assisting friendly nations in resisting violence should not be regarded as a threat. The discount rate of the Bank of England has now increased from two percent to four percent. This is a normal safeguard measure to protect our country's assets from flowing out of the country during unstable times. Then, the Prime Minister spoke of Sir Henderson, the Ambassador to Germany, meeting with German leader Hitler, stating that this move was to once again inform leader Hitler of our country's position to prevent any misunderstanding. If war were to break out between Britain and Germany, it would be a great disaster. I conveyed this intention to leader Hitler, because, in the view of the British government, all the problems between Poland and Germany do not need to be resolved through war, nor should they be resolved through war. Leader Hitler's answer was nothing more than reiterating Germany's claim that it should maintain freedom of action in Eastern Europe. This statement is a complete misunderstanding of Britain's position because Britain has not demanded a special position in Eastern Europe. Leader Hitler also attributed the responsibility for future wars to countries that obstruct German interests, but if it is said that the interests of a nation must be satisfied through bloodshed or the destruction of the independence of other countries, I dare not agree. At this point, the Prime Minister was filled with emotion and, amidst enthusiastic applause from the members, made the conclusion, "I have done my best to maintain peace, which is witnessed by God. Now, if unfortunately it fails, and our country is forced to fight, then all mankind will feel pain, and no one can predict the outcome. However, the reason why we fight is not about the political future of a remote foreign city, but to uphold a certain principle. If this principle is destroyed, then all nations in the world will never have hope for peace. Fortunately, the disaster has not yet arrived, and reason and a steady mind still have the possibility of prevailing. The lives of millions of people are tied to the actions of those who bear responsibility. I hope that they will be compassionate and empathetic. Our country has been able to unite in this critical period (all members cheered loudly), and I firmly believe that you, the members, will be able to show this purpose to the world." (All members cheered again). (Havas Cable, 24th)

### Hitler Rejects British Prime Minister's Advice, Meets British Ambassador, Expresses Unchanged Original Intention

Berlin - Ambassador Henderson stayed in Berchtesgaden for half an hour, indicating that his meeting with leader Hitler must have been very brief, probably only about ten minutes. (Havas Cable, 23rd)

Berlin - Britain's last effort to avert war has now failed, and the tense situation is rapidly escalating. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, when meeting Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday, was reportedly told of the British government's attitude, namely, that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not affect Britain's obligations to Poland in the slightest. Last night, the German official news agency issued an article, stating that Hitler had made it clear to the British Ambassador that the obligations assumed by the British government could not make Germany give up its rights, which are tied to its survival. This kind of answer from Hitler is regarded by people in German political circles as a serious warning to Britain: Britain should not interfere when Germany is forced to defend the interests necessary for its national survival. (Reuters Cable, 24th)

Berlin - Leader Hitler met British Ambassador Sir Henderson twice in Salzburg yesterday. The first time, Sir Henderson delivered Prime Minister Chamberlain's letter to Hitler, and the second time, Sir Henderson received Hitler's reply. According to well-informed sources, there was nothing new in Mr. Chamberlain's letter. Its content was exactly the same as the statement issued by the British government the day before. As for Hitler's reply, according to the German news agency, it clarified Germany's determination to protect its vital rights and would not be influenced by any restrictions from the British government. Diplomatic circles believe that there is no doubt that the German government will not change its attitude. (Haitong Cable, 24th)

### Roosevelt and Hull Hasten Back to Washington to Make Another Appeal for Peace

Washington - According to reliable sources here, although officials do not believe that President Roosevelt will make another direct appeal for peace, several advisors to the State Department are now advocating that President Roosevelt cable Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, asking him to use his influence to stop the war. Some sources also believe that Washington will issue a formal declaration, reiterating the United States' desire for peace. According to reliable sources, the general idea of the various reports prepared for the President to review upon returning to Washington is that "the current crisis cannot be resolved." (Reuters Cable, 24th)

New York - President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have both cut short their vacations due to the critical situation in Europe and are rushing back to Washington. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington this afternoon. In response to reporters, he said that he was "deeply concerned about the crisis in Europe. He does not know what kind of action the government intends to take." The Presidential Palace has firmly stated that although the State Department advised the President to delay his return to the capital until Friday morning for safety reasons, the President decided to return to the capital early. Hull said that he felt it was necessary to "keep pace with the rapidly changing international situation." British Ambassador to the United States Sir Lindsay met with Assistant Secretary of State Welles yesterday. (Reuters Cable, 24th)

Washington - Because of the possibility of a major war in Europe, the State Department last night specifically advised people not to travel to Europe again. At the same time, the US embassies in France and Poland also advised expatriates to leave the country as soon as possible. Senior government officials here held two meetings within 24 hours to discuss the steps the United States should take in the event of war in Europe. (Associated Press Cable, 24th)

Editorial

### A Review of the Content and Characteristics of the New Soviet-German Pact

"Although the Soviet Union and Germany's agreement on a non-aggression pact may encounter various difficulties, not only will it not be stillborn, nor difficult to deliver, but it will also be completed quickly." Now, it has been completed in less than a day. According to what has been released from Berlin, the pact has seven articles, the full text of which can be found in today's news column of this newspaper. Among them, the most noteworthy points are decisively recorded as follows:

Article 2: If one of the signatory countries is attacked by another country, the other signatory country shall not, in any way, provide assistance to the attacking country.

Article 3: The two signatory countries shall, from now on, maintain contact and exchange information on all issues of mutual concern.

Article 4: Neither signatory country shall participate in any international group that is unfavorable to the other signatory country.

Assuming that what was transmitted from Berlin fully captures the essence of the document, then the Anglo-French side has been hoping for two days that the content of the pact would stipulate that "if one of the contracting countries has any aggressive acts against a third country, the other contracting country may declare the pact invalid." However, this was not restricted by the Soviet-German pact, meaning that if a contracting country has any aggressive acts against a third country, it will not affect the existence of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In contrast, the first article of the Chinese-Soviet non-aggression pact (signed on August 21, 1937) explicitly states, "Both parties condemn the use of war as a means of resolving international disputes and recognize war as an instrument of national policy." All of this, which establishes the principle of international peace, was not highlighted by the Soviet-German pact, meaning that acts of war were not condemned by the Soviet-German pact. Based on this, although the Soviet Union and Germany are part of the entire international community, and the deterioration of Soviet-German relations is a crisis for the overall situation, the non-aggression pact now concluded only settles this one element, one aspect. To say that it makes any contribution or provides any benefit to world peace is absolutely not the case.

The Soviet-German non-aggression pact has its own distinct characteristics: The essence of a general non-aggression pact tends to be passive prevention rather than active action, but the new Soviet-German pact cannot be viewed in this way; this is the first characteristic. The binding force of a general treaty tends to be limited to the future and does not apply retroactively (just like Article 3 of the Chinese-Soviet non-aggression pact, which contains such a provision, and there are many other similar examples that cannot be listed); the new Soviet-German pact has a view that encompasses both the past and the future; this is the second characteristic. How can these characteristics be proven? Weren't the Soviet Union and Britain and France supposed to be negotiating a tripartite political agreement and military agreement for a long time? Its meaning is anti-aggression, a peace group, and specifically aimed at Germany. If it were not for Germany, where would it come from? Germany and Italy have a separate military alliance treaty, with Britain and France as assumed enemies, which is a separate matter. Furthermore, hasn't Germany separately signed an international anti-Comintern pact with Japan and Spain? Its meaning is anti-communism, specifically aimed at the Soviet Union. If it were not for the Soviet Union, where would it come from? Now, in the new Soviet-German pact, with the provision in Article 4, "Neither signatory country shall participate in any international group that is unfavorable to the other signatory country," this is an active action to stop the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. In other words, the Soviet Union should abandon Britain and France because of the new pact, as it is unfavorable to Germany. Since there is a provision in Article 4 and no explicit statement that it does not apply retroactively, this is an active action to abolish the anti-Comintern pact; in other words, Germany should abandon Japan and Spain because of the new pact, as it is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. All of this is a proper interpretation, without any other interpretation, and becomes a very noteworthy characteristic. However, the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister still comforted the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, saying that there was no reason for the tripartite negotiations to stop, and that the Soviet-German non-aggression pact did not conflict with the mutual assistance treaty planned by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; this is truly a ridiculous statement, and even a great mockery. Coincidentally, and not by mere coincidence, at the same time, the German authorities were reassuring the Japanese and Spanish ambassadors to Germany, saying that the anti-Comintern pact was ideological in nature, and that the restrictions Germany now received from the Soviet Union would not affect the anti-Comintern pact; this mockery has the same ingenious effect as the Soviet Union's statement to Britain and France. The speaker probably smiled, and the listener only gave a bitter smile!

Carefully pondering the articles of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Soviet Union, situated between Britain, France, and Germany, is perhaps playing tricks and still has room to perform a sleight of hand; is this a clever tactic of trying to capture by letting go? Speaking from the fundamental policy expressed by the decisive pact, no one needs to have any fantasies beyond the articles. If we examine between the lines of the articles, such as the maintenance of contact and exchange of information stipulated in Article 3, if we interpret this with normal morality, it is to prevent discord; although the interaction is shallow, the words are deep, so can it be said that there is room for letting go? Furthermore, as stipulated in Article 2, if Party A is attacked by another country, then Party B must not assist the other country; if we try to find a loophole in this and say that if Party A attacks another country, then Party B may not be bound by the pact and may still assist the other country; for example, if Germany attacks Poland, and Britain and France fulfill their promises and assist Poland, then although the Soviet Union does not assist Poland because it is dissatisfied with Poland, can't this be regarded as Germany attacking someone, and the Soviet Union retains the freedom to assist Britain and France? Yes, yes, the right to this interpretation belongs to the Soviet Union; however, Germany can proclaim to the world, "I am sincerely punishing Poland because I have no choice, but I have never harmed Britain and France at all. Britain and France are now attacking me!" Speaking from the fundamental policy expressed by the Soviet Union today, wouldn't the Soviet Union politely decline Britain and France, saying, "You are attacking Germany, but I have a pact, so I can't help you"?

What is the Soviet Union's fundamental policy? It is that the Soviet Union only wants Germany to abandon its eastward expansion policy and abandon its anti-communist banner, and fundamentally does not want to participate in the war between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. This is the Soviet Union's policy from beginning to end, and it cannot be shaken by any kind of emotion or trick. The negotiations in Moscow with Britain and France were an attempt to shake it; the attempt failed, but it is not diplomacy's fault.

All that is stated above is based on the articles of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact transmitted from Berlin, and the main purpose is only to review its content. As for the new situation in the international arena that we can look forward to after the establishment of the new pact between the two countries, we will discuss it in a separate article.

Berlin - From 6:00 AM this morning to 8:00 PM on Saturday, flights are prohibited throughout eastern Germany and East Prussia, except for military and government aircraft. The eastern border extends from Greifswald on the Baltic Sea to Nielebock and Brandenburg, 35 miles west of Berlin, and then extends to the border of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, encircles the Protectorate of Kromau, passes through Linz, re-enters Austria, and ends at Villach near the Italian border. Then, the border line encircles the entire German border and returns to the Baltic coast and Greifswald. (Reuters Cable, 24th)

Berlin - German newspapers today continue to publish news of Polish military preparations and anti-German terrorist activities on the Polish border under alarming headlines. According to reports from eastern Upper Silesia in Poland, all roads on the Polish-German border have now been completely blown up. Barbed wire and various obstacles are everywhere. The border villages and towns are filled with Polish troops, and there are observation posts hidden in the forests along the border, monitoring at all times. (Haitong Cable, 24th)

Warsaw - It is reported that the reservists mobilized by the government authorities belong to the 1913, 1914, and 1915 classes. In addition, technical personnel who have not been ordered to mobilize have now been called up. The number of Polish army personnel has therefore increased to 1.5 million. (Havas News Agency Cable, 24th)

Warsaw - Since the French government has taken mobilization measures, the Polish cabinet also held two meetings yesterday afternoon and at 10:00 PM, deciding to take new national defense measures in accordance with the plenary power law passed by the parliament in June of this year to adapt to the needs of the international situation. Those who should be mobilized among the nation's able-bodied men were summoned by telegram last night and this morning. As for how many able-bodied men have been called up, it is difficult to ascertain due to the secrecy of the mobilization. However, according to general estimates, the number should be around one million. In addition, the government has also begun requisitioning vehicles, and economic mobilization and industrial mobilization are also being actively promoted. However, daily life for the people has not been affected in any way, nor have any troops been seen passing through the streets. Railway transportation is as smooth as ever, and the capital is serene. (Havas Cable, 24th)

Warsaw - The general public today began to understand the tension of the current crisis when they read the shocking news of German aggressive actions in the newspapers. Troop movements around Warsaw continued all night last night. Although general mobilization has not yet been announced, the government has issued announcements summoning new reservists from many age groups. (Reuters Cable, 24th)

Danzig - According to reliable sources from the Polish Corridor, mobilization has been officially announced in Poland today. All farmers are being forced by the gendarmerie to abandon their work and go to the fortresses to serve. (Haitong Cable, 24th)

### French Reserve Soldiers - A Portion Called to Duty

Paris - The Ministry of Defense has issued a notice stating that the Ministry will exercise requisition rights in the capital area starting at midnight today. (Havas, 23rd)

Paris - Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier convened a meeting at 6:30 PM, gathering relevant ministers and leaders of the army, navy, and air force. A decision was made to call up reserve officers and soldiers with technical skills. President Lebrun returned to Paris at 7:00 PM in the evening and is scheduled to preside over a State Council meeting tomorrow. At that time, France's firm position on the Polish question will be reiterated. Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe the situation is extremely serious, but consider that Germany may not take any action against the Polish Corridor tomorrow. (Havas, 23rd)

Paris - French Premier Daladier, in light of the increasingly tense international situation, continued to call up conscripts last night. According to military experts, the number of armed soldiers in Europe has reached as many as ten million. Daladier announced that French reserve replenishment troops have received orders to report for duty, and therefore preparations for the German-Polish crisis have been fully completed. Last night, the atmosphere in Paris was filled with wartime tension, and conscripts filled the trains leaving Paris. At the same time, thousands of reservists rushed from various places to gathering points in the west. Also, the number of conscripts' relatives gathered at the train station last night was unusually large. (Reuters, 24th)

Paris - France is currently actively engaged in military preparations. The Paris train stations are extremely busy with military transport. Cafés in front of the stations are crowded with soldiers from the Maginot Line assault teams, as well as many reserve officers and soldiers. It should be noted that the Gare de l'Est (Paris East Station) is an important railway station for access to France's eastern border. (Haitong, 24th)

Paris - French conscripts who have mobilization certificates marked with the number "2" have now been called up for duty. (Reuters, 24th)

Paris - This morning, notices were posted outside the Paris City Hall and public places, calling up those with mobilization certificates marked with the number "3" or "4". This is the first round of mobilization, equivalent to a partial mobilization. (Reuters, 24th)

Paris - Here, everything is no different from usual, except for the reserve soldiers being sent off at the station by their families after being ordered to mobilize. Residents go about their business as usual. Newspaper vendors sell special editions of the latest news along the streets. Many new-style public buses have been requisitioned, resulting in a decrease in the number running on the streets. All train stations are extremely busy, with special trains full of soldiers departing from time to time. Large posters are posted on the platforms, indicating the destinations of each train. Long-distance telephone lines between cities have also been reserved for transmitting official reports. (Havas, 24th)

Paris - Since the full text of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was disclosed, hopes for a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have completely vanished. Therefore, France is prepared for general mobilization. The French army has now increased to over 1.5 million men. The Maginot Line is fully manned with defensive forces, and troops on the second line of defense have also arrived at their destinations. All private cars have been requisitioned by the government. Crowds gather in front of the city council hall to read mobilization orders, while armed men travel incessantly to the train stations to take trains to the border. Many people here believe that the Soviet Union's decision is a major blow to Britain and France, and suspect that there are still secret clauses. According to Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the business newspaper, Ribbentrop brought several rolls of phonograph records from Chamberlain's visit to Hitler last year on his trip to Moscow, revealing that people in Britain and France greatly hoped that Germany would attack the Soviet Union at the time. Angered by this, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Ribbentrop. (Associated Press, 24th)

### Daladier Plans to Form a National Unity Cabinet

Paris - Premier Daladier, in view of the extremely serious situation in Europe, is reportedly planning to issue an appeal to the nation, urging them to work together to overcome the difficulties. His first step is to form a "national unity" cabinet. (Havas, 24th)

Paris - The cabinet held a State Council meeting this morning. Premier Daladier declared that the situation in Europe is extremely serious, and he has taken various military measures to ensure safety. The State Council approved this. Foreign Minister Bonnet then reported on the situation and analyzed the clauses of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. According to sources close to the government, if the situation becomes more serious, Premier Daladier plans to form a "national unity" cabinet and call on the people to work together to overcome the difficulties. (Havas, 24th)

### British Army and Navy Prepare to Respond to Various Incidents

London - Since last night, British warships have been preparing to sail to naval bases in the North Sea. The British regular army and territorial army are also prepared to move. London's anti-aircraft units are implementing continuous day and night alert measures, preparing to respond to enemy aircraft attacks at any time. (Associated Press, 24th)

London - Political figures here have stated that, according to Franco-Italian regulations, the British government does not need to seek parliamentary approval to declare war. It only needs to submit a request to the King for signature and request parliamentary ratification afterward, which is sufficient. When war was declared on Germany in 1914, Parliament was in session, so there was no question. Now that Parliament has reconvened, the cabinet can get timely ratification if it makes a final decision. (Havas, 24th)

London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to deliver a short broadcast address from Downing Street at 8:30 PM tonight, which will be broadcast to all parts of the British Empire and the United States. (Reuters, 24th)

Gibraltar - Gibraltar is now making military preparations. All defensive works, such as anti-aircraft gun stations, are manned by troops. The northern entrance of the harbor has been equipped with a water barrier for protection. All troops are on standby in barracks, and officers have canceled all leaves. A senior military officer said that the British forces in Gibraltar have quietly prepared everything to respond to all kinds of events. (Reuters, 24th)

### Belgium, Netherlands, Greece, and Other Countries Make Military Preparations

The Hague - Dutch Prime Minister Kier arrived here yesterday from Germany, after the government ordered all government officials to take vacations in the country. The Dutch government ordered that government officials must stay in the country so that they can return at any time in case of emergency. (Associated Press, 24th)

Athens - The Ministry of the Army has issued a bulletin stating that all reservists of the 1936 and 1937 classes belonging to field artillery, heavy artillery, mountain artillery, cavalry, and telegraph units should report for duty to participate in exercises. (Havas, 24th)

### Serious Incident Occurs on the German-Polish Border - Germans Break into Polish Territory and Open Fire - German Passenger Plane Reportedly Shot Down by Polish Troops

Warsaw - Responsible sources here stated that a German sentry intruded one kilometer into Polish territory near the city of Eylau in East Prussia this morning. Several serious incidents also occurred last night. Fifteen Germans broke into the Polish border at midnight last night and attacked the customs office at the Małachowicza station in the Katowice district, firing over a hundred shots. A railway mechanic and border guard Ruda were both injured. The rioters dragged Ruda into German territory. Several other Germans also attacked the sentry post in the village of Kiramowice in the Rybnik district this morning, firing a total of over two hundred shots. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It is generally expected that Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski will lodge a protest with the German government tomorrow. (Havas, 24th)

Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that two German transport planes were shot at by Polish soldiers while flying outside Polish airspace. However, this has not been confirmed by Polish sources here. (Havas, 23rd)

### Danzig Overthrows Constitution - Appoints Forster as Head of State - City Police Arrest Large Number of Poles - Customs Negotiations Break Down

Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that the Senate of the Free City of Danzig has issued an order in two articles: (1) Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in the Free City, is appointed as the head of state of the Free City. (2) This law shall take effect on the 23rd. Regarding this matter, German officials refused to comment, stating that this is an internal matter of the Free City of Danzig and has no direct relationship with Germany. Observers said that Forster's appointment as the head of state of the Free City is no different from Hitler's appointment as the head of state of Germany in the capacity of the Nazi Party. It is essentially the implementation of a unitary system and the complete overthrow of the current constitution of Danzig, but not an immediate annexation into Germany. It is still unknown how Senate President Greiser will be accommodated. (Havas, 24th)

Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that Poland sent a delegation to Danzig to discuss customs issues with the city authorities, but they returned to Warsaw without completing the matter. The current negotiations have therefore been declared broken due to this unilateral action. (Havas, 24th)

Danzig - The city police have arrested over one hundred Poles, mostly railway workers. It is generally believed that Germany may take action against the Danzig railway, which is the asset of the Polish government. (Havas, 23rd)

Danzig - The British Consul General in Danzig, Shepherd, left Danzig for home with his luggage last night. (Haitong, 24th)

### German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact - Signed in Moscow the Night Before - Not to Participate in Actions Detrimental to Each Other - To Maintain Contact Regularly Hereafter for Ten Years

Moscow - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here by plane yesterday. A noteworthy feature at the airport was that the Soviet hammer and sickle flag and the German swastika flag were displayed side by side for the first time. (Reuters, 24th)

Moscow - Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held the first meeting on the non-aggression pact at 3:30 PM yesterday. The meeting lasted for three hours. Besides Molotov and Ribbentrop, Dahlin and German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg were also present. At 10:00 PM in the evening, the two sides reopened negotiations and finally signed the non-aggression pact. The original text is as follows:

"The Government of the Soviet Union and the Government of Germany, guided by the desire to strengthen the cause of peace between the Soviet Union and Germany, and taking as their basis the fundamental provisions of the Neutrality Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and Germany in April, 1926, have agreed upon the following:

(1) The two Contracting Parties undertake to refrain from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.

(2) Should one of the Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third Power, the other Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third Power.

(3) The Governments of the two Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on questions affecting their common interests.

(4) Neither of the two Contracting Parties shall participate in any grouping of Powers whatsoever that is directly or indirectly aimed at the other Party.

(5) Should disputes or conflicts arise between the two Contracting Parties over questions of one kind or another, each Party shall seek to settle these disputes or conflicts exclusively by means of friendly exchange of opinion or, if necessary, by the establishment of arbitration commissions.

(6) The present Treaty shall be concluded for a period of ten years, with the proviso that, unless one of the Contracting Parties denounces it one year before the expiration of this period, the validity of this Treaty shall be deemed to be automatically prolonged for another five years.

(7) The present Treaty shall be ratified within the shortest possible time. The instruments of ratification shall be exchanged in Berlin. The Treaty shall enter into force immediately upon signature. Done in Moscow, on August 23, 1939, in two originals, in the German and Russian languages. Molotov, Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Soviet Union; Ribbentrop, Plenipotentiary of the Government of Germany. (TASS, 24th)

Berlin - The news of the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was broadcast by the local radio station at 2:00 AM this morning. After hearing the news, officials enthusiastically commented, "The value of this move is self-evident." Political figures attach great importance to Article 4 of the treaty (which stipulates that neither party shall participate in any group that is directly or indirectly unfavorable to the other signatory). The obligations stipulated in the Anti-Comintern Pact and the League of Nations Covenant have been canceled by this article. It is noted that when Germany and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship and neutrality in 1916, the Soviet Union demanded that Germany provide a guarantee that it would not fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant to deal with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the same provision was agreed upon (Article 3 stipulated that if other countries formed a group to boycott one of the signatories by economic and financial means, the other party shall not participate). At the same time, the German government stated in the annex that if the League of Nations made any decision regarding the Soviet Union, Germany should oppose it. However, the situation is different now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded. Germany is bound by the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the Soviet Union is a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, Article 4 of this treaty is worded broadly. (Havas, 24th)

Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made a speech when he returned to Berlin by plane from Moscow, saying, "Historically, if Germany and the Soviet Union are hostile, the situation is extremely bad. Once they become friends, the situation becomes clear. Yesterday was one of the most meaningful days in the fate of our two great nations. Hitler and Stalin have become good friends. The non-aggression and consultation treaty signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and I is solid and unshakable. The two great nations of Germany and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely based on this treaty. This is a major turning point in the history of our two countries. A certain country attempted to encircle Germany and the Soviet Union. This treaty was born in response to this. It will also have a good impact on the relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and the friendship between Germany and Japan. This can be asserted." (Havas, 24th)

### British and French Military Representatives Prepare to Return Home - Germany Also Plans to Woo Turkey

Moscow - The British military delegation will travel to the capital of Finland by plane today or tomorrow. The whereabouts of the French military delegation are still unknown, but the passports required by the representatives were signed by the Soviet authorities yesterday, and they may leave Moscow after the British military delegation. (Havas, 24th)

Moscow - Two representatives of the British military delegation are scheduled to return to London by plane tomorrow to report on the discussions between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The remaining representatives, as well as the French representatives, will remain here, awaiting instructions from their governments, and then decide on their next steps. (Havas, 23rd)

London - Responsible sources here stated that the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have stalled, but have not broken down. The governments of Britain and France both want to understand the true meaning of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact before deciding whether the staff talks should continue. It is still unknown what the Soviet Union's intentions are. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told the ambassadors of Britain and France that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were proceeding too slowly. This is the reason why Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to the non-aggression pact, but the trilateral negotiations can still continue. In addition, Britain and France have once again negotiated with the Polish government, urging it to agree to allow Soviet troops to pass through Polish territory in wartime, so that the main difficulties of the trilateral negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be resolved. (Havas, 23rd)

Berlin - Prime Minister Hitler vigorously advanced the movement to acquire the European balance of power last night, and is trying to get Turkey to leave the democratic camp. The Nazi Party believes that Germany has a high chance of signing a non-aggression pact with Turkey, in order to overthrow the efforts of Britain and France to drag Turkey into the anti-German encirclement front of democratic countries. The German ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, left Berlin last night to go to Turkey. He will negotiate with the Turkish government to sign a non-aggression pact. (Associated Press, 24th)

Berlin - German Ambassador to Turkey Von Papen returned to his post here today. He is reportedly carrying concrete instructions to advise Turkey to change its current policy. (Havas, 24th)

### Japan's Bewilderment - Will It Correct Its Attitude Toward Britain and the United States? - Tokyo Authorities Hold Meetings in Panic - Japanese Newspapers Scold Germany for Selling Out Friends

Tokyo - The authorities held multiple meetings yesterday, which proves that the German-Soviet non-aggression agreement has greatly shaken the authorities. Japan's future policy will be greatly influenced by this move. Konoe set off for Hayama today to inform Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa of Prime Minister Hiranuma's beliefs about the new situation and his own opinions. Asahi Shimbun published a lengthy report from New York today, urging that Japan should correct its attitude toward Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo - Japanese sources here said that the concrete plan to strengthen the anti-communist axis has been invalidated due to Germany's actions. The Japanese government will now adjust its European policy and take unilateral action. Prime Minister Hiranuma, former Prime Minister Konoe, and Minister of the Army Itagaki agreed on this issue yesterday. Minister of the Navy Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and Finance Minister Ishiwata met with the Prime Minister separately today and reportedly agreed with the opinions of Hiranuma, Konoe, and Itagaki. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo - Today, Miyako Shimbun predicted that the Japanese government may declare the abandonment of the Nine-Power Treaty within days, believing that the situation in East Asia has undergone drastic changes since the treaty was established. The Japanese government must absolutely reject the path of collective interference in Japan's affairs in China. All newspapers said that Japan has long held the opinion that the treaty has become a dead letter, but democratic countries still use the treaty as the basis for discussing all issues in China. Britain and the United States are now trying to inquire about Japan's opinions in order to convene an international conference based on the treaty. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today vehemently criticized Germany and became even more resentful due to the alleged offer from Berlin to serve as an intermediary for negotiations on a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty, scolding "Germany for selling out its allies who share the same ideology." On the other hand, the German expatriates here are all elated, saying that Britain and France may retreat without a fight. Asahi Shimbun said that Germany has clearly violated the text and spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the pact has now become a scrap of paper. Japan has abandoned its obligations and must start anew, establishing a new order in East Asia, and this new order can only be completed by expelling communism from Asia. It is absurd for Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the hypothetical enemy against which Japan has been arming for many years. Miyako Shimbun asked sarcastically, "Who said that the Anti-Comintern Pact is a spiritual bond between the related countries?" Saying this is an optimist. Hochi Shimbun said, "The snake catcher has been bitten by the snake. Japan's great anger must be silently endured." Nichi Nichi Shimbun said, "Some people advocate that Japan should determine Germany's true motives. We doubt whether this is possible. Italy may follow Germany and force Japan to follow suit. However, the Soviet government and the name of communism are different in name but the same in reality. Why waste time quibbling now? We can return to an autonomous and independent Japanese policy." (Reuters, 24th)

### Seven Nordic Countries Call for Peace

Brussels, Belgium - The foreign ministers of the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Finland) held a meeting here, which closed at 8:00 PM. King Leopold III of Belgium immediately delivered a speech on behalf of the heads of state of each country, appealing to European countries for peace, and hoping that the current disputes in Europe would be resolved peacefully, without resorting to force. He said, "If all those who hold the key to the situation can truly show a spirit of friendly cooperation, negotiate on the demands they have put forward and the disputes between the countries, this is what we most desire." Although the time is extremely urgent, it is not too late to start negotiations immediately. (Havas, 23rd)

### A Reporter Asks - When Will the Japanese Fleet Sail to the Mediterranean?

Tokyo - At a press conference this morning, Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy, declined to comment on the impact of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty on Japan, but said, "Independence and autonomy are the best and most stable ways to achieve Japan's goal of establishing a new order in East Asia. Japan now has the opportunity to re-recognize the correct situation, and this will definitely become a powerful factor in resolving the China Incident." A reporter asked, "The opinions of the army and navy on Japan's accession to the German-Italian military alliance are different. Has this been resolved?" Kanazawa replied, "This is just a rumor spread by outsiders when various parties discussed this issue without reaching a decision." There is no reason to be anxious about the new situation in Europe, allowing it to change instantaneously in the current international situation. A foreign reporter asked, "When will the Japanese fleet sail to the Mediterranean?" Rear Admiral Kanazawa replied with a smile, "We are preparing." (Reuters, 24th)

### Pope Broadcasts for Peace

Rome - The Pope will deliver a broadcast at 6:00 PM today, urging to end the war. (Reuters, 24th)

### General Numata Passes Away

Tokyo - The Ministry of the Army announced on the 22nd that Lieutenant General Numata Tokushige, who had been active in central and northern China since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, had been hospitalized for dysentery and pneumonia, and passed away at a certain place at 2:25 AM on August 12. (Domei, 23rd)

### Japanese Ambassador Quizzes German Foreign Minister, Parts Ways Unhappily

Berlin: Sources among the Japanese community here recently revealed that prior to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to the Soviet Union, Japanese Ambassador General Oshima met with him on the 22nd to question the signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. At the time, Ambassador Oshima, "in his military style, spoke frankly, without the slightest reservation," and the two sides parted on rather unhappy terms. Regarding this matter, German officials reportedly told the Japanese and Spanish envoys that the Anti-Comintern Pact was purely ideological and that Germany would never allow any commitments accepted by the Soviet Union to affect this pact. Upon hearing this, the Japanese side considered it a "humorous remark." Because Germany did not consult with Japan and Spain beforehand, nor did it inform them of its intentions, people from both Japan and Spain said that Germany's move was extremely bold and requested the German government to explain in detail. This made those in charge in Germany quite unhappy. In addition, some of the German petty bourgeoisie and some workers who followed National Socialism were not sincere. Now hearing the news that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed on a non-aggression treaty, they were extremely pleased. When workers met on the streets, they greeted each other with the cry of "Long Live Moscow." However, true members of the National Socialist Party were all bewildered because their position had to be completely changed after this. Moreover, many people strongly stated that the Soviet Union would occupy a pivotal position in Europe. The fact that the German Foreign Minister was now going to the capital of the Bolshevik country would seriously damage Germany's prestige internationally, and therefore they openly expressed regret. Those in charge said that Germany would hold a memorial on the 27th of this month in Tannenberg for the victory over Russia in the European War. Now, signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, that is, the defeated country in the European War, was inevitably contradictory. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Moscow: The German Embassy here held a banquet, inviting German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, did not attend the banquet. When the German Foreign Minister flew to Moscow, the Japanese Ambassador did not go to the airport either. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Soviet Newspapers Comment: The Soviet-German Agreement

Moscow: Today's editorials in *Pravda* and *Izvestia* both commented on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. *Izvestia* stated, "Stalin, in his historical report to the 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, summarized the part about international politics, saying, "We advocate maintaining peaceful, close, and friendly relations with all our neighbors." This principle has long been the cornerstone of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union has always used this principle as a guideline, and has consistently strived to safeguard universal peace, thereby first and foremost striving to maintain peaceful relations with countries geographically closest to it. Stalin continued in the aforementioned report, "This is our position, and we will abide by it, as long as these countries maintain similar relations with the Soviet Union, and do not attempt to directly or indirectly infringe upon the integrity and inviolability of the Soviet Union's borders." "The recent development of relations between Germany and the Soviet Union is a good example of this principle. On August 19, the two countries signed a commercial and credit agreement in Berlin. On August 23, the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was concluded in Moscow. These two documents are of great significance not only for the relations between the two signatory countries, but also for the entire world's international political situation. It is self-evident that the establishment of peaceful relations between two major powers such as the Soviet Union and Germany will inevitably be sufficient to calm the extremely tense general international situation. Not only the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact, but also the content of the pact is completely sufficient to prove this. It is commonly known that in relations between countries, certain problems often arise that can lead to disputes and conflicts contrary to the original intentions of both parties. The pact signed on August 23 contains provisions for such incidents, stating that when such incidents occur, "the two parties will resolve such disputes or conflicts exclusively through peaceful means, through friendly exchanges of views or, if necessary, by establishing a commission to mediate the conflict." The pact further stipulates that the two parties must maintain contact, and engage in discussions and exchange of information on matters pertaining to their common interests. This condition will first and foremost assist in preventing the aforementioned unforeseen events, namely disputes and conflicts between the two parties, from occurring. Therefore, from a political and legal standpoint, the pact signed in Moscow yesterday, with a term of ten years, is a document of extraordinary significance. This pact brings the relations between the two major countries to complete normalcy, and this point alone will surely help to stabilize the international political situation in Europe and the world. This pact has put an end to the adversarial attitude in the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the adversarial attitude is precisely what the enemies of both countries are attempting to instigate and prolong. Differences in ideology and political systems should not and must not prevent the establishment and maintenance of good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany. In summary, "this newly signed non-aggression pact, as well as the commercial and credit agreement of August 19, inherently contain the necessary preconditions for the friendly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany to develop day by day." *Pravda* stated, "The significance of the pact goes beyond adjusting the relations between the two signatory countries. The conclusion of the pact comes at a time when the international situation has reached an extremely sharp and tense degree. The Soviet-German non-aggression pact is indeed an act of peace and will undoubtedly help to ease the international tensions. The conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact is undoubtedly a very important event of international significance, because it is a tool for peace and will not only promote good neighborly and peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, but will also be beneficial to the consolidation of general peace. The hostility between the Soviet Union and Germany has now ceased. Differences in ideology and political systems should not and must not become obstacles to establishing good neighborly relations between the two countries. The friendship between the Soviet and German peoples, which had been put into a stalemate by the enemies of the two countries, now has the necessary conditions for development and prosperity." (TASS dispatch, 23rd)

### British Nationals in Germany Ordered to Evacuate

Berlin: British Ambassador Henderson recently issued a notice to the country's consulates and nationals, stating, "Due to the tense relations between Britain and Germany, all nationals are advised to prepare for a temporary evacuation as soon as possible. Anyone who makes a decision in accordance with this order should be responsible for their own actions." Many copies of this notice have already been printed, and all nationals can request to read them at the embassy. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### Zhu Zongzhuo, Yuan Hanjun, Former Nankai Students: Zhang Boling's Statement

Chongqing: Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University and Vice-Chairman of the National Political Council, told a Reuters reporter this morning that Zhu Zongzhuo and Yuan Hanjun, who recently sent a letter to the Hong Kong government confessing to being the assassins of Cheng Xigeng, were both former students of Tianjin Nankai University. After the fall of Tianjin, the two remained in the area due to important missions. Although he cannot actively prove that the two were the assassins of Cheng Xigeng, there is indeed strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that this is extremely possible. Both were excellent students. After speaking, Zhang showed a copy of the 1936 Nankai University alumni directory, which stated that Zhu Zongzhuo was from Gushi County, Henan, was 17 years old at the time, and was studying in the first year of high school. Zhang also said that he knew Zhu's grandfather and father and also had a cousin who was currently working as an assistant teacher at Tsinghua University in Kunming. Zhang continued, stating that Yuan Hanjun graduated from the Nankai Middle School in 1936, was 19 years old at the time, and was originally from Shangyu, Zhejiang. When Nankai moved from Tianjin to Sichuan Province, the two students did not come to Chongqing until August 7 of this year, when they visited professors and classmates at the school. The two were extremely tight-lipped about their activities, only asking their classmates not to publicize the news of their arrival in Chongqing. Zhang also recalled the destruction of Tianjin Nankai University by the Japanese two years ago and said that his students were determined to avenge the country and the school. More than eighty Nankai students have sacrificed themselves in this decisive battle. Zhu and Yuan were both good young men, and it is very possible that they were the real assassins of Cheng Xigeng, because he knows that there are many former Nankai students now engaged in patriotic work in Tianjin and other parts of North China. Zhang agreed to inquire among the two's former classmates whether there were any letters or conversations that could prove that they were related to this case. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Hong Kong Forms a Major Fortress: Presents an Unprecedented State of Tension; British Forces Have Mobilized Military Strength; Working on Defense Throughout the Night; Heavy Artillery Transported to the Mountain Peak for Placement; Women and Children Prepare to Move to Manila

Hong Kong: Since the British government instructed the Hong Kong government to take all necessary security measures, Hong Kong has outwardly transformed into a major fortress. According to British military authorities, the Japanese troops concentrated around the Kowloon border and their weapons far exceed what is necessary to deal with guerrillas. As for the present, although there is not yet any major change expected here, the British have already begun various preventive measures, such as the evacuation of civilians, the mobilization of defensive forces, and the control of food supplies. At the same time, the artillery positions that were set up on the mountain peaks of Hong Kong several months ago are also being used by the British to transport heavy artillery up the mountain for placement, to supplement the inadequacy of the Stanley Military Island Battery and the Davis Battery, in order to control the gateway to Hong Kong. Also, the British military headquarters here presents an unprecedented state of tension, and employs Chinese laborers to work on defense works and the urgent construction of air-raid shelters throughout the night. British military authorities have asked reporters not to inspect the Kowloon border area. Most British women and children and other foreign nationals have prepared to evacuate and move to Manila. According to the American consulate here, there is extreme crowding of people seeking to go to Manila. Also, tonight the government spokesperson stated in a radio broadcast that all women and children should evacuate early before the situation worsens, because Hong Kong has become a fortress, and in the event of war, the presence of women and children here would only be a hindrance, so the government has no choice but to order an evacuation. It was also said that although the current situation has not yet reached the final critical point, preparations should be made as early as possible. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: The troop transport ship *Ettrick* is now prepared to carry naval and army officers' families out of the country in an emergency. All officers' families have received orders to pack and prepare. The intention is that there will be no notice of departure in six hours when they must leave the country. At the same time, the *Ettrick* is scheduled to sail out on Saturday or Sunday if the situation does not improve. As for where it is sailing to, it has not been announced. The authorities in Manila and Macau have agreed to cancel regulations such as the requirement for incoming persons to have a sanitary certificate to facilitate the entry of refugees. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: Due to the changes in the European situation and the increasingly tense Japanese encirclement, the authorities have sent engineers to demolish the Luohu Railway Bridge and dig trenches along the Tai Po Road in preparation for sealing off Kowloon at any time. Border Indian troops have been transferred to the rear, replaced by British troops on the front line, and volunteer corps on the second line. There are increasing numbers of people withdrawing deposits from Hong Kong's Chinese and foreign banks, and many German nationals have left. The inventory of a certain German firm is being rushed to Shanghai. (Special dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: Hong Kong government news. The Japanese have hung banners on poles more than ten feet long in Shenzhen with the words "Ordered by the Chairman to Reclaim the Concessions." Japanese soldiers and supplies continue to land and unload in Nantou. Dozens of Japanese gunboats and armed fishing boats are gathered there. According to reports, 5,000 Japanese troops are heading to Shenzhen, and most of the Japanese troops in Shatoujiao have withdrawn. (Special dispatch, 24th)

London: According to Reuters, official London has acknowledged the startling news of the Japanese blockade of Hong Kong. It is said that Chinese guerrillas have been very active in that area and elsewhere recently. The Japanese army has notified the Hong Kong government 48 hours before military action in accordance with the conditions agreed upon last year. The relationship between the British and Japanese staff officers on the border continues to be friendly as before. Also, according to a senior official speaking to a Reuters reporter, the cutting off of roads and bridges on the Kowloon border, and the warning to women and children to prepare to evacuate, are merely one aspect of the precautions taken by the British Empire in various places due to the precarious European situation. Unfortunately, this happened to coincide with the Japanese military action, which led to various rumors. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo: According to news from the Japanese side in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government has secretly ordered the families of naval and army personnel to prepare to leave the country immediately upon receiving a six-hour notice. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: In view of the tension in the local situation, the authorities have continued to implement security plans. Foreign women and children living in the New Territories have been advised to move to the city yesterday. Today, women and children living on the islands of Stunkets and Stanley have also received the same advice. It is reported that the families of naval and army personnel have been ordered to pack their luggage in preparation for relocation, and arrangements for the evacuation of civilians are also underway as necessary. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: External news. In the afternoon of the 23rd, the British military authorities had destroyed the railway and highway bridges on the Shenzhen River.

It is heard that this measure belongs to preparations for any eventuality. (Dispatch, 23rd)

Singapore: According to news here today, the families of British naval and army personnel now in Hong Kong plan to come here on the transport ship *Atreus*, which is expected to arrive here at the end of the month. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

Chongqing: Someone inquired here about the possible impact of the overall situation from well-informed Chinese sources, who replied, "We do not know what changes the future will bring." However, they said that it is highly doubtful that Japan will truly attempt to occupy Hong Kong. Before the announcement of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, it was generally believed that Japan was preparing to put pressure on Britain in the Far East, but recent developments in Europe may have completely changed the situation. At the same time, it is widely believed that Japan may take advantage of Britain's difficult position in Europe to threaten Hong Kong, in order to induce Britain to follow Japan's example in the Far East and revise the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Even if Japan makes this attempt, it will only occupy Kowloon, and will not obstruct Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Hong Kong: According to British authorities tonight, all ports in Hong Kong are now deploying mines to implement security. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

### Six Japanese Planes Shot Down in Air Battle Over Chongqing the Night Before Last; Bombs Dropped Entirely in the Fields; Japanese Claimed to Have Attacked Xiaolongkan

Chongqing: According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, six Japanese bombers were shot down in the Chongqing air battle last night.

Chongqing: All-India Congress President Nehru's first night in Chongqing was both stimulating and interesting, as Japanese planes attempted to raid and were defeated by Chinese fighter planes after a fierce air battle. Upon receiving news of the arrival of the Japanese planes, President Chiang immediately called Nationalist Party Secretary-General Zhu Jiahua and instructed him to ensure Nehru's safety. The Indian leader was then led into Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's well-built air-raid shelter. Wang, along with Minister of Communications Zhang Jiaao, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council Zhang Jun, and League of Nations expert Rajchman, were also there. During the air raid, Nehru and the Chinese leaders happily exchanged views on domestic and international issues for two hours. Twenty-seven Japanese bombers, taking advantage of the moonlight and the difficulty for Chinese fighter planes to attack in the dark, flew directly to Chongqing from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in two groups at about 6:30 pm. As soon as the alarm was sounded, Chinese fighter planes immediately took off. Twenty-five minutes later, the Japanese planes appeared, and the fighter planes immediately engaged them. The Japanese bombers attempted to break through in two groups, but each time they were intercepted by the defending planes. The sound of machine guns could be heard clearly, and the planes could be seen tumbling up and down. Because the Chinese interception was very fierce, the Japanese planes only dropped a few bombs far from the city and failed to bomb Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo: Today, news from the Japanese military training here claims that "Japanese naval aircraft attacked the Xiaolongkan military facility sixteen miles west of Chongqing last night and carried out effective bombing. It is heard that the Chongqing government is currently building another Chongqing in that area. Although the Japanese planes encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire and the challenge of six Chinese fighter planes, all of them returned safely to their original defenses. As a result of the Japanese attack, several places in Xiaolongkan caught fire." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Chen Lifu, other government officials, and civil leaders also attended. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### British Army Garrison in Tianjin Destroyed by Flood; One British Soldier Electrocuted and Killed

Beiping: According to travelers arriving here from Tianjin, the British army garrison in Tianjin has been destroyed by the flood. The rain has not stopped, but it is no longer as intense as before. The authorities have now prepared to cope with several weeks of emergency measures. Tianjin British Army Commander Brigadier Lowry has been forced to move to a hotel higher up in the British concession. The British army spent a night sleeping on the roofs of their barracks and are now stationed in various warehouses. The army's bakery and hospital have also been washed away. Although there is still a lot of flour, it is very difficult to make the bread needed by the entire army. The residence of an official of the British Consulate General has now been converted into a hospital. Lifeboats, etc., from the British escort ship *Santarves* (1,045 tons) are now being piloted by naval soldiers to transport goods to and from the streets of the British concession. All commerce has completely stopped, and the shops have all closed their doors. The clerks of the flooded banks are living in the banks. The British concession still has no electricity. It is heard that even the intermittent supply of tap water has now been cut off. The water in the Japanese concession is ten feet high. Japanese nationals seeking refuge are now arriving here in droves. The yachts of Beiping's lakes have all been requisitioned to be sent to Tianjin by the military to reduce the difficulty of transportation on the flooded streets. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Tianjin: Last night, a British soldier was found electrocuted on the barbed wire barrier surrounding the British concession. His name is still unknown. Several Chinese and one foreigner in the British concession have drowned. The foreigner drowned in the center of the British concession. It is believed to be a Russian. At the same time, there is a great danger of an epidemic spreading in Tianjin, as the flood has broken through the latrines, causing a nauseating stench to fill the city. Food supplies are very scarce, and prices are soaring. The authorities are now organizing food collection points and are planning to use barges to transport water from Tanggu, as it is expected that the water supply may be cut off at any time. There is still no electricity. (Dispatch, 24th)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the focus of military operations this week (August 16th to 22nd) remained in southeastern Shanxi. All other fronts saw only sporadic fighting. Chinese forces maintained a steady, defensive approach, repeatedly blunting enemy advances. The capture of Jincheng dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. The details of the campaign are outlined below:

"Shanxi Front": Since the enemy advanced along the Baijin Highway with the superior strength of five divisions, our forces adopted a scorched-earth tactic, deploying in the mountains on both sides. Taking advantage of the enemy's lack of a firm foothold, we launched attacks from multiple directions. Since last week, we have successively captured strongholds west of the highway, including Yangcheng, Qinshui, Qinyuan, and Changzi, as well as Yushe, Wuxiang, Liaoxian, and Linxian to the east. We defeated the invading enemy and besieged Jincheng, the enemy's last stronghold. Although the Japanese continuously reinforced and counterattacked, they were repeatedly repelled. By the evening of the 19th, the Japanese were overwhelmed and fled north. On the morning of the 20th, the county town was completely recovered. We then pressed forward, capturing Tianjingguan on the border of Shanxi and Henan provinces, and pursued the enemy to Sanliqiao, Qilingcun, and Wangtai, cutting off their reinforcements. Over 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 1,000 weapons were seized. Our vanguard is now pressing on the outskirts of Gaoping City, and its capture is imminent. The enemy's attempt to control the borders of Henan and Hebei provinces by holding the Baijin and Jijin highways has been completely shattered by our forces. The enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang in western Shanxi, after being fiercely attacked by our troops for several days, is in a precarious situation, now only holding their positions defensively. We are intensifying our encirclement. "Guangdong Front": The Japanese troops in the Chaozhou-Shantou area of eastern Guangdong launched a three-pronged attack on Shaxitou last week. After being routed by our forces, the enemy repeatedly launched attacks through Anbu, but were heavily defeated. Some enemy troops aggressively attacked Dongpu and Fengxi, attempting to divert our forces, but they were intercepted and defeated. The enemy retreated into the city and has remained inactive. In the Zengcheng-Conghua area of the northern Guangdong front, we engaged the enemy in fierce battles at Shengang, Longtian, and Baitagang, killing over 500 enemy soldiers. The area is now completely under our control. On the western Guangdong front, since the 19th, over 1,000 enemy soldiers advancing along the Xinhe and Xinkai roads were lured into pre-set positions in the Duruan, Jinggen, and Pingdiling areas and surrounded and annihilated. The enemy abandoned over 500 bodies and fled back to Jiangmen. We pursued and pressed the attack to the city walls, continuing the fierce assault. Separately, over 2,000 enemy troops landed in Nantou (south of Bao'an) and Dapeng Bay, engaging our forces in fierce battles. Since the 18th, we have launched a courageous counterattack against the enemy invading Shenzhen, fighting fiercely for several days. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. There are now no enemy traces in the Miaoquan area of Bao'an. The enemy in Dapeng Bay, after being met with a head-on assault, suffered a major defeat and fled back to their ships, appearing to be retreating.

"Henan Front": In southern Henan, after our forces briefly recaptured Changtaiguan last week, they continued their fierce attacks, and on the 18th, once again entered the North Gate, inflicting significant casualties. Another of our forces advanced towards Luotuo Shop, approaching the West Gate of Xinyang, and attacked the city with artillery, resulting in intense fighting. Over 2,000 enemy troops in Tongxu, Taiqian, and Dongming counties in eastern Henan were subjected to continuous fierce attacks by our forces. The enemy, attempting to defend on multiple fronts, suffered heavy casualties. Qixian city remains surrounded by our forces. A unit of our surprise troops seized the opportunity to attack the Lanfeng railway station, burning enemy ammunition depots and barracks. Now, all enemy communication lines east of Kaifeng along the Longhai Railway have been cut off by our forces. Several thousand enemy troops in Wuzhi and Muleidian in northern Henan have been launching fierce attacks to the west for days, but have been repeatedly met with head-on assaults, resulting in numerous enemy deaths. The remnants fled back along their original route. The railway between Xinxiang and Anyang and Xiuwu has been completely destroyed by our forces, cutting off their rear and causing extreme panic. Additionally, on the morning of the 21st, enemy troops from Qinyang advanced towards us through Baixiang Town. Our forces launched a timely counterattack, luring the enemy to the vicinity of Guanzhuang, where they were surrounded and annihilated. The enemy abandoned over 300 bodies and fled. There are now no enemy traces in Baixiang Town.

In addition, the great victory in western Suiyuan resulted in the recapture of Baotou and the capture of key points north of Wenling, with over 1,000 enemy soldiers killed. In southern Hebei, we pressed towards Zaoqiang. In Shandong province, we captured Chaocheng and Fanxian, and surrounded Shanghe, Pingdu, and Ye County. In southern Anhui, we besieged Digang and recaptured Jiangyao. In Zou County, we captured Yuanjiaji and Daban Town. In northern Hunan, we captured Wuxingpai. In northern Jiangxi, we defeated the enemy advancing on Zhanggongdu and advanced on Bowu and Ningdu. In Jiangsu province, we recaptured Shucheng Town in Rugao County. In western Zhejiang, we attacked Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu, controlling traffic on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. All of these are important recent victories. This report is attached for your information. (Dispatch from the 24th)

### Guangzhou Newspapers Advocate Anti-British Sentiment

Guangzhou – The intensity of the anti-British movement in Guangdong province's newspapers has noticeably increased. This morning, a certain newspaper published an article titled "Guangzhou People Demand the Return of the British Concession." The newspaper concluded with a threatening statement: "The people of Guangzhou will carry out very serious actions within one or two days." When some officials were asked about this article, they reportedly did not approve of the outbreak of anti-British activities. Non-official sources believe that the anti-British movement will not extend beyond newspaper advocacy. (Reuters dispatch from the 24th)

### Calculation Standard for Exchange Rate Differences

Chongqing – The Ministry of Finance's measures for settling and collecting exchange rate differences for exported goods, announced on July 1st and 13th, and the measures for reporting export settlement, have all been stipulated. Foreign exchange earned from the sale of exported goods, after being settled at the legal rate through the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications, may receive from the bank an exchange rate difference equivalent to the difference between the legal rate and the bank's posted rate. Subsequently, due to merchants failing to settle, the method of calculating this exchange rate difference, whether based on the posted rate on the date of signing the foreign exchange purchase certificate or the posted rate on the date of selling the foreign exchange to the bank, was a matter of dispute, and the Trade Commission was requested to interpret it. After considering commercial conditions, the commission submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to investigations, the commission has received an order from the ministry stipulating that all exchange rate differences for export goods should be calculated based on the Bank of China's posted rate on the date the foreign exchange purchase certificate was signed. The bank will indicate the posted rate on the certificate when issuing it, for future reference. This regulation will allow exporters to estimate the costs, profits, and losses of goods, reducing their business risks and encouraging the export of domestic goods, which will greatly benefit the entire export trade. (Dispatch from the 24th)

### Orders

Orders from the National Government on the 24th: (1) Appointing Pan Yizhi as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; this order. (2) Appointing Gu Fengxiang as the Supervising Commissioner for the Provincial Examinations of Guizhou Province; this order. (3) Appointing Shen Zemin as a Senator of the Military Advisory Council; this order.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Gaoyou, Seemingly in Retaliation

Correspondent from Taixian: At 10:00 AM on the 20th, a Japanese bomber suddenly appeared over Gaoyou County, circling the city once before dropping two bombs and flying south. Both bombs landed in empty areas, causing no local damage. The purpose of the Japanese bombing appears to be retaliation for the recent fierce attacks by Chinese forces on Zhaoguan Dam and Shaobo, where the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. They are attempting to disrupt the rear with aerial bombings. However, the morale of the Chinese troops has not been affected.

### Green-Stalked Rice from Qingpu Confiscated in Shanghai; Over 5,000 Bags

Correspondent from Qingpu: The other day, over 5,000 bags of green-stalked rice from Qingpu, packed into 18 boats, were being transported from Qingpu along the Dayingpu River to Suzhou Creek and then to Shanghai. However, near the Toyota textile factory, they were seized by the Japanese, who claimed that certain procedures had not been followed. Rice merchants are currently in contact with the Japanese. It is heard that rice shops in the countryside have ample rice stocks, and the early rice harvest is about to begin. If the authorities can make every effort to regulate the market, it will not be difficult for rice prices in Shanghai to drop slightly.

### The Tianjin Blockade: A Review of British Interests - Translated from the "Millard's Review of the Far East"

As this reporter writes, the Tianjin incident has become a matter of prestige. The specific British interests involved, however, have been overlooked. Tianjin, with its British Concession, the only one in North China, and its enjoyment of judicial privileges, is the cornerstone of the British position in the region and a key commercial and distribution center. British interests concentrated in and around Tianjin cover a wide range of activities. This is evident from the names of some of the major British firms operating in the city, such as the Kailan Mining Administration, British-American Tobacco Company, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Asiatic Petroleum Company, Dunlop Rubber Company, Brunner, Mond & Co., Jardine Matheson & Co., Butterfield & Swire, Tianjin Anstie Export Co., and China Soap Company. Recent estimates put the number of British firms operating in Tianjin at 117, with 98 having capital of over 50,000 yuan. In addition to these private organizations, there is the British-run Tianjin British Municipal Council's electric power company, with a generating capacity of 7,500 kilowatts, and a water plant with a daily supply capacity of one million gallons. In 1936, land tax revenue (perhaps around one percent of taxable value) reached 255,746 yuan, and rent tax reached 487,662 yuan, indicating the scale of real estate interests within the concession itself.

The major British interest in Tianjin is trade. New factors arising from the current conflict, such as the redefinition of coastal trade routes, the blockade of other ports, and rising prices, have resulted in changes that cannot be accurately calculated at this time. However, available statistics can still indicate the importance of Tianjin to British trade and serve as a basis for comparison with the pre-war situation. British ships held the top position at the port of Tianjin until 1938, when they were surpassed by Japanese vessels and relegated to second place. Last year, the total tonnage of British ships entering and leaving Tianjin was 1,763,461 tons, of which 1,355,706 tons were coastal vessels. This total is still an increase of 299,461 tons over 1937, and 49,230 tons more than in 1936.

Similarly, during this decisive conflict, the total value of British exports from Tianjin has not decreased. Instead, it has increased from 10,379,840 yuan in 1936 to 11,738,520 yuan in 1938. However, during the same period, the value of Tianjin's exports to Japan increased from 28,440,410 yuan to 78,210,785 yuan (exports to the United States decreased from 44,285,017 yuan to 31,257,541 yuan). In 1938, Tianjin's major exports to the United Kingdom were livestock and livestock products, mostly bristles, eggs, and egg products (7,029,770 yuan), hides, leather, and skins (478,513 yuan), seeds, mostly almonds (513,475 yuan), and textile fibers and products, mostly wool (2,928,470 yuan).

The war has had different effects on this trade. Hides, leather, and skins, seeds, textile fibers and products, and bristles all decreased between 1936 and 1938. Only seeds have recovered from their 1937 position. The most serious impact on British interests has been the decline in wool exports, largely due to Japanese monopolization of wool. However, the increase in exports of livestock and livestock products, particularly eggs and egg products, has more than compensated for this loss.

British goods imported into Tianjin in 1938 amounted to 3,538,535 gold units (one gold unit is equivalent to 2.26 yuan or approximately 68 US cents before devaluation), compared to 3,539,849 gold units in 1937 and 2,851,235 gold units in 1936, a slight increase. Imports of Japanese goods, however, increased rapidly from 11,992,151 gold units in 1936 to 54,436,018 gold units in 1938. The increase in American imports during the same period was not as rapid as that of Japanese goods, increasing from 3,926,565 gold units to 9,158,510 gold units. The most important items of British goods imported into Tianjin in 1938 were white and dyed cotton cloth (65,556 gold units), wool and woolen products (399,608 gold units), metals and ores (955,567 gold units), vehicles and ships (122,853 gold units), metal sundries (101,301 gold units), chemicals and pharmaceuticals (723,940 gold units), dyes, pigments, and paints (58,517 gold units), and books, maps, paper, and wood pulp (46,360 gold units).

Wool and woolen products, dyes, pigments, paints, books, maps, paper, and wood pulp have all decreased sharply, while metals and ores, as well as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, have increased dramatically. Among many other less important items—such as tobacco, wine, beer, liquor, candles, soap, kerosene, fats, wax, gums, resins, and leather—although the amounts are smaller, they have all increased significantly.

Actions such as the establishment of export monopolies, the prohibition of certain exports, foreign exchange controls, revisions of tax rates to favor Japanese products, discriminatory treatment in granting railway access, and inadequate telegraph services have all hampered and harmed British interests. However, the British commercial position in Tianjin, until the recent crisis, has remained strong. The blockade of the concession itself poses an unparalleled danger to British interests.

### Japanese Army Threatens Hong Kong; British Officer Says Hong Kong Can Hold Out for Nine Months

Hong Kong Correspondent: The Japanese army has again invaded Shenzhen and has issued threatening statements against Hong Kong. Therefore, the question of how long Hong Kong's military preparations can last during a crisis is of great concern to the general public. Recently, a reporter from the London Sketch visited Hong Kong and, based on his observations, expressed optimism. Now, retired British Army Colonel Robinson has also expressed his views, strongly asserting that Hong Kong's defense can be maintained for at least nine months. Colonel Robinson retired on July 26th of last year and returned home in August. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the London Daily Telegraph, directly refuting rumors that Hong Kong's defense capabilities are weak, calling them ignorant. The letter listed Hong Kong's military equipment on both the offensive and defensive sides in great detail. The letter briefly stated that anyone familiar with the situation in the Far East can confidently declare to anyone, whether friend or foe, that Hong Kong is by no means indefensible. To say that it is indefensible is a fallacy. In terms of Hong Kong's military preparations, even if it were completely surrounded, it could be defended for at least nine months. As for naval attacks, the coastal forts are extremely strong and powerful, and a large number of submarines are active and can handle any situation. If the enemy wants to land or attack from the mainland, they will also meet strong resistance. It would take them months or even years to succeed.

### Chinese Forces in Northern Jiangsu Re-Enter Lianshui City and Approach Huai'an and Huaibei

Correspondent from Taixian: The Chinese forces in northern Jiangsu have been vigorously reorganized by the authorities, and after a considerable period of training, their morale is high and their strength is abundant. On the anniversary of "August 13th", they launched an offensive against the Japanese army on all fronts, north and south, achieving good results in the following days. In the Lianshui area, they have re-entered the county seat. In the Huai'an and Huaibei areas, they also hold a very advantageous position. According to reports from the front, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Dongchen Town, Rugao, at dawn on the 13th, engaging the Japanese army in fierce fighting. The Japanese army initially held their strong fortifications, stubbornly resisting, but the Chinese army, undeterred, finally drove the Japanese army back at 3:00 AM on the 13th. Dongchen Town was officially recovered by the Chinese army. After the Japanese army fled back to Rugao City, they closed their gates and defended it to the death. The Japanese in Huaian and Lianshui have been subjected to repeated counterattacks by the Chinese army for several days. The Japanese special services agency has ordered Japanese merchants, prostitutes, and various looted goods to be transported to Suqian as quickly as possible, and they have been busy transporting them in recent days. Also, a certain brigade of the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese army in Jijia City and Gushan Town at dawn on the 13th, encountering the Japanese army. The Chinese army charged bravely. A unit of a certain regiment occupied Gushan Town. The main force of the Chinese army engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army defending Jijia City. The Japanese army, unable to hold out, disregarded humanitarian principles and released poison gas shells, which was extremely brutal. The morale of the Chinese army is extremely high, and they continue to surround and annihilate the Japanese army in Jijiashi.

### Japanese Merchants in Nanjing Hoarding Copper Coins and Subsidiary Currency; Branches Established in Xuzhou and Bengbu

Nanjing Correspondent: Since Shanghai suddenly experienced a shortage of copper coins and fractional currency, the market has been greatly affected. The counties in the Shanghai-Nanjing occupied areas have also suffered the same situation. Copper coins in Nanjing have all been collected by Japanese merchants. The organizations specializing in collecting copper coins and subsidiary currency are the Meizhong and Xingzhong money exchanges on Zhonghua Road, and the Takahashi branch of Japanese merchants on Taiping Road and Guofu Road. All of these are branches of the Japanese merchant Ishifuku. They collect over a thousand yuan in copper coins every day. Their scope is very broad. In addition to Nanjing, branches have also been established in Xuzhou and Bengbu. Furthermore, the Japanese Fujiya on Zhongshan Road secretly purchases copper coins and ships them to Shanghai and then to Japan. The Nanjing money industry association has investigated the facts and reported them to the headquarters of the Japanese military special services agency, requesting that it be banned. However, the special services agency feigned ignorance and did not take action.

### Japan Takes a Cautious Attitude Towards the Situation in Shanghai; Threatens Action But Not Blockade; Yamada's Speech Reveals Desire for Peace; Shanghai Rumors All Baseless

High-ranking figures in the Japanese Central China Army recently answered reporters' questions regarding the rumor that the Japanese would blockade the concessions, claiming there were "several policies." The Japanese authorities stationed in Shanghai may take action. He continued that he could not say for sure what methods the Japanese authorities would take, but in his opinion, there was no indication of any isolation measures similar to Tianjin. However, he had told people on Monday that "Japanese naval and military authorities are now quite serious and cautious in their consideration of newly occurring sudden events." He firmly believed that the final outcome of any event must be handled by the Japanese military authorities. Furthermore, Yamada, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army, invited Western reporters yesterday. The details are as follows. Yamada, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and invited foreign reporters yesterday to deliver a speech. It was generally speculated that he would express opinions related to the situation in Shanghai. Because the Berlin wireless broadcast news the day before yesterday claimed that the Japanese would soon blockade Shanghai, many Western reporters were eager to attend. Yamada did not mention a word about the situation in Shanghai. Japanese briefings for reporters were usually held at 5:00 PM, but yesterday it was specially moved earlier.

The occasion expressed an unwillingness for war

It was held at 10:30 AM in the Japanese naval attaché's office on Rue D'esperey. During the session, Yamada vigorously promoted "peace," speaking eloquently about the need for cooperation and expressing his dislike for war. Japan did not want to bomb China or harm third-country nationals or their interests, etc. The situation was different from the previous "news briefing meetings." It was widely believed that after Japan was abandoned by Germany, the world no longer had any country to side with it, and it was in a state of panic. It had no choice but to slightly ease its pressure on Britain, deliberately spreading an atmosphere of peace to observe the changes.

Rumors have absolutely no basis

The North China Daily News said that (on the 23rd) Shanghai was rife with rumors, spreading throughout the two concessions, causing anxiety among merchants and citizens and causing considerable tension. There was talk in the clubs, pubs, and other meeting places, all discussing the future of Shanghai following the European situation. Those in charge of identifying these rumors included some Japanese military personnel, the Municipal Council, and the Consular authorities. They confirmed that they were rumors, including the occupation of certain parts of the western district of the Public Concession by the Japanese army, the accumulation of Japanese troops in the areas near the Public Concession, and the landing of Japanese reinforcements. However, many people seemed intent on spreading them, causing considerable agitation among Chinese and foreign citizens here. Yesterday afternoon, when asked whether the Japanese would invade the Public Concession, a semi-official Japanese source said that this may not happen. The general feeling in informed circles here is also that the Japanese will not take this action. According to Municipal Council officials, they have heard all the rumors. Although the Japanese issued a statement on Tuesday saying that they were planning strict measures, they had no factual basis to clarify all the rumors.

Japanese troops will take several measures

The Shanghai Times reported that Colonel Mabuchi, the head of the Chinese Army Press Corps, disclosed last night (the 23rd) while answering questions from journalists regarding rumors of an impending blockade of the Shanghai Public Concession, that the Japanese military authorities would take "several measures" in Shanghai. According to him, he could not say exactly what measures the Japanese military would take, but in his opinion, it was unlikely that they would "immediately take any steps similar to those in Tianjin." Since the Japanese army and navy announced on Tuesday that they were deeply concerned about recent unfortunate incidents, he believed that "the Japanese military authorities will eventually take some action." When asked about rumors that 10,000 to 12,000 Japanese soldiers had recently arrived in Shanghai from North China, Mabuchi replied that he could not comment on this, "because any military action is a military secret."

Bizarre News from Berlin Broadcast

Regarding the rumors of a blockade that have been unsettling Shanghai for the past two days, a foreigner said last night that he received a news broadcast from Berlin at 5:30 PM local time, broadcast at 10:30 AM Berlin time, stating that according to news from Shanghai, the blockade of the Public Concession was imminent. The Berlin announcer also stated that, according to foreign sources, the Japanese had already blockaded the Huangpu River for an hour to allow 10,000 troops to land.

British troops on patrol are merely on alert

At the same time, it was reported that British troops from the East Surrey Regiment were patrolling along the western boundary of the concessions last night. According to those in charge, these troops are merely on alert. There is nothing unusual about their activities in the western district. Yesterday afternoon, rumors spread that Japanese military police had begun patrolling the roads outside the boundaries. This has been denied by the police. However, they acknowledged that Japanese military police did appear on the roads outside the boundary yesterday, merely to install telephone wires.

Municipal Council Replied to Japanese Consulate's Communication

The North China Daily News reported that at the Japanese reception for journalists yesterday (the 23rd), it was revealed that regarding the shooting case on Rue D'esperey involving concession police and "Greater Shanghai Municipal Police," the Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter of protest to Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden on Tuesday. Fessenden replied to Miura on the same day, requesting that the Japanese authorities investigate. His reply to the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" stated that the results of the investigation by the Public Concession authorities differed from the results of the Japanese investigation. The Public Concession authorities hoped that all evidence should be examined by a third party and that both sides should first agree on this step. The reply concluded by saying that Miura had correctly requested a postponement of the return of public concession police to the area north of the Suzhou Creek.

Kimurik's Room is Closely Guarded

The North China Daily News reported that after Kimurik, the western inspector of the police, was hospitalized in the Country Hospital for treatment, two plainclothes Japanese military police attempted to enter his room. To prevent a possible intrusion by the Japanese military police in the future, it was decided to station a detective from the western precinct outside Kimurik's room. It was also reported that the authorities had strictly ordered that only police officers and those holding special passes would be allowed to enter the room. A reporter who wanted to confirm this report made a phone call to the Country Hospital yesterday (the 23rd) to inquire, and the hospital said to ask the police. Although it had been known since Sunday morning that British troops were stationed outside Kimurik's room, the reason for this security measure was not confirmed by those in charge until yesterday. Kimurik was injured by a plainclothes policeman while questioning the "Greater Shanghai Municipal Police" on Rue D'esperey.

### Rice and Grain Free Transportation to Shanghai: Agreement Reached and Implementation to Follow Soon. Japanese Side Expresses Doubt About Rice Shortage in Shanghai, but Acknowledges Difficulties in Transporting Rice from the Interior. Various Groups Agree on Methods for Ordering Foreign Rice.

The English-language *North China Daily News* reports: Official sources indicate that the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities regarding increasing the allowance for rice and grain transported into the two concessions. Once discussions are completed, it is expected that implementation will follow soon, restoring normalcy to matters concerning rice and grain.

Japanese Observation of Rice Shortage Reasons

*Continental Daily News* reports: Colonel Mabuchi, head of the Japanese Army press corps in Central China, stated at a press conference yesterday (23rd) that if the Public Concession authorities cannot find a solution to the rice and grain question in the city, it will be time for the Japanese to take over. If Public Concession officials are unable or refuse to act, potentially causing disturbances that disrupt the peace and order of Shanghai and its suburbs, the Japanese authorities feel compelled to take appropriate measures to resolve the rice and grain problem. Regarding the "so-called rice shortage," the Japanese authorities are quite frustrated, yet they doubt the term "shortage" is entirely accurate. Mabuchi continued, stating that there is actually no such shortage, as speculators, even the Public Concession authorities, are constantly hoarding large quantities of rice and grain. The extremely high rice prices are causing harm. He believes that the Public Concession authorities and merchants, acting out of self-interest with such astonishing measures, should resolve this problem.

Acknowledging Japanese Tax Obstacles

At this point, a certain foreign journalist suggested that a key point in alleviating the rice shortage would be for the Japanese to permit the free entry of rice and grain from their occupied areas into Shanghai without levying harsh taxes. In response, Mabuchi acknowledged that this would certainly be one way to alleviate the shortage of rice and other goods. However, the relationship between the Public Concession and areas outside the concession presents many obstacles. The Japanese military authorities feel that the first step in easing the situation is to improve the atmosphere within the Public Concession. Asked if the Japanese would allow rice to be transported from Wuhu and other areas with large rice stocks into Shanghai, given that millions of Chinese urgently need rice and grain, he replied that if the situation were truly that dire, action would have to be taken to address it. Most people do not understand how difficult it is to transport rice from one place to another; even the Japanese army suffers from such difficulties. However, this problem, along with "similar problems," is currently under consideration by the Japanese authorities.

Registering Required Before Ordering Foreign Rice

Further news: Various Shanghai groups, in order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents, have decided to order foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief. Initiators Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, Wang Yuqing, Guo Shun, and others met at the Shipping Club at 12:00 noon yesterday to discuss methods for ordering foreign rice. They stipulated that groups, organizations, companies, and firms wishing to order foreign rice must first obtain a registration form from the Accountants' Association, with a minimum order of 100 bags.

Registration Procedures Agreed Upon

(1) Groups, organizations, companies, and firms wishing to order Saigon rice should go to the Shanghai Accountants' Association, located on the fourth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII (telephone 35900), to obtain a registration form and fill it out according to the instructions. (2) After a sufficient quantity has been registered, an order will be telegraphed overseas. The initiators will convene a meeting of those who have placed orders to discuss methods and select custodians. (3) The price of Saigon rice and transportation costs will be investigated and determined by the initiators. Those placing orders should pay at least 50% of the price when placing the order, with the remainder to be paid based on the final settlement. (4) Those placing orders may not cancel their ordered quantity. (5) The minimum order quantity is 100 bags. (6) Collection matters will be handled by a bank designated by the initiators. Initiators: Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, Guo Shun, Wang Yuqing; Accounting Advisors: Yu Yushu, Wang Haifan, Li Wenjie.

The form for registering to order Saigon rice is as follows: (1) Ordering Organization, (2) Representative, (3) Address and Telephone, (4) Quantity Ordered (how many bags, each bag containing 1.25 piculs), (5) Declaration: (i) The registration methods for ordering Saigon rice established by the initiators have been read and are willing to comply. (ii) All methods will be handled according to the decisions of the initiators. Ordering Organization (seal), Representative (signature and seal), Republic of China, year, month, day.

Advising Against Further Increases in Noodle Prices

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Mechanized Noodle Industry Association requesting restrictions on noodle prices, in order to care for their well-being. The Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association, stating: "Recently, rice prices in the city have been extraordinarily high, and the general working class mostly purchases noodles to satisfy their hunger. The Mechanized Noodle Industry Association relies on selling noodles for a living. If flour prices continue to rise, it will greatly affect the operations of the noodle industry and the lives of the working-class citizens. Accordingly, this is communicated to you in the hope that your Association will take this into consideration, inform your colleagues, empathize with the difficulty of people getting food, and refrain from further increases in noodle prices. This is our deepest hope."

The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee convened its 44th meeting yesterday morning, with the participation of representatives from the Hakka community, Chen Ziyi representing the General Chamber of Commerce, and committee members Zhang Lizhong, Zhang Yin’nan, Cai Shengming, Zheng Shengyun, and others, totaling fourteen people. The Hakka representatives included Wei Yueqing, Zhu Qiuiong, Zhang Songtao, Shi Zufu, Cai Weixiang, and others, totaling seven people. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qian’geng and recorded by Wang Jiting. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and Chen Ziyi, representing the General Chamber of Commerce, gave guidance, briefly stating that the current situation in the Shanghai rice market differs from the limited price by more than double, causing market disorder and suffering for ordinary people. Recently, Mr. Yu Qiaxiang, a prominent figure in Shanghai, invited various national groups and groups to order 5,000 tons (equivalent to 50,000 bags) of foreign rice. On one hand, the Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request assistance from the Special District authorities in facilitating supply sources to ensure abundant goods and stable prices. Furthermore, during this time of seasonal scarcity, we should exercise self-restraint, consider the food supply for the city's five million residents, and assuage the people's longing. Subsequently, gathering opinions from various individuals, provisional price limits were set: the highest price for white japonica rice should not exceed 40 yuan, and the highest price for indica rice should not exceed 35 yuan. If these provisional prices are exceeded, a complaint box will be set up for anyone to report violations. If violations are discovered, they will be immediately reported to the Special District authorities and publicized in the newspapers, requesting social sanctions.

White Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Lowering Prices in the Interior

According to shipping industry sources, yesterday afternoon, Heli Shipping Company transported over 30 boats of white rice from Songjiang, each boat carrying 170-180 dan, totaling over 5,000 dan, which has been unloaded in batches ashore. It is also learned that the various townships outside Songjiang city simultaneously (on the 24th) received orders from the Chinese Guerrilla Area County Government to implement price stabilization, at 1 jiao per jin (equivalent to 16 yuan per dan). Each person is limited to purchasing 3 jin, and upon purchase, the rice must be soaked in water to prevent hoarding.

### Problem of Rent Increase by the Jianye Company

The French-owned China Construction and Land Company, which owns properties throughout the French Concession, already increased rents by 20% after August 13th. Recently, it notified tenants in various alleyways that rents would be increased by another 30% starting in September. The tenants unanimously opposed this, as detailed in this newspaper. It is now learned that the company's manager is aware that it is not appropriate to increase rents in the current environment, especially with residents leaving the Concession in increasing numbers. Yesterday, he indicated to tenants in Wanyi Alley that he would be willing to reduce the increase by 20%, raising rents by only 10%. The tenants in that alleyway are currently seriously considering this offer.

### An Open Letter (Part 1)

— Huang Yanpei

In the twenty-one months that I have been away from Shanghai, I have spent eighteen months traveling to various places in the front and rear. In the past year, I have traveled extensively in the rear. Allow me to select and tell you about what I have recently seen and heard.

What inspires people the most everywhere is the populace. After more than two years of resistance, traveling throughout the rear, I have never heard the populace utter a single complaint about the long war or the hard war. Whether it is the requisition of the populace's wealth or physical strength, as long as it is explained clearly that it is for the sake of resistance, there is absolutely no reaction to any sacrifice. Recently, in a certain place, I visited an aircraft construction project. More than five thousand workers, without much training, were inspired by a speech by the organizer, explaining the close relationship between aviation construction and the resistance and its great contribution. They came before the start time; they did not leave when the closing time came. The seventy-day deadline was completed in less than sixty days. That day I stood on a high platform and spoke a few words that stimulated the masses - Gentlemen, what is the soil that you carry on your shoulders every day, that you dig out shovel by shovel, and that you trample under your feet? Gentlemen, remember, this is the land of the Republic of China, the land that our millions of soldiers and tens of millions of compatriots are willing to protect with their blood and flesh! Gentlemen, your pearl-like sweat, dripping on this bright and splendid land, what glory! -- Before I finished speaking, the entire crowd of five thousand people suddenly erupted in a great shout of joy, as if they were crazy. Is not that enough to show the fervent anti-Japanese sentiments of our general populace in the interior and in the frontier?

The youth show it very clearly. Wherever I travel, in almost any town, I will come across students who have joined the army, and they are all volunteers. Visiting their families, reading the letters they sent home from the army, all kinds of expressions, both loyalty and filial piety, if you are human, you can't help but be moved to tears. I only think that the standard of being a person has been raised in the future. We can only feel ashamed to be like us! (Try reading my recent work "Facts of the Populace's Fervent Patriotism Received from Inspection in the Interior" (Guoxun, Issue 209)). In the early stage of the resistance, Guangxi was the first to show it, and now it has almost spread everywhere. In the early stage of the resistance, youths volunteered to join the army, and they secretly hid it from their parents. Now the parents' mentality has also changed. I was comforting the families of soldiers in a certain place on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and I met the mother of a little hero named Shang Binru. I asked: Binru joined the army, didn't you stop him? She replied: He is doing his part for the country, how can I stop him? In a certain place, there was a Mrs. Liu whose son joined the volunteer army without telling his mother. His mother accidentally saw her son marching in the crowd. She asked others what was going on. They replied that they were going to fight the Japanese. The old lady Liu was very excited and bought a few feet of red silk, personally draped it on her son's back, and followed him, causing a sensation in the entire local society as a good story. There are too many stories like this to tell.

In the past year, the populace's ability has been fully demonstrated on the front lines. Everyone knows that the areas north of Hubei and south of Henan, and the areas north of Henan and south of Shanxi, are only able to prevent the Japanese from advancing because the populace and the army cooperated extremely closely and the two sides' forces were coordinated extremely harmoniously, resulting in great achievements. The Japanese either advance decisively or retreat decisively. This is of course the bravery of the army in battle, but the populace "also has a force in it." In the future, wherever the Japanese cavalry goes, it will probably be the best opportunity for the populace to show its strength.

As for politics, I dare to say that under the guidance of the highest leader in charge of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we are always moving step by step on the path of improvement. Since the War of Resistance, the railway and postal services have been the most outstanding performers of service in the most difficult and dangerous times. Recently, I was traveling in the southwestern border region. There is a place called "Two Umbrellas." It is truly "remote." I happened to find a post office box. I loved the unique name of the place, and I wanted to test the performance of the postal service. I wrote a few postcards and sent them from Two Umbrellas to various places, and I asked for a reply. Then, one by one, I received replies. I can't help but sigh that the postal organization is indeed strict. When I returned to Chongqing, it was just in time for a Japanese air raid. The air defense organization was indeed much more advanced than before. Chongqing has a joint emergency relief office. Following its guidance, citizens almost completely hide with agile and orderly movements at the sound of an alarm. What is commendable is that a group of service teams and fire brigades bravely risked danger to rush to the rescue. The director-general of the office personally directed the scene every time. A incendiary bomb landed without exploding, and in an instant, sand was covered on it, so it would not burn. A car company, whose neighbor was bombed, had a large amount of gasoline stored. In an instant, it was safely taken out. These are all their achievements in bravely risking danger. One director-general was pressed under a collapsed house, but he was unharmed. These are all facts that I personally saw and heard. (To be continued)

### Rapid Change in International Situation: Public Bonds Surge, Japanese and German Currencies Plummet, Soviet Currency Rises: Small Rebound in Gold Market Due to Foreigners Buying

Since Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact, the international situation has changed, and the financial market has suddenly become active. Unified public bonds began to surge the day before yesterday, from one yuan and five cents to one yuan and a half. By yesterday morning, various newspapers reported that the German Foreign Minister had officially gone to Moscow to sign the agreement. The city's securities market believed that the international situation was rapidly changing and moving in a favorable direction. Furthermore, victories were repeatedly reported from the war zones between our country and Japan. Therefore, market confidence became firm. Thus, the prices of unified public bonds continued to rise. In the morning, Class A was 50 yuan and 8 jiao, Class B was 14 yuan and 6 jiao, Class C was 42 yuan and 3 jiao 5 fen, Class D was 41 yuan and 4 jiao, and Class E was 41 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen, generally rising by 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, prices slightly declined. It is predicted that they will continue to rise within the day.

Gold Market Rebounds Slightly After Sharp Drop

The city's cash market prices are based on telegram reports from the international market. If there are drastic changes in one or two countries in the world, whether in military, political, or economic aspects, gold prices will fall or rise accordingly. The day before yesterday, the gold market plunged sharply due to the German-Soviet agreement and the serious European situation, falling by about 570 yuan. Yesterday, the gold market rebounded slightly in unofficial trading. In the morning, it was 3,990 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 4,200 yuan, a slight improvement of 200 yuan compared to the previous day. The reason is that foreigners in Shanghai, fearing the outbreak of war in Europe, are converting pounds and other currencies of countries involved in the conflict into large bars of cash. According to gold market insiders, during the First World War, gold prices fell to more than 20 yuan per tael. If the German-Polish incident leads to a Second World War, gold prices will inevitably plummet. The sharp drop in the past two days is symbolic of this. As of yesterday, the unofficial foreign exchange market also turned slightly looser. The British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan and 93.75 fen, while the HSBC market quoted the British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 68.75 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate at 7 yuan and 18.75 fen.

German and Japanese Currencies Plunge

German gold bonds (i.e., mark bonds) had repeatedly risen after the successful invasion of Czechoslovakia. Now, due to the country's aggressive actions against Poland, the gold bonds and gold pounds have suddenly fallen sharply. Yesterday, German gold bonds were only 1 yuan and 1 jiao, a drop of more than 3.5 jiao compared to the previous day and more than 7 jiao compared to last week. Gold pounds were only 90 yuan, a much smaller drop than before. Japanese old man tickets have been falling in the past two days, only about 1 yuan and 1 jiao, a drop of 3-4 jiao compared to last week. As for Soviet gold pounds, they have risen to 96 yuan, and gold bonds have risen to about 4 jiao.

### Fessenden Travels North for Summer Vacation, Departs This Morning, Returns to Shanghai Next Month

### Remains of Dane Krogh Cremated; His Wife Sobbed Uncontrollably

After the director of the business department of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, the Dane Krogh, was shot and killed by bandits last Friday morning, his remains were cremated at the Western Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road at 5:30 PM on the 23rd. Thousands of people attended, including British Army Commander General Simmons, the Danish Consul General in Shanghai, all foreign members of the Great Northern Company, the Shanghai Fire Brigade, and all members of Company A of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

### Completion of Telegraphic Transfer Allotment; Obtaining Becomes More Stringent: Preventing Speculation While Prices Soar; Increased Capital Makes Various Industries More Active

After the implementation of the new telegraphic transfer system, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to prevent speculation, avoid soaring prices, and affect people's livelihood, strictly handled the acquisition and use of such transfers. The method for distributing telegraphic transfers to firms has now been completed. The market is being strengthened by increased capital, making various industries more active. Details are as follows:

Completion of Telegraphic Transfer Allotment

The Bank Joint Reserve Committee has temporarily set the total amount of interbank telegraphic transfers to be acquired by various firms at 50 million national currency. Banks, money houses, trust companies, and other institutions have provided collateral to the Committee to obtain these transfers for circulation in the market. In order to avoid encouraging speculation and hoarding to prevent soaring prices, the Committee decided to handle the process strictly. It has now fully considered the actual needs of various firms, trust companies, etc., and completed the allocation of the number of interbank transfers to be acquired. (1) 20 million yuan to the four central banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture; (2) 20 million yuan to various banks and trust companies; (3) 10 million yuan to various money houses.

Firms Acquire and Circulate

A total of more than 110 banks, money houses, and trust companies are authorized to acquire interbank transfers from the Bank Joint Reserve Committee. As of August 17, the total amount of transfers acquired by various firms and trust companies was 14,751,100 yuan. The assessed value of the collateral was 25,565,208 yuan. As for the three central banks of China, China, and Communications, they acquired and paid for the telegraphic transfers due to the payment of the seventh installment of principal and interest on unified public bonds at the end of July. It is reported that the amount acquired was 10 million yuan. The issuance of transfer certificates by the Committee has been temporarily postponed.

Increased Capital Makes Various Industries Active

The Silver and Money Industries Association previously agreed with the three central banks of China, China, and Communications to adjust interbank funds. The interbank transfer deposits previously deposited by the various firms in the bank reserve and money industry reserve totaled 22 million yuan. Since July 4 of this year, they have been converted into legal currency for circulation, divided into twelve weeks. Eight installments have now been released, each installment being 1.8 million yuan, totaling 14.4 million yuan. In addition to increasing the capital of new transfers in the market, it also increased the capital of cash, thus various industries have become more active and greatly benefited.

### Over a Thousand Sand and Stone Workers Unemployed; Request for Relief: Sand and Stone Industry Unable to Help; Workers Strike Entirely Yesterday

Since the sand and stone from the Sijiao Islands have been monopolized and prevented from being unloaded by the "Jiangnan Company," sand junk boats have suffered heavy losses and are unwilling to continue loading and transporting. As a result, the demand for various industries in Shanghai has come to a standstill. The sand and stone industry has been unable to buy or sell, and has been suspended for more than a month. More than a thousand workers carrying sand and stone at various docks are paid by the job. Although a few have been transporting to Shanghai through indirect means, the number of porters is too high, which is not enough for the workers. Most of them have been unemployed because there is no cargo to carry. Therefore, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, representatives Fang Jinxiang, Liu Yucai, and others, totaling more than 30 people, prepared a letter to the sand and stone industry tea party, requesting the capitalists of the industry to find ways to maintain their livelihoods. After temporary deliberations by the industry's committee members, they expressed their rejection of the workers' request, as they themselves were finding it difficult to maintain their operations after the suspension of mining, transportation, and junk boats. The workers announced a complete strike yesterday. In addition to reporting the situation to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Sand and Stone Association also requested the Department's assistance in negotiations (Note: The road-building sand and stone of the Public Works Department is also supplied by the industry. After the transportation is cut off, road-building projects will also be forced to stop).

### Japanese Warships Yakumo and Iwate Suddenly Enter Port Again; American Warship Marblehead Enters Port and Anchors Yesterday Morning

The Japanese warships Yakumo and Iwate arrived on the 20th and were anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf and buoys 1 and 2. The circumstances of their departure from Shanghai the day before yesterday morning (23rd) were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the two ships suddenly re-entered port yesterday morning and are still anchored in their original locations, forming a tripod with the Izumo, which is noteworthy. Also, the American naval cruiser Marblehead, a large ship with four smokestacks, arrived in Shanghai at 6:30 AM yesterday. She anchored in front of the New Customs House (i.e., the place where the former American flagship Augusta anchored). It is reported that after the ship is supplied, it will return to North China.

### Four Banks Move to Yunnan: Preparations Underway; Qian Xinzhi and Others Fly to Chongqing

The headquarters of the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, were located in Shanghai before the war. After the war, they were ordered to move to Chongqing, and Shanghai was changed to a branch. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that they all be moved to Kunming. Kunming is now the hub of trade between China and Southwest countries and the center of Chinese industry and commerce. The reporter of the New Sound Society learned from the banking sector that the four banks have prepared to move to Kunming. Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, and Qian Xinzhi, general manager of the Bank of Communications, flew to Chongqing the day before yesterday to prepare for the move.

### Using Recruitment as a Pretext to Entice Young Men: Authorities Discern the Conspiracy and Establish Preventive Measures

Since a certain party is using recruitment as a pretext to entice young men to transport them to the outside of the Customs to serve as soldiers, the authorities have discerned the conspiracy and established preventive measures for compliance. (1) The county governments in the war zones will post notices in various towns and villages, informing them that what a certain party calls recruitment of workers is actually transporting them outside the Customs to serve as soldiers, and then transporting them back inside the Customs to fight. (2) To supplement the effectiveness of the notices, the county governments should also recruit intellectuals and young students to organize political work teams or propaganda teams to go to various villages to do propaganda work. (3) In areas under the control of a certain party, the administrative inspector's office should organize another propaganda team to cooperate with the guerrillas to post notices and carry out propaganda work. (4) In areas under the control of Chinese military forces, counties should establish righteous people's shelters to receive those who flee from areas under the other party's control because they do not want to be drafted. (5) For the righteous people who flee, they should be either incorporated into the ranks according to their wishes and participate in the war of resistance after receiving military training, or assigned to military transportation work.

### The Money Exchange Industry Association Requests to Exchange 100,000 Yuan in Subsidiary Coin Notes: Calculated at 1,000 Yuan Per Member: Awaiting Approval From the Central Bank

The Money Exchange Industry Association recently noted that the Central Bank of China's Shanghai branch is about to issue new subsidiary coin notes of one and five cents. To facilitate the exchange procedures for its members, it sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday requesting the bank to allow the Association to represent its members in exchanging the new coins. The original letter stated that the members were feeling the inconvenience of using stamps and that the exchange was causing complaints. As your bank is about to issue 500,000 yuan in new coins, our Association requests that each member be allowed to exchange 1,000 yuan. There are more than 100 member money houses, so a total of 100,000 yuan in new coins will be needed to meet business needs. It is heard that the letter has been properly presented to the bank by the person in charge of the Association. Now, each money house is eagerly awaiting a reply so that they can gather funds and carry out the exchange as requested.

### East Hanbi Road, Hongkou: Robbers Injure Person

Yesterday, at approximately 6:00 PM, within Lane 342 of Dong Hanbi Road, Hongkou, a man surnamed Mou, residing within the lane, was stabbed by robbers. As the man was about to exit the lane, two robbers suddenly jumped out from hiding and seized him. One robber brandished a gun, while the other held a sharp blade. They both demanded the gold ring on his hand. The man, unwilling to part with it, attempted to evade them, but was eventually caught up. One robber stabbed him fiercely in the abdomen with the blade, causing him to fall to the ground in pain. The two robbers then snatched the gold ring and fled. Fortunately, a passerby witnessed the incident and reported it to the police, who sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment. His condition is critical.

### Rice-Snatching Incidents

Huade Road: At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, a rice shop located at No. 383 Huade Road, Hongkou, was raided by thirty to forty impoverished men and women who snatched rice. The shop had just opened for business and was unable to stop them. Approximately two and a half dan of white rice were taken. The shop urgently called for help, but by the time the detectives arrived, the crowd had dispersed. Only the last person was apprehended and taken to the police station for investigation.

Xinzha Road: At approximately 7:25 PM yesterday, Wanghe Rice Shop, located at No. 206, Lane 51, Xinwenqiao Road, Xinzha Road, was suddenly stormed by over a hundred impoverished people on the verge of starvation, who snatched over seven dan of white rice. The shop staff, seeing the overwhelming force and large number of people, were unable to stop them and could only let them proceed. After about twenty minutes, they finally left, but detectives had already arrived upon hearing the news. They arrested the last person to leave and confiscated a small bag of white rice in his possession, taking him to the police station for questioning.

### Ban on Import of Foreign Goods: Private Carrying Prohibited

Flexibility Allowed for Customs Duties Under One Yuan
Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of measures to prohibit the import of foreign goods during the extraordinary period, customs offices across the country have been ordered to implement them. However, customs offices in occupied areas such as Shanghai have not yet complied due to the special circumstances. Now, the Ministry has ordered that in the future, foreign goods carried in travelers' luggage that are prohibited from import shall still be permitted for import if the customs duty payable is less than one Customs Gold Unit. If the customs duty payable is one Customs Gold Unit or more, it shall be strictly prohibited.

### Irregular Shipping Cargo: Particularly Active Merchants Consider Revised Freight Rates Too Burdensome

Merchants Consider Revised Freight Rates Too Burdensome After Shilling Decline
Since the decline of the shilling and the soaring price of coal, the shipping industry has been greatly affected. As a result, freight rates have been repeatedly raised. Several British shipping companies, seeing the rampant decline in foreign exchange, feared that the increased freight rates and ticket prices would not be sufficient to compensate for the losses. Therefore, the freight rate list was converted into Hong Kong dollars based on the national currency and implemented from the first of this month, as previously reported. However, customers must pay the freight in Hong Kong dollars, which they consider too burdensome, so they do not ship much cargo. As a result, the British companies have experienced very little traffic in passengers and cargo to Hong Kong. However, general irregular shipping companies have seized the opportunity to become active, dispatching ships one after another. The freight rates, still collected in national currency, have tripled their profits. Recently, Tung Yih Shipping Company's Tang En ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai directly to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang on the 27th. Lian Shun Shipping Company's San Min ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Haiphong on the 31st. Warren Shipping Company's Da Pu ship is scheduled to depart directly for Hong Kong on the 29th. Hong Li Pluto ship, managed by Hong Yun Shipping Bureau, is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Saigon on the 28th. To avoid congestion and delays in Haiphong, goods being shipped to the mainland are now more conveniently transshipped through Saigon. Quanzhou ship, managed by Qiacheng Shenhang at No. 12 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, departed directly for Hong Kong yesterday morning, fully loaded with passengers and cargo.

### Extortion from Factory Owner: Two Defendants Convicted

Wanbao Silk Factory at No. 53 Singapore Road was founded by Li Mingzhi from Ningbo and Xu Jianfan from Qingpu (owner of Junfeng Silk Factory). From April to July this year, they continuously received letters signed by the head of the "Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group," surnamed Zhang, accusing the factory of profiting by purchasing a large quantity of inferior artificial silk at low prices. The letters demanded 600 yuan, or else drastic measures would be taken to kill Li, etc. Later, Zhang Yongkang from Jiading, who was acquainted with Li and Xu, came to the factory falsely claiming to know the leader of the "Eliminate Traitors Group," surnamed Zhang. Xu Jianfan decided to have Zhang meet the "Eliminate Traitors" at the Xuri Dongsheng Teahouse on North Zhejiang Road, asking Zhang to intercede, for which Zhang took ten yuan for expenses such as talking and transportation, thinking that everything was fine. Unexpectedly, on July 3rd at 11:30 AM, as Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan were leaving the factory in a private car, they were ambushed and shot at by bandits on the way, attempting to take Li's life, because the "Eliminate Traitors Group" was determined to get the 600 yuan as a demonstration of their means of harming Li's life. After the incident, Li reported to the Gordon Road Police Station based on information, and Zhang Yongkang was first arrested at the Xuhui Refugee Camp, followed by Mei Renqing from Hubei, both of whom were related to the case. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Yongkang to three years of imprisonment and Mei Renqing to eight months. The remaining charges were dismissed.

### Pawnshops to Restore Old Interest Rates: Two Percent Per Month to Be Implemented Next Month

The pawnshop industry in the city recently convened a meeting of both new and old businesses at the Pawnshop Association, located in the Jiufu Company building on Parker Road in the Public Concession. Two proposals were discussed. The first proposal was that due to the recent surge in prices and the high cost of living, and the increasing expenses, it was unanimously agreed to restore the old interest rates. From September 1st, all tickets, regardless of size, will be charged a uniform interest rate of two percent per month. All old tickets from before will be exchanged for new tickets to show uniformity. The second proposal was to shorten the term for gold jewelry pledges, considering that in this extraordinary time of national crisis, the market is changing rapidly, and the price of gold jewelry fluctuates too much. If pawnshops pledge according to the current market price, they will inevitably suffer losses in the future. Therefore, some people proposed shortening the term to twelve months. As this matter was deemed to be of great importance, it was decided to retain it and temporarily set the pledge price at 200 yuan per tael. A general meeting will be convened on October 25th this year (i.e., the 13th day of the ninth lunar month, the birthday of Guan Yu) to make a final decision. All businesses were also notified to cancel all existing wall posters and porcelain plaques related to reduced interest rates from today.

### Illegal Exchanges: Chinese Merchants Not Allowed to Participate; Severe Punishment for Those Found to Have Done So; Trading Activities Deemed Invalid

The various guilds in the city received a telegram yesterday from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that regarding the matter of the Shanghai Far East organizational exchange, the various industries and related firms had previously been ordered by telegram not to participate in this illegal organization. It is now reported that the Japanese side is establishing a Cotton Industry Co., Ltd. Trading Place at the original site of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, stipulating the identity of brokers and requiring a deposit of 3,000 yuan. Transactions are to be in units of ten bales, and the standard brands are designated as the Lanwei brand of the Nichi-Ka Sha Factory and the Shuiyue brand of Nei Wai. It is also stipulated that although the name is cotton industry, it actually includes all kinds of goods, etc. It has been investigated that the establishment of this cotton exchange is intended to monopolize the market and manipulate yarn prices. It is urgent to reiterate the previous order and strictly prohibit Chinese merchants from participating. All industries are hereby ordered to earnestly warn that they must not participate in this illegal organization. Those who participate in the organization of the said exchange, provide money or property, or act as brokers on their own initiative to convey and introduce transactions, once reported and verified, will be punished in accordance with Articles 2, Paragraph 6, and Paragraph 10 of the Punishment Regulations. Furthermore, all trading activities conducted in illegal trading places have been determined by the central government to be invalid and have been ordered to be notified to all courts. Therefore, if Chinese merchants trade in the said exchange, not only will they have no legal protection, but they will also inevitably cause themselves trouble by being exploited. It is also requested that this intention be carefully explained to all merchants, so that they may be vigilant.

### Shanghai Electric Power Company: Questions About Increased Electricity Fees; Soaring Coal Prices and Increasing Expenses; Suspected Additional Fee Increase of 120.01% Starting Next Month

The Shanghai Electric Power Company will add an additional fee of 120.01% at the end of September. According to the company, this increase is due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange in July, which has affected operating expenses. 89% of these expenses must be paid in foreign currency. The company's coal expenses, it is claimed, increased by more than 245% in July this year compared to July 1937, which is three and a half times more than two years ago. The impact of the continued decline in foreign exchange is causing the company to experience even greater expenses than in September. It is reported that the Municipal Council has agreed to increase all fees by 120.01% starting next month.

### Japanese National Trafficking in Opium: Seized by Gordon Road Police Station; Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment

Japanese national Morikawa Matsuo, 40 years old, residing at No. 36 Dalu New Village, Shigaota Road, secretly trafficked in opium in addition to running a construction business. He also owned a black-plated car, No. 10088, and employed Cao Fuzhi from Tongzhou as his driver. Yesterday afternoon at 4:45 PM, Morikawa Matsuo, accompanied by Chen Qiuqing from Haimen and Zhou Xiangshang from Pudong as an interpreter, carried two large packages of opium, weighing 304 taels in total. He ordered his driver Cao Fuzhi to drive to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. Suddenly, Inspector Schnakes of the Third Team of the Chengdu Road Police Station, along with Chinese constables No. 2446, No. 1676, and No. 3255, searched the area and seized the opium. The four people, along with the opium and the car, were taken to the police station. Except for the Japanese national and the opium, which were sent to the Japanese Consulate, the other three, Chen, Zhou, and Cao, were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted according to law. After Judge Chuanda questioned them and clarified the case, he sentenced Chen and the other two to eight months of imprisonment each for aiding others in trafficking opium, and each was deprived of their civil rights for one year.

### Summer Hygiene Exhibition at the Ningbo Residents Association in Shanghai

Lectures and Entertainment Every Evening
Yiyou Society of this city has always advocated for proper entertainment and service to the community.

### Murder Case in Zhaofeng Garden: Four Defendants Confess to Committing the Crime; Awaiting Qin Yuanxing to Appear Before Further Verification

Qin Yuanxing, a native of Changzhou who worked as a servant for British resident Mr. Wellington at No. 4, a certain apartment in Lane 641, Avenue Joffre, took advantage of his employer's absence on the 16th of this month to bring his fellow villagers Chen Guoyuan (i.e., Chen Xiuquan) and Zhang Xiaoer to the residence. He stole two pistols, over one hundred bullets, and a pistol-shaped lighter from his employer and handed them over to those people, who took them to the Lao Yutai Hotel on Yunnan Road. They were instructed by their accomplice Ren Xiaorong to have Agou accompany them to the Dongfang Hotel to hide the stolen goods in a room. Fearing that Qin Yuanxing would reveal the matter afterward, they ordered Chen and Zhang to lure Qin to Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai that evening. At 9:30 PM, Chen and Zhang, along with the brothers Zhou Wenqing and Zhou Xiezhen (also known as Qian Xizhen), who were lying in wait in the garden, first beat Qin into injury and then tightly strangled his neck with a rope. Nearby British soldiers heard the noise and rushed over, capturing Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer. Only then was Qin saved from being killed. The other two defendants, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen, were also apprehended by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station the next day at the Yuanyuan Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, and the stolen guns and bullets were recovered. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, Qin Yuanxing, the victim in the case, has recovered from his injuries in the hospital. As the location where he stole the guns and bullets falls under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court, he was taken there for investigation by the French police a few days ago. As the defendants Chen Guoyuan and others are also related to the theft of the guns, the Second Special Court prepared an official letter and sent detectives from the French police to attend the First Special Court yesterday morning when Judge Meng Tingke presided over the continued hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court, submitting a letter requesting that the case be transferred for a joint investigation. However, the First Special Court needed the victim Qin Yuanxing to be present for questioning. As Qin was not brought in yesterday, the four defendants were only questioned briefly. According to Zhou Wenqing, Xiezhen is my brother. Chen only invited me and Zhang to go to Zhaofeng Garden that day. We really didn't know about their stealing guns. Later, we were asked to help beat Qin in the garden and did not participate in strangling Qin's neck. Soon after, Zhang and I were arrested by British soldiers. Zhang Xiaoer stated that he was invited by Zhou Wenqing, who said that a woman named Jinbao would be introduced to Qin at the garden that evening. After that, he just followed the crowd in beating Qin and knew nothing else. Chen Guoyuan stated that on the afternoon of the 16th, Qin stole the guns and bullets and handed them over to me to take to Lao Yutai and give to Ren Xiaorong. Ren then gave me two yuan in banknotes and a rope, ordering me to lure Qin to Zhaofeng Garden and take the opportunity to strangle him to death to prevent exposure. Zhou Xiezhen helped pull the rope while the other two just helped beat him. Zhou Xiezhen only admitted to helping beat him, etc. After a statement was made by Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the court ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing with Qin Yuanxing present.

### Lawyer Jiang Hechun Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, an attempted kidnapping occurred on Racecourse Road. Two cars, Nos. 9832 and 5827, suddenly stopped in front of No. 493 Racecourse Road. Two men in Western-style suits jumped out of the cars and went straight into the building, asking for Jiang Hechun, a resident lawyer. Jiang met with them immediately. Unexpectedly, upon seeing Jiang, the visitors claimed that they had important matters to discuss outside. When Jiang refused, the two men forcibly dragged him out, intending to put him into the car. Jiang, realizing that something was wrong, cried for help. At that moment, a patrolling officer happened to pass by and saw the situation. He immediately drew his gun and approached to arrest them. The two men, who were unarmed, jumped into the car, and both cars sped away one after another. Jiang was then out of danger. Jiang, whose courtesy name is Jianqiu, is from Panyu, Guangdong. He joined the Shanghai Bar Association to practice law in July of the 22nd year.

### Widow Sues for Delivery of Asset Account Books: Lawsuit Withdrawn After Court Persuasion

Gu Side, a local, is 44 years old. He runs Side Trading Company in a self-built house at No. 93 Muerming Road. The land there covers more than four mu and four fen, along with eight city buildings and one residence built on the ground, all of which are the legacy of his father, Gu Anxiang. The income account books for the real estate have been managed by his nephew, Gu Rongfu. In the winter of the year before last, Gu Rongfu became seriously ill and was replaced by Rongfu's younger brother, Gu Rongxing, as the accountant. Last summer, after Gu Rongfu passed away, his wife, Bai Xiufeng, being a young widow, often argued with them for various reasons. Recently, Bai Xiufeng, along with her son Gu Huasheng (just two years old), filed a complaint in the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing her uncle Gu Side and her brother-in-law Gu Rongxing, requesting an order to hand over the asset account books and detailed income accounts. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the defendants Gu Side and Gu Rongxing to the Third Civil Court for questioning. The defendants Gu Side and Gu Rongxing appointed lawyer Ma Junshuo to appear in court to defend, stating that the account books were always recorded by the plaintiff's deceased husband, Gu Rongfu. The plaintiff, Bai Xiufeng, had assisted her deceased husband in handling household affairs and should be well aware of any irregularities. As for the second defendant, Gu Rongxing, although he recently succeeded the plaintiff's deceased husband in the position of accountant, the accounts are recorded in a new type of bookkeeping format, which is clear and without any errors. The plaintiff's filing of this lawsuit is suspected to have other purposes. The court examined the statements and, because the case involved family matters, repeatedly and kindly advised the plaintiff. After the plaintiff Bai Xiufeng was patiently persuaded by the court, she withdrew the lawsuit in court, and relatives and friends will mediate the matter to prevent further litigation.

### Guerrilla Forces Enter Hengmian

After a day and night of fierce fighting, Hengmian Town was captured by Xi's unit, and they confronted Xu's unit near Tangmu Bridge.

### Impersonating Public Officials: Extortion and Fraud Case Concluded

Rogues Lin Kunjin, Yao Wenbin, Ding Shaotong, and Yao Genlin, impersonated detectives from the French police on the night of the 4th of this month. They went to the home of Chen Pu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 51 Shangxianfang, Avenue Joffre, under the pretext of searching for opium and drugs. They claimed that if she gave them 500 yuan in legal tender, the matter could be resolved, otherwise they would have to take her to the police station for investigation. At the time, Pu, being a woman, did not realize the truth and agreed to give them 200 yuan. However, Lin and others insisted and refused to accept it. While they were negotiating, Pu's brother, Pu Chengyong, discovered that Lin and others were impostors extorting money and secretly reported to the French police. The police immediately dispatched detective Chang Kanghui to rush to the scene and arrest Lin and the others. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao Yan continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the French Concession Administrative Authority presented the case and prosecuted the defendants for impersonating public officials, extortion, and fraud. Ding Shaotong, one of the defendants, hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to defend him. After questioning the four defendants, Lin and others confessed that they met on the road and went to the plaintiff's house together. They were looking for a friend. They admitted that they had impersonated detectives. The court examined the confessions, ordered the opening of arguments, and announced the conclusion of the trial. The verdict will be announced on the morning of the 28th. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Red Pill Criminal Apprehended

Luo Xiangheng (32 years old) of Guangdong, was found to be carrying forty-eight packages of red pills, weighing twenty-seven pounds, at 12:20 PM yesterday on the road near Robison Road and Jessfield Road. He was apprehended by the Puto Road police search team and taken back to the police station. This morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and a public prosecution was initiated against him for the crime of trafficking drugs in violation of Article 4 of the Anti-Drug Law.

### Rape of Female Teaching Assistant Case

Appeal with Evasive Words
Xie Xiangheng, a native of Wujin who once served as a teacher at the La Genna Elementary School, used the pretext of recruiting a female teaching assistant in the spring of the year before last to deceive Wang Jie, a young woman from Pinghu, to his residence at No. 14 Jiyili, Bubian Road, which was Xie's residence. He promised Wang Jie a monthly salary of 15 yuan, asking Wang Jie to modify student papers there. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM on May 16 of the same year, Xie closed the door tightly and committed indecency. Later, Wang Jie's mother, Wu, discovered that her daughter, who was only eighteen years old, had been violated and was heartbroken. She hired lawyer Qian Yuan to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Xie of committing a crime against public morals. The initial trial in the case acquitted Xie. Wang Wu did not accept the verdict and hired lawyer Qian to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. During the appeal period, Xie committed another fraud case and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the First Special Court. Regarding the case of the rape of female teaching assistant Wang Jie, the High Third Branch Court sentenced him to six months of imprisonment after interrogation. Xie did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. Recently, the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court ruled to overturn the original verdict. Yesterday, Wu Tingqi, a judge of the Criminal Court of the High Third Branch Court, along with judges Wang and Chen, opened a joint court for trial. Xie's statement was evasive, claiming that Wang Jie first slept naked on his bed, leading to consensual sexual intercourse. Lawyer Qian then detailed Xie's reasons for appeal, stating that they were quibbles and requesting that Xie be punished for the crime he deserved. The court examined the statements and announced that the trial was concluded and that the verdict would be announced later.

### Woman Loses Watch: Russian Barber Suspected and Arrested

Cao Jindi, a woman from Yangzhou residing in a flat in Qianjiatang Kailingli, Huanlong Road, is twenty years old. She stayed with a Westerner in Room 2, Apartment 8, Laffayette New Village, Lafayette Road on the night of the 21st. When she got up at 8:00 AM the next morning and went to the bathroom to wash, she took off a gold watch worth 37 yuan and left it in the bathroom. A Russian barber named Dasi (transliteration) came to urge her. Cao went out of the bathroom in a hurry, forgetting the watch. When she remembered and went back to the bathroom to look for it, it was gone. She suspected that the barber had stolen it. She told the Westerner she was staying with, who reported it to the French police. Dasi was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Kechou questioned him in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police requested an adjournment for further investigation and questioning. The court questioned Dasi and approved the investigation, rescheduling the trial. The defendant was taken into custody.

Wang Binghao, a native of Shaoxing who works as a Chinese constable No. 748 in the French police force, is twenty-three years old and lives at No. 437 Siwenli, Xinzha Road. He is unmarried and has an affair with Chen Qian, the wife of Chen Tinghua (29 years old), a native of Chongming, who lives at No. 59 Changyuli, Yangjia Lane, Julai Road. Around 7:00 PM on June 21st this year, Wang went to Chen's house after his shift to continue their affair. Chen Tinghua returned home from outside and caught them in the act of adultery. He grabbed Wang, intending to send him to the police station for investigation. While they were struggling, Wang grabbed a sharp knife from the table, intending to scare the husband into releasing him. Unexpectedly, Qian stepped forward to dissuade him, and Wang's knife accidentally stabbed Qian in both legs. Her husband's fingers were also slightly injured. Neighbors living nearby called the police, and Wang and the husband were arrested and taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. At the same time, Qian was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Chen Tinghua, the husband, felt resentful for being detained in the position of plaintiff and victim, and filed a petition with the court requesting bail. The request was approved. The case was brought to trial in the First Criminal Court in front of Judge Sun Penghua on the morning of the day before yesterday. The police lawyer requested that the hearing be adjourned again, as Chen Qianmin was still being treated in the hospital for her injuries and had not yet recovered. The court examined the report and approved the adjournment, pending Chen Qian's recovery. Wang remained in custody, and Chen Tinghua remained on the original bail.

### Furnace Explosion Injures People

At around 2:30 PM yesterday, a silver smelting furnace in Rongchang Rubber Company at No. 425 North Suzhou Road, North Henan Road, exploded suddenly due to the intense heat.

Subsequently, detectives dispatched by the police station arrested Xu and Liang at Hongqiao Road, recovering the stolen money, goods, and photograph.

### Landlords in Liyuanfang, Near the Chinese Concession, Intend to Raise Rents

Tenants of Liyuanfang on Route Paul Henry Brunel have recently faced demands from the China Business Corporation, the landlord, to increase rents by over 40% per house starting this July. The tenants strongly oppose this, arguing that during these extraordinary times, with Shanghai resembling an isolated island, the people are suffering immensely. Landlords should show compassion for the difficult times. Moreover, the location is adjacent to the Chinese Concession, and since the "August 13th" incident, traffic has been cut off, effectively isolating the area. Not only are the shops along the street unable to operate due to closed frontages, losing their original function, but also the tenants' access is limited to Kangding Road's Rongjin narrow lane, causing great inconvenience. The corporation's decision to raise rents without consideration is considered baseless. Yesterday, the tenants held a meeting and unanimously resolved to reject the illegal rent increase and have commissioned lawyers Chao Kun, Shan Yuhua, and Zhao Yuxiang to handle the matter legally.

### Suicide Attempts

Yesterday morning around 12:30 AM, a man named Dong Ahua, 22 years old, jumped into the Huangpu River at Wharf No. 6 on the Bund due to economic hardship and poverty, intending to end his life. He was rescued and taken by ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment.

A young man named Hu Shinan, 24 years old, residing at 3827 Rue Robert, Shanghai West, suddenly conceived the idea of death. He ingested poison around 1:00 AM yesterday morning and was subsequently taken to the Labor Hospital for treatment by ambulance.

Jiang Junxin, 19 years old, a guest in room 218 of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road, suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. Yesterday at noon, he secretly ingested a large amount of corrosive sublimate (mercuric chloride) to commit suicide. The room attendant discovered him and quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.

### Wartime Educational Facilities in Henan (Continued)

Guerrilla Education

The measures for promoting education in the guerrilla zones of the province include: (1) Restoring educational administrative organs, retaining the original organization of the education bureau, and not leaving the county boundaries; (2) Preparing for the establishment of joint district middle schools. If the original middle schools in each guerrilla zone cannot be opened, the education bureau will investigate the number of students and teachers, report to the county government, and forward the information to the provincial government for the establishment of joint schools. If funding is insufficient, a request for subsidies will be submitted to the provincial government; (3) Elementary schools, short-term schools, and people's schools should move with the population, ensuring that education is available wherever the people go, with teaching methods including open-air teaching or itinerant teaching; (4) Secret anti-Japanese war education under the puppet organization: changing the form of schools and establishing private schools to secretly promote anti-Japanese war education.

Special Education

Special education takes Zhongshan School as its center, implementing management, education, upbringing, and hygiene to correct the thinking of the people in the bandit areas and teach them self-sufficiency and production skills. The province's implementation process includes: (1) Establishing the Henan Province Special Education Office in the 13th year of the Republic; (2) Funds are allocated by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to subsidize the province, starting with 20,000 yuan from the second half of the 26th year, with the provincial treasury contributing 30% and the central government 70% (reduced to 70% after the "July 7th Incident," and then reduced to 50% after the provincial treasury's 70% in the second half of the 27th year); (3) Operations: 52 Zhongshan People's Schools, 68 classes for children, 20 classes for adults, 12 classes for women, and 7,418 male and female students; (4) Anti-Japanese War Work: Although counties such as Huangchuan were once occupied, special education personnel remained in the guerrilla areas to undertake political work, change the form of schools, secretly implement anti-Japanese war education, or serve as communication personnel. The Ministry of Education has reportedly issued a commendation and a bonus of 1,000 yuan, which will be awarded to the best performers.

Future Plans

The province, mindful of the fact that schools in various war zones have hastily moved out of the province, resulting in students being scattered and young people in the war zones losing their schooling and intellectuals losing their jobs, deems this inappropriate. It has decided that, no matter what happens, it will not move out of the province. If necessary, it will move the schools into a mountain to implement anti-Japanese war education in order to continue cultural life and cultivate talents for the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction. It is currently constructing a joint school building capable of accommodating thousands of people in a certain township, which was completed in May. It is also building several joint school buildings in the mountains of Song County and Lushi County in preparation for emergencies.

### Finance: Seven Nations Call for Peace; Gold Prices Surge Again; Highest Reached 4,200 Yuan; Trading Busy, Around 2,000 Taels

Yesterday's spot gold market was erratic due to fluctuating sentiment, with prices fluctuating wildly. Generally, it first fell and then soared. Opening was influenced by the afterglow of last night's closing, and due to a certain gold shop's appetite, it was raised to 4,040 yuan. However, due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, sales from A and B gold shops were strong, and the price once dropped to a low of 3,900 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates stabilized, buying sentiment was stimulated. A certain gold shop strongly absorbed orders from speculators, and Hong Kong traders also came to buy, so the price rebounded sharply, soaring to 4,095 yuan. At noon, it retreated slightly, and the noon closing was 4,065 yuan. In the early afternoon, as A and B gold shops rushed to sell, it was pushed back into the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching 3,970 yuan. Later, news of the seven nations calling for peace emerged, and foreign exchange rates tightened. People's sentiment turned optimistic, and foreign and Tianjin-Hong Kong traders and speculators entrusted brokers in the market to buy aggressively. With few sellers, it soared again to a high of 4,200 yuan. However, it closed at 4,170 yuan, up 205 yuan from the previous day. Trading was brisk, reaching about 20,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fluctuated accordingly, eventually rising by 20 yuan. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Rises 205 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with little change compared to the previous evening's closing, despite the slight easing of foreign exchange rates in the morning, due to a certain gold shop's appetite. However, it was 75 yuan higher than the previous day's evening closing price. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from gold shops at 4,040 yuan. After opening, the retail shops of various gold shops received a lot of goods, resulting in frequent hedging sales. The trend turned downward due to persistently strong foreign exchange rates. It soon fell by 140 yuan. A money exchange shop sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop for 3,900 yuan. After 10:30 AM, it was heard that foreign exchange rates gradually stabilized, and buying sentiment strengthened. A certain gold shop and Hong Kong traders competed to absorb, and a certain money exchange shop also had a strong appetite, so it rebounded directly, soaring by 195 yuan. The gold shop bought 20 taels from gold shops for 4,095 yuan. By this time, it was already noon. Later, a money exchange shop sold out to take profits, and it immediately fell back 30 yuan. A money exchange shop sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,065 yuan, making the noon closing price. After closing, the price was raised to 4,120 yuan as a certain gold shop came to dig for more. In the afternoon, the market rebounded again due to a rush to sell from the gold shops and tracking sales from retail investors. Opening was 35 yuan lower than the noon closing. The gold shops sold 20 taels to the money exchange shop for 4,030 yuan. After opening, buying sentiment was still strong, and it soon returned within 40 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to the gold shop for 3,970 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop started a buying spree again, and foreign exchange rates tightened, so a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of non-industry players), securities firms, and a certain gold shop acting on behalf of customers competed to absorb, causing the market price to immediately rebound sharply. Under the cover of a buying spree, it jumped 230 yuan. The money exchange shop bought 30 taels from the gold shop for 4,200 yuan. Later, the gold shops sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,170 yuan, making the evening closing price. As a result, it rebounded 205 yuan from the previous day. It was heard that Hong Kong traders still had an appetite after closing, and the price was raised to 4,190 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 300 yuan. The gold price quoted by the current gold shops is 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. The current bid gold price is 65 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Rises 20 Yuan

The initial quotation for jewelry gold was 400 yuan per tael, and Daxon hung it. At 9:25 AM, it increased by 5 yuan, and after 25 minutes, it decreased by small 5 yuan, at 11:30 AM, it increased by large 5 yuan again. After 10 minutes, it increased by 5 yuan again, at 2:35 PM, it increased by large 5 yuan again. At 3:00 PM, it increased by 5 yuan again. As a result, it increased by 20 yuan. It is estimated that Daxon revised to 420 yuan, and New Row was 418 yuan. Taking in decreased by 20 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

London, 20th: British pure gold has not changed, and is still 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks have also remained unchanged.

### Speculative Intentions Shift: Sell British Gold, Buy US Dollars

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listing price was revealed, with no changes. The British-US exchange rate in the unofficial market fluctuated due to the uncertain situation and unpredictable sentiment. Therefore, it initially loosened and then suddenly tightened. The morning opening was slightly soft. The market was pressured because Hong Kong continued to heavily sell and Chinese merchants boldly sold large amounts of British gold. However, the Bank of England and HSBC absorbed these sales, and British firm Sassoon also participated in the buying. This eased the loosening trend, although British gold once strengthened to 3 pence 8125, and the US dollar also weakened to 7.4375. Subsequently, Sassoon resumed buying and Chinese merchants strongly bought US dollars for September delivery, gradually stabilizing the situation. By the afternoon close, it was on par with the morning opening. In the afternoon, news circulated in the market that the seven-nation alliance was mediating for peace. Therefore, it was generally believed that there might be a glimmer of hope for the European situation. As a result, Chinese merchants continued to purchase spot US dollars, and HSBC's appetite for British gold remained strong. Therefore, the market sentiment turned tight and soft. Ultimately, British gold closed at 3 pence 59375 and the US dollar closed at 7 yuan. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market. Due to sudden changes in the global situation, warring countries naturally face risks. The market generally adopted a bearish position of selling British pounds and buying US dollars for September delivery. As a result, the US dollar was tighter than the British pound.

Sassoon and Chinese Merchants Shift from Selling to Buying

In the early morning, the London rate narrowed by 375, the New York silver price fell slightly, the London gold price remained unchanged, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was stable, against Shanghai it rose by 1875, against France it fell slightly. The US dollar against the British pound remained level, against Shanghai it rose by 4 jiao 1 fen, and against France it rose by 0.0625. The central listing prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening selling prices for spot were British gold at 3 pence 71875 and the US dollar at 7.25 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound weakened by 0.03125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.0625. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric and speculators continued to aggressively sell, causing British gold to surge. However, HSBC's absorption was good, and Sassoon also bought spot shillings. Therefore, the loosening trend was relatively slow. It is estimated that Sassoon absorbed 3 pence 71875 of spot British gold from foreign banks. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric and Chinese merchants successively sold spot British gold at 3 pence 75 and 8125 to HSBC and other favorable British banks. They then sold spot US dollars at 7.3125 and 4375 to American banks. When the HSBC listing prices were revealed, there were no fluctuations, and the silver balance tax remained exempt. Afterwards, Western merchant Sassoon and foreign firms bought spot British gold at 3 pence 75 from foreign banks and Chinese banks, and also bought spot US dollars at 7.375 from foreign banks. Therefore, the process gradually stabilized. Later, general Chinese merchants vigorously bought September US dollars at 6.75 and 625 from Hong Kong Electric and foreign banks. Therefore, the futures market sentiment tightened. By the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 pence 71875 and US dollar at 7.25 yuan, which were the same as the opening prices.

September Futures: US Dollar Tighter Than British Pound

Later in the market, Western merchant Sassoon resumed absorbing spot shillings, and Chinese merchants vigorously bought spot wine, causing the trend to soften. First, Sassoon absorbed spot British gold at 3 pence 65625 and 625 from foreign banks. Then, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars at 7.15625 and 125 from a certain bank. At that time, Chinese merchants also bought September US dollars at 6.4375 and 375 from foreign banks. After entering, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars at 7 yuan from a certain bank. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 pence 59375 and the US dollar at 7 yuan. The prices for British gold for this month were 3 pence 578125 and the US dollar was 6.96875. The prices for British gold for September were 3 pence 3125 and the US dollar was 6.3125. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot and this month's British pound tightened by 0.09375, and the US dollar softened by 0.1875. September's British pound was 0.0125 more expensive, and the US dollar narrowed by 0.0375.

### Foreign Currency Rebounds

Yesterday's foreign currencies rebounded sharply as the foreign exchange market tightened in the afternoon. British and American gold pounds were firm and rose. Customers took the opportunity to buy British and American gold notes at low prices, which also became more expensive. Hong Kong notes initially loosened and then tightened, resulting in a slight increase. French franc notes were scarce in supply and demand and remained stable. Singapore notes were weak and fell slightly. Dutch notes were in demand and rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine notes followed the rise of strong American notes. German gold notes were not in high demand and fell significantly due to the European situation. Australian gold notes followed the rise of British notes.

### US Silver Recovers Slightly, British and Indian Silver Follow Suit

New York Silver Telegram: American spot silver recovered slightly by 0.005. Bombay Silver Telegram: The Indian silver market was weak. Spot fell by 6 annas, and futures fell by 7 annas. Only 25 contracts were traded.

### Securities: Bond Market Uncertain, Bulls Continuously Emerging, Market Price Gains Thwarted

In the unofficial securities market, the rising momentum from yesterday still had some residual power. However, due to the continuous emergence of bulls and the rise of uncertainty in sentiment, market prices were also slightly thwarted. Since Germany and the Soviet Union became friends after being enemies, there were still unpredictable changes in the future. The bond market naturally had considerable indirect stakes in this. This became the focus of discussion for both bulls and bears, with many conflicting opinions and difficulty reaching a logical conclusion. Therefore, most people still followed the market sentiment and took profits when available without long-term thinking. In this volatile market, it was not easy to return to the right track. Yesterday's trading volume decreased significantly. The trend initially went from low to high, then peaked and weakened. Neither buyers nor sellers showed continued excitement. Buyers only included No. 14 and No. 15, and Da Feng had a slight appetite for buying. No. 41 was still selling, and Lianhe and Tongkang also sold off. As a result, market prices still rose by 46 jiao. After the close, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and gold prices rose again. The bond market then fell by 34 jiao. The total transaction volume was 1 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Market Conditions: The share price of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange was 36 yuan, and 100 shares were traded.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that stock market trading was scarce, and price fluctuations were small. Although the afternoon was the time for new trading to begin next week, interest was still lacking. Traders, in view of the European situation, seemed to have no intention of participating in new trades.

London British Merchant Far East Company Stocks: The listed prices for this month's 23rd (Wednesday) were slightly stable. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares rose by 1 pound to 66 pounds, while Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 0.5 pounds to 68 pounds. It was still a market with prices but no transactions. Gulang Rubber shares rose by 1 shilling 3 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence, and the rest remained unchanged.

London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listed prices for this month's 23rd (Wednesday) were slightly soft. The Reorganization British issue fell by 1 pound to 26 pounds, and the Jinpu Original British issue fell by 0.5 pounds to 11.5 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond telegram said it fell to 8.5 pounds, a drop of 4.5 pounds. It was feared that this was a coding error and would need to be verified later. All other varieties remained unchanged.

### Yarn: Panic Selling by Hoarders, Yarn Prices Plummet - Double Horse Writes Another 50 Yuan Down

The yarn market, which had been falling on Saturday and Sunday, continued to decline today, and the falling momentum continued. The environment was bad, and foreign exchange rates rose. Hoarders who had disregarded everything in the past now saw the European war clouds looming and a war about to break out. As a result, sentiment was uncertain, and there were many small-scale floating sales. In this situation, they reluctantly sold their positions, and the supply of chips became excessive. Yarn prices plummeted. The 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods broke through the 700 yuan mark, and warehouse list prices fell below the 600 yuan mark. The spot Double Horse price was 650 yuan, a further drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day.

The opening price of spot yarn in the morning continued the residual momentum from the previous day. The warehouse list price of 20-count Double Horse yarn continued to fall by 21 yuan to 585 yuan. However, there were few inquiries for spot goods. After a short while, some people felt that the degree of decline was too deep, and a buying wave suddenly rose, rising by 15 yuan in less than a moment, breaking through the 600 yuan mark, and the price reached 610 yuan. Then, news came that foreign exchange rates were rising, and at the same time, bad news followed. The situation changed abruptly, and sellers swarmed in, their shouts shaking the outdoors. In an instant, it fell sharply by 450 yuan. The warehouse price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 574 yuan, and the spot price was 650 yuan. The closing price was flat. It was found that the transaction volume in half a day totaled 950 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 50 yuan, Double Globe fell by 30 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 40 yuan, and Shepherd Boy fell by 24 yuan. It was found that 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin today, 50 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 80 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each trade group are listed on the left.

### Yarn Prices Plunge, Cotton Sales Stall

There was no transaction in the Chinese and foreign spot cotton trade. However, sentiment was slightly different. The factories, in view of the tragic fall in cotton yarn prices and the fierce falling momentum, had scattered sentiment for purchasing raw materials. As for the cotton merchants, although foreign exchange rates rose, the converted price was not much cheaper, and the stock of cotton was decreasing day by day. Therefore, they did not loosen their intention to sell. In this situation, the two sides presented a stalemate. According to a certain broker, 100 pieces of Tongye Zhongjin Huisi were sold for 140 yuan, which was 3 yuan lower than the previous day's price. Only 50 bales of Tonghua from Subei arrived. The opening price for each side on the previous day was recorded as a rise of 10 yuan in error and is now corrected.

In addition, Shanghai's foreign cotton trading saw that the exchange rate had turned into a firm state yesterday. However, yarn prices were tragically falling due to the panic of domestic merchants, who were aggressively selling. As a result, cotton prices were falling. The original cotton price was weak to sell because the sentiment of the industry was quite firm, and it was temporarily not planned to sell. As a result, trading was more quiet.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, it was still firm in the early morning. Later, due to the critical European situation, New York securities plummeted, and sentiment was volatile. Most of the bulls took profits and closed their positions, and the market price fell as a result. At the close, it fell by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, fell by 2 rupees. Egyptian prices rose by 45 pounds.

### Regularly Scheduled Deliveries: European Situation Urgent, Hoarders Sell Off, Customers Wait and See, Sales Plunge - Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, due to the urgent European situation and volatile sentiment, hoarders tended to sell off, and merchants in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other markets also depreciated and resold their goods. Buyers were fearful, and transactions declined sharply. The market price fell sharply, and the difference between the marked price and the unofficial price reached 0.5 yuan. Wholesale shops on this street sold 2,800 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill, printed cloth, flannel, and velvet to retail shops and various ports in the Yangtze River Delta and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Most customers from the Chu trade group adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and small purchases continued. Market prices for fine cloth and fine twill continued to fall by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan, and dyed cloth, line flannel, and baize fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Printed goods were stable.

Dong Ding

The selling atmosphere was still strong in the morning market, and the market price fell sharply again. The lowest price for Longtou fine cloth fell to 17.2 yuan, and the price for Wufu fine cloth fell to 15.5 yuan. Merchants from Tianjin and dyed cloth shops were selling. However, since this price for Longtou was already 2.8 yuan different from the previous week's September futures market price, there was a move to buy at a low price. Sales rose again, and the resulting Longtou price was 17.78 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 6700 bales of fine cloth and fine twill. Baize and zhigong also continued to fall by 0.124 yuan per piece.

Exports

Today, there were five scheduled deliveries shipped to Hong Kong, 210 pieces shipped to Haiphong, 12 pieces shipped to Yantai, and 20 pieces shipped to Tianjin.

### Food: Prevent Accidents, Rice Shops Reduce Purchases, Customer Xian Rice Falls by 0.3-0.5 Yuan, Fresh Jing Rice Still Opens at 40 Yuan

Du Rice: Recently, rice prices have been soaring, with general rice shops selling at high prices of 423 yuan, causing the poor to be unable to make a living and triggering rice riots. There were two or three incidents every day. Yesterday, a rice warehouse on Tongfu Road almost suffered a robbery. Fortunately, the police arrived after hearing the news, and it did not happen. Therefore, the shop owners were all vigilant and rarely made purchases. Also, yesterday, a total of 14 boats of rice from Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang arrived from all routes, 1,450 bales of Fengjing Che Lun Baozi, 2,000 bales of new Jian rice from Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, and other places. In addition, Wuhu new Jian rice also arrived. However, the number of old Jian rice was limited, and sentiment was slightly calmer. It was estimated that fresh Xijing was priced at 40 yuan, high Xijing was priced at 39 yuan, Changzhou fresh Xijing was priced at 39.5 yuan, Su Tongkun Jing was priced at 38.5-38 yuan, Songjiang and Nangang Songyin early and late rice from Hexia were priced at 356 yuan, original bales were priced at 38 yuan, Jiashan Jiaxing new Jian was priced at 34 yuan, Kunshan Xinchuan Jian was priced at 34.5 yuan, Wuhu new early Jian was priced at 34 yuan, high Chen Wujian was priced at 3635 yuan, Wuxi Bianwu was priced at 31 yuan, and Danyang Bianyuan was priced at 30 yuan. The total number of transactions was more than 8,000 bales.

Customer Xian: Yesterday, the buying sentiment turned weak, and the total transaction volume was only more than 2,000 bales. The industry hoarders had no new appetite, and the shops were also preventing accidents and did not dare to buy much. Also, new Xian rice from all routes continued to arrive on the market. In the future, new rice can still come to Shanghai in a steady stream. Some of the previously arrived Wu Xian rice had already been transferred out. Therefore, the price had fallen by 0.3-0.5 yuan. High Wu Xian was priced at 35.5-34 yuan, and the price for Zhongjue was not uniform.

Yang Rice: Transactions were quiet. However, it was heard that various groups, commercial firms, and factories were all trying to order on their own. Only 200 bales of Chen Xiaojiao were opened at a price of 34 yuan, and the new Saigon was not opened.

### Flour: Rising Momentum Gradually Weakens, Wheat Prices Also Loosen

Flour: Yesterday, although the price of the No. 2 flour mill stood at the original price of 6.4 yuan, the recovered goods gradually loosened. Due to the tense European situation and the plummeting gold price the day before, commodity prices showed a slight downward trend. Therefore, general customers and hoarders were not eager to buy. It was heard that the recovered goods had loosened to 6.56 yuan. The sales in this street were active. Amid the high rice prices, the demand from various shop doors was still strong, with more than 30,000 bales sold. Transactions with customers were still sluggish. According to customer news, the current price of Tianjin flour is limited, and transportation is also difficult to calculate. It is necessary to wait for the market price to fall before there is a formal sale. It was found that 1,000 bales of flour were shipped to Tanggu today.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market also appeared loose. Since the international situation changed, the industry hoarders first waited and watched, and the mills' appetite also turned loose at the same time. Also, the wheat price had reached a high peak of 10 yuan, and the rising momentum had reached its full potential. Therefore, the buyers took advantage of this to suppress the price and take it. Yesterday, the Fufu and Liang factories bought a total of 10,000 bales of wheat from Wuxi, Suzhou, Danyang, Changzhou, Puzhen, Caishi, Wuhu, and Pudong. Domestic households entered two carts of Daqiao wheat, and the price was similar to the previous market.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Loosens

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to move downstream as foreign exchange rates loosened. According to foreign telegrams, there was a slight recovery. Dutch news: The recovery price for September was 7.10 Dutch guilders. Hong Kong telegram: The price for coarse white sugar was 8.20 Hong Kong dollars. London telegram: The price for December was 6 shillings 3.5 pence, the price for March next year was 6 shillings 4 pence, and the price for June was 6 shillings 4.5 pence, with a total rise of nearly 4 pence in two days.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Lively, Silk Merchants Break Free From European Turmoil, White Factory Down 400 Yuan

Yesterday, the local silk market in Shanghai suddenly turned lively for foreign sales. However, the silk market fell relatively as foreign exchange rates rose. White Factory 78 points opened at 3,800 yuan, a sharp drop of 400 yuan compared to the beginning of the week. Li Li 6 numbers opened at 1,800 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan. However, transactions were brisk. In general, silk merchants sold their goods in a rush due to the European situation and the impending outbreak of war. Yesterday, Xinfu Dachang and other firms entered nearly 300 dans of White Factory Li Li.

Foreign Silk Market: New York spot prices for Chinese and Japanese raw silk fell by 2 cents each. Lyon fell by 0.5-1 French franc. New York near-term prices rose by 1 cent, and far-term prices remained unchanged. Yokohama spot prices rose by 10 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 2 yuan.

### Coal: White Coal Sales Strong, Prices Stable

Due to the tense European situation, the shilling had risen the day before, and foreign exchange rates had loosened. The fish in the department store had suddenly plunged, but the coal market remained stable due to strong real sales. The selling price was not weak. The industry discount price for Hongji White Coal was still 96 yuan, Haifeng Coal was 94 yuan per ton, and Mark Coal was 93 yuan. The shipment from the concession warehouse was traded in cash by the industry.

### Hardware: Qing Lead and Tin Sales Stagnant

Recently, hardware transactions have been very quiet, and prices are also chaotic. Therefore, the market situation is deserted. It was found that the Tianjin gang and Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs had no appetite for Qing lead and tin. Factories and hoarders on Muji Street were also stagnant, so transactions were sporadic. However, the selling prices were still high due to industry relationships. For example, the price of Citibank Qing lead was 90 yuan, the price of Dutch tin was 880 yuan, the price of Xiaokeng tin was 830 yuan, and the price of Jinguang tin was 300 yuan. The unit was dan. It was found that the standard was 1020 yuan better than before.

### North-South Goods: New Hainan Longan Meat, Second Batch Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Number of Shuidong Branches Still Small

After the new Hainan Longan Meat was listed, the second batch was also shipped by the Desheng ship, with a total of 45 pieces. The number of Shuidong branches was still small. Only 110 boxes arrived yesterday. Samples can be seen today, and the opening market price is unlikely to change too much.

### Raw Peanuts Gradually Rise

Raw peanuts have been in short supply recently, and market prices have gradually increased. Yesterday, the price in the ocean market was opened to 31.5 yuan per dan, and the Southern Regulation Bank sold at 35 yuan, which was only enough to cover costs. It was truly an extraordinary price in an extraordinary time.

### Candied Dates Fall

Recently, candied dates have arrived from Jiaxing and Suzhou. Also, the appetite in Hong Kong has gradually been satisfied, and there is no intention to continue ordering. Therefore, the market situation suddenly turned weak, and selling prices fell by 1020 yuan. The bank price was 110-105 yuan per piece. According to news from Lanxi, the production price was relatively cheap, and a small number of transfers to the local market would arrive soon.

Spring and Autumn

### Current Affairs Sketch: Rice Robbers

— Liu Xinghuo

This is a corner of the isolated island. It is in a humble alley. It is in a dilapidated room. The dim kerosene lamp light is as terrible as the face of the child sleeping on the bed board. The mother crouching next to him has shown exhaustion for all kinds of coaxing the child, and the gossamer-like breathing is still continuing to flow.

"Mom...! Mom... I'm hungry..."

"...Don't yell... Father... Father's coming! To cook..."

When the weak voice was about to be swallowed by loneliness, suddenly, a man rushed in from the outside like he was crazy. He gasped and shouted: "It's not me! It's not me!" and staggered to the table. In the light of the kerosene lamp, you could see his pale face.

"Father!...The child is crying."

The woman jumped up from the edge of the bed in surprise: "You...why?...

You...go outside and see if there are any police..."

The woman looked out the door, and there wasn't a ghost in the quiet alley. She began to tremble: "There's nothing! You...what trouble did you cause?"

"No, no." The man's gasping gradually calmed down.

"Your rice...didn't you buy rice?"

"Oh! Don't talk about it." He seemed to be alarmed when he heard the word rice. "Rice, yes, I didn't buy it. No! No! I didn't buy...When I ran to the rice shop, it was crowded with a large group of people. They were noisy, as if they were making noise, so I squeezed forward. I don't know who shouted a robbery, and everyone rushed in. I was also squeezed into the store in the crowd. They all carried the rice and flour piled there like tigers and left. I thought of you, I thought of my child, who hasn't eaten anything today; so I picked up a bag of rice from the ground..."

"What? You also robbed rice...No! No! You must be wrong!" She said with great nervousness: "Where is your rice?..."

"I picked up a bag of rice, and suddenly, a burst of distress welled up from my chest. Why should I rob rice? Is it all the rice shop's fault that rice prices keep rising? Is robbing rice a permanent solution? Who is causing such a chaotic situation in Shanghai? ...While I was thinking wildly, I heard someone shout: "The police are coming!" I hurriedly ran away, and I don't know where the rice on my shoulder went..."

"So, no rice..." She was a little dejected. "But, we can still bear hunger, but the child can't stand it! My poor child..." She looked at the child with concern, and the child had fallen asleep out of exhaustion.

"Yes, if we go on like this, we may starve to death one day." His face was intertwined with distress, annoyance, and anger. But, after a while, his eyes lit up, as if they were burning with fire: "No! I never want to starve to death alive here. If I'm going to die, I have to find a valuable way to die."

The kerosene ran dry, and darkness came after the lamp light shook. Let the bright moonlight illuminate this silent room and ignite the anger in the young man's chest!

### Rain After Clearing

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode Fifteen: Overseas Love News Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaf; A Miraculous Scene Amidst the Fire, Truly Outstanding Lotus

Alice also, as her aunt had said, inevitably exaggerated things somewhat. However, these words cannot be said to be completely without influence. Although this aunt was conservative and stubborn, her advice against marrying a Chinese man stemmed from her sincerity. Besides her aunt, others might not approve either, and Alice herself was still hesitant. Unexpectedly, as the Chinese say, "Marriage is predestined by heaven." Marriage truly has what is called a heavenly connection. If there is a real connection, it cannot be broken no matter what. Perhaps Alice and Chenggong were destined for each other, with a guiding hand in the dark, teaching a white woman to marry a yellow-skinned husband. One day, an accident suddenly occurred at Alice's home. It turns out that Westerners often like to live in tall buildings, especially in cities. The most numerous and tallest buildings are in New York, USA, where some buildings have over a hundred stories. New Yorkers have a competitive spirit when it comes to building tall buildings, and once this competitive spirit takes hold, it's unstoppable. For example, if you build a hundred-story building, tomorrow someone else will build a hundred-and-five-story building, surpassing your record by five stories. The next day, someone else, not to be outdone, insists on building a hundred-and-ten-story building, breaking your hundred-and-five-story record. If the city authorities don't impose a limit, the height will keep increasing indefinitely. Now, in France, where we are, there are no such extremely tall buildings, but five or six-story buildings are not uncommon. Alice lived in a five-story building, an apartment-style building that they called an "apartment." Alice's family had a very luxurious house, but it was in the countryside, far from the city. However, because Alice wanted to study at the University of Lyon, she rented this apartment, which was not far from the school. Fortunately, there were only her mother and daughter, so they didn't need a very large house, and this apartment was quite elegantly decorated and fully equipped. Downstairs, there were also gardens, lawns, tennis courts, and the like. Of course, Alice's male and female classmates had all been there, and Chenggong had been there countless times. Alice and her mother chose to live on the fifth floor for its spaciousness and good light. There was an elevator for easy access. There were several families living on the fifth floor, each with four or five rooms, including a living room, bedroom, dining room, bathroom, etc. Alice also had a beautiful study, which her classmates had also visited. Next to the study was Alice's bedroom. Although the room was not large, it was very neatly arranged, which her male and female classmates also knew. (173)

### Utilizing Old Textbooks

— Anran

Textbook prices have already increased in bookstores: 50% for middle schools and 80% for primary schools. Some may think that the bookstores are deliberately being malicious, trying to make a profit amidst the rising prices of everything. However, with a little investigation, we can see that the bookstores also have their own unavoidable difficulties. Not to mention anything else, just the price of paper alone has risen from two or three dollars per ream to more than ten dollars per ream. A ream is only five hundred sheets, so it is conceivable how much the cost of textbooks has increased. Therefore, besides hoping that the bookstores will not raise prices any further, we must also think of other ways to remedy the situation regarding the textbooks that students must have.

The best way to remedy the situation is naturally to utilize old textbooks. It is said that the girls' association of Guanghua Middle School has already launched this movement. They have already issued circulars to the students, asking everyone to hand in their used old textbooks, stating how much they want to sell each copy for, and how much they are willing to donate to refugees after the sale. I believe that this method is currently an urgent matter for students in various schools on the isolated island. I hope that all schools will take the initiative to imitate it when school starts.

Such utilization of old textbooks can naturally achieve the following public benefits: (1) There is no need to increase the outlet for foreign paper. I think the bookstores would be willing to do less business and earn less money. (2) Waste is utilized, and material resources are conserved, so that textbooks that would originally be placed on a high shelf after use or discarded in a corner can still fulfill their final use and not be wasted. (3) Students' burden is reduced, and the overall social economy is stabilized, because those who sell old books will gain a little, which is a small supplement, and those who buy old books will spend a small amount of extra money and obtain the same application, which will save them a lot more.

What I hope is that not only middle schools should do this, but also universities, and especially primary schools! Because primary school textbooks have increased the most, and the parents of primary school students are mostly middle and lower-class families, and their economy is most difficult under this kind of pressure of life. However, primary school students do not yet have the ability to automatically organize themselves to seek their own welfare, so I especially hope that the faculty and staff of various primary schools will be willing to come forward to take charge of affairs. Some selfish and self-serving primary school authorities, if they still insist that students buy the new textbooks and new exercise books that they handle and sell, and absolutely do not allow the use of old or other substitutes, as they did last year, that should of course be subject to public criticism. I hope that this semester, it will not happen again! (Editor's note: The current Nan Zhong students have organized an "Art Book Trading Committee" to promote it in various schools.)

### Flowers in the Art Garden

— Bai Hua

“Dramatic School”

Produced by MGM; Showing at Cathay Grand Theatre

Lu Hui Reina's outstanding acting skills come from hard work and training.

As Wang Long's wife in "The Good Earth," she is kind, hardworking, loyal to her husband, and places her hopes on her children. She gives us a vivid image of the role of Alan. In "Flowers in the Art Garden," she plays another difficult role: a poor girl who is loyal to art and wants to work at night to earn money for tuition. She fantasizes about a beautiful world, and she yearns for a beautiful lover. After meeting the Marquis in the factory, she sows beautiful seeds deep in her heart, and she hopes that it will bloom into extraordinary flowers. However, the Marquis's fickle love gives her a severe blow, and her beautiful dream of love is shattered. On the other hand, she develops her artistic talent. When she becomes famous and obtains inner comfort, she rejects the Marquis's love and decides to dedicate herself to art.

Lu Hui Reina's performance, from yearning, disillusionment to success, she can strongly grasp the changes in emotions and portray the character's personality. Especially the following examples are performed more profoundly and movingly. Her sweet fantasy when she first met the Marquis in the factory; the vivid and lively fabrication of a trip with the Marquis to her classmates; her initial surprise when the Marquis appeared, followed by being flattered; her angry departure when she saw the Marquis loving another dancer in the nightclub; and finally, her heartfelt joy at the successful performance, she can use facial and eye expressions to convey psychological changes. The apotheosis of acting is breathtaking.

The director's portrayal of the atmosphere of the drama school is very lively. For example, the hopes of each student and the various aspects of practicing "Romeo and Juliet" are very dramatic. However, the development of the whole film is too smooth and not compact enough, because the director focuses on Lu Hui Reina, and the other characters to be portrayed are neglected. Therefore, Pauline Goddard and Alan Marshall have no achievements to speak of.

### Tyrone Power and Annabella to Have Marital Troubles

— Tan Huibin

According to news from San Francisco's wireless radio broadcast, Tyrone Power, the mainstay of 20th Century Fox and Hollywood's number one star, is the most popular and handsome superstar in the world's film industry, and also the ideal lover in the hearts of tens of millions of female fans. Since he announced his marriage, not only his old lovers Sonja Henie and Loretta Young were heartbroken, but female fans (and some male fans) around the world were saddened. Many strange and difficult news had happened in Hollywood. But Tyrone was so fascinated by Annabella at that time that they finally got married despite everything. But now Hollywood brings good news to our female fans. Tyrone Power's relationship with Annabella has recently not been as close as when they were newlyweds, and there are often quarrels and disputes. Although Annabella conceded, Tyrone felt that there should be no unhappiness between husband and wife. Since it exists, it is not a blessing for the family, so he even has the intention of divorcing Annabella. In recent banquet parties, Tyrone always went alone. Annabella seemed to have understood Tyrone. She knew that he was not a steadfast lover. Wasn't Janet Gaynor deceived by Tyrone? So Annabella may not refuse a divorce if Tyrone proceeds with a separation.

### From "Nine Whirlwinds" Talking About Song Dezhu (Part 2)

— Weiwo

—Also Introducing Four Students from the Opera School

Accompanying Song Dezhu to Shanghai this time, besides the male role Yang Baosen, and the clown Ai Shiju who came to Shanghai with Mao Shilai last time, there are also Xiao Deyin, Li Debin, Song Jinsheng, and Tong Dexin.——Call them graduates of the opera school. I will now give an introduction below:

Xiao Deyin and Zhao Deyu and Cheng Yuhuan are known as the three outstanding Jing roles of the opera school. Deyin plays the Jiazi Hualian role, learning from Hou Xirui (some say that the students of the opera school, and the roles all learn Cheng Yanqiu, the male roles all learn Wang Shaolou, the Jing roles all learn Hou Xirui, and the clown roles all learn Cao Ergeng. There is indeed such a saying, because Yanqiu is the vice principal of the opera school, so the students all have a bit of an idol concept). All of Hou's masterpieces, such as "Famen Temple," "Bow Inkstone Yu," "Hong Fu Zhuan," "Dingjia Mountain," and "Mukezhai," Xiao is good at, and his expressions and actions are also lifelike. He was one of the first students of the opera school. Cheng Yanqiu greatly appreciated him. When Hou Xirui left the Qiu Sheng Society, Deyin was invited to join and fill Hou's vacancy. He performed in Qingdao with the Qiu Sheng Society and was very popular.

Li Debin has already been introduced in this magazine, but the language was vague. Debin's martial arts foundation is not bad, and his martial arts plays are quite good. Plays such as "Entering the Big Hammer," "Group Celebration Meeting," and "Picking the Village" are no less than Ye Shengian's. However, his literary plays are slightly worse. Jin Zhongren cared for Debin very much. Debin's literary plays were learned from Zhongren. After leaving the school, Debin joined Li Wanchun's Yongchun Society and Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society. Now, through Jin Zhongren's introduction, he entered Pu Yusheng's Qingsheng Society, specializing in matching plays with Xun Zilingxiang, and his skills have improved a lot compared to before. It is said that he has already become a disciple of Xun Huisheng. Recently, a new stage sent people north to invite actors. Huisheng strongly recommended Debin, but he already had a previous invitation with Huang Yu, so he declined the invitation from the new stage.

Song Jinsheng and Tong Dexin are both Song Dezhu's assistants in martial arts roles. Song Jinsheng is Dezhu's brother. His skills are not bad. However, he has not been following Dezhu for long. His qualifications and experience are not as good as Tong Dexin's. Tong Dexin has been Dezhu's assistant since the earliest days. Dezhu cannot do without him. The relationship between Dezhu and Tong Dexin is like Nine Whirlwinds and Yan Lanshi, Zhu Guifang and Zhu Xiangquan, one complementing the other, extremely able to paint the beauty of peony green leaves. Dezhu's assistants, in the earliest days, were Tong Dexin, Zhang Dezhi, Cao Derun, and Zhao Dexun. Later, Cao Derun changed careers, Zhang Dezhi passed away, and they were replaced by Zhang Jinyuan and Song Jinsheng. This time, when Dezhu came south, Zhang Jinyuan and Zhao Dexun were not on the list. Presumably only Tong Dexin and Song Jinsheng came with him.

### Wartime Cinemas in Spain

— Qintian

Only Half a Mile from the Front Line; Most Attendees are Soldiers

When the Spanish war was at its most intense, an American photographer followed the army to shoot war news films. One night, the cold wind was fierce, and he saw many soldiers and women lined up on the street, covering their heads and pulling their collars, as if waiting for food distribution. He said to his friend very sympathetically, "These people are so pitiful!" But his friend said; "Don't worry, go and see what they are waiting for first?" Turning the corner, it turned out to be a movie theater. They were waiting to buy tickets to see the Marx Brothers' "Three Stars with the Moon." The Spanish especially liked to watch the Marx Brothers' films because these comedies mostly tore down the masks of worldly sophistication.

### News from the Painting and Entertainment Circle

— Dongyun Writes; Xiuyun Creates Graphics

(14) Storytelling

This kind of entertainment can only be heard on the radio because the storytelling aspect is too simple and not suitable for theater performance. But it also has its advantages.

When there is nothing to do late at night, listening to story programs on the radio, quietly listening for half an hour, is really effective in cultivating emotions and pleasing the mind.

Storytelling is not that easy; without considerable knowledge, completely "referencing ancient texts" and telling stories straight from the book will never be popular.

### Preface to the Ankang Gathering (2)

— Tianxu Wosheng

There was also a Hollywood cinema, only half a mile from the front line. Soldiers fighting on the front line sometimes got leave at night to leave the battlefield and went to the theater to watch a movie before returning to the trenches on the front line. The film "A Tale of Two Cities" was also very popular with the audience, and the chivalrous behavior of Sydney Carton was widely praised.

These cinema entrances were usually piled with sandbags. Once, a bomb exploded at the entrance of a certain theater, and the ticket seller was killed by the bomb, but the movie continued to play.

Really Jin Yuan, after Jin Zhi Yelu Chucai surrendered to Yuan, he wrote the Collection of Zhanran Layman. According to his notes, it is known that there are four types of Ruan. What we in Hangzhou used to have is called the String Da Ruan, directly referred to as Ruan Xian. Another is called the Xiao Ruan, which is similar to the Double Qing of Xing 13 items, but its abdomen is different. However, they are all similar to the Sanxian, and the Sanxian is also divided into two types, one is the Haixian, its sound is broad and low, which is used for documents and Ankang, and the other is the Quxian, its sound is tight, small, and high, which is used for Southern and Northern tunes. The Quxian can be matched with a flute, and it is mostly used for singing Northern tunes. Those who sing Fu words only use it alone, or match it with the Erxian的和琴. The other three types have never been obtained by Jin and Yuan, so they cannot be used for Northern tunes. The Haixian is matched with the Pipa, so in the Yuanjian Leihan, the Pipa and the Ruan are classified as one type, and there is no distinction between the Double Qing and the Sanxian. The Double Qing is used for Shifan fine music, and the Da Ruan is the main music for the Seven Sages, so it is not used for Southern tunes. Southern tunes are also called Hua tunes, which have directly accused them of being non-orthodox sounds, but all those who play the Sanxian must sit in the central upper seat, ranking first, so their respect can be seen. The Pipa and the Heqin are divided into left and right, and the drum board is at the end, and if there are five seats, a vacant seat is waiting for guests. If there are seven people playing together, then a Zheng 笙 Xiao is added, and there is no one with empty hands. Those who play the Sanxian must sing Lao Sheng or Jing, those who play the Heqin sing Xiaosheng, the Pipa sings Dan, and the drum board belongs to Chou. Those who pluck the Zheng do not open their mouths, probably because the accent of the people of Shanxi Qin is not suitable. The so-called Heqin, or even regarded as Huqin, is not a Hu system. What we in Hangzhou call Erhe, then using the Erxian to harmonize with the Sanxian, Sixian and Thirteen strings of the Zheng, and the thirteen pipes of the Sheng, six holes of the Xiao, it can be said to be an omnipotent odd instrument, worthy of its name. Ji Kang's Yuansheng Ai Yue Lun says, a peaceful person, listening to Zheng flute Pipa, his form is irritable and his ambition is beyond, hearing the sound of Qin Se, his body is quiet and his heart is free, so I think that Heqin must have originated from Ji Kang, Ji Kang originally liked to learn Lao Zhuang, and was known for being lazy in the world, its system is suitable for its nature, and semitones are very flexible.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Shaving and Plucking Hairs are Two Major Sufferings for Actors

When talking about the ages of these four people, Mei is of course the oldest (probably actually over fifty, no need to state). Huisheng is next (forty-one), Xiaoyun is about the same age as Huisheng, and Yanqiu is the youngest (in his thirties). If we talk about appearance, I am afraid Lanfang is still the first, because Yanqiu is fat and strong, Huisheng is addicted to hobbies, and Xiaoyun is born as a small, refined girl, without a noble spirit, so even though Lanfang is nearly fifty years old, his stage presence is still as good as ever. In fact, he himself has naturally grown sideburns, no different from our Dean Yu, and the reason why he can make the audience below the stage unable to see it is because he is exceptionally diligent in plucking hairs in private. Above, I said that the more you shave your beard, the longer it grows, so generally male actors who play female roles rely on a pair of small tweezers to pluck the beard one by one when they have nothing to do. It is said that after plucking the husband, it will certainly grow out, but comparatively it always grows slowly and sparsely, and at the same time it is not as thick and hard as when it is shaved with a knife. The pain of plucking is of course beyond words, but since you are doing this line of work, what can you do?

Some people say that anyone who has been castrated will no longer grow a beard, so eunuchs have no beards. On stage, such as those who play Chen Lin, Guo Huai, and other old men, although the characters in the play live to be eighty or more, with snow-white hair and an old-fashioned appearance, they do not wear beards. (Sideburns, mouth surface, are all internal names for different types of beards) Also, actors usually do not grow beards, because growing a beard means that they will no longer perform on stage; such as the current Nine Whirlwinds, etc. Only Sheng roles, because they often wear a mouth surface, and when they are old and do not often perform, they often grow them, such as Sun Juxian, etc. Some people also say that Dan roles pluck their beards very diligently when they are young, but once they reach old age, they no longer grow, and this statement is still to be investigated for credibility.
