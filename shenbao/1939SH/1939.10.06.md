### Chinese Troops Closely Encircle Pingjiang County City; No Trace of the Japanese South of the Miluo River; Various Chinese Armies Press the Attack Amidst Japanese Chaos; Totaling 30,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Achieving Unprecedented Results; Recovering Places Like Ma'anling and Laohushan in Northern Jiangxi

Chongqing: Fierce battles in northern Hunan continue to unfold. In recent days, various Chinese armies have been relentlessly pursuing the defeated Japanese troops, achieving significant victories. Pingjiang County City has been tightly encircled by Chinese forces, preventing the Japanese from breaking out and making its capture imminent. On the railway front, Chinese pursuing troops have pushed the Japanese forces to the north bank of the Miluo River, nearly causing a complete collapse. Currently, with the exception of a few remaining Japanese soldiers in Yingtian who are being swiftly eliminated, there is no trace of the Japanese south of the Miluo River. This large-scale southward invasion by the Japanese was met with a fierce counterattack by the Chinese, who cut them into several sections, encircled, and annihilated them. In total, over 30,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed by the Chinese forces. More than 6,000 bodies were abandoned or could not be moved. The severity of their losses, the speed of their defeat, and their panicked retreat are unprecedented in any previous decisive battle. The valiant Chinese soldiers have achieved unprecedented results, effectively achieving the greatest goal of depleting Japanese forces. (Fifth Dispatch)

The Japanese retreated towards Yingtian, and Chinese troops at Danianqiao annihilated several hundred Japanese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes. This morning, Chinese troops were mopping up the remaining Japanese soldiers between Pingjiang and Wengjiangpu (west of Pingjiang), and near Xinshi in Changle. The three to four thousand Japanese troops in Pingjiang are almost trapped. Furthermore, two to three thousand Japanese soldiers from Tongcheng reinforced Chongyang last night and launched a counterattack on Chinese-held Maishi, seemingly intending to seize the strongholds of Maishi and Taoshugang to find a retreat route for the trapped Japanese forces in the Pingjiang area. The fighting there is currently intense. (Fifth Dispatch)

After receiving the report, the Chinese air defense forces prepared immediately. When the first batch of Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace, the Chinese searchlights illuminated them. The brave air force also rose up to fight. After being attacked, the Japanese plane formations were disorganized and hastily dropped bombs before fleeing. The other four batches also successively invaded the city's airspace, circling for a long time, and still indiscriminately bombed the suburbs before escaping in batches along the original route. (Fifth Dispatch)

Chongqing: A squadron of Japanese planes, numbering about eighteen, flew along the Yangtze River to the Sichuan border on the morning of the 5th.

(Fifth Dispatch)

Chongqing: After midnight yesterday, an alarm was issued here, saying that forty-five Japanese planes were coming to raid the area. At that time, the moonlight was bright, but there were still thin clouds in the sky, so most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes fell outside the city. The alarm was lifted at half past four this morning, so the residents went back to sleep. However, they were awakened by the alarm again at about ten in the morning, but at this time it was drizzling here, and the Japanese planes left without dropping bombs. It was heard that various places in eastern Sichuan had been bombed by Japanese planes. The alarm was lifted again at half past eleven. (Fifth Dispatch from the Associated Press)

Chongqing: From midnight yesterday to dawn today, Chongqing was extensively raided by eighty Japanese bombers, divided into five teams. Residents spent the night hiding in air-raid shelters.

Most of the bombs dropped in the western suburbs fell along the Yu-Rong highway. After bombing Beibei Hot Springs, 30 miles north of Chongqing, the fifth team of Japanese planes flew back to Chongqing near dawn and bombed the western suburbs again. Shortly after dawn, the last Japanese plane had flown out of sight, and the alarm was lifted. At ten o'clock this morning, Japanese planes were seen flying towards the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and an alarm was issued here again.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Baseless News

Chongqing: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today denied reports that the Soviet Union had requested that the Eighth Route Army be transferred from North China to Yunnan Province. The news was published by an American newspaper in Shanghai, which claimed that the Soviet Union had requested that the Eighth Route Army be transferred to Yunnan Province to prepare for an attack on British Burma. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied the news that Soviet troops had entered Xinjiang. (Fifth Dispatch from the Associated Press)

Chongqing: Chinese sources here have not confirmed the claim that large numbers of Soviet troops have arrived in Xinjiang. Although Chongqing is in daily contact with Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province, by radio, it has not received any such news. People here generally believe that this claim was spread by the Japanese in the hope that the Soviet Union would pose a threat to Afghanistan and India, and as a result, force Britain to change its policy towards Japan. People also feel that the news that some Soviet volunteers recently entered China via Xinjiang has been misinterpreted, hence the claim that Soviet troops have arrived in Xinjiang. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)

### Discord Between Wang Jingwei and Wang Kemin

Beiping: Reliable Chinese sources today claimed that discord between Wang Jingwei and Wang Kemin, leader of the "Provisional Government of Beiping," has stalled the effort to organize a Chinese "central government." It is said that Wang Kemin wants to retain his position as the leader of the North China government, which in theory is subject to Jingwei's control, but Jingwei fears that Wang Kemin would hold a high position in Nanjing in name only without real power due to conflicts in the Chinese officialdom. It is reported that the seventh "Joint Committee" will be held in Ping in mid-October in an attempt to eliminate differences of opinion. Wang Jingwei will attend in person at that time. At the same time, it is reported that Jingwei is trying to invite Wu Peifu to be the head of the "Pacification Committee" to implement local policies in North China under Wang Jingwei's "new government." Chinese sources claim that if Wu Peifu refuses to take office, then Qi Xieyuan will be invited to assume the post. It is reported that someone is trying to eliminate the conflict between Wang Jingwei and Wang Kemin. (Fifth Dispatch from the Associated Press)

### Military Committee Releases One-Week Battle Situation

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Committee said that the war this week (September 27 to October 4) was the fiercest in northern Hunan. There were also fierce battles on other fronts. Although the Japanese army's invasion was fierce, under the strong resistance of the Chinese, the severity of the Japanese army's losses and the speed of their retreat were unprecedented. Therefore, the success of the Chinese strategy of depleting the Japanese army has been powerfully demonstrated. Regarding the course of operations, the more important ones are described below:

Hunan-Hubei Front: The Japanese troops in the Pingjiang area invaded China in three routes this week. The central route snuck along the railway line to Qiaotouyi, the right wing snuck along the Chang-Yue ancient road to Sanduoqiao south of Qingshan City, and the left wing snuck from the mountainous area on the Chang-Ping border to Jinjing and then turned west to invade and reached Shangshanshi. Another part snuck from Jinjing south to Yong'an City, venturing blindly with extremely fierce momentum. Starting on the 30th, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold and launched a full-scale counterattack, cutting the Japanese vanguard into several sections in the intricate mountainous areas and defeating them individually. By the 2nd, the central route had captured Qiaotouyi and Liju, the right wing had captured Qingshan City, Sanduoqiao, Wanggongqiao, and Lijia Duan, and the left wing had captured Yong'an City, Shangshanshi, Jinjing, Maishi, Longmen, Zhuxi, and Xianzhong. Chasing the defeated enemy was like splitting bamboo. Within a few days, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers collapsed in a disorganized manner to the north of Pingjiang. At the moment, the Chinese army continues to advance, and the front has been pressed to the Miluo River. The overall war situation is increasingly stable as the remaining Japanese troops are thoroughly mopped up. In recent days, the Hubei Chinese army has launched attacks on various routes, encircling Linxian in the north by way of the Xi River, and capturing Changshoudian, Xiaojia Dian, and outposts around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, as well as encircling Qianjiang, and approaching Xianning and Chongyang in southern Hubei, and capturing a lot wherever they went.

Northern Jiangxi Front: The Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi, after being badly defeated in the northeast of Gao'an, gathered several thousand remnants and invaded west from Fengxin. In order to induce the Japanese army to penetrate deep, the Chinese army made slight shifts at the positions of Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu west of Fengxin. Starting on the evening of the 26th, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack and engaged in a heroic battle with the Japanese army. By the morning of the 27th, Luofang, Yecheng, and Qifu had all been recovered, and then they advanced to encircle Ganfang and severely attacked the remaining Japanese troops. On the 1st, they took advantage of the victory to recapture Huangshaqiao, Hengqiaoshi, and Shiziling, cutting off Japanese reinforcements. The region is estimated to have killed more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers. As for the Japanese troops northwest of Xiushui, after sneaking into Taoshugang, they immediately divided more than 3,000 infantry and cavalry into two routes to invade Bai Shaling in the southeast and Gai Wenling in the southwest, but were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were defeated. Taoshugang has been recovered, and more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed. The Japanese attempt to coordinate with the invasion of northern Hunan has been completely thwarted. Moreover, the quick-response Japanese army in the northeast of Gao'an successively captured Longshan, Yanziyan, and Nanxi in the southeast of Nanchang, and captured a lot. At the moment, they are continuing to advance and mop up the remaining Japanese troops. (To be continued)

### The Savings and Remittance Bureau Is Ordered to Issue Savings Bonds for National Construction; Divided into Types A and B with Good Interest Rates

Chongqing: In order to encourage national savings and to start national construction undertakings, the central government designated the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue savings bonds for national construction. After receiving the order, the bureau actively prepared for it and is now ready. It has ordered the bureau's Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang branch offices, and more than 1,000 post offices in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to sell them simultaneously around the Double Ten Festival. In order to promote them smoothly, the director of the Savings Department, Xu Jilian, was specially assigned to lead ten special inspectors from the Remittance Inspection Department, including Zhang Zhongyi, to go to various branch offices to assist in the promotion in order to achieve widespread publicity. Mr. Xu and special commissioners Zhang Zhongyi and Fang Jianbiao arrived in Chongqing by air on the 4th to actively rush to handle the sales and various procedures. Other commissioners will also arrive one after another. It is heard that this savings bond is better and more convenient than ordinary savings. The absorption of funds is limited to running national construction affairs, with the idea of saving to save the country. Both the principal and interest are directly responsible by the post office and are guaranteed by the government, which can be said to be unparalleled in stability. Savings bonds are divided into two types, A and B. Type A bonds are registered and can be reported lost and reissued. Type B bonds are unregistered and cannot be reported lost but can be freely transferred or donated. The denomination is divided into six categories: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. The term is stipulated to be a maximum of ten years, but Type A bonds can be applied for redemption at any time after six months at more than 1,000 post offices across the country, which is no different from ordinary current savings, and the interest is far better than current savings. Type B savings bonds must specify the term of storage at the time of purchase, which is divided into ten types from one year to ten years. Once specified, it cannot be changed. Detailed information will be printed in a booklet and issued by the bureau within days. (Fifth Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Theory of Japan's Withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern Pact

Yesterday, news dispatches from London, England, and Rome, Italy, both stated that the Japanese government had announced its withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern International Pact, but the details were not clear. As of last night, Tokyo had not released any news on this matter. On the 2nd of this month, that is, before the 4th, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, in his speech on diplomatic policy at the local governors' conference, first stated the following:

"At the local governors' conference in May of this year, Foreign Minister Arita once said that the Japanese government was advocating the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy and was negotiating with Germany and Italy. However, the European situation subsequently underwent rapid changes centered on the Danzig issue. On August 24, Germany and the Soviet Union unexpectedly established a non-aggression pact. Therefore, the aforementioned negotiations were terminated."

The news dispatches from England and Italy yesterday were either a misrepresentation of Nomura's speech or a separate announcement by the Japanese government. It is currently impossible to verify this. However, Nomura's statement was that the strengthening negotiations had ended, not that the agreement had been canceled. The dispatches from England and Italy were equivalent to an announcement of the cancellation of the withdrawal. The two differed in degree, but were consistent with the Anti-Comintern Pact.

The so-called Anti-Comintern International Pact was led by Germany and Italy, and Japan was attached to it. At the time when Germany and Italy were destroying democracy and establishing national socialist and fascist regimes, they used anti-communism as a banner for their domestic and foreign political strategies. The two countries were dissatisfied with the situation after the Treaty of Versailles and conspired to change it, thus forming an axis as a lever for aggression. This is where the Anti-Comintern Pact came from. Japan launched its aggression in the Far East, knowing that this was not approved by the world's democratic countries. Moreover, Japan and other countries have many people who are wary of communism. Furthermore, Japan insisted on carrying out aggression in China that could not be without ties, so it joined the Pact. In fact, Germany, in addition to assisting General Franco in Spain and carrying out an armed revolution against the slightly left-leaning Republican government, which led to the two-and-a-half-year Spanish Civil War, has never engaged in anti-communist activities. Even within their own country, the organizations of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party are fully capable of crowding out dissidents and protecting the regime, and do not need to claim to be anti-communist. As for Japan, it launched its aggression in China while fully suppressing the communists, and intensified its aggression in China when the Communist Party was exhausted. Not only did it never engage in anti-communist activities, but it also objectively undermined China's efforts to eliminate the communists. What are the rights and wrongs, good and evil, of communism? What is the international strategy of the Communist Third International? What are the communist components in the Spanish Republican government? What is their performance? What are its advantages and disadvantages? These are all separate issues that cannot be simply judged. However, Germany and Japan, which claim to be anti-communist, have never dared to face the Soviet Union, the communist headquarters, which is an unquestionable historical fact. Therefore, the so-called Anti-Comintern International Pact is a tool for Germany and Japan to create suspicion in domestic and international affairs, and has no value in essence. Hitler had great talent and strategy, capable of both launching and withdrawing. Therefore, he called for anti-communism at the beginning and also allied with the Soviet Union first. When the Soviet Union and Germany were allied, the Anti-Comintern Pact also became ashes. Therefore, under the current situation, it is actually the same for Japan to either advocate maintaining the agreement, advocate strengthening it, announce the termination of the strengthening negotiations, or make an announcement of withdrawing from the agreement. In short, they are all completely meaningless things.

What we still want to discuss is that the Japanese are meticulous and cautious about everything, whether it is a national affair or a petty business. This is due to their national character. Therefore, the Japanese still do not regard the Anti-Comintern Pact, which the world regards as waste paper and ashes, as nothing, and stubbornly believe that waste paper still has the weight of waste paper and ashes still have the utility of ashes. Although Germany has already destroyed the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese still insist on not leaving it, not abandoning it lightly, and striving to make the most of it. It can be asserted. What is it used for? It is used to deal with China. Prime Minister Abe once said that "Japan's biggest problem today is the handling of the China Incident. Therefore, we have no choice but to place the core of our policy in the handling of the China Incident and integrate and concentrate all domestic and foreign policies under this goal." The existence or abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact is one end of its policy, and all policies are designed to deal with China. How is it used? There are Britain and France in the China issue. Britain and France are timid and sometimes close to stupidity. Japan can still use the Anti-Comintern Pact in diplomatic magic and international propaganda to flaunt itself in front of Britain and France. Although this pact has no meaning at all, it may be effective in intimidating Britain and France, which is one of its uses. There is the Soviet Union in the China issue. The current relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan is extremely delicate. They are both suspicious and circumspect, and they both want to use each other. The essence of the Anti-Comintern Pact is to oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Japan publicly withdraws from the pact, it will at least hope to obtain some kind of comfort from the Soviet Union as a price before the announcement, which is the second point. Japan's actions of aggression against China can no longer be justified by anti-communism. However, because it attempts to make China its de facto protectorate, it has no choice but to attempt to station troops in China under the guise of peace. This has always been justified by anti-communism. Now that an Anti-Comintern Pact has not been abolished, it is also inconvenient to force people to participate again. It is still necessary to find other excuses for stationing troops to replace anti-communism. When this substitute has not yet been found, it should not abandon the pact like worn-out shoes, which is the third point. These three points have no practical effect at all. However, the Japanese will try to make the most of this completely meaningless Anti-Comintern Pact, whether they keep it or abandon it. We will soon see that they will definitely reverse this theory and prove that it is not a mistake!

### Statement by French Premier Daladier: Britain and France Determined to Collaborate for Ultimate Victory; Will Never Yield to Strong Powers and Accomplished Facts; Unwilling to Accept a Temporary Truce Before the Next Aggression

Paris: French Premier Daladier stated to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today that France must continue to fight, expressing that the unity between Britain and France in military, economic, and financial spheres remains close. After British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Britain and France would never abandon the purpose for which they joined the war, French Premier Daladier also declared to the world that the French government will continue to cooperate faithfully with Britain and will not accept any peace dictated by others. Daladier elaborated on the origins of the war, stating that while the immediate cause of the war was the invasion of Poland, the underlying cause was Germany's ambition to dominate Europe. Daladier continued by stating the aim of France in the war, explaining why France must continue its extremely friendly unity with Britain in this war. Daladier also answered questions from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies in detail, expressing admiration for Italian Premier Mussolini's efforts to prevent the outbreak of war until the last moment, and said that Britain and France had repeatedly tried to resolve various disputes without resorting to war, but Hitler ultimately created the current war situation and must bear full responsibility. It is reported that Daladier mentioned to the committee the efforts of the United States to revise its neutrality law. (Reuters, 4th)

Paris: Premier Daladier delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, clearly explaining the government's current policy and reviewing diplomatic activities since the outbreak of the military conflict, stating that Germany has imperialistic goals and intends to control everything. This war was purely caused by that country's blatant attack on Poland, and that country bears all responsibility. Britain and France had previously strived to find a peaceful solution to various disputes between Germany and Poland, and the French government also published a Yellow Book to make all relevant documents public so that all countries around the world could be clear about where the responsibility lies. At this point, the Premier then described the possible consequences of various agreements between Germany and the Soviet Union, and reported in detail on the negotiations between Britain and France with Turkey, as well as France's mutual relations with most countries. He expressed satisfaction with the improvement of relations between France and Japan, and said that as for France's war objectives, they have been repeatedly stated before and need not be repeated. Recently, the bond between Britain and France has become increasingly strong, and both sides are determined not to yield to violence or to accomplished facts. What France hopes for is not a temporary truce between two aggressions, but a lasting peace that ensures the safety of all countries. The Premier then concluded by saying that he firmly believes that Britain and France will be able to achieve ultimate victory no matter what. It is rumored that Germany has sent peace proposals to Britain and France, but this is not true. This speech was deeply praised by the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and people in the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies also expressed great satisfaction, saying that the German propaganda machine has used so-called peace proposals to cause some misunderstandings internationally. "Premier Daladier's resolute speech can dispel these misunderstandings in one fell swoop." (Havas, 5th)

Daladier, French Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense

### British Foreign Secretary Explains Three Principles of Peace

London: The House of Lords debated the war situation today. Lord Snell spoke first, saying that when peace is proposed in the future, we must pay attention to examining whether it is a genuine peace and not a truce that anyone can use to rearm and prepare for further aggression. We unfortunately have no reason to believe that Nazi Germany has slightly changed its mind and purpose. Today's Germany is still yesterday's Germany and is a huge problem for the world. If Nazi Germany wants peace and proposes a republic of peace with a velvet glove on one hand and a loaded pistol in the other, then its psychology is unspeakable. Germany has a brain, but it does not understand why other countries hate Germany. We must be careful when dealing with this matter, because the restoration of the status quo may not be the restoration of peace. We do not want to continue to live under the fear and anxiety that we have had for the past few years. I hope the British government will not refuse to listen to genuine proposals that can restore world peace, but we must pay attention to whether it is a genuine or false peace.

Former Home Secretary Lord Samuel then spoke, saying that if the war ends within a month, everyone will welcome it, but if the end of the war only makes the situation no better than before, but instead worse, and the people are still not free from panic, international treaties are still worthless, and the scourge of war is still a threat, then this truce is too expensive. I believe the people of Britain and France all know that we are now at war and must continue to do so to achieve our original purpose.

Archbishop Lang stated that we cannot have peace with Hitler, but we can conclude an honorable treaty with Germany and the great Germanic people. We should arrange a path for a new organization of European peace, so that our youth have a clear understanding that they are not only eliminating harm to European life, but also preserving civilization for the future.

Lord Cecil, Chairman of the British League of Nations Union, also stated that the rumored peace proposals include the recognition of the conquest of Poland, and if so, such proposals are unacceptable.

Foreign Secretary Halifax replied on behalf of the government, saying that Britain trusts France very much, just as France trusts Britain very much. Recently, if Britain has made any decisions or announcements, it has always consulted with the French government and exchanged opinions. This has been the case in the past and will continue to be the case in the future. As for the Soviet Union, we are happy to see the maintenance of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey do not need to conflict with the extremely close relations between Britain and Turkey. As for the possibility of peace proposals, I cannot predict the content of such peace proposals that may be put forward. We have very painful experience of the characteristics and methods of the German government. We have repeatedly seen the German rulers abolish the international treaties they have signed and destroy the basic principles of the policies they have been promoting for many years. Therefore, if the German government now wants to use guarantees instead of threats to satisfy people, then we must say that the guarantees issued by the current German government are insufficient. If we do receive peace proposals, we will study them carefully and test them with the principles for which we are fighting. No matter what the nature of the proposals, they must be considered in the following three aspects: 1. The circumstances under which the peace proposals are put forward; 2. The government that puts forward the peace proposals; 3. The guarantees that any future agreement can obtain. If the circumstances of the proposals are negotiations under the threat of force, then the danger is extreme. Britain and France will never be moved by threats and abandon the principles for which they are fighting. If we abandon violence and pledge to abide by faith, then we are prepared to shake hands with other countries, including Germany, and jointly engage in the work of genuine world construction. We have repeatedly stated our willingness to contribute to achieving this goal, but any progress towards this goal cannot begin until there is a solid guarantee of security and that countries no longer constantly fear German attacks and no longer need large-scale armaments to prevent aggression. Now our first responsibility remains to find conditions that can prevent violent regimes from being used again and that government promises are kept. (Reuters, 4th)

### Although Hitler Scheduled to Speak Today, "Peace Offensive" Already Frustrated

Berlin: The German official news agency stated that the German Parliament is scheduled to meet at noon on Friday to listen to Hitler's declaration. It is expected that Hitler will announce his peace terms at that time. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin: German political figures mostly take a wait-and-see attitude toward the future development of the international situation. Now that the war in Poland has ended, the tense situation has eased slightly. German people are eagerly looking forward to the speech that Head of State Hitler will deliver to the Parliament tomorrow. Since yesterday morning, national flags have been flying all over Germany to celebrate the transfer of German troops from the eastern front to the western front. (Haitong, 5th)

London: The Italian official news agency published an article in Rome confirming the claim from Berlin that Italy has not taken the initiative for peace at the moment. It is said that the news spread by some British newspapers that Mussolini is considering a peace conference plan has no basis. In the current situation, Italy does not want to have an initiative of this nature. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent criticized the matter, saying that informed sources in London attach great importance to this statement. Moreover, the fact that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano did not issue a communiqué after visiting Berlin shows that Mussolini has refused to launch Hitler's peace plan. This point has special significance, because British Prime Minister Chamberlain said on Tuesday that he would study and test any proposals based on the conditions he had previously stipulated. Now that Germany's proposals have obviously failed to meet these conditions, Mussolini is not accepting the responsibility of promoting Germany's proposals. The fact that there was no communiqué after Ciano's visit to Berlin is probably because a communiqué could not be issued until Mussolini approved Germany's proposals. It is rare for there to be no communiqué after such an important official visit. (Reuters, 5th)

Rome: The news that the German Parliament will meet tomorrow is the matter of most interest to Italian political figures at the moment. The Italian government welcomes measures to end the war, but rumors have spread from Britain and France that Italy has already moved to end the war. Semi-official Italian sources deny this, and the general public believes that the time is not yet ripe and it seems too early to take formal action. (Haitong, 5th)

Washington: Official circles do not comment on the possibility of the United States participating in a peace conference, as mentioned by former British Prime Minister Lloyd George in the House of Commons yesterday. However, non-official circles say that the United States is unwilling to propose a peace treaty with Italy or other countries that would permanently divide Poland. Secretary of State Hull has previously stated that the US government does not recognize that Poland has been destroyed. (Reuters, 4th)

### Spanish Airlines Stop Using Italian Aircraft

Madrid: Spanish domestic airmail routes originally used Italian aircraft and were piloted by Italian pilots. It has been learned that from today onwards, all aircraft will be replaced with domestically-made aircraft and domestically-hired pilots. (Havas, 4th)

### British Military Circles Attach Great Importance to Soviet-Turkish Negotiations; Believe it is Related to the Situation in the Black Sea; Lithuania Discusses Soviet Proposals

London: Military and political figures here have focused their attention on the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. It is believed that the Soviet Union is eager to protect itself from the possibility of British naval and air forces attacking and destroying the Baku oil fields via the Black Sea. Therefore, it is now putting pressure on Turkey to lock the Black Sea, but it is believed that Turkey will not disappoint the Allied countries. (Reuters, 5th)

Geneva: News has been received here from Paris that French political figures are paying close attention to the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. French political circles believe that these negotiations involve the issue of Turkey recognizing the accomplished facts within Poland. If Turkey follows the Soviet Union's opinion, other countries in the Balkan Entente may also follow suit. (Haitong, 5th)

Moscow: Political figures in Moscow say that the Turkish representative has received instructions from his government to continue negotiations, so the Soviet-Turkish negotiations that were suspended on October 2 can be reopened. Diplomatic circles here are rife with rumors that the Soviet government has proposed the following key points to the Turkish Foreign Minister: (1) Warships of belligerent countries are not allowed to pass through the Dardanelles Strait during wartime; (2) Conclude a Soviet-Turkish mutual assistance treaty; (3) In fact, the Soviet Union will undermine Turkey's relationship with the British-French alliance.

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu, accompanied by the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yaktai, visited Soviet Defense Commissar Voroshilov yesterday and held a lengthy conversation. Saracoglu then visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan. Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Terentiev also participated. (Haitong, 5th)

Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu's talks in Moscow have been delayed. Although official circles have not criticized it, the public has become greatly uneasy. Newspapers authorized by the government vaguely state that even the slightest sacrifice that harms Turkey's sovereignty and honor cannot be recognized. This is Turkey's task. According to reliable sources, but not confirmed by official circles, the Soviet Union has requested to sign mutual assistance treaties with the Balkan and Black Sea countries, which are the same as those being negotiated by the Soviet Union with the Baltic countries. Another message said that the Soviet Union had informed Saracoglu that the Soviet Union must establish naval bases in Romania's Constanta port and maintain the right to transport troops through the Balkan Peninsula countries. It is heard that among the important events discussed by Saracoglu in the Soviet capital, in addition to the events that are directly related to Soviet-Turkish relations, there are also those that affect the Balkan Consultative Countries, allowing them to be the issue of Romania. Although the true nature of these discussions is still very vague, Turkish newspapers are fiercely criticizing the rumors that the Balkan Peninsula countries are abandoning their neutral status and tending towards democratic countries. Diplomatic circles hinted that Moscow is putting pressure on Saracoglu, but said that no matter what happens, Turkey's position and its promises to Britain and France will not be affected. (Reuters, 5th)

Last night, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters and Latvian legal advisor Chevlinis began drafting an agreement with representatives of the Soviet government. (Haitong, 5th)

Swiss Capital: According to news from the Finnish capital, the claim that the Soviet government invited Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko to go to Moscow is not accurate, but it has been confirmed that the Soviet Union has again requested that the Finnish government not fortify the Aland Islands. (Havas, 5th)

Moscow: Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Soviet representative Palchirov exchanged the ratified text of the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty in the Estonian capital last night.

### Germany Plans to Monopolize Trade with Neutral Countries to Strengthen Economic Warfare Capabilities

Danish Capital Dispatch: The political reporter stationed in Berlin claims that according to informed sources in Berlin, the German government will soon invite neutral countries to participate in a trade conference in order to change the entire current trade system in Europe. It is heard that former President of the German National Bank, Schacht, has drafted a plan asking neutral countries to transport all their exports to Germany, which will then resell them to other neutral countries. (Reuters, 5th)

Danish Capital: Negotiations on German-Danish commercial relations began today at the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main topic of discussion was the various problems that have arisen in German-Danish commercial relations after Britain implemented a blockade policy. (Haitong, 5th)

Latvian Capital: The Latvian commercial delegation will travel to Berlin next week at the invitation of Germany to negotiate the promotion of trade between the two countries. (Reuters, 5th)

Yugoslav Capital: The German economic delegation has been here for some time negotiating a commercial agreement with the Yugoslav government. The German side intends to order various raw materials and requests immediate delivery, but is unwilling to pay for the goods in cash, only promising to exchange them for military equipment and various machines "as soon as possible." This has not been accepted by the Yugoslav government, and current negotiations have encountered difficulties. The plenary meeting originally scheduled for the two delegations to be held within days has been postponed indefinitely. In addition, it is heard that the British Commercial Counselor has met with the Yugoslav Minister of Commerce, Drais, to inform him that his country is willing to purchase grain and raw materials from Yugoslavia. For this reason, the Yugoslav government's attitude towards Germany has become tougher. Germany fears that after the negotiations break down, Yugoslavia will contact Britain, and also because the Soviet Union may provide various raw materials under more favorable conditions, it is not eager to conclude an agreement with Yugoslavia. (Havas, 5th)

Paris: Well-informed sources here recently said that since the Soviet Union is putting pressure on the Baltic coastal countries and Germany is putting pressure on the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, there is a possibility that these countries may be forced to become war zones in a short period of time. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, according to information obtained from Rome, the Soviet government has concentrated 600 aircraft and 20 army divisions in the Kunlun area on the border with Latvia. In addition, in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty it signed with Estonia, the Soviet government originally intended to send troops to strategic locations in that country, but it sent troops before that country ratified the treaty. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also made demands on Finland for certain privileges for certain ports in that country. Judging from this, the Soviet Union intends to maintain strategic bases on the Baltic coast, and the more the better. As far as Germany is concerned, it is heard that the German government has sent a strongly worded note to the Norwegian government, demanding that it supply the country with certain goods, otherwise it will send aircraft to bomb it. The threatening methods it has taken against neutral countries can be seen from this. Regarding this, people in Sweden expect that Germany and the Soviet Union will soon force the Scandinavian Peninsula countries to stop trading with Britain and France and instead sell various goods to Germany and the Soviet Union. (Germany needs a part of the pig iron supplied from the Scandinavian Peninsula countries). These countries are extremely uneasy about this. However, responsible officials in Paris still said that Germany and the Soviet Union's strategies are bound to fail. (Havas, 5th)

### German Submarine Sinks Greek Ship; French Submarine Captures German Ship; Estonian Ship Detained by Germans

London. The Greek steamship "Taimantis" was sunk today by a German submarine in British waters, 60 miles from the coast. All crew members have been rescued. (4th, Havas dispatch)

London. Twenty-eight crew members of the Greek steamship "Taimantis," which was sunk by a German submarine, who escaped danger were landed last night by the submarine at Ventley Bay in Kent County. It is reported that five members of the local militia witnessed the submarine submerging into the sea, but were unable to detain it. The rescued individuals were confined to the submarine for 36 hours. It is said that the Germans treated them well. Six of them require hospital treatment, but their conditions are not severe. (4th, Reuters dispatch)

London. Responsible sources here claim that in the past week, only 836 tons of British ships have been sunk by the Germans. The German claim that a British merchant ship rammed a German submarine is entirely unfounded. They also deny that the British authorities have used submarines in the current conflict. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

London. A German ship of 8,000 tons, which was loading iron ore in Luleå, Sweden, recently entered a minefield near the island of Borkum in the East Frisian Islands of German territory in the North Sea. It is reported that it struck a mine and sank. The fate of the crew is unknown. However, the Germans have now seized the Estonian ship "Järni" to compensate for this loss. According to a Gothenburg, Sweden, newspaper, the "Järni" was carrying lumber to Antwerp, Belgium, when it was seized near Visby by a German destroyer and taken to a German port. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Danzig, a large coal ship flying the Finnish flag was seen aground on the outer beach of Jäschke Island yesterday, refusing assistance, giving the impression that it was a German ship and that there may be detained crew members on board. (5th, Reuters)

Paris. It has been learned that the French submarine that captured a German cargo ship yesterday and brought it back to a French port traveled over a thousand miles, which is a remarkable achievement for a submarine. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Copenhagen, Denmark. Cannon fire was heard yesterday off the western coast of Denmark. It is generally believed that this was due to a naval battle near the German island of Heligoland. (5th, Havas News Agency dispatch)

Stockholm, Sweden. After repeated violations of territorial waters by German submarines, the Swedish government has decided to form a fleet to patrol the coast. This fleet includes one battleship, two destroyers, two submarines, and several smaller warships. The naval authorities have also borrowed one hundred merchant ships from various shipping companies, equipped them with weapons, and ordered them to assist in searching within territorial waters. (5th, Havas dispatch)

Copenhagen, Denmark. The "National Daily" here recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that several Danish ships detained by the Germans will be released after confiscating the cargo they carry. German officials also confirmed that if the British contraband list is not revised, Germany will launch an "economic war" with all its strength, regardless of the impact on neutral countries. (5th, Havas dispatch)

Berlin. Political figures here, commenting on Germany's intensification of economic warfare against Britain, stated that Germany's adoption of this measure was not proactive, but was forced as a response. Germany is willing to engage in fair warfare. Germany's chivalrous conduct in the first month after the outbreak of the war can prove this, and the statements of neutral observers can also be cited as sufficient evidence. The new action by the British Admiralty to arm merchant ships is an extreme violation of the laws of maritime warfare in international law. Merely arming merchant ships cannot be regarded as converting them into warships, but the direct order from the British Admiralty to attack German warships has blurred the distinction between combatant and non-combatant. Therefore, Germany has a need to intensify economic warfare. (5th, Haitong dispatch)

London. The Information Department recently issued a communiqué stating that in the week from the 23rd to the 30th of last month, a total of 33,000 tons of various contraband goods destined for Germany were intercepted by British warships. In total, the number of contraband goods intercepted in the four weeks since the start of the war has reached 289,000 tons. (4th, Havas dispatch)

### Daladier Signs Agreement with Czech Envoy; Stipulates Formation of Czech Army in France

### Western Front; Intermittent Artillery Battles Between Two Armies; Germans Evacuate Civilians from Various Border Towns; French Aircraft Reconnaissance Work Very Successful

Paris. The General Headquarters issued communiqué No. 61, stating, "Our advanced units are constantly patrolling in various locations on the front lines. The enemy once attempted to advance south of Bemasans City but was repelled by our army. In addition, one of our submarines intercepted an enemy merchant ship somewhere at sea and ordered it to sail to one of our ports." (4th, Havas dispatch)

Paris. The General Headquarters issued communiqué No. 62, stating, "Artillery battles occurred intermittently in several places on the front lines last night." (5th, Havas dispatch)

Paris. The General Headquarters issued a communiqué regarding the results of air combat over the past month, stating that in September, a total of eight of our pursuit aircraft were shot down, and a total of thirty German pursuit aircraft were shot down. In addition, our aircraft have repeatedly conducted reconnaissance work and have been very successful, taking thousands of photographs. The enemy's anti-aircraft batteries and air force were unable to prevent this. As a result, the construction situation of the Siegfried Line is fully known to our military staff. As for German aircraft, they have not yet conducted reconnaissance flights within our country. (4th, Havas dispatch)

London. Military critics here are gradually adopting the view that the German army will take the road through the Netherlands to attack. The news that the German army is actively reinforcing the Siegfried Line opposite Belgium shows that they want to protect their left flank in this attack. Moreover, this is the only place where they can use the mechanized units and rapid attack tactics that have been very effective in Poland with the hope of success. According to an announcement by the Information Department today, the German Minister of Aviation, Göring, the Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, and other leaders of the National Socialist Party purchased a large amount of butter from Britain several months before the outbreak of the war. It is said that it was sent every week by an employee of a large wool export company from Bradford to the aforementioned leaders. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

Paris. The first group of French war correspondents is scheduled to go to the front lines tomorrow to report on the war. These people are all famous writers.

As for foreign journalists, except for a few reporters from British and American newspapers, they are not allowed to enter or leave the war zone. (5th, Havas dispatch)

### French Parliament Declares Recess; To Prevent Communist Activities; Many Communist Deputies to be Arrested

Paris. Since the government announced the temporary recess of the Parliament, people in the lounges of the Senate and the House of Representatives have unanimously praised it, and said that many Communist deputies will soon be arrested, and their arrest warrants have already been issued. (5th, Havas)

Paris. After the cabinet held a State Council meeting yesterday morning, the government gazette published an order today stipulating that the Parliament should be adjourned immediately. Political figures commented on this, saying that this move is extremely important. Although the government dissolved the Communist Party on the 26th of last month, the privileges enjoyed by the party's members of Parliament are still valid. According to the Constitution, this privilege is limited to the parliamentary session. Once the session ends, it will immediately lose its effect. Now that the Parliament has been adjourned, the privileges enjoyed by the deputies will be automatically canceled, and the government can punish them in accordance with ordinary laws when necessary. The authorities have also, at the request of the military authorities, begun investigating the activities of the party's deputies. If the deputies are found to have formed a new party under a false name, they will be brought to justice. However, the temporary adjournment of Parliament does not stop its activities, and the government can still convene it at any time, which should be in the second half of November. The full powers enjoyed by the government will then expire, and the Parliament will have to be asked to re-pass the Full Powers Act. (5th, Havas dispatch)

Paris. The municipal halls of various towns in the Seine Province, which are presided over by members of the Communist Party, have been ordered to be dissolved by the Ministry of the Interior, and new municipal halls have been appointed to exercise their functions on their behalf.

The Hague. The British Dominions Secretary, Eden, declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the Dominions of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand will each send a representative to London to discuss with the British government methods of cooperation during this war. Political figures said that after the ministers of the Dominions arrive in London, their title will be representatives, but in reality, it will be similar to the Imperial Defense Conference during the World War, indicating that England and its four Dominions have unanimously cooperated in preparing for long-term operations. (4th, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

### Deposits in Bank for International Settlements Again Decline

Basel. The Bank for International Settlements issued its monthly report today, stating that its deposits have declined again due to withdrawals during the war. The bank announced today that the meeting of the board of directors of central banks, scheduled for October 9, has been postponed indefinitely. The reason was not stated. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

### US Bomber Squadron Patrols Over Fiji; Submarine Squadron to Arrive in Manila Within Month; Chongqing Newspaper Praises US Navy as Stabilizing Force in the Far East

Manila. Fourteen bombers that arrived here earlier from Hawaii, from today, five of them have started flying to familiarize themselves with the terrain, while patrolling the skies over the Philippines. These aircraft are currently based at Cañacao Bay across from Manila Bay. The aircraft carrier "Langley" is also anchored there. In addition, six US submarines sent here for reassignment are expected to arrive here within this month. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)

Washington. Reliable sources claim that twelve US Navy bombers patrol the Caribbean Sea from the United States to northern South America "from dawn to dusk" every day. US Navy officials neither confirmed nor denied this. It is widely believed that this patrol is the first step in establishing a "security belt" around Panama. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing. Chinese sources here believe that the US Navy's strong presence in the Pacific is a stabilizing force in the Far East situation. Although Japan's continental expansion policy has not achieved much to date, if there were no US power to control it in the Pacific, Japan might expand southward and shake the position of Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies. In the previous Great War, the United States focused on Europe. In the current Great War, the United States is focusing on Japanese aggression. In short, as long as the US Far East policy does not change, Japan will never be able to realize its ambitions. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)

### President of Japanese Seiyukai Party Nakajima Attacked; Bullets Miss; Assailant Escapes

Tokyo. Nakajima Chikuhei, the president of the reform faction of the Seiyukai Party, was shot at by someone with a gun near his home at around 8 p.m. on the 4th when he was returning home in a car. Two bullets hit the front of the car. Nakajima was unharmed. The perpetrator escaped. The authorities are investigating his whereabouts. (4th, Domei dispatch)

### US Senate Continues Debate on Neutrality Act Amendment; Senator Johnson Suggests Mediating the War

Washington. The Senate continued to debate the Neutrality Act amendment today. Senator Connally, a Democrat, gave a speech in support of the amendment proposed by the government, saying that if the arms embargo is not lifted, Germany could easily use it as an excuse to sink American merchant ships. He also said that US defense, both naval, land and air, must be strengthened. In addition, Republican Senator Vandenberg, a key isolationist, insisted on maintaining the arms embargo. (4th, Havas dispatch)

Washington. Senator Tom Connally, yesterday moved in the Senate, advocating that the government's Neutrality Act amendment be sent back to the Foreign Relations Committee for reconsideration, so that the committee divides the "cash and carry" clause into two parts, and then returns it to the Senate for discussion. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)

Washington. Senator Johnson, a Democrat from Colorado, proposed yesterday in the Senate, asking President Roosevelt to cooperate with the leaders of various neutral countries to bring about an "immediate ceasefire" in Europe. Johnson said this is the best time to mediate in the current situation, and other neutral countries are waiting for the United States to initiate it first. This proposal has been submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)

Washington. Republican Senator Johnson submitted a draft resolution to the Senate, requesting President Roosevelt to join with various neutral countries to mediate and urge the European belligerent countries to stop the war immediately. Diplomatic figures here commented on this, saying that only the President and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have the right to initiate this matter. Johnson's actions are a kind of strategy, even if it leads to victory achieved by violence being recognized. (4th, Havas dispatch)

Washington. While the Senate continued to debate the government's Neutrality Act today, Republican Senator Johnson introduced a resolution asking President Roosevelt to join other neutral countries in urging an immediate ceasefire in Europe. Democrat Connally, who had previously opposed the government on various domestic issues, now supports the government's new Neutrality Act, saying that if the arms embargo and restrictions on American shipping are not lifted, Germany will soon sink American merchant ships. Republican Vandenberg opposed lifting the arms embargo, saying that this action is a non-neutral act, and if this habit is cultivated, other non-neutral acts will easily follow, such as the United States scheming many things outside the war to assist those it favors, and ultimately being drawn into the war. (4th, Reuters dispatch)

Washington. Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement today, saying that the US government does not recognize unlimited interference with the legality of American merchant ships. At the same time, Hull warned American merchant ships of the special dangers of sailing into the vicinity of belligerent waters. (4th, Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Cabinet Establishes Ministry of Trade; Storm in Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Director of Commercial Affairs Bureau Matsushima Resigns; Foreign Minister Nomura Criticized by Subordinates

Tokyo. After the Cabinet decided to establish a Ministry of Trade to absorb the Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a bizarre situation has occurred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Matsushima, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Bureau, angrily resigned yesterday morning, saying that if the ship does not listen to the captain, then the captain can only leave the ship. As a result, the six section chiefs and several junior officials of the Commercial Affairs Bureau also resigned one after another. Then, 150 senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting to discuss this situation for a long time, and finally decided to ask Foreign Minister Nomura to attend the meeting at 5:15 p.m. yesterday to question him, criticizing him for betraying his faith in supporting the establishment of the Ministry of Trade and demanding his resignation. However, Nomura's attitude was firm and he did not accept the request, saying that implementing national policy is to prioritize the unity of the cabinet. The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then requested that important political and economic diplomacy should be unified under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and passed a resolution stating that all directors and secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are united and firmly opposed to the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. The government now believes that this turmoil is an internal matter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again convened a meeting today to consider protesting to Prime Minister Abe. (5th, Reuters News Agency dispatch)

Tokyo. All section chiefs and administrative officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting in the conference room at 8 p.m. on the 4th, advocating opposition to the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. It was resolved that each department and bureau should elect one section chief representative and one administrative official representative to form an executive committee to carry out the opposition movement, and the meeting would not disperse until the goal was achieved. After the meeting, the following declaration was issued: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not opposed to the establishment of the Ministry of Trade. For the sake of completing the current general mobilization system, it originally advocated the establishment of a strong industrial trade ministry or economic ministry that included the production and distribution sectors. However, now that diplomacy is not unified - political diplomacy and economic diplomacy - but implements a unified diplomacy, it is absolutely impossible to deal with the difficult international situation. Therefore, we firmly oppose the Ministry of Trade directly participating in diplomatic work, and firmly believe that the organic union of political diplomacy and economic diplomacy can realize the development of overseas trade. Thus, an attempt was made to establish a powerful industrial trade ministry to strengthen a unified diplomacy externally, and to unify trade, production, distribution and other sectors internally to promote Japan's economic development. However, the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade decided by the Cabinet this time not only failed to thoroughly include the production and distribution sectors, but also recognized that the Ministry of Trade could directly issue orders and direct affairs to overseas commercial officials and consuls general. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always advocated the unification of diplomacy, so all section chiefs and administrative officials must unanimously oppose the main points of the establishment of the Ministry of Trade decided this time. (5th, Domei dispatch)

Tokyo. The preparatory committee for the Ministry of Trade decided by the cabinet meeting on the 3rd held its first meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2 p.m. on the 5th. Chairman Karasawa and the various committee members attended. First, they discussed and reviewed the order and other administrative matters, and then proceeded with substantive deliberations. In addition, the new Ministry of Trade decided to transfer some of the affairs of the Commerce and Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Matsushima, the Director of the Commerce Bureau, submitted his resignation based on his position. Also, other foreign affairs officials opposed the new Ministry of Trade's organization. However, the government seems determined to implement it according to the established policy. Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura will also express their determination at the regular Councilors' meeting on the 5th, hoping to realize it in accordance with the cabinet decision. (5th, Domei dispatch)

### Berlin, Rome Report; Japan Withdraws from Anti-Comintern Pact; Tokyo Believes It Is a Misunderstanding

Tokyo. The reports from Berlin and Rome that Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura has announced his withdrawal from the Anti-Comintern Pact are unfounded. It is believed here that Germany and Italy are obviously spreading rumors based on Nomura's speech at the National Local Governors' Conference on October 2. Japanese sources claim that the Foreign Minister did not mention the Anti-Comintern Pact in his speech that day, but only said that negotiations to strengthen the tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact would be suspended due to the development of the European situation.

### Xinhua Daily News Comments; British Warships Withdraw

Chongqing. The CCP organ Xinhua Daily News commented today on the British naval authorities' withdrawal of five out of ten British gunboats from the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou, saying that this decision may have a major significance for the future development of the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese must carefully consider this matter. Given the outbreak of the European War, the withdrawal of British gunboats is naturally expected. What the Chinese should pay attention to is not the withdrawal of the gunboats themselves, but the gradual withdrawal of British power from the Far East and the subsequent changes in British Far East policy. Britain has huge interests in the Far East, but since the outbreak of the European War, these interests have been under very strong pressure, and therefore it has compromised with Japan in the hope of protecting its interests. However, history has proven the repeated errors of British Far East policy. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1894 helped Japan defeat China, and as a result, Japan, a second-rate country, became a first-rate country in the Far East. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 resulted in Japan defeating old Russia. Although the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished due to American opposition, its spirit has occupied an important part in British Far East policy from the Mukden Incident in 1931 to the present. Japan is determined to eliminate the interests of third countries in China. Britain is well aware of this, but since the Mukden Incident, Britain has consistently adopted a policy of compromise with Japan. It can now be frankly said that if one believes that Britain is helping China to resist Japanese aggression, it is more accurate to say that Britain hopes that Japanese aggression in China will end within a certain limit. For many years, the British government's efforts have been largely devoted to this goal. China is indeed unfortunate, but Britain is also unfortunate, and its rights and prestige have become sacrifices of this policy. British rulers do not want a strong and independent China. The talk about reopening Anglo-Japanese talks clearly indicates the path that events will follow. We now want to warn Britain that Japan's policy of expelling third countries' rights in China will never change. No matter what kind of compromise Britain makes, it will not affect China's determination to continue resisting Japan. Furthermore, Britain and Japan cannot solve the problem of the Far East alone. At the same time, we hope that the British people will prevent their government from casting the same mistakes it made in Europe, and we hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to the international conspiracy currently underway in the Far East.

### US Gunboat Docked in Chongqing Damaged in Collision

Chongqing. The US gunboat "Tutuila," docked in Chongqing, was struck by a ferryboat in heavy fog yesterday. It is expected to be repaired in the city within a few weeks. The ferryboat was swept away by the rapids of the Yangtze River and collided with the "Tutuila," creating a hole four feet wide and nearly ten feet high in the hull. There were no casualties. However, two people on the ferryboat were knocked overboard and were quickly rescued by nearby sailboats. Sailors on the gunboat immediately began pumping water. Fortunately, an engineer who previously worked at the Shanghai company that built the ship is now in Chongqing. After inspecting the damage, he expressed the opinion that the ship could be repaired in the city without much difficulty. (5th, Reuters dispatch)

### News from Northern Jiangsu: Fierce Fighting in Guanyun's Yangji for Five Days and Nights; Chinese Troops in Xuzhou Approaching the Suburbs; Japanese Invasion of Huai'an Foiled; Puppet Troops in Yangzhou Under Japanese Surveillance

Taixian Correspondence: In recent days, there have been repeated clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops in various counties in northern Jiangsu. A summary follows:

Guanyun: On the night of September 18th, the Guanyun Regular Brigade fiercely attacked the Japanese troops in Yangji. The next day, when they attacked the fort, platoon leader Zhang Tongfeng and more than 20 soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves in a mine explosion. Nine Japanese soldiers were killed or captured alive. The remaining Japanese troops continued to resist from a blockhouse. After five days and nights of stalemate, the entire town of Yangji was reduced to scorched earth. On the 22nd, three Japanese planes escorted approximately 200 Japanese soldiers to reinforce Xiangshuikou, Xinpu, Banpu, and Dayishan. Except for the Japanese troops at Dayishan, who were blocked by Chinese troops, the rest had entered Yangji fort and attempted to cut off the Chinese troops' retreat. On the 23rd and 24th, Japanese planes bombed the Chinese troops in shifts, forcing the Chinese troops to retreat to their original positions.

Haizhou: Japanese planes have been unusually active in Haizhou recently. On the 21st, they dropped three or four bombs at Zhangjiadian and Longrong. On the 22nd, they dropped three or four bombs at Xiaoyao. They dropped more than 20 bombs near Tongxingji Longwokou, and more than 10 bombs in Xin'an Town. On the 24th, they dropped more than 10 bombs near Yangji and five or six bombs near Tanggou Tangjian. Despite the activity of Japanese planes, the morale of the Chinese soldiers and civilians remains extremely high.

Ganyu: After the Ganyu Chinese Army Regular Brigade occupied Ganyu County, they captured a significant amount of Japanese light and heavy weaponry. When they subsequently attacked Huandunbu, the Japanese troops suffered heavy losses. However, they failed to firmly occupy Shahe Town due to the arrival of Japanese reinforcements.

Xuzhou: In the Xuzhou area, there have been frequent clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops recently. Fierce fighting occurred on the 17th and 20th, with four Japanese soldiers killed and more wounded. Therefore, Japanese troops are heavily stationed inside and outside the city and around the railway station to prevent Chinese troops from launching a surprise attack. However, the Chinese troops are distributed in various villages, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Furthermore, a unit of the Chinese Army's general brigade arrived near Xuzhou to monitor the movements of the Japanese troops and launch a counter-offensive.

Huai'an: The Japanese troops in Huai'an have been scheming to invade the south, but have not succeeded. At approximately 8:00 AM on September 24th, a combined Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery force of more than 200 men advanced towards Huafangtou, Handong, and Shazhuang. They first bombarded the area with heavy artillery, followed by machine-gun fire. The Chinese troops also bravely resisted. However, the Japanese troops resorted to inhumane tactics, releasing tear gas. To avoid the gas, the Chinese troops quickly retreated. As a result, the two locations were occupied by the Japanese troops. At 8:00 PM, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale counter-offensive while the Japanese troops were still consolidating their positions. The Chinese troops, with high morale, attacked from multiple directions. The Japanese troops, caught off guard, retreated into the city. Huafangtou and Shazhuang were recaptured by the Chinese troops. On the same day, the Japanese troops in Huai'an dispatched another unit of approximately 100 Japanese and puppet troops, with two small artillery pieces and four light and heavy machine guns, to Huangtu Bridge outside the east gate. After fierce resistance from the local self-defense forces, the Japanese troops used their superior firepower to launch a fierce attack and forcibly occupied the area, destroying more than a dozen civilian houses in retaliation. However, they were ambushed by Chinese troops and retreated back into the city.

Funing: On September 19th, Japanese troops in Funing dispatched more than 40 Japanese and puppet troops, with many light and heavy machine guns, to attack the Chinese troops' position at Xiaozhaoguan. They came into contact with the headquarters of the Chinese Regular Brigade stationed there. The Chinese troops resisted using fortified defenses, preventing the Japanese troops from succeeding, and forcing them to retreat back into the city. In this battle, one Japanese officer was killed. It is also reported that the Japanese troops in Funing are currently building 30 two-section boats, each section capable of being carried by two people. Their intentions are unclear.

Yangzhou: The Japanese troops in Xishan, having been ambushed by Chinese guerrilla units, are feeling uneasy. On the 22nd, 50 to 60 Japanese troops from Yangzhou reinforced Xishan, but the next morning, they returned to Yangzhou in the same two trucks. In addition, approximately 200 Japanese and puppet troops are stationed at Xiannvmiao. Puppet troops are stationed as sentries, seven or eight at each location, at Touerdiao Bridge and Sanyuan Bridge Jiangjia Bridge. Japanese troops also send out sentries to monitor the puppet troops. Furthermore, a Japanese shallow-water warship is patrolling the Xian Shao River to protect bridges and waterways and prevent sabotage by Chinese troops.

### Jianghua Troops Requested to Launch Night Attack; Japanese and Puppets Defending County Seat

Jingjiang Correspondence: Jingjiang is a small county in northern Jiangsu. Since being occupied by the Japanese and puppets, the city, which is only three miles in circumference, and the eighteen miles from the city to the Jiangbian of Bawai Port have been placed under their control. The other townships attached to the city are still under Chinese control. A small unit of Chinese troops attacked a puppet police station outside the west gate late at night. In the darkness, the two sides exchanged fire, resulting in casualties on both sides. Puppet Inspector Ni was also injured. Chinese mobile units often use various opportunities in the countryside to ambush Japanese and puppet troops, making it difficult for the Japanese and puppet troops to track them down. Therefore, they are only able to defend the small city and are unable to do anything else. Recently, a traitor named Cai Dekui was captured in Baiyi Town. He was shot for being a Japanese electrician. The Japanese and puppet troops, fearing the Chinese troops, have issued county resident certificates to all residents in the city and have organized them into baojia (a system of household registration and control). New residents whose names are not on the register are not allowed to receive certificates and are accused of being anti-Japanese elements. Therefore, the population of the city has not increased. Most residents live in the Huangju and Wumawei areas.

### Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, Harassed by Japanese Troops; Qian Junshi Dies for His Country

Wuxi Correspondence: Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, is near Taihu Lake. When the Chinese troops retreated westward the year before last, many people sought refuge there, regarding it as an isolated paradise. This spring, Qian Junshi, the district chief of the Tenth District, cooperated with the guerrillas to maintain order. Last month, it was suddenly reported that the Japanese military police from the urban area had sent more than 20 Japanese soldiers to the town to keep an eye on the guerrillas. To avoid sacrificing the town, the guerrillas did not take action. The Japanese troops soon retreated. On the afternoon of September 30th, more than 20 Japanese soldiers arrived in a boat at Caishentang, four or five miles from the town. Suddenly, there was intense gunfire from both sides of the river. The boatman was shot dead, and the boat capsized. At that time, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed, two were captured, and one escaped in the chaos and returned to the city to report. On the night of the 30th, a large force of Japanese and puppet troops arrived and surrounded Yangshuyuan, demanding the surrender of the perpetrators and the bodies of the Japanese soldiers. Qian Junshi led his troops to resist. The Japanese troops set fire to the town. Qian Junshi bravely took the lead and died after being shot several times. Later, Chinese reinforcements arrived and drove back the Japanese and puppet troops. However, before retreating, the Japanese and puppet troops took several townspeople with them. The town was burned down, and the town hall and the new altar were destroyed. The losses were immeasurable. Later, Chinese guerrillas extinguished the fire and collected Qian Junshi's body. The townspeople expressed their respect for Qian Junshi, who died with great spirit. However, all the residents of the town evacuated after hearing the alarm.

### Fujian Province Expands Winter Cultivation Campaign; Implements Grain Management Measures in Various Counties

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, Fujian Province has promoted winter cultivation to increase agricultural production and achieve self-sufficiency in food during wartime. However, the winter cultivation campaign in the sixth year was rushed due to time constraints, and publicity and guidance were not widespread. Therefore, the planting area of winter crops was only more than 2 million mu. By the seventh year, the winter cultivation area had increased to more than 3.2 million mu. This year's winter cultivation period is approaching again. The provincial government has decided to further expand the campaign. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Bureau has drafted a plan, divided into two steps: publicity and implementation. In terms of publicity, in addition to using various oral and written methods and various occasions, they will also use the universal National Monthly Meeting and wartime civil schools to lecture on winter cultivation issues to achieve greater results. In terms of implementation, in addition to mobilizing all farmers in the province to work hard in winter cultivation, they will also promote the participation of rural women, who account for half of the population. For winter cultivation loans, the Cooperation Affairs Administration under the Construction Department will coordinate the handling and has obtained the consent of the Provincial Bank to increase the loan amount. According to the wartime situation, the counties in the province are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A includes 16 coastal counties such as Wenhou, Type B includes 9 counties such as Shouning, and Type C includes 13 counties such as Nanping. This classification method is designed to concentrate grain production in the rear to avoid losses during the outbreak of war. The loan recipients are loyal farmers with farming ability, heads of households, with fixed addresses and cultivated land, whether they are members of the cooperative or not, can apply for loans. Cooperative members' loans are handled according to the credit loan method. Non-member loans should gather five to thirty people to form a cooperative winter cultivation group, which is introduced by the cooperative or guaranteed by a reliable guarantor. The interest rate on these loans is very low, and the repayment period is limited to six months. The amount that each person can borrow is three yuan in Type A counties, five yuan in Type B counties, and ten yuan in Type C counties. The selection of crops and the purchase of seeds will be properly guided by various cooperative instructors, and a seed committee will be organized to be responsible for handling them. The results of winter cultivation will be reported by the supervisory committees of each county, according to the cultivated area, location, crop type, and quantity filled in the loan contract, and reported to the Cooperation Bureau for record. The responsibility for agricultural technical guidance and loan collection will be handled by the Cooperation Affairs Bureau, assisted by the Agricultural Improvement Office and the county governments.

The Fujian Provincial Government recently implemented grain management to ensure food self-sufficiency and prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling, hoarding, and speculating. According to the method, each county uniformly organizes a grain management committee. Before the early and late rice harvest each year, the local baojia chiefs will conduct a comprehensive survey of the number of mu of rice planted by the owners and farmers in the bao, and estimate their harvest, filling out a form and reporting it to the district office, which will report it to the county grain management committee for verification. The owner's family should report the actual harvest quantity to the local baojia chief within one week after the harvest, filling out a form and reporting it to the district office, which will forward it to the county grain management committee. The owner's family should also report the quantity of remaining rice in addition to the necessary consumption for the whole family to the baojia chief in charge, who will forward it to the district office, which will report it to the county grain management committee for record. If they want to sell it, they should report to the grain management committee, which will coordinate the sale according to the market price and must not sell it themselves. If the number of rice harvested by the owner's family is underreported or falsely reported, and they intend to hoard and speculate, hindering people's food supply, once discovered or reported, in addition to confiscating the underreported or falsely reported portion, they will be given appropriate punishment. If the baojia chief assists in concealing it, or takes the opportunity to engage in favoritism and fraud, they will also be punished according to law. The grain management committees of each county may also conduct surveys of the local grain situation and formulate wholesale and retail prices of rice and other grains on a weekly basis, submit them to the meeting for evaluation, and then present them to the local主管 government for announcement.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Increase in Tuition Fees for Western and Chinese Children's Schools; Western Schools to Increase by 25% Next Month; Chinese Schools to Increase by 15% Next Spring

The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the large increase in expenses required for the various schools established by the Council, held two meetings on the 15th and 29th of last month to consider the issue of increasing tuition fees. It was found that the educational expenses required this year were expected to exceed the amount stated in the budget by 340,000 national currency. If the current situation continues unchanged, the financial situation next year will be even more unfavorable. The summary of income and expenditure of the various Council-run schools is listed below:

Western Children's Schools

Tuition Income Expenditure

1938

195,555 yuan 741,845 yuan

1939 (Estimated)

910,677 yuan 994,757 yuan

1940 (Estimated)

--- yuan 1,066,000 yuan

Chinese Children's Schools

1939 (Estimated)

102,792 yuan 92,192 yuan

1940 (Estimated)

303,000 yuan 1,052,000 yuan

According to the above figures, the expenditure of each Western children's school next year will increase by 43.7% compared with last year, and the income will increase by 13%. The expenditure of each Chinese children's school next year will increase by 38.5% compared with last year, and the income will increase by 11.6%. The increase in expenditure of Western children's schools is greater, so the increase in tuition fees should also be greater. As for the method of increasing fees, it is appropriate to collect a certain percentage of surcharges. After detailed discussion by the Education Committee, it was resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve an increase in tuition fees for all Western children's schools by 25% from November 1st of this year, and for all Chinese children's schools by 15% from the spring of next year. The total surcharge can collect one million yuan per year. The above recommendations have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council at its regular meeting on the 4th of this month.

### Finance   Exporters Dumping Foreign Exchange in the Market, Immediately Recovers After Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: listed exchange rates did not fluctuate. The under-the-table market for British and American currencies stabilized slightly as various rumors in the market gradually dissipated. However, trading started soft in the morning due to weak selling interest from foreign banks. Subsequently, the Bank of England (on behalf of a certain group) absorbed heavily, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also followed suit. Although foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters were mutually supplying and dumping, positions were still difficult to allocate, causing the British pound to continue to tighten to 4 shillings and 3.75 pence, and the US dollar to also soften to 7.375 yuan. Later, as telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters continued to show strong selling interest, and the British merchant Sassoon also came to dump, the Bank of America (arbitrage on rupees) also had an oversupply, so the situation gradually recovered. The evening close for the British pound was still 4 shillings and a half, and the US dollar was 7.5625 yuan. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market, and trading was brisk throughout the day.

Heavy Absorption by Favorable Bank

At the beginning of the morning, the London cable indicated that near-term futures were down by 3.75 pence, and far-term futures were down by 4.375 pence. The New York silver price fell by 0.125. London raw gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates: British pound against US dollar and French franc were flat, against Shanghai down by 0.040625. US dollar against British pound up by 2.5 fen, against Shanghai down by 0.15 yuan, against French franc up by 0.875. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence for the British pound and 7.4375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was slightly tighter by 0.03125, while the US dollar was softer by 0.125, due to the increase in exchange rates. After opening, the Bank of England suddenly came to absorb heavily, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also absorbed slightly. Although foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and exporters came to supply, the foreign banks' supply interest was not smooth, resulting in a continued tightening situation. It is estimated that the Bank of England settled foreign telegrams, exporters, and current British pound from banks at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and 3.75 pence. Subsequently, it absorbed current US dollars from Hong Kong telegrams and foreign banks from 7.46875 yuan, softening to 3.75 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was revealed to be a small 0.5 fen. Afterwards, Hong Kong telegrams and exporters continued to dump, and the British merchant Sassoon also began to sell, so the situation turned strong. It is estimated that Sassoon, Hong Kong telegrams, and exporters successively dumped current British pounds to HSBC, Chase, and a certain foreign bank at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and a half penny, and current US dollars from 7.5 yuan up to 6.25 yuan. Near noon, transactions decreased, causing the situation to suddenly become calm. Extended to the noon close, the bank's current selling prices were 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence for the British pound and 7.5 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the morning opening, the British pound was flat and the US dollar recovered by 0.0625.

The Afternoon Market Turns Stable

In the afternoon market, as exporters resumed selling and HSBC's appetite weakened, the market continued to recover. It is estimated that exporters sold current British pounds to Favorable Bank at 4 shillings and a half penny, and sold current US dollars to foreign banks at 7.5625 yuan and 5.9375 yuan. Extended to the evening close, the bank's current selling prices were 4 shillings and a half penny for the British pound and 7.5625 yuan for the US dollar. This month's British pound was 4 shillings and 4.375 pence, and the US dollar was 7.4375 yuan. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the current British and American exchange rates were neither up nor down.

Hong Kong US Dollar Softens

Hong Kong, 5th Telegram: The exchange market was stable this morning. The British pound was unchanged, still opening at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 1 shilling and 9.6875 pence.

### Various Anxieties Dissipated: Gold Market Mediocre

Yesterday's spot gold under-the-table market, started high and then weakened, the trend hovering, but the daily fluctuations were slightly mediocre, the high and low difference only 50 yuan.  Because the previous day's unfounded rumors greatly subsided, in the early morning, a certain gold firm had a strong bullish mentality, relentlessly absorbing through heavy selling.  And foreign exchange tightened and softened, sellers watched and waited. The morning opened up to 4,080 yuan, then rose to a peak of 4,100 yuan because buying wind was still strong.  Subsequently, silver houses sold to jewelers, and securities firms dumped successively.  Furthermore, because foreign exchange changed from tight to soft, although a certain money exchange business still had an appetite, it was ultimately difficult to match. It once fell back to a low of 4,050 yuan. At noon, a certain gold firm resumed buying wind, raising it back to 4,085 yuan. The noon close was slightly weak at 4,077 yuan.  In the early afternoon, it was still flat.  After entering the afternoon, because the floating bulls of the day closed out, coupled with the continued recovery of foreign exchange, it fell to a closing price of 4,055 yuan, a small decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Total transactions were slightly lighter than the previous day, about a thousand taels.  Silver jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold etc. remained consistently stable.

Spot Gold Without Large Fluctuations

Since early opening, due to tight and soft foreign exchange, people's minds were firmly bullish, a certain gold firm urgently purchased on behalf of speculators, coupled with a lack of sellers at the time, the market opened high by 22 yuan. A certain gold firm acquired ten taels from the money exchange business at a price of 4,080 yuan. After opening, a certain gold firm's absorption was still strong, raising it by 20 yuan. The securities firm acquired twenty taels of gold at 4,100 yuan. At the time, silver houses frequently sold short, and gold firms no longer had an appetite, the market went downward. Soon after, it fell back by 30 yuan. A certain gold firm sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business bought on behalf of a client, and once rose again to 4,080 yuan. However, because foreign exchange changed from tight to soft, selling wind was strong again, securities firms and money exchange businesses etc. rushed to dump. Although certain two money exchange firms successively modified for customers, the position still felt generous, and immediately fell by 30 yuan. The securities firm sold ten taels to the money exchange business for 4,050 yuan. Thereafter, a certain gold firm resumed buying wind, and retail investors also took advantage of the low to absorb, and the situation immediately became firm, raising it by 35 yuan. A certain gold firm acquired thirty taels from the silver house at 4,085 yuan. The noon close was slightly lower, the money exchange business sold ten taels to the gold firm for 4,070 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm again acquired ten taels each from the silver house and peers for 4,077 yuan, as the noon closing price. The early afternoon opened slightly weak, making it smaller by 7 yuan, the money exchange business sold to the gold firm on two for 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm continued to absorb, recovering by 5 yuan, a certain gold firm acquired thirty taels from peers for 4,075 yuan. After entering the afternoon, foreign exchange became strong, and retail bulls closed out, coupled with a certain gold firm's appetite turning idle, it gradually retreated, and soon after it fell by 20 yuan. The money exchange businesses mutually transacted twenty taels for 4,055 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after closing, the money exchange business sold short twenty taels to a certain silver house on behalf of clients, at a price of 4,050 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 50 yuan. The selling price of the current gold firm's own gold brand was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and transactions were few.

Jewelry Unchanged Throughout the Day

Jewelry silver shops exchanged out per tael. Because spot gold did not fluctuate greatly, it did not change throughout the day.

Da Tong Hang still hung 410 yuan, and the new merchants’ prices were the same as above. The purchase prices were to be reduced by about 20 yuan.

Foreign Currencies All Unstable

Yesterday's foreign currencies fluctuated constantly with the exchange market, so they also fluctuated accordingly. For example, the US dollar bill initially rose to about 14 yuan, then retreated to 13.5 yuan, and finally to 13.6 yuan, a slight decrease of 5 fen. In addition, the British gold bill continued to rise by 0.5 yuan, the British pound also rose by 0.5 yuan, the American pound rose by 1 yuan, the Hong Kong bill rose by 5 fen, and the Japanese gold bill rose sharply, finally rising to 1.1385 yuan, an increase of 0.025 yuan. The demand for Korean bills was relatively rare, and as a result, it only rose slightly by 0.5 li. The other currencies were still stable.

### Small Denomination Notes Difficult to Exchange

Since the Central Bank of China issued small denomination notes in Shanghai, it has been generally believed that it can alleviate the pain of small transactions. Since the start of issuance on the 29th of last month, it has been more than a week, but the small denomination notes circulating in the market are still extremely rare. Peddlers and various shops still use substitute vouchers and tram tickets for small change, and because the acceptance of these types of vouchers is frequent, they are tattered and often cause disputes. The small ones not only lose convenience, but also increase the burden on life, and the large ones are related to the entire national monetary system. This is because the Central Bank does not set up exchange offices, so most shops and residents have nowhere to exchange them, and unified industry exchange makes them a rare commodity. One yuan notes can only be exchanged for 9 jiao, and recently some yuan can be exchanged for 9 jiao and 5 fen. It is said that the amount is too small and cannot meet the needs of the entire Shanghai, like a cart of firewood for a cup of water. Therefore, for the benefit of the majority, the Central Bank should increase the amount of issuance and entrust various banks and money shops to exchange them, so as to avoid congestion and benefit the people. This is the responsibility of those who regulate finance. (Sea)

### Securities: Bond Market Firm and Stable; Bulls Still Adding Positions

The under-the-table securities market situation yesterday was generally still hovering, but people's minds were extremely firm and bullish, and the market situation was quite firm and stable. Major bulls were only adding positions and not releasing them. The date for the lottery for Type C bonds was set for the 9th, and there were more buyers than sellers. It has been set for a long time that Type C bonds are above 6 yuan and Type E bonds are above 5 yuan. Whenever there is good news, it is easy to rise, and whenever there is bad news, it is only stagnant. And trading is extremely lively when rising, and it becomes quiet when falling, which shows the stability of people's minds. Since the interest rate for arbitrage of foreign exchange is weak, a considerable part has become wary of foreign banks due to the European war, and the target has shifted to the bond market. The capital is naturally strong, so the future trend should be easy to rise and difficult to fall. The process yesterday was first up and then down in the morning, and first stable and then firm in the afternoon. The momentum of buyers and sellers was dominated by buyers. As a result, except for Type C bonds which were unchanged, the rest were slightly better by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, and 96 bonds were also better by 0.15 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Shares Transaction: The Bank of China was transacted for 50 shares at a price of 53 yuan.

The Public Association of Industries also reported that yesterday's stock market was firm and stable in the morning, and turned hardened in the afternoon due to the new account's debut. Economic agents competed to buy various well-known speculative stocks, and Huidefeng and Rui Rong shares were given special treatment. The stocks of various holding companies (that is, those that invest in various stocks of other companies as one of the company's businesses), such as Shanghai Silver Company, Yangtze Silver Company, and International Trust Company, were also very active. Steel shares and China Reclamation shares also rose sharply. In fact, the prices of each share, except for rubber shares which were slightly neglected, were almost all involved in yesterday's rise. The market seems to have no room for both industrial shares and rubber shares at the same time. This is why interest sometimes pays attention to the former and neglects the latter, and sometimes turns to the latter, but neglects the former.

London, 4th Telegram: The listed prices of stocks of various Far Eastern British companies today still opened for Shanghai Waterworks and several others. The market was stable. Only Gula Keling Rubber shares fell back by 9 pence, to 15 shillings and 6 pence.

London, 4th Telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts today still opened for China-France American dollars and four others. The market was stable and unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Floating Longs Exit the Market, Yarn Market Turns Down; 10 Count Yarn Still Able to Support

Yesterday, the yarn market, which had suddenly seen an increase after the closing of the previous day, turned downwards because the rumors were unfounded and people's hearts were stable. At the same time, the actual demand of customer shops showed no sign of improvement. Therefore, the market atmosphere turned downwards, and the general floating longs, in view of the above situation, felt that the overall trend was difficult to reverse, and came out one after another. The market price changed from strong to weak. However, the hand-weaving industry in the inland Jiangzhe area has recently switched to purchasing Chinese yarn due to the high price of Japanese yarn, and the demand for cone yarn is also strong. 10-count coarse yarn can still support one step of the yarn market because the weather is getting colder and it is used to make flannel. Otherwise, the falling wind would be even more severe.

At the opening of the current yarn market in the morning, the remaining power of the previous day was continued, and the general customers cried out loudly, and the bargaining price was very expensive. The price of Shuangma stack increased by 10 yuan, to 740 yuan, and several packages were transacted. Only Shuangma spot goods, the customer shop had no purchasing volume, and the asking price was 766 yuan, but it was held for a long time and failed to be transacted. The rumor of the previous day has now collapsed without attack. Speculators sold short more times, and in a short while, it fell by 10 yuan, the price of the stack was 730 yuan, and the spot price was 752 yuan. The closing price was still weak. As a result, 1,365 packages were transacted in half a day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 10 yuan, Tiannv fell by 5 yuan, Shuangdiqiu fell by 1 yuan, and coarse yarn was also weak. The factory opened 400 packages of 20-count Jinhu cone yarn from Xinsheng Factory at a price of 770 yuan. It was found that 2,045 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Dajin yesterday, and 20 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amount of purchases from various customer shops is listed on the left:

Peers 740, Inland 510

Xiamen 10 Yunnan 5

Hong Kong 50 Jiangxi 20

Statistics 1,6

### Manufacturers Watch and Wait: Cotton Prices Still Not Loosened

The current cotton transaction is quiet. Chinese and foreign manufacturers are increasingly hesitant about raw material procurement due to the rising yarn prices. Therefore, transactions have greatly decreased, and peers are also in a peaceful state. However, there is still no hope of a surge in arrivals, so the selling price is difficult to excessively fall. However, the price of Indian cotton has greatly fallen, and the foreign exchange is tending to loosen. Although the calculation is not very smooth, it is much cheaper than the previous price. Japanese factories may have purchasing plans. If the purchases are implemented, Chinese cotton may be affected, and it is still unknown. The source of northern Jiangsu, Tonghua, is only 940 packages. Panzi Zhu has done business, and the current cotton has only reached a compromise with the peers. 120 packages of Taicang flower were priced at 154 yuan.

Another news: The foreign cotton transaction in the Shanghai port has been very dull recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. The foreign exchange was very calm yesterday. Although the factory's inventory of cotton is not very abundant, it is currently unwilling to take the risk of purchasing, fearing the recurrence of unfounded rumors and the sharp increase in foreign exchange. There have been many arrivals in Tongzhou recently, and the selling price of Bailuo District has a non-negligible impact.

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet but very firm in the early morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines, so the market was not active. Later, because of the strong short selling in the south, cotton prices slightly recovered at the close. As a result, they were mixed. The near-term fell by 4 pounds, and the far-term rose by 4 pounds. India Data Tong predicted a drop of 2 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool fell by 8 pence.

### Food: Fuxin Urges Delivery; Flour Prices Go Downstream From Now On; Benefit to People's Livelihood is Not Small

Flour: Yesterday, the downward trend was frequent, because both local and customer sales were flat. Although the north and south shops took on purchasing, the transactions were sporadic. The local street sales, because the factory disk still needs 7 yuan, it is difficult to purchase smoothly. In addition, the Japanese flour sellers were full, and the floating shorts were dumped. The Phoenix brand in October only sold for 6.5 yuan. The stack goods of the local factory were also subject to strict urging from the factory, and the incident of Fuxin factory collecting loss fees has not yet been changed. Therefore, the market is still unsustainable, and the price has fallen by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. It is heard that the red and blue car and Fuxin brands have opened at 6.7 to 6.8 yuan. 36,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday, and 1,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong today.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat was not much, and the production prices in various places have not been relaxed. The sellers are also unwilling to easily sell off. However, the factories need less raw materials because the flour market is not active, and the traders are only paying attention to second-class goods because the prices are too high. Tongshi Shan Fuxin factory purchased more than 1,000 packages of wheat from Changxi Suyou, priced at 9.86 yuan, and the traders purchased more than 10 cars of wheat from Sukun Guantian, priced at 109.33 yuan. The market is slightly firm.

### New Early Rice Fell Sharply: Sharpness Has Entered the 20 Yuan Mark

Since the new goods from various districts arrived in large quantities, the prices have fallen every day. Yesterday, the falling wind was even more intense. The new goods from Changzhou, Sukun Fengjia and other places continued to arrive in 5,600 packages, and at the same time, the new goods from Changxi Songjiang Nangang and other places have already been harvested and should be on the market. However, due to transportation problems, they have not been seen in the market. Therefore, the people in the industry have been watching and not purchasing. Yesterday, people's minds became more and more discouraged. All the customer traders once again asked for a price reduction to sell off. Local customers also changed their attitude and would not purchase unless it was cheap. The market continued to fall all the way until the close and was not stabilized. As a result, the prices of each were reduced by 12 yuan. The new early rice fell sharply, and the giant was pouring down 34 yuan. Yanglu was devalued by about 1 yuan. The sharp points of each customer also fell by 12 yuan. The second-grade sharp points have entered the 20 yuan mark. The Chang broken opened at 41 yuan, the middle at 38 yuan, the Xi broken at 40 yuan, and the middle second at 378 yuan. The Su Tong was at 367 yuan, the new early rice was at 35 yuan, the Changzhou new early rice was at 378 yuan, and the Fengjing hundred was at 334 yuan. The new Yang tip was particularly priced at 26 yuan, the high was at 25.5 yuan, and the second was at 24.5 yuan. The Lu tip was at 27.3 yuan to 27 yuan. The Jiangbei tip was at 21 yuan, the second was at 20 yuan, the broken tip was at 20 yuan to 19.5 yuan, and the Bian Yuan was at 33 yuan. More than 5,000 packages were transacted in the Tongshi.

Another News: In the midst of the arrival of rice from the customer market, the situation has gradually declined. Yesterday, after the new early rice and new early rice fell by 356 yuan, the market for customer rice was even more difficult to sustain. Although the low prices attracted inquiries, the storage was more than enough to meet demand, and the Wushan Japanese also put out a large number of rice. Yesterday, the high-end meter had already fallen into the 20 yuan mark, and the second-grade Wushan and Jiangbei rice were all less than 20 yuan. Brown rice was also only 189 yuan, which was less than 1 yuan than the previous market.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Continues to Rise and Increase; Actual Sales Only Handled on the Local Street

Yesterday's soybean oil market, under the sudden and intermittent source, most people's minds were generally good, causing its selling plate to show a new peak. However, the actual sales of various shops were delayed, and only the local street was handling it. Although the market continued to rise by 0.45 yuan yesterday, its potential was quite strong. A total of 30 barrels of Kobe oil were transacted. The price was listed in the foreign market price column. 50 pieces of Yanshi oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, and 50 pieces of Qingxi oil. Peanut oil was purchased continuously for Hong Kong sales, and the market was mediocre. Yesterday, 700 cans of Yantai canned raw oil were opened at a price of 75.5 yuan.

The Necessity of Tonifying Weak Husbands in Autumn to Avoid Falling into Life's Tragic Situation!

The body is our living treasure. Wealth, status, knowledge, and reputation are certainly valuable, but without a body, what is there? Therefore, those who are good at cultivating life can be slightly slower to get rich and need not rush to become officials. If the body is weak, it is essential to tonify it first. Once the body is healthy, there will be many opportunities to seek wealth and honor. Even if one does not seek glory and retreats to their home, being a loving and affectionate couple, growing old together, having many children and grandchildren, and a harmonious family, what happiness that is!

There are many reasons why a husband's body becomes weak, but it is mostly due to early self-abuse, seminal emission, early marriage with excessive indulgence, or multiple wives and excessive lewdness, which exhausts the reproductive gland fluid, the source of life. This leads to brain weakness, insomnia, poor memory, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and various other symptoms. Such sick husbands will inevitably shrink back from difficulties and miss opportunities. Even if they get good opportunities, they will feel unable to cope due to a lack of energy! In marital life, they will be weak and incompetent, either appearing briefly like a flash in the pan or completely unable to perform sexually, sacrificing their wives' youth. Some wives with gentle temperaments become depressed and ill as a result, while stronger ones may have affairs or elope due to loneliness. It is common to see wives openly suing their husbands for divorce!

Do not fall into life's tragic situation because of weakness! This is the only essential meaning of why weak men need tonification. I now say this with certainty: After the weather turns cooler in autumn, our bodies undergo a natural astringent action. This is called "autumn harvest and winter storage." Therefore, it is easier to absorb tonics at this time. Also, after the labor of spring, summer, and early autumn, as well as the consumption of the hot summer, even a healthy person needs tonification at this time. However, although tonics are beneficial to the body, they should not be taken randomly. If one has brain weakness and takes digestive aids, not only will the brain weakness remain, but the natural ability to digest will also decrease. Therefore, tonification must be targeted and effective. Regarding the various weakness symptoms mentioned above, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Reproductin," a preparation made from the reproductive gland extracts of strong animals, is the most effective and targeted. Because this preparation is valuable in quality and effective, it has long been highly praised and is unmatched by any similar mixed spleen preparations. Moreover, it is peaceful in nature, without any side effects such as exciting the nerves or stomach, and is purely a positive and constructive tonic. After taking it, it can exert five major functions within one day and night: nourishing the brain and blood, producing essence and strengthening the kidneys, and nourishing the nerves. Continued use can also promote development and adjust metabolism, and it will surely cure various symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use can also benefit longevity and rejuvenation. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" (available at Wing On, Sincere, Western drugstores, and Wuzhou Chinese and Western drugstores) to consolidate the seminal gate and stop leakage, so that the effect will be quick!

### Untreated Seminal Emission Will Make It Difficult to Be a Husband

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

A great man stands upright, strives for progress, and makes achievements. This is what every man should do. However, to be a great man, one must have the qualifications to be a great man. The qualification is nothing other than having a strong physique, a smart mind, and abundant energy. Only then can one learn tirelessly, with knowledge and skills surpassing others. Encountering opportunities and striving to make achievements will be envied by friends. At the same time, such men must be ideal partners for women, often finding favor in love and marrying a satisfactory wife. After marriage, life will naturally be filled with love, and having sons and daughters will bring immense happiness!

However, if a man, due to youthful ignorance or being tempted by a bad environment, or willingly falling into depravity, commits the bad habit of self-abuse; or is infatuated with brothels and indulges in early years; or is forced by an outdated family to marry early and damage his body; or does not know hygiene, worries and overworks, and becomes imbalanced after illness; all of these are enough to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the seminal gate, and lead to seminal emission. Seminal emission is common among young people, and if it can be cured immediately, there is no significant harm. But if it is delayed and untreated, it will be extremely dangerous! Because the semen in the human body, the so-called reproductive gland fluid, functions to promote development, adjust metabolism, and nourish the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves. If the semen is exhausted due to seminal emission and indulgence, then brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, dreams, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, and various other symptoms will arise. As a result, energy will be exhausted, work will be ineffective, learning will not progress, and one will be abandoned by society! In marital life, one will inevitably be dissatisfied with his wife, and tragedies will be staged in the family. Wouldn't this make it difficult to be a husband? If a man cannot be a husband, his life will be in vain! Therefore, self-abuse and indulgence must be strictly prohibited. If you have seminal emission, seek treatment quickly. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" is the most effective. After taking this preparation, it can immediately consolidate the seminal gate and calm the nerves, achieving the effect of sleep and stopping seminal emission that night. Those who already have the above symptoms must also take "Reproductin," a preparation made from reproductive gland extracts, to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continued use will surely cure various symptoms in a short period of time and make the body healthier. If patients can come to my clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors and receive new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty and Health

### The Sorrow of the Large-Breasted Girl

— Yao Chongjing, American Medical Doctor

Beauty and health are a woman's second life, and we have not overstated the truth. In a male-dominated society, although women strive for liberation, the constraints imposed by physiology and economics are unavoidable. However, women also have a divinely bestowed and ingenious ability to captivate men, and that is feminine beauty and health. Why do so many men bow down at the pomegranate skirt? Why do so many husbands' souls get occupied by their beloved wives? Why does the authority of the teacher's wife, wife, and young mistress surpass that of the teacher, old man, and young master? Isn't this because the beauty and health of women's bodies and appearances, using the mellow wine of love, intoxicate the minds and bodies of men? Indeed, a woman who grows up with a slender figure, high breasts, and full hips naturally exudes the beauty of curves. At the same time, such women's ovarian function must be sound, so their blood is full and their cheeks are rosy. When she smiles and welcomes people, how can men's hearts not be intoxicated by her? Therefore, she will surely be able to choose a satisfactory husband in the love field, and after marriage, the couple will be loving, have sons and daughters, and the family will be happy! However, if a woman suffers from menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, infertility, or other hidden diseases, her ovarian function will be destroyed, so her breasts will not develop well, or those that have developed well will gradually atrophy. Her hips will also be thin, her blood will be deficient, and her complexion will be pale or sallow. Even more, brain decay, insomnia, back pain, mental fatigue, and other symptoms will arise. Such women cannot attract men's hearts, fall into a tragic situation in love, or even be infertile, age prematurely, and die young! To seek remedy, according to world-renowned gynecologists and my experience, taking "Reproductin" for women, an ovarian preparation, is the most effective. This preparation can regulate menstruation, stop leukorrhea, and cure hidden diseases within 24 hours after taking it. Regular use can also enhance ovarian function and adjust metabolism, which can make the breasts erect, the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty and health.

### British Ambassador Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing, This Trip Is To Contact Chinese Authorities and Will Meet Chiang Kai-shek Regularly

Since Germany and the Soviet Union advanced into Poland one after another, the European situation has changed unpredictably. The British government has repeatedly clarified its policies and attitudes towards the current situation in Europe through Prime Minister Chamberlain. At the same time, the British government has repeatedly stated that the European situation does not affect Britain's past policies towards the Far East and that it will continue to support China's economic relations. British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr visited Chongqing last time to meet with the central authorities and Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang. He returned to Shanghai via Gulangyu on May 29 after completing his official duties. After staying for three months, due to many changes in the situation in Europe and Asia, he left Shanghai and set off for Chongqing yesterday morning. The details are as follows:

Pre-departure Remarks

Ambassador Clark Kerr boarded the British Changxing Company's Empress of Russia at 1:00 yesterday morning and set off for Hong Kong. British diplomatic officials in Shanghai all went to the pier to see him off. The ambassador traveled with a simple entourage and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong in seven days. He plans to transfer to a British warship and transfer to Haiphong, and take a plane to Chongqing. The ambassador's itinerary this time is simpler than the previous decision to drive to the mainland by car. When the ambassador was about to leave, the reporter went to visit him. He said in a very natural and leisurely manner that this trip was only a routine visit to the Chinese government authorities, because he had the mission of an envoy and had to contact the Chinese authorities frequently. However, the general public believes that at a time when the situation in Europe and Asia is very turbulent, the ambassador's trip seems to have something noteworthy. According to another source, after the ambassador arrives in Chongqing, he will have discussions with US Ambassador to China Johnson, who is currently staying in Chongqing. The location of his meeting with Chiang Kai-shek will be determined at that time. The ambassador will stay in Chongqing for one month before returning to Shanghai.

### The Truth About the Stalled Negotiations on the Western Shanghai Issue: The Issue of Police Power Seems Easier to Resolve, The Pseudo-Regime Is Determined to Interfere With the Collection of Taxes

Yesterday afternoon, a certain official of the concession told reporters that the intrusion of pseudo-police into the road construction area outside the boundary, the unauthorized deployment of outposts and patrols, and the directing of traffic can no longer be regarded as temporary matters. As for mutual negotiations to seek a solution to the situation, judging from the current state of affairs, it was originally expected that the parties concerned could find a satisfactory solution within one or two months. However, the negotiations have now reached a stalemate. The focus of negotiations between the Municipal Council and the pseudo-municipal government is on re-allocating the area and powers of the road construction area in the Western District outside the boundary. These direct negotiations are being conducted by Municipal Council President Philip and pseudo-Mayor Fu Xiaoan. They have met several times. The last meeting was two weeks ago. At this time, due to the issues of taxes and police power, there were significant differences in opinion between the two parties, and the negotiations could not continue. It is believed that the difficulties in the issue of police power are easier to resolve, while the issue of taxes is clearly a major obstacle in the negotiations, and these two issues are also related, making it impossible to seek a separate solution. In addition, the issue of adjusting the defense areas, which is currently being discussed by the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, also involves the municipal rights and interests of the road construction area outside the boundary in the Western District, so the solution is even more complicated.

No New Developments in the Situation in Recent Days

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that Municipal Council President Philip told reporters this morning (5th) that the Municipal Council is currently working hard on the recent developments involving the police authorities on the road outside the boundary. The reporter asked if the Municipal Council and the Dadao Municipal Government would continue to hold negotiations. Philip said that there have been no new developments since he met with "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan in early September. As for the incident in the beginning of this week when several Dadao policemen intruded into the Municipal Council's property, broke into the Municipal Council's Western Children's Girls' School on Yu Yuan Road, and wandered around the school's property, the Municipal Council is "carefully watching" it.

The Briton Gray Was Detained Midway

The "Continental News" reported that a British person named Gray, 39 years old, residing at 934 Jing'an Temple Road, was intercepted and detained by the "Dadao" traffic police, who occupied the powers of the Municipal Council Police Department on the roads outside the boundary in the Western District, at the corner of Difeng Road and Jing'an Temple Road at about 6:00 pm yesterday (4th). After being detained for two hours, he was released. Gray is the first foreigner to have a serious dispute with the "Dadao" police. The incident occurred when Gray was driving a car along Jing'an Temple Road. A "Dadao" traffic policeman stationed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road suddenly ordered Gray to stop and asked to see his driving permit. Gray refused. It is said that Gray told the pseudo-police, "I only follow the rules of the Municipal Council on this road." This statement seemed to have angered the policeman, who immediately summoned 40 "Dadao" policemen, most of whom were armed with rifles, and surrounded Gray's car, ordering him to stay inside the car. However, two women were allowed to leave the car. It is said that the debate was quite fierce afterward. A few minutes later, police officers arrived at the scene to mediate, and a lot of talking was done. The dispute ended at about 8:00 pm, and the "Dadao" police allowed Gray to return to his residence.

Car Passengers Suddenly Searched

The "Zi Lin News" reported that just after 9:00 am yesterday (4th), a public bus drove to Yu Yuan Road, almost directly opposite the entrance of Zhaofeng Park. Suddenly, two Chinese passengers were taken off the bus by the police of the "Special Municipal Government" of Shanghai and searched. The public bus was allowed to continue driving. A few minutes later, the two Chinese were also allowed to leave.

### Three British Gunboats Continue to Retreat, Destination is Singapore, Will Leave Shanghai Next Week

In view of the urgent military needs of other regions, the British government has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats on the Yangtze River. The announcement has been officially released by the British Embassy here. According to the Shanghai-based British gunboats, there are five ships: Scorpion, Dragonfly, Grasshopper, Aphid, and Ladybug. After being ordered, the above five ships have all made preparations for withdrawal. Among them, in addition to the Dragonfly and Grasshopper, which sailed away on the 3rd, the other three ships, Ladybug, Aphid, and Scorpion, have been learned by the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency that they will be withdrawn on the morning of the 11th. As for the destination of the withdrawal, the Tokyo telecast of the Hai Tong News Agency on the 5th reported that the recall of British gunboats in the Yangtze River has been confirmed here. When the Navy Department spokesman met with foreign reporters today, he made a statement, claiming that Japan hopes that Britain will withdraw all ships from China's territorial waters. Japan believes that the time has not yet come to restore navigation on the Yangtze River, because there are still fierce battles in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, allowing the Hunan area to restore navigation, which is still dangerous.

### About 600 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Arrived in Shanghai from Hankou

The "Continental News" reported that yesterday (4th), a ship with seriously wounded Japanese soldiers, about 600 people, was transported from Hankou to Shanghai by the Japanese transport ship Kishumari (transliteration) on Tuesday. The arrival of the wounded soldiers coincided with the news from the responsible parties that there were fierce battles around Hankou and that the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. According to news from foreigners in Hankou a few days ago, the Japanese airfield in the area was heavily bombed by Chinese aircraft.

### Relief Association's Employment Placement Statistics

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in addition to raising funds to assist various charitable organizations in handling accommodation and relief, it also pays attention to post-disaster matters such as evacuation, relocation, employment placement, and production work. According to Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General of the Association, the number of refugees registered for employment by the Employment Placement Group from February to the end of September in various accommodation centers is as follows: 319 female workers in yarn factories, 48 coppersmiths, 37 chefs, 55 printing workers, 43 teachers, 31 clerks, 23 female workers in sock factories, 53 machinists, 20 painters, 7 embroiderers, 31 workers in silk factories, 114 workers in tobacco factories, 46 weavers, 71 workers in rubber galoshes factories, 3 electrical engineers, 14 silk weavers, 20 carpenters, 29 tailors, 21 plasterers, and other skilled and unskilled workers, totaling 2,257 people. 468 people have been directly placed by the group, including 163 female workers in yarn factories, 30 female workers in porcelain factories, and others who have taken on other jobs. The number of refugees who have been indirectly employed with the assistance of various accommodation centers is not included. The association also provides subsidies to refugees during their apprenticeship, to show compassion and reduce the burden on employers. It is still hoped that all sectors will give priority to employing refugees when they need labor, turning division of profits into production, and transforming passive charity into active relief. Replacing relief with work and benefiting the people is certainly not a small matter. Please contact Mr. Li Wenjie, Director of the Employment Placement Group, and Mr. Li Baiqiang, Deputy Director, at 12669 at any time for consultation.

### Zhejiang-Fujian Shipping News

American shipping companies are still trying to navigate through the ports that have been blockaded in order to maintain their shipping rights. Recently, the British ship Xin Anli, represented by the American company Wiley Hann & Co., and the British company Yilong's Shen Guanglun, have both made trial voyages to Xinghua, Fujian Province, and berthed at Sanjiangkou. According to the reporter of Da Guang News Agency, the Shen Guang and Xin Anli ships have completed loading in Xinghua and returned to Shanghai one after another at about 6:00 pm the day before yesterday (4th). It is said that when leaving Fujian, they were inspected by Japanese warships, but the situation was still relatively smooth. Whether they will sail again in the future is unknown. According to the reporter of Da Tong News Agency, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line's Wileigh Hann company's New Anner has arrived in Shanghai last night, and Hua Lun Foreign Company's Dapu wheel has been postponed for another day and is scheduled to open on the 6th. However, due to insufficient loading, it will be delayed for another day. The Yi Hua Foreign Company's Baoli wheel is still scheduled to open on the 7th, and the Li He Foreign Company's Mou Fu wheel is currently unloading goods in Zhen, and it will return to Shanghai around the Double Tenth Festival.

### National Day Memorial Post Office Holidays

The Postal Administration announced that the 10th of this month is the National Day Memorial Day, and the Bureau will be closed for one day as usual. The office hours of the Japanese Management Bureau and its branches will follow the established Sunday schedule.

### Pseudo-Police Intruded into a British Home Late at Night, Arrested the Briton Walter, and Took Away a Record Player

The Briton J. Ward is a football star for the French Football Club in this port. He lives at 23, Lane 1984, Jing'an Temple Road. His left neighbor is the New Royal Hotel opened by an Italian. The hotel used to be located on Hongkou Bazilu, but it moved to its current location when the war started. At about 9:00 pm yesterday, while Mr. Walter was relaxing at home, he suddenly heard a knock. The servant was sent to open the door, and several pseudo-"police" officers entered the house proudly, claiming that they needed to talk to the owner. Mr. Walter then got up and questioned them. According to the pseudo-"police," they said they were asking if a person named "Wang" (transliteration) lived in the house. Mr. Walter then explained that he was a British citizen and had no Chinese living with him at all. However, the pseudo-"police" officers insisted on taking Mr. Walter to the pseudo-"police station" for questioning. The two sides argued for a long time without effect. Mr. Walter was then arrested and did not return until late at night. At the same time, a record player that Mr. Walter had prepared was also taken away by the pseudo-police officers. It is unknown what their purpose was. After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which has jurisdiction, was reported and is now in negotiations.

### Japanese Troops Added Posts at the Intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu, Japanese Plainclothes Military Officers Surveyed the Shurong Institute, and Few Residents in District A Were Vaccinated

Inside the Jiangsu Automobile Company at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu, when the Japanese troops had not taken over District A (between North Henan Road and North Jiangxi Road) north of Suzhou Creek, a team of British soldiers was stationed there. After the British and Japanese troops were rotated, the British soldiers withdrew to the Qianjiang Guild Hall on North Henan Road and Hai Ning Road. The iron wire mesh there was

Blocked with Iron Wire Mesh

There were no stationed troops, nor were there any posts. When the reporter went to inspect the area at 4:00 pm yesterday, he saw an armed Japanese soldier standing guard to the west of the iron wire mesh. Pedestrians who stopped to watch were loudly reprimanded. According to residents there, the scavengers in Zhabei who did not have passes often used this road to enter and exit, causing the iron wire mesh there to be damaged. It was not until yesterday morning that this

Japanese Post

The Railway Hospital on Bazilu is now the 19th Accommodation Center of the Cilian Sub-Association. The day after the Japanese troops took over District A north of Suzhou Creek, Honpo Yoshio, an investigator from the Japanese Navy Department, went to investigate with an armed Japanese military officer. It was decided that the armed members of the Fuxing class would continue to inspect the area. After that, no Japanese went there again. At 6:00 am yesterday, several Japanese plainclothes military officers went to inspect the surroundings of the hospital for more than ten minutes before leaving. According to a railway worker, who is now working for the pseudo-railway, he intends to

Take the Opportunity to Incite

The Japanese side to take over the hospital for their own residence. However, those who currently live in the hospital are all elderly and weak refugees with no homes to return to, numbering over a thousand people. The Japanese side should not drive them to sleep on the road. At the Japanese-established vaccination site on the right side of the Shanghai Electric Company on North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, the time for forcing residents to be vaccinated was originally scheduled from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. When the reporter passed by the area at 3:00 pm yesterday, no one was going for vaccination, and only the staff in the cloth shed were sitting idle.

### US Destroyer Squadron Flagship Sails to Manila, Sudden Departure from Yantai, Strict Secrecy in Advance, Two More Ships Have Also Arrived in Shanghai

The "Continental News" reported that it was learned in Shanghai last night (4th) that the flagship Black Hawk of the US Asia Fleet Destroyer Squadron suddenly ended its summer stay in northern China on September 28 and sailed directly from Yantai to Manila. It was found that the US Asia Fleet had gathered in Qingdao in the first two weeks of September, and the authorities had

Kept Secret About the Actions of Each Vessel

It was not until after the ships had sailed out that the foreigners in Yantai learned about it. The Black Hawk's sailing to Manila quickly brought the summer training season for each vessel in the waters off northern China to an end, and the taverns and other places in Yantai that attracted American sailors were closed down as a result. Since the start of the European War, the US authorities have kept the actions of each vessel in the Asian Fleet as secret as possible, which is why

Foreigners in Yantai

Were surprised to find that the Black Hawk had left the port on the morning of September 1. At that time, the US destroyers Pope and Pillsbury, which were docked in Yantai, had also arrived in Shanghai three days ago and were still docked in this port last night, but the future destinations of the two ships

Were Not Announced

And Will Not Be Announced. The Black Hawk will not sail to Shanghai this year, causing the tavern owners in this port to look worried, because they attract the most sailors during the two seasons each year, when the Asian Fleet sails from Manila in the spring and from Yantai in the autumn.

### Foreigners Can Enlist in the British Army, The British King Has Issued an Order, But Shanghai Is Temporarily an Exception

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that it was heard in official circles today (5th) that the British King has recently issued an order that foreigners can now enlist in the British Army and be appointed as officers. Currently, Shanghai will not be affected by the order. Many Poles or Czechs living in Britain will immediately join the British Army. However, the enlistment of foreigners in the British Army stationed abroad will be delayed. Recruitment will only be ordered when it is deemed necessary. The British Consulate General in Shanghai has already registered all British citizens for national service and has also recorded non-British citizens who volunteered to join the British Army last week. Therefore, these non-British citizens will not be immediately affected by the British King's new order. However, if the British authorities do recruit them, it will be announced at that time.

### Japanese Military Spokesman Claims They Will Not Attack Changsha; Actually Uses Attitude of Chinese Spokesman to Explain Changsha Has No Military Value

The "North-China Daily News" reports: Yesterday afternoon (the 4th), a Japanese military spokesman stated that the Japanese army in northern Hunan may or may not attack Changsha. The spokesman could not disclose the purpose of the Japanese army's offensive east of Dongting Lake. However, the spokesman hinted that the Japanese army might avoid the provincial capital of Hunan and continue its offensive in "a certain direction." Perhaps the spokesman's remarks regarding Changsha were intentionally ambiguous. The spokesman recalled that a Chinese spokesman had declared that Changsha "no longer has any military value." Japanese commanders may agree with this assessment by the Chinese side, but this decision must be made by senior staff officers. One thing can be stated with certainty: one of the Japanese army's objectives in fighting in Hunan Province is to inflict significant commercial and material losses on the Chinese side.

### Japanese Force Relocation of Muslim Cemetery; Muslim Community Holds Emergency Meeting; Strenuously Argue for Route Change to Preserve Original State; Matter Concerns Religious Property, Attracting Citywide Muslim Attention

The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery is being forcibly moved because the Japanese are planning to build a railway there. The Fuyou Road Mosque has convened a citywide meeting of representatives from various Muslim organizations. The result was a decision by the Muslims to work together in the coming days to negotiate with the Japanese based on reason, demanding a change of route in order to preserve the original state of the cemetery. A reporter from Daguan News Agency has investigated and reported the situation as follows:

Muslim Representatives' Emergency Meeting

The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery and the Niuye Guild land originally belonged to the Fuyou Road Mosque and comprised more than twenty mu, with approximately eight hundred graves. After the cemetery keeper reported to the mosque that the Japanese were planning to seize the cemetery land to build a railway, forcing the relocation of graves, the mosque posted notices to all families of the deceased, soliciting opinions for discussion at the meeting. At the same time, they printed leaflets explaining the truth of the matter and distributed them to Muslims throughout the city. Upon hearing the news, Muslim organizations throughout the city were extremely indignant and convened an emergency meeting of Muslim representatives the previous evening. Over forty representatives from mosques and missions in Fuyou Road, Zhejiang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, Pudong, and Hudong attended. A representative from the Fuyou Road Mosque reported on the Japanese seizure of the cemetery land. Representatives expressed their opinions separately, their emotions were agitated, and their attitudes were indignant. It was decided that Muslims would work together to negotiate with the Japanese based on reason, demanding a change of route to preserve the original state of the cemetery. They then discussed the opinions of the families of the deceased and adjourned the meeting around 9 p.m.

Matter Concerns Religious Property, Struggle Based on Reason

Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Muslim community told the Daguan News Agency that Islam originated in Mecca, Egypt (referred to as "Tianfang" by Muslims). The prophet is Muhammad. Countries around the world, such as Turkey, Egypt, the Balkans, India, Abyssinia, Australia, England, America, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan, all have Muslim populations. Islam in China dates back to the Tang Dynasty. There are over 30 million Muslims throughout the country, with the largest populations in the northwest in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia, followed by various provinces, cities, and counties. The Japanese seizure of the Muslim cemetery is not just a matter for the Fuyou Road Mosque; it is a matter for all Muslims in the city and the country, and even for Muslims in countries around the world. Given the significance, the Fuyou Road Mosque authorities do not dare to act alone and rashly adopt any measures to negotiate with the Japanese. News will be communicated to Muslims throughout the city at any time to determine how to respond. They will argue reasonably. A Cantonese man, He Muxi, 61 years old, living at No. 4 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road, recently purchased several large bundles of firewood from a certain place. Last night, He used a knife to split the bamboo hoops on the firewood, but in the center of the firewood was a bomb. After He vigorously chopped the wood, the bomb was detonated by the impact. He's left and right hands were injured and he was transported to Renji Hospital by ambulance. It is said that his right hand has been blown off.

### Free Transport of Rice to Shanghai Resolved; Rice Prices Plummet; Approximately 10,000 Bags Arrive in Shanghai Daily; Food Supply No Longer Feared to be Scarce

New rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has successively entered the market, and due to favorable weather, there has been a bumper harvest. The issue of free transport of rice to Shanghai has also been resolved. As a result, various rice industry groups are making every effort to dredge sources of supply, purchasing from various producing areas, transporting rice to Shanghai for market adjustment. In recent days, the volume of rice transported by river, train and ship from Kunshan, Changzhou, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Songjiang and other places has been from 8,000 to 15,000 bags per day. As a result, Shanghai's stock of rice has gradually increased, market prices have fallen by three to four yuan, and the trend is expected to continue. Therefore, there is no concern of lack of food. Furthermore, although the arrival of rice in Shanghai has been surging, it is all Jiangbei Xian rice, therefore, although the price of Xian rice has continued to fall, the price of Bai Geng rice has remained stable. Yesterday, a large number of Songjiang Bai Geng rice, no less than 8,000 bags, was transported by river. As a result, the opening price of this Bai Geng rice in the rice market yesterday fell by five yuan per shi. The price per shi, which was originally 37 yuan, has fallen to 32 yuan yesterday. Jiangbei Xian rice also continued to fall by one yuan per shi due to the continued arrival of goods, with the highest price being 31 yuan. However, due to the scarcity of Changshu Bai Geng rice, the price per shi still costs 42 yuan. As for Nanjing brown rice, the price per shi is only 18 yuan. If transportation is not obstructed in the future, prices should not be expected to rise.

### Son of Deceased Zi Yun Sues Stepmother for Embezzlement; Misappropriating Property of Younger Son Held in Trust; Defendant Claims Plaintiff Did Not Provide Support; Court Orders Reconciliation, Assault Case Not Tried

Lou Buqing, son of the deceased former head of the Shanghai Songhu Police Department's Investigation Team, section chief of the second district of the Jiangsu Water Police, and native of Hangzhou, Zhejiang (34 years old this year, currently residing at No. 4, Yi Li, Fahuaxi Town, Columbia Road, Shanghai, formerly worked in the baggage room of the Suzhou Railway Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and left his job when the Suzhou station was evacuated after the 83 war). Lou Buying, (25 years old this year, currently residing at No. 11 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, formerly worked at the Ningbo Telephone Company, recently resigned due to illness).

Two brothers

Recently, they engaged a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against their stepmother, Lou Wu (also known as Lou Wuhen, age unknown, currently living with the second plaintiff, as the fourth concubine of Lou Ziyun) for embezzling property, requesting investigation, and an ancillary civil suit, requesting the court to order the return of property rights, etc. It is claimed that the plaintiffs' father, Lou Ziyun, died in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). The plaintiffs divided the inheritance. At that time, it was agreed that Buying's

share of the property

would be managed by the defendant, and the deed to the house located at No. 28 Xibanbei Lane, Panmen, Suzhou, which Buqing inherited, would also be kept by the defendant. However, the plaintiffs became unemployed after the war and once left Shanghai to seek work in Hong Kong. When they returned to Shanghai, the defendant's attitude suddenly changed, unlike in the past. Later, they found out that all the Xicheng Lane houses leased by their late father had been changed by the defendant to

Wuhen's name

with the rental office. Only then did the plaintiffs realize that she

harbored ill intentions.

It was not appropriate to have the property managed by her. They demanded that she hand over the property rights she held in trust, but not only did she refuse, but she also claimed that Buying had committed violence, falsely reported to the police station, and led the police to arrest him. Because there was no evidence, the matter was not pursued. The plaintiffs could no longer tolerate it, so they hired a lawyer to send a letter to negotiate, but the defendant ignored it and hired a lawyer to publish a statement that the property belonged to her. The plaintiffs immediately published a rebuttal, but the defendant again claimed that Buying had not provided for her support and refused to hand over the property rights. According to

the time of the property division,

although there was the matter of the defendant returning to Buying to provide support, before the war, he was responsible for the entire family's livelihood. Now, because he lost his job after the war, he is accused of being idle and not doing his job. Moreover, the rental income from the Xicheng Lane houses is enough to support the defendant's personal life with surplus. Now she is embezzling under false pretenses, which clearly violates Article 335 of the Criminal Code. They request an investigation and an order for the return of the property rights, etc. Lou Wu also filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Lou Buqing brothers of assault, requesting an investigation.

Both sides countersue

The court, upon receiving the complaint, opened the second courtroom for trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The Lou Buqing brothers and their lawyers stated that the defendant, Lou Wu, had embezzled the property. The defendant, Lou Wu, delegated a lawyer to state on her behalf that there was no dispute over the property rights held in trust for Buying. However, the property rights belonging to Buqing were not held in trust by the defendant, and the housing deed held in trust for Buying was submitted to the Suzhou Land Bureau for exchange of certificates, as evidenced by the receipt from the Suzhou Land Bureau. However, Buying must bear the defendant's

living expenses and support.

The defendant can return the property rights. After verifying the statements in court, the court ordered a postponement until the 12th for the defendant to appear in court for further questioning, and instructed both parties to try to reconcile out of court. Because Lou Wu did not arrive, the hearing on the assault case was not conducted.

### Losing Lawsuit Over Temple Property; Threatening Lawyer; Gu Zhuxuan Also Receives Threatening Letter

Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the Tianchan Stage, and lawyer Zhu Qichen, of No. 403, Taihe Building, Labourdonnais Road, each received a bizarre, similar threatening letter one week ago. Gu and Zhu reported the situation to the Old Zha Police Station. After the police station checked the handwriting, they determined that the two letters were written by the same person. After a secret investigation by lawyer Zhu Qichen, it was believed that Yangxi, the monk of Leshan Temple at the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Avenue Dubail, French Concession, was suspected of being involved. Four months ago, Lawyer Zhu was entrusted by a monk named Qinliang to handle a lawsuit involving temple property with Yangxi and Yuanhua. Yuanhua and Yangxi lost the case. Zhu then reported to the French police station the day before yesterday and had the two monks Yangxi and Yuanhua arrested, and then transferred them to the Old Zha Police Station. Lawyer Zhu also presented other handwriting of Yangxi as evidence. The police station has now sent the two letters and Yangxi's handwriting to the appraisal office for appraisal. Yangxi and Yuanhua are temporarily released on bail pending verification.

### French Police Department Protects Resident Safety; Strictly Arresting Hooligans; To Reduce Extortion and Solicitation

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the concession areas of Shanghai were relatively stable, so refugees from all over the world flocked to them, causing an unprecedented increase in the number of residents in the concessions. The French Concession Police Department believes that in recent times, there have often been strangers in the area who are unfamiliar with the situation in Shanghai and are often extorted by hooligans and thugs. This type of case accounts for a large proportion of recent crimes, so it is believed that it is not enough to make the citizens live in peace without completely eliminating the hooligans in the area. Therefore, a special team was established a few days ago, consisting of Chief Inspector Dai Rongji, detectives Weng Huanzhang, Li Shuren, Wan Minghai and others from the Criminal Division, to specifically eliminate hooligans in the area. Residents are also requested to report to the police station any incidents of extortion or solicitation of illegal fees from merchants, and they will be severely punished without any leniency.

### Do Not Trust Fleeting Acquaintances; Youth Robbed of Large Sum of Money; Clues Obtained in Laundry Shop; Suspect Arrested at Cathay Hotel

Fang Shengui, a native of Fujian, is 20 years old. He came to Shanghai from his hometown to purchase goods. He took the Haikou Steamer. Because he was lonely on the way, he communicated with Zheng Fuqing, a fellow passenger, and they became very friendly because they were both from the same hometown and of similar age. On the 2nd of this month, the steamer arrived in port. Fang and Zheng opened a room at the Oriental Hotel, No. 356 Yu Qiaqing Road and stayed overnight. The next morning, Fang, because he

was unfamiliar with the way,

invited Zheng to go to a certain money house on Bazi Road to get 1,800 yuan in cash, and returned to the hotel together. Fang put 100 yuan aside for pocket money, and hid the rest in a small leather box. Unexpectedly, Zheng Fuqing, although he looked like a dapper young man in Western clothes, actually harbored evil intentions. In the afternoon, he used a trick and made an excuse that the scenery of Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai was quite good, why not take a trip. Fang agreed and went to Zhaofeng Park together. First, they went to the drinking room to drink shaved ice. After more than ten minutes, Zheng

claimed to have a stomachache

and urgently needed to defecate. He told Fang to wait a moment, and then left. Fang waited for more than half an hour, but Zheng did not return. Fang knew that something was wrong and urgently called the Oriental Hotel to inquire, and learned that Zheng had gone back and left ten minutes ago. Fang hired a car back to the Oriental Hotel, and saw that the lock on the small leather box in the room was broken, and 1,700 yuan of French currency had disappeared. Fang knew that Zheng had stolen it, and urgently reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, which sent Detective Xue Youwen to investigate. It was learned that Zheng had entrusted his clothes to the Fuyu Laundry Company, No. 727, nearby for washing, so he notified the laundry shop that if Zheng came to pick up his clothes, he should be detained. The other day,

a tea servant from the Cathay Hotel

went to pick up the clothes and was detained by the detectives. After interrogation, it was learned that Zheng was in room 412 of the Cathay Hotel. He was arrested and 300 Hong Kong dollars, 381.60 French dollars, and a Hong Kong boat ticket (prepared to take a boat to Hong Kong), as well as leather box and bird gun and other items were confiscated. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the Special Court No. 1. The police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case and requested a postponement. When questioning Zheng Fuqing, his statement was hesitant. The court ordered him to be detained pending further verification.

### Snatching Chinese Policeman's Gun; Three Criminals Sentenced; Each Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment

On September 15th, at 7:15 PM, Chinese constables Nos. 1663, 1228, and 2557 of the Gordon Road Police Station were patrolling the area of Connaught Road and Great Western Road in western Shanghai. They were suddenly surrounded by a crowd of about fifteen thugs, each with automatic pistols and other weapons. The thugs snatched three pistols and eighteen bullets from the three Chinese constables and fled with howls. Subsequently, the armored car team of the police station in the district, composed of both Western and Chinese detectives, arrested three suspects, Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan, natives of Anhui, and brought them to the police station. They confessed to being members of the so-called "Self-Defense Corps" and claimed that the "Corps" lacked weapons, hence the move. They admitted to being responsible for keeping watch while the three Chinese constables' guns were robbed, and confessed to robbing several hundred yuan of property from the Big Barrel General Machine set up by Mao A'xiang, the King of the Flower Show in western Shanghai. They were sent to the First Special District Court, and the police station filed a public prosecution on charges of robbery. The court concluded the debate and waited for the verdict. Yesterday morning, the presiding judge issued a verdict in the Criminal Court No. 3, sentencing Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan to

five years of imprisonment each

for armed robbery, as a warning. If they did not agree with the verdict, they could file an appeal within ten days. The three criminals knew they had violated the criminal law, so they bowed their heads and obeyed.

### Zhen Da Customs Brokerage Accused of Embezzlement; Defendant Did Not Appear at Yesterday's Hearing

Zhang Da, a native of Wujin, is 57 years old. He currently practices as a lawyer at No. 120 Guizhou Road. In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937),

the Ministry ordered

him to be appointed as a prosecutor in the Yichang District Court. Later, he was transferred to serve as a judge in the Hankou District Court. At that time, he carried

baggage worth 20,000 yuan

in twelve pieces from Shanghai, which were packed into ten large pieces. He entrusted the Zhen Da Weiji Customs Brokerage opened by Zhu Qirong, a native of Ningbo, at No. 18 Xin Yong'an Street, French Concession, for transportation. At that time, the National Army had not yet withdrawn from the suburbs of Shanghai, and all transportation was extremely convenient. However, Zhang was still afraid that obstacles would occur on the road, so he specifically requested a passport from Yang Hu, the commander of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison, and gave it to the Zhen Da Customs Brokerage to transport the baggage together. Unexpectedly, until ten years after the National Army withdrew from Hankou, this baggage had not been received. Zhang then came to Shanghai and practiced law. He repeatedly entrusted people to negotiate with Zhen Da, but they always gave vague excuses. Zhang had no way, so he hired lawyer Wang Xintang to file a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the customs brokerage owner Zhu Qirong of embezzlement and breach of trust, and requested that the court order the return of the baggage or compensation for losses of 20,000 yuan in national currency. The court approved the complaint, and yesterday Judge Miao opened the Criminal Court No. 2 to summon the defendant. The defendant failed to arrive because the door number on the subpoena, No. 18, was mistakenly written as No. 180. The court briefly questioned the plaintiff, Zhang Yuanzheng, and then ordered the case to be adjourned to the 14th of this month for further hearing.

### Prodigal Son Murders Elderly Father; Demanding Money Unsuccessfully, Suddenly Arouses Murderous Intent; Administers Electric Current and Slashes with a Knife; Elderly Father Dies Tragically, Unfilial Son Arrested

Zhou Yongjie, a native of Ningbo, 50 years old, lives at No. A228 Haig Road, Western Shanghai. In his early years, he ran a business and was quite diligent, so he had some savings. Zhou has a son, around 20 years old, who usually hangs out with hooligans, practices inferior habits, and repeatedly demands money from his father to squander outside. Recently, he repeatedly demanded money from his father, but Zhou did not give him any. His son therefore harbored resentment in his heart. Around 10 o'clock last night, Zhou's son suddenly had an evil idea and went to Zhou Yongjie's bedroom, seeing his father sleeping sweetly in bed. Zhou's son connected an electric wire to the current, one end attached to Zhou Yongjie's body. After Zhou was electrocuted, he fainted. Zhou's son used a sharp knife to slash Zhou Yongjie's head, splitting his skull, and slashed each of his legs, breaking all the leg bones. He died on the spot. Zhou's son carried a wooden box from outside to his father's bedroom, intending to put his father's body into the box, when someone reported the arrival of nearby Chinese police, who arrested Zhou's son on the spot. The body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy.

### Refugee Association Second Broadcast; Appeals for Sponsorship; Anniversary Celebration Held; Fundraising Results Announced Yesterday

### Pedestrian Killed by Truck

At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Lung Men Road, Public Concession, at about 4:45 p.m. yesterday, a transport truck, number 16920, was speeding from west to east, when a pedestrian, over 30 years old, wearing a light gray gabardine gown, white socks, and black shoes, was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, crushing his head and feet, and died on the spot. Patrolman No. 2833 of the Chengdu Road Police Station arrived, copied down the driver's number, and then sent the deceased by car to Bao Long Hospital, and transferred to the morgue, pending report to the court for inspection.

### Reported News of Applicants for Radio Operator Examinations: Mr. Gong Allegedly Used the Name of the Aviation Administration to Organize a Fake Examination; The School Providing the Exam Site Should Also Be Held Responsible

To the Esteemed Editor:

We are a group of graduates from the Wireless Radio Specialization Department of the First China Vocational Supplementary School. Around the time of our graduation, a classmate, Mr. So-and-so, informed us that the Inland Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department (Southwest Highway) radio stations were recruiting over eighty radio operators in Shanghai. The lowest monthly salary was eighty yuan (for a third-class operator). After being hired, travel expenses to the interior would be subsidized by the organization. The first examination was to be held at the ×× Wireless Radio Specialized School. What a wonderful opportunity! We were all filled with joy, hoping that after passing the exam, we could realize our dream—to serve our motherland!

This was on July 18th. We went to the ×× School to register and learned that the examination would be held at 6:00 PM on the 19th. At that time, according to the regulations, we each paid a registration fee of two yuan, and submitted two photos and resumes. With the receipt in hand, we waited for the 19th. That day was when a typhoon hit Shanghai, and it rained heavily. Braving the wind and rain, we rushed to the ×× Radio School for the examination. Upon arrival, we saw a notice posted stating that the examiner, a radio operator from the ×× Shipping Company, surnamed Gong, named ××, had been delayed due to the typhoon preventing the ship from docking, so the examination would be postponed. We then returned home. For three consecutive days, it was all for naught. We were very surprised. How could a state institution be so unreliable with its examination schedule? However, we believed that the ×× Radio School had a considerable history and reputation in Shanghai, so it would certainly not engage in falsehoods to deceive us young people.

The examination was held at 6:00 PM on the 22nd. One chief examiner and three or four proctors were present, with over thirty applicants. After four hours, the examination ended. At this time, our heavy hearts gradually lightened, and we only hoped for the results to be announced. Several days later, we learned that some of us (the writers of this letter) had been accepted. How delighted we were! Our hopes were about to be realized! We were also told that we would have to depart within two months. Therefore, we all prepared our luggage, waiting to embrace our motherland and serve the country two months later. At that time, we felt indescribable joy and relief!

Now, two months have passed since the examination date. Ah! Truly, "the heavens have unpredictable winds, and humans have sudden misfortunes." A few days ago, we suddenly received a mimeographed letter from the ×× Radio School sent to each applicant. After reading the letter, it was like a bolt from the blue, shocking everyone. The letter stated: "The examiner, Gong ××, has not yet provided a departure date, and is now even demanding a security deposit of five yuan per person... This method seems deceitful, so we have decided to immediately refund the registration fees previously collected..." We still cannot figure out how such a reputable radio school could do such a senseless thing. Mr. Gong used the school as an examination site, so prior arrangements must have been made, and the school must have trusted Mr. Gong. We trusted the ×× Radio School. Our registration fees were paid at the school's accounting office, and we took the examination at the school, so the ×× Radio School must bear responsibility. Unexpectedly, this is the result, which has surprised us all... Alas! Because of this so-called opportunity, we waited wholeheartedly for two months. Knowing that we had been accepted and would be sent to work in the interior, we did not apply for the openly advertised radio operator positions at schools such as the St. Louis Radio School recently. Who knew that now the ×× Radio School would inform the applicants that this matter was a fraud. Then, won't we have to look for another opportunity? But when will we have the chance? It has been over two months since we graduated from school. If things continue like this, won't the skills we have learned gradually decline and become rusty? The youth's time is the most precious time in life. Waiting like this on a deserted island is a significant loss for us! (Responsibility for the text rests with the author)

### The Sky After the Rain

— Bao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Promote Medical Education and Build Schools; Thinking About Expanding Village Governance and Providing Care for Children

There is another bad custom: using celebrations and condolences as a way to make money and seek profit. This is less common in the countryside, but more prevalent in cities. For example, when an old lady turns a certain age, her birthday must indeed be celebrated, and the post-birthday feast cannot be forgone. When a stepmother turns a certain age, her birthday must indeed be celebrated, but the biological mother's celebration must be even more lively. In addition, birthdays of paternal aunts, maternal aunts, mothers-in-law, and foster mothers are all opportunities to gather materials for birthday celebrations. There are even cases where a birthday is celebrated in the first half of the year, and another one is celebrated in the second half. If the old lady has already passed away, then a posthumous birthday can be celebrated if a regular one cannot. Later, the death anniversaries of parents and grandparents are treated the same as regular birthdays, with invitations sent out widely and gifts collected extensively. In reality, when a person is dead, what birthday is there? If it stems from sincere remembrance, family rituals and memorial services are acceptable, but why the need for such grand displays? This shows that the intention is not really about the celebration. Later, Shanghai's pleasure-seekers even sought revenge and retaliation because of not sending gifts when sending invitations, resulting in violent altercations. The matter of gift-giving can be said to have reached its extreme. Therefore, there was a backlash later, with society generally refraining from giving gifts for celebrations and condolences. If close relatives and friends occasionally offer a gift, that is an exception. The gifts given are either souvenirs or necessities. Items like banners and silver shields are completely useless waste, and of course, they have disappeared. Even the market no longer sells such items. Therefore, there were very few people giving gifts at Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun's wedding this time. However, one cannot say there were absolutely none. Close friends and confidants also gave them gifts, but they could give them at any time, without having to crowd around at this particular moment. Just like among her sisters, Zhu Airen might not give her anything, but the He sisters would definitely give something. It is unknown what the Wu Junsou sisters would do, but they would probably give some souvenirs. It is guessed that Mrs. Su Liya's gift would be the biggest. At eight o'clock on Friday morning, Zhu Village Chief called his granddaughter. He said, "Yesterday, the village council meeting was held, and the matter of the He sisters' silk weaving factory site has been approved. However, what kind of building will be built in the future? What kind of equipment will be used? The layout will still have to be reviewed once. You inform them both!" Airen obediently agreed, and also told him, "I won't be coming to Freedom Village next week because everyone is going to Shanghai to attend Jin Danyun's wedding. Also, the He sisters received a telegram from their grandfather saying that a paternal elder is coming to Shanghai from the north, and they will also go to visit him to discuss the silk factory. Because that paternal elder is currently a shareholder and used to run a silk weaving factory, he is an expert who should be consulted." (188)

### Gas Lamps (Mechanical Poetic Talk)

— Ru Hui

Before electric lights, Shanghai also had "gas lamps."

Wang Tao's "Ying Ruan Magazine" (1875), Volume Six, states:

Westerners have erected lamps in the streets, spaced closely or sparsely according to distance. The lamps are all made of hexagonal glass, shining like stars from afar. Later, they were replaced with gas, which is even brighter. This is because the gas from coal mines is gathered and ignited, so the light is far-reaching and dazzling... It can be seen that "gas lamps" appeared in Shanghai during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, and were regarded as "miracles." Therefore, people at the time created the "Ten Views of Northern Shanghai," and this was one of them, titled "Night Market Lamps," and they praised it with the following verse:

Thousands of electric lights connect iron pipes,
Most suitable for dance halls and singing banquets.
No need to envy the purple light offerings of old,
A city that never sleeps all night long.

At that time, Shanghai had only a few "gas lamps," but it became a "city that never sleeps." However, this is not an "exaggeration." Ciqi Zhiting's "Four Poems on Yangjing" described the mystery of "gas lamps" even more vividly. The poem reads:

Living fire burns thousands of flowers,
Bright stars illuminate ten thousand homes.

Pavilions are never dark in spring nights,
The scenery is vast and boundless.

Trying to outshine the silver toad [moon],
Truly opening iron tree blossoms.

Climbing high and looking far,
Seemingly scattering red city clouds.

The topic is called "Ground Fire," which was a very common name at the time. The old owner of Twenty-Three Rooms also filled in "Looking South of the River" to praise it, calling it:

Shanghai is good, ground fire is the brightest.
The bronze dragon counts the hours, boasting a sleepless night,
Iron trees bloom, illuminating the deep night,
Even clearer than the moon.

This is written in a more tranquil way. However, most writers only regarded it as the moon. Su Kanghou's poem: "No need to carry candles in this scenic spot, round pearls replace the moon and are even brighter. No need to waste money to buy, heaven opens a city that never sleeps at sea." is of this kind. "Shanghai Northern Bamboo Branch" also praised "ground fire":

Thousands of lamps stand west to east,
Fire comes naturally, seizing the work of nature.

No need to burn tallow to boast of extending the day,
Night walks are always in the moonlight.

The end note says: "Lamps are placed on poles to illuminate the road. The fire comes from underground passages, the light is extremely bright and never goes out all night." Therefore, at the time, "gas lamps" were also called "self-lighting fire." As for "ground fire all night," "Shenpu Bamboo Branch Words" also mentioned it, saying that "ground fire passes through everywhere." The poem directly praising it reads:

Most ingenious is the smokeless ground fire,
Bright light, faces slightly flushed.

Up and down the building, all are illuminated,
Who can discern the mechanisms in the dark?

The last two lines are very good. The strangest is the author of "Shanghai City Miscellaneous Poems," who cursed "gas lamps" as "ghost fire," calling "ghost fire clustering like stars, Zhang Hai Market." This person was probably a very conservative type. But most authors only had praise. Until "electric lights" were established, the enthusiasm for praising "ground fire" turned to "electric lights." However, in the early days of "electric lights," which was also the transitional period from "gas lamps" to "electric lights," there were also those who praised both sides. This is evidenced by the "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" of the owner of the Southern Border Double Red Bean Pavilion:

Shanghai is clearly a city that never sleeps,
Electric lights and gas lamps compete in beauty.

Making people unable to distinguish the round moon,
Let alone say tonight is the Lantern Festival.

### Two Stages Compete to Hire Xun Huisheng; There Are Still Problems with His Coming to Shanghai

— Only Me

Xun Huisheng, one of the Four Great Dan performers, has not come south to perform since his appearance at the Tianchan Stage in the twenty-second year, which is already six years ago. (Three years ago, Huisheng once came to Shanghai to attend Zhang Xiaolin's sixtieth birthday celebration.) Precisely because of this, the Golden Theater and the Renewal Stage both want to invite Mr. Xun to Shanghai. After the two theaters sent people to contact Huisheng separately, the news of Xun Huisheng's coming to Shanghai to perform spread to almost every Peking Opera enthusiast's ears.

After many twists and turns, as a result of the two theaters' unrelenting efforts, the truth tells us this: Xun Huisheng will come south in mid-September of the lunar calendar, and the heads of the two theaters will resolve this difficult problem with emotions. ——Xun Huisheng will first perform at the Renewal Stage for half a month (taking over from Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, and others), and after that, he will go to the Golden Theater for one month (taking over from Wang Yurong). Unexpectedly, after the Renewal Stage's talent scout Chang returned to Shanghai to report back, Xun Huisheng suddenly sent a telegram to a certain influential person connected to Renewal, saying that he did not acknowledge having reached an agreement with the Renewal talent scout to come to Shanghai on time to take over from Wu Suqiu and others. Therefore, the matter of Huisheng's coming to Shanghai has changed again in unseen ways.

It is said that Huisheng and Renewal have not reached an agreement because of business matters. Xun Huisheng is treating Renewal with an attitude of recognizing money but not people, wanting to use a huge performance fee to make the Renewal authorities give up on him. His intention is that after Renewal gives up, he can resolutely come to Shanghai to perform at the Golden Theater. In fact, the Golden Theater had indeed formally invited Huisheng a long time ago.

The Renewal Stage's matter with Huisheng now hinges entirely on a difference in numbers. Renewal's General Manager Mr. Dong Zhaobin's intention is to express discouragement because of Huisheng's deliberate obstruction. However, after hearing "a casual remark" from a certain influential person, if the influential person's intention is that there is no need to invite him again, the Renewal authorities will decisively give up on Xun Huisheng and bring Tan Fuying and Tan Xiaopei, father and son, to Shanghai to perform ahead of schedule. As for the Golden Theater, because they had smooth negotiations with Huisheng before, they expressed great confidence in Huisheng's coming to Shanghai.

The affairs of opera troupes are often infinitely variable. It is possible that Xun Huisheng can still meet the people of Shanghai according to the original plan. However, besides this problem, there is another problem, which is that Wang Yurong's supporting actors, the young male lead Jin Zhongren, the clown Zhu Binxian, and the painted face Jiang Shaoqiu, are all members of Xun Huisheng's troupe. If Wang Yurong performs at the Golden Theater before Huisheng, Jin Zhongren and others will have to come with Yurong. There is no problem with this on the Golden Theater's side, but on the Renewal side, it is an unexpected complication because in reality, it is absolutely not allowed for Jin Zhongren and others to perform in both theaters.

It is said that Xun Huisheng's staff members and supporting cast all want to come south. Huisheng himself is not unwilling to come to Shanghai. However, all leading actors have a certain arrogance, which is that if someone invites him, he must put on a full display of airs. I am also a member who loves and protects Huisheng. I hope Boss Xun will not be too much like that. Because this decision is undoubtedly giving Huisheng a great opportunity. One must know that opportunities are not always available. If this opportunity is missed, I am afraid there will not be such a good opportunity again.

### After the Outbreak of the European War: The Trend of Hollywood

— New Film

After a considerable period of brewing, the European war has finally transitioned from a propaganda war to a formal war. Although Hollywood, the world's only film city, is separated by vast oceans, it has been significantly affected by the European war. In particular, the following points are especially prominent:

Changing Film Production Policies Europe is the largest overseas market for American films, especially Britain, which is an excellent market for Hollywood productions. Therefore, this European war has severely hit the overseas market for Hollywood films, especially since Britain is also one of the main warring countries. As a result, Hollywood film companies immediately changed their policies regarding film production, and all films centered on European film audiences were stopped from being filmed.

Movie Stars Return Home to Serve When we recall the previous European war, many foreign movie stars in Hollywood returned home to serve, some even fighting on the battlefield. So this time, after the outbreak of the European war, it is certainly no exception that foreign movie stars will be conscripted back home. For example, Charles Boyer has returned to France to serve, and people like Colman have also returned to England. If the war continues, there will certainly be many more foreign film workers who will return to their countries to take on various wartime tasks and serve their country!

Promoting the South American Market In recent years, the Spanish war and the Sino-Japanese conflict have reduced Hollywood's overseas film market. The outbreak of this European war has had an even more serious impact on Hollywood. In this situation, Hollywood film companies have shifted their attention to South American countries, making every effort to promote the market in South America and Central America. Therefore, we have recently seen films depicting South American scenery being shown continuously, which is also a shift in Hollywood's direction in the midst of the European war!

### Splendid Rivers and Mountains

— Enterprise

"Juarez"

"Splendid Rivers and Mountains" narrates the story of Mexican President Juarez in the mid-19th century, resisting the French army that invaded Mexico. Although most of the cities were captured, and although the puppet Maximilian was crowned under the instigation of Napoleon III, Juarez remained calm and firm. He rejected Maximilian's moderation and extinguished the rebellion of Vice President Urandi with the fire of justice. Finally, with the support of the military and the people, Juarez recovered Mexico's splendid rivers and mountains.

From this story, it gives us the following lessons: (1) Juarez's indomitable spirit of resistance finally led to the final victory; while the French army, which traveled long distances and hoped to fulfill its ambitions of aggression, was inevitably doomed to failure. (2) Maximilian's puppet appearance was indeed deceived by General Baron. When he discovered that Baron wanted him to sign a document authorizing the confiscation of people's property and the execution of those who privately stored military supplies, he still hoped to "cooperate" with Juarez. He did not completely see that in the autumn of national survival, there is only absolute "yes" and "no," and there is no middle ground. (3) Vice President Urandi's conspiracy and rebellion also finally collapsed before justice.

The role of Juarez is played by Paul Muni. With his refined acting skills, he plays the great man in history. His bright and energetic eyes and firm and calm demeanor are truly awe-inspiring! The role of Maximilian is played by Brian Aherne. From his puppet appearance, being deceived, compromising, to failing, he can portray the conflict of psychological contradictions in every process, which is completely different from the unrefined hero Fleury in "New Gold Mountain." Bette Davis, as Maximilian's wife Carlota, demonstrates her superb acting skills in comforting her husband and going mad after seeing Napoleon. (To be continued)

Shanghai Should Create a Theater for Joint Performances of Qin, Pi, and Huang Operas

Recently, Song Dezhu's "Jinshan Temple" has been staged at the Sun Theater. This play combines civil, military, Kunqu, and miscellaneous styles in a furnace, deeply catering to Shanghai customers' tastes. The skillful and steady fighting at the end, combined with the tight and rigorous stage presence, makes the whole play impeccable, with no one missing a beat or leaving the stage. This is truly a rare occurrence in fighting plays. What is wonderful is that, in addition to the drummer and cymbal player who are slightly older, the others, such as those playing the erhu, sanxian, moon guitar, and small drums, are all children around ten years old. This situation is probably only seen by Shanghai residents. It is not well known that the Beijing Opera School originally had a music theory department, with the renowned Cao Xinquan responsible for guidance. Therefore, many students of the school are able to master the stage thoroughly. Those who came with Xing Dezhu this time are probably alumni who graduated from the same department. In recent years, many new famous musicians have emerged, but many can only play the erhu and are not skilled in the flute and sona. Compared to the students of opera school, they are truly ashamed.

After watching this play, I have a lot of feelings. If we only talk about the first half of "Jinshan Temple," Dezhu may not be better than Han Shichang of the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe. However, if we compare the current situations of Han and Song, it is simply one in the underground and one in the sky. In recent years, Peking Opera has developed abnormally, and Kunqu and Qin Opera have almost been submerged into obscurity. A few years ago, Shichang, in order to maintain the livelihood of his colleagues, once again acted as Feng Fu, performing in various ports in Pingjin. However, because the audience was sparse and the ticket prices were low, the daily ticket income was not enough to cover the cost of food and lodging for the entire troupe. Because Shichang still had income from teaching opera at a certain mansion, he declared that he was completely voluntary, and even his transportation expenses were not covered. However, he still had to pay the salary of one yuan to the employee who dressed his hair every day. ——(114)
