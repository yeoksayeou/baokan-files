### German-Italian Peace Movement Fails; Western Front Warfare Intensifies; Air and Artillery Battles Fierce; General Offensive Commencement Unconfirmed; Germany Deploys Air Mines on the Western Front; Zeppelin Factory in Xu Berlin Reported Bombed

Basel, Switzerland – It is heard here that there are fierce battles between French and German forces in the central part of the Western Front. This is a result of the French army's offensive along a 40-mile zigzagging line (extending eastward from the Saar River to the Vosges Mountains). It is said that both sides have added a large number of troops to the war, with the French army having tanks and fully equipped auxiliary units. Whether this battle is the starting point of a general offensive on one side, or the French army's attempt to repeatedly seize the positions that the German army recaptured during the counter-offensive in the middle of last week, is still unknown.

Paris – The German offensive on the Western Front has increased in strength and importance. It appears to be testing naval defenses in preparation for a large-scale offensive. Berlin claims that German troops have occupied French positions east and west of Wissembourg in Alsace-Lorraine, but France has firmly denied this. It is said that German troops have repeatedly tried to attack strong French positions within German territory, but have not succeeded. The French 75mm guns are superior to the German artillery fire. German troops attempted to occupy the hillside, but were ambushed by machine guns in the mountains. The French army is temporarily not penetrating deep into German territory, in order to concentrate on consolidating the occupied areas and resisting German attacks. The French front lines have reached the German defensive areas, with thirty to forty solid fortresses and outposts made of reinforced concrete per square mile. (Reuters, 25th)

Romanshorn, Switzerland – It is heard that a squadron of French or British aircraft bombed the Zeppelin factory in Friedrichshafen, Germany, between 9:00 PM and 11:00 PM last night. (Reuters, 25th)

Paris – According to news from here today, the French army has again pressed on German positions. Responsible parties often ask about the German activities of the past two days: Is this a show put on by the German army as Hitler is about to personally visit the Western Front, or is it a sudden attack on the French outposts in the hope of recapturing the lost territory between the Siegfried Line and the border? In any case, it is not easy for the German army to launch a strong attack, because the French have had more than a week to extend the defenses of their recently captured positions elsewhere. The French army has now built new artillery forts and installed barbed wire. (Reuters, 25th)

Berlin – The fighting in the Saar region of the Western Front is fierce. German authoritative circles claimed last night that Germany intends to determine the outcome on the Western Front within a year. A German spokesperson stated, "It is infuriating that Germany does not prevent Britain from blockading German food supplies to trap Germany, but still waits passively behind the Western Front, awaiting the enemy's attack." German military circles admitted that German troops have begun to be transferred from Poland to the Rhine front. If the peace movement fails, German troops will launch a major offensive against the British and French armies. The 86th Division of the German army fighting on the Eastern Front remains mostly in Poland, while the German army on the Western Front numbers between 35 and 40 divisions. This is in case the final peace efforts fail. (Associated Press, 25th)

Luxembourg – According to news from the front today, last night, the sound of artillery fire roared throughout the night between Chenqin and Wasserbillig along the Moselle River, interspersed with the intense, crisp sound of anti-aircraft guns. As reporters traveled along the west bank of the Moselle River, they saw many temporary defense lines deployed in the suburbs of German towns, especially in the areas of Tawern and Wincheringen. The best-concealed German forward outposts were hidden in forests and bushes. According to news from here, the Germans have densely planted landmines in front of the Siegfried Line. The French army is now moving towards the Luxembourg area to prevent the Germans from attacking through Luxembourg. (Associated Press, 25th)

Rome – According to a battlefield reporter for the "Roman People's Newspaper," German troops on the Western Front have repeatedly released "air mines," which are twenty times more powerful than ordinary landmines. These "air mines" are new weapons that consist of landmines attached to balloons, which are then detonated electrically. (Associated Press, 25th)

Rome – According to reports from special correspondents sent by various newspapers here to the German Western Front, the German army has deployed many small balloons equipped with explosives in the sky to intercept enemy aircraft. These balloons can be detonated from the ground, and it is extremely difficult for enemy aircraft flying nearby to escape.

Paris – The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 42, stating, "Our troops conducted local reconnaissance in many areas on the front line yesterday. Several enemy aircraft attempted to attack, but were successfully intercepted by our fighter planes. In addition, the enemy artillery units heavily bombarded our positions south of Deux-Ponts." (Havas, 24th)

Berlin – The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating, "Enemy and our aircraft engaged in air battles on the Western Front, and eight French aircraft were shot down. Both sides' artillery units and scout troops were also active in certain areas. One of our submarines was sunk by an enemy destroyer in a certain sea area." (Havas, 25th)

London – Although Germany is willing to defeat Britain and France with a blitzkrieg, Nazi leaders seem to disagree. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and extremists advocate attacking Britain and France through Belgium, while Air Force Chief Göring and moderates, who often pay attention to the United States, advocate respecting neutrality for the time being. It is important to note that Germany has a 300-mile line in Poland that must be garrisoned, while there are 4 million Soviet troops stationed outside the border. According to French confirmation, no new troops have come from Poland since the first batch of reinforcements was transferred to the Western Front. Therefore, some critics believe that Hitler may hold the Siegfried Line and invade the Netherlands in order to establish air bases near Britain. However, before this move, Hitler may have to put on another show to make the world believe that he really desires peace, but it is being destroyed by the Allied countries that are engaging in military buildup. According to Turkish official sources, the Turkish Foreign Minister will persuade the Soviet Union to guarantee to prohibit German ships from entering the Black Sea and to prevent the Balkans from being drawn into the war vortex.

### The Soviet Union in Central Europe Seizes German Hegemony; German and Soviet Troops Advance Towards the Border; Large Numbers of Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Moscow

Moscow – Soviet troops in Poland are currently busy taking over the positions occupied by the German army, in accordance with the Soviet-German border demarcation agreement. The Central Red Army is now less than 100 miles from Warsaw and can occupy the suburbs of Warsaw, Prague. Several trains, fully loaded with wounded Soviet soldiers, arrived in Moscow last night. This shows that the Polish army did resist the Soviet invasion. It is heard that Germany's cession of large tracts of Polish land has greatly increased the Soviet Union's power in the Black Sea, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Baltic Sea. Therefore, diplomatic circles are greatly concerned about the arrival of Estonian Foreign Minister Selter here last night and the expected arrival of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu in Moscow this afternoon. In light of the development of Soviet-German relations, outsiders predict that the future status of the Baltic states is very dangerous. Staff of the Polish embassy in the Soviet Union are still here, and the departure time has not yet been determined. It is heard that although the Soviet ambassador to Poland is here, the Soviet authorities are currently investigating the whereabouts and fate of the staff of the Soviet embassy in Warsaw. (Reuters, 25th)

Berlin – The German High Command issued a communiqué tonight stating that the German army continues to move towards the demarcation line in accordance with the entire plan on the Eastern Front.

Moscow – The General Staff of the Soviet Red Army issued the following war bulletin on September 24: On September 24, the Red Army units continued to advance towards the determined border, occupying the towns of Sejny, Augustów, and Grodkówek, reaching the line of Augustów, Knyszyn, Bielsk Podlaski, Krasne (40 kilometers northwest of Brest-Litovsk), Bicze (20 kilometers southwest of the same city), Lubaczów (northwest of Hrubieszów, Uhnów, and Rawa Ruska, 20 kilometers), and occupying Komanów, Drohobycz, and Boryslav (towns southwest of Lviv). (TASS, 25th)

Moscow – The Soviet Dnipro River Flotilla, moving upstream along tributaries, is continuing its advance within Polish territory. Yesterday, it reached the railway bridge piers of the cities of Luniniec and Sarny, encountering no resistance along the way and only clearing some of the mines laid by the Polish army. (Havas, 24th)

Berlin – Before withdrawing to the demarcation line agreed upon by Germany and the Soviet Union, the German army held a special ceremony at the Brest Fortress.

Moscow – A special correspondent for "Pravda" recently published an article in the newspaper describing the situation of the Soviet army taking over the city of Brest. It stated that German and Soviet officers met in the city of Brest at 7:00 PM on September 22 to complete the handover procedures. After the German commander's representative informed the Soviet officers of the local situation in the city, the Soviet army entered the city of Brest at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. (Haitong, 25th)

Berlin – German Foreign Policy Director Weizsäcker and Soviet Russian Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev exchanged the instruments of ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact concluded on August 23, 1939, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning. According to the pact, it has been in effect since the date of signing. (Haitong, 25th)

### The Vatican's Attention to the Church in Poland

The future of the Catholic Church in Poland, especially in the part occupied by the Soviet Union, has aroused serious concern here. It is heard that the Pope is personally paying the closest attention to this situation. There have been no reports of religious persecution, but there are fears that the Soviet Union will eventually harass it. (Reuters, 25th)

### Repeated Explosions in Germany; Carelessness in Factories and Coal Mines

Lithuanian Capital – According to news from Berlin, an explosion occurred at the Chuculite factory in the town of Turnbullhof, near Berlin, on the 23rd of this month, and it was burned down. This is the fourth explosion in Berlin in recent days. The German authorities regard it as an organized sabotage movement and have taken various measures to prevent it. (Havas, 25th)

Berlin – The Bocheng coal mine in Westphalia, Prussia, exploded yesterday. It is now known that eight people died and forty were seriously injured. There are still nine miners whose escape routes are blocked, and it is feared that they have perished. (Reuters, 25th)

Bochum – The "Hanover" coal mine here exploded last night due to a lamp accident, killing seventeen people and seriously injuring fourteen. In order to extinguish the fire, a part of the ventilation system has been tightly sealed. (Haitong, 24th)

### 5,000 German Aircraft Bomb Poland; Conversation with the U.S. Ambassador to Poland

Paris – U.S. Ambassador to Poland Biddle, who recently arrived here from Poland with his family via a detour, described how Germany used 5,000 warplanes to destroy Poland's production and transportation within a few days. It is said that German planes constantly traveled over Poland, making the entire hinterland a front line. German planes bombed aircraft factories, preventing them from working, and blocked train traffic and general transportation. The whole of Poland was therefore plunged into chaos for five days. It took the U.S. Ambassador fifteen days to travel from Warsaw via Romania to Paris, and he was at least three times under fire from German planes. (Reuters, 25th)

### Thousands of Square Miles of Polish Territory Handed Over by the German Army to the Soviet Union

Swiss Capital – The "National Daily" of Basel recently commented on the progress of the Soviet army in Poland, stating, "Germany sacrificed tens of thousands of soldiers to conquer thousands of square miles of Polish territory, which has now been handed over to the Soviet Union. What are the feelings of the German army when they are ordered to withdraw? The problem in Eastern Europe is complex, and there is still a crisis. Not only Germany, Hungary, and Romania, but also the Balkan countries. From then on, the actions of the Soviet government are even more important than the actions of the German government." (Havas, 25th)

### Italy Promotes the Neutralization of the Balkans; Estonian Foreign Minister Arrives in Moscow; Bulgarian Aviation Representative Also Arrives

Istanbul – Italy's withdrawal of unnecessary troops from the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea has aroused good impressions among Turkish people. Although this statement has yet to be confirmed, Turkish circles believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will still carry out his plan to neutralize the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. According to this plan, Italy has recently withdrawn troops stationed on the border between Albania and Greece. Turkey believes that Italy's garrison in the Dodecanese Islands near the Turkish Aegean coast is an organic and continuous threat. (Reuters, 25th)

Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German General Report," published an article today commenting on British diplomatic activities, stating that Britain originally planned to use the Balkan countries to form a siege line around Germany. Therefore, it made guarantees to several countries, but its intention was only for the benefit of Britain and its allies. In fact, there is a natural relationship between the Balkan countries and Germany. The exchange of certain goods benefits both sides. Germany has no political desires for Southeastern Europe. What it hopes for is that the countries of Southeastern Europe do not take risks lightly, so as not to hinder their own interests and relations with Germany. For the sake of the Balkans themselves, it would be best to follow the example of the Nordic countries and declare neutrality and stay out of the matter. (Haitong, 25th)

Moscow – Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here at 4:45 PM this afternoon and was immediately welcomed by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Stepanov, and many other dignitaries. Foreign Minister Selter is scheduled to stay here for two days. According to official announcements, the purpose of this trip is to sign a new trade agreement with the Soviet authorities, but it is generally believed that when Foreign Minister Selter holds talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, various other issues, especially the neutralization and disarmament of the islands belonging to Estonia in the southern Gulf of Finland and the issue of a Polish submarine escaping from the port of Tallinn, Estonia, will be submitted for discussion. (Havas, 24th)

Estonian Capital – Estonian Prime Minister Õunapuu delivered a speech at the beginning of the Air Defense Propaganda Week, reiterating Estonia's neutral attitude towards the European War. He said that the Polish government and the Polish state no longer exist, and Estonia's international status is guaranteed by its neutrality policy. The non-aggression pacts signed by Estonia with Germany and the Soviet Union have already taken effect. Estonia's neutrality requires the people of the whole country to adopt a neutral attitude and emotion in speech and in fact. Respect and friendship for domestic minorities are the main conditions for ensuring neutrality. The fact that the Estonian Foreign Minister is currently in Moscow negotiating a new trade agreement with the Soviet Union proves the friendly and normal relations between Estonia and the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 25th)

Moscow – The Soviet authorities yesterday announced a ban on foreign ships passing through the Newa River connecting the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga. Finnish ships are the most affected by this measure, as they have the right to pass through the river according to the 1923 Navigation Treaty. However, the treaty expressly stipulates that the Soviet government has the right to close it in wartime. Therefore, this decision is in accordance with the treaty. (Hai Dian, 25th)

Bulgarian Capital – Bulgarian Director of Commercial Aviation Botev set out for Moscow yesterday. It is said that regular air services will be opened between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria in the near future. This route may be extended to Athens, the capital of Greece. Political figures here hope that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will sign a new commercial treaty in the near future to facilitate the exchange of goods between the two countries. (Haitong, 25th)

Stockholm – According to news from Moscow today, Colonel Auders, Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Air Force, has now arrived in Moscow and is preparing to stay in the Soviet Union for a week to hold important meetings with the Soviet National Defense Headquarters. (Haitong, 25th)

### Warsaw Suffers Heavy Damage from German Artillery and Aircraft Bombardment; About 100 Fires in the City; German Troops in the East Have Been Repulsed

Warsaw – The local radio station broadcast news at 8:00 PM this afternoon, stating that German artillery bombarded the city all day long, and many shells fell in the city center, causing many casualties. At the same time, many enemy planes came to bomb, and the Ujazdowski Hospital, which had a Red Cross flag, was bombed, and many wounded soldiers and women and children died. Enemy planes also dropped many incendiary bombs, and the National Opera House and other important buildings were set on fire, but "the citizens are spirited and determined to resist to the end." Although the enemy infantry units have repeatedly launched attacks, they have been repulsed by the defending troops. (Havas, 24th)

London – Warsaw radio reported that Warsaw was subjected to continuous bombardment yesterday. The Church of the Savior was hit by a bomb during mass, killing and injuring many people. A part of the Red Cross Hospital was also destroyed, and many wounded soldiers and women and children died in the hospital. German troops attempted to attack many times during the day, but were all repulsed by Polish soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. (Reuters, 25th)

Warsaw – The Defense Headquarters broadcast a war bulletin last night stating, "German artillery has been bombarding our city and the Modlin fortress area all day long. There are very few houses in the city that remain intact. There are hundreds of fire pits in the 24 hours of yesterday, and the number of civilian casualties is extremely high. The enemy's siege of the Modlin area is very fierce, but it is still held by our troops. The enemy troops in the east of the city have been repulsed. On the left bank of the Vistula River, our army launched three counter-attacks last night, capturing many prisoners. The morale of the people in the city is very high." (Havas, 25th)

Swiss Capital – Although the German side issued a communique yesterday stating that the Polish war has ended, according to news received by the Basel Newspaper in Switzerland, the Polish army is still continuing to resist, and is organizing secret groups in the occupied areas, similar in nature to those organized by the Polish national hero and former Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, during the last European war to resist Russia, but on a larger scale, and aimed at resisting both Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 24th)

Paris – Military experts here recently commented on the Polish army's resistance, saying that the Polish army's defense of Warsaw was very brave. Previously, when the German side advanced deep alone, the Polish army could have taken advantage of its fatigue to launch a heavy blow, but because the Soviet army suddenly entered and attacked its rear, it led to an irreparable defeat. In terms of the geographical situation of Poland, it was originally in a disadvantageous position militarily. In addition, in order to make world opinion aware of its efforts to seek peace, the Polish government did not implement general mobilization until the last minute. This delay in opportunity was undeniable. The deployment of Polish army units at the beginning of this month was as follows: (1) One army each was stationed in the northern cities of Suwałki and Mława to defend against the German East Prussian army. (2) One army was deployed in the corridor area, commanded by General Bortnowski. Later, due to the unfavorable terrain of the corridor, General Bortnowski withdrew the main force to the southern area after obtaining the consent of the General Headquarters. (3) Two large armies were deployed in the central region to defend the western border, one in the northwest in the province of Poznań, commanded by General Kutrzeba, and the other in the southwest in the province of Upper Silesia, taking a strategic position with the defenders of Częstochowa. (4) One army was stationed along the Beskidy Mountains in the southwest to defend the southwestern border, with the province of Kraków as its base. As for the industrial area in the eastern part of Silesia, which had no defenses, it was originally planned to be destroyed and implement a scorched earth policy when the German army attacked. Later, the army unified by German General Kluge entered the corridor, and the army unified by General Reichenau entered Upper Silesia, immediately encircling the Polish army from both flanks. There were a total of three attempts, all of which failed. Although the Polish army's communication lines were completely destroyed by the German army, it was still able to withdraw eastward in an orderly manner and was not completely annihilated by the German army. Only one army in the province of Poznań was blocked between Kutno and Łódź. The Polish army then fiercely resisted in Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk, which was very successful. The German army's advance was greatly frustrated. At that time, the Polish army could have launched a counter-offensive in the central region to relieve the siege of the garrison in the province of Poznań, but the Soviet Union suddenly sent troops to attack its back, causing the Polish army to miss a good opportunity to turn defeat into victory, which is regrettable.

Editorial

### The Question of Revising the American Neutrality Act

America's traditional foreign policy is divided into three aspects according to region: towards Europe, advocating neutrality and avoiding entanglement in the vortex of war as much as possible; towards the Far East, adhering to the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity; and towards the Americas, rejecting foreign influence, i.e., implementing the "Monroe Doctrine." National policy is subject to fluctuations due to changing circumstances, but its essence remains constant. In the two years since the outbreak of war in the Far East, the United States has grasped its Far Eastern policy with a combination of firmness and flexibility. Recently, the unfortunate outbreak of war in Europe has once again presented the most serious test of the American neutrality policy. As for the Americas, Germany and Japan have long been engaged in conspiratorial activities in Mexico and Central and South America; and after Canada declared war on Germany, the United States immediately felt the extension of the state of war to its northern neighbor. With such complex international relations, how can the United States stand outside the vortex while taking into account all three aspects of its national policy? This is what the American authorities are pondering and anxious about.

Currently, international attention is focused on the revision of the Neutrality Act in the special session of the U.S. Congress. This newspaper has already pointed out the various shortcomings of the current U.S. Neutrality Act. (See editorials of January 7th and March 11th of this year); President Roosevelt has been doing his utmost to advocate revision so that he can maintain neutrality on the one hand and sanction aggression on the other. His painstaking efforts are worthy of admiration. Today, let us briefly analyze whether the revision of the Neutrality Act can be implemented in this special session and the impact of the revision on the Far Eastern situation.

First, we should be clear that the revision of the Neutrality Act is not related to American national policy; even if the amendment fails, it does not mean that American national policy has overturned its traditional spirit and adopted isolationism. It can only be seen as a victory for the Republican Party's political warfare. In other words, the current issue of revising the Neutrality Act has changed from a foreign policy issue to a political struggle between the Democratic and Republican parties, which is significantly different from the situation at the beginning of this year. But in our observation, the revision of the Neutrality Act is very likely: (1) Although the Neutrality Act has the significance of avoiding involvement in the vortex of war, its impact has caused significant damage to American industry and commerce. Automobile King Ford once said, "The only people who want to revise the Neutrality Act are those who want to take advantage of it to manufacture arms on a large scale for profit," which is somewhat exaggerated, but it also reveals a part of the truth. Even President Roosevelt has publicly stated that "the shelving of the Neutrality Act amendment seems harmful to industry and commerce." Since the expiration of the "cash and carry" clause on May 30th of this year, the United States has been absolutely unable to export arms to any belligerent country. This matter, in a political sense, is enough to encourage Hitler and disappoint Britain and France, not to mention that in an economic sense, it is not tolerable to American industry and commerce. So we can imagine that American arms dealers, financial groups, and general industry and commerce will inevitably exert strong pressure on members of Congress. (2) Since the outbreak of the European war, American public opinion has become increasingly strong in advocating the revision of the Neutrality Act, and all newspapers in the country, except for the Hearst system, are supporting President Roosevelt; America is a democratic country, and public opinion has authority. (3) The above-mentioned amendment was shelved in the vote of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by only one vote; and many of the senators who advocated delaying the discussion assumed that the European war would not break out. Now that the European war has not only broken out, but also has a tendency to prolong and expand, the premise of the assumption no longer exists.

What is worrying is that the issue of revising the Neutrality Act has unfortunately become a tool of political struggle. Originally, whether the Neutrality Act should be revised and what the advantages and disadvantages are vary from person to person. The debate between the two sides in Congress had long been exhausting, and all members of Congress, except for a few so-called "die-hards," had long been tired of hearing it and thought that revision or no revision was fine, and had no preconceived notions. Only those "die-hards" and opposition parties took the opportunity to engage in activities, vigorously spreading the word that President Roosevelt plans to participate in the third presidential election next year, but because domestic affairs are unsatisfactory, he plans to regain his lost prestige in foreign policy. Recently, Landon, the Republican presidential candidate who failed in the previous election, also publicly stated that he does not oppose the Neutrality Act amendment, but it should be conditional on Roosevelt's declaration not to participate in the third election, saying that Roosevelt hopes to use the revision of the Neutrality Act to eliminate party opinions, which is not fair. That is simply admitting frankly that the Neutrality Act is a tool of political struggle, which is enough to make outsiders feel chilled! Everyone has a sense of shame, and the great American citizens must be able to clarify this atmosphere!

As for the impact of the Neutrality Act on the Far East, Japan has never hoped that the Neutrality Act can be revised, because the United States' export of arms benefits Britain and France, but at the same time, it also benefits Japan, which has a huge navy and merchant fleet. But the problem is not that simple, because China and Japan have not declared war, which is fundamentally unrelated to the Neutrality Act; second, China actually buys very few arms from the United States and does not use this as a source of resistance; and third, Japan's gold is running out and it cannot afford to buy large quantities. Moreover, the United States has long had the determination to formulate separate measures for the Far East, but it cannot be implemented immediately because of the obstruction of US-Japan trade; now that US-Japan trade will expire next spring, when to renew the rights is not in Japan. Even if Japan can take advantage of the revised Neutrality Act, at most it will be only two or three months. Not only that, in this special meeting of the US Congress, I heard that there are also four proposals to deal with Japan, and we can pay attention to its whereabouts!

### Britain and France Reject Mussolini's Mediation; German Press Praises Italy's Mediation; Italian Press Claims Central Europe Will Be Affected

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain will address the House of Commons tomorrow and reply to the proposal of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to mediate the European war. The Information Department criticized Mussolini's speech on Saturday, stating, "Britain's principles remain unchanged and will be implemented with unwavering determination." (United Press, 25th)

London - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks on Saturday that Europe has not yet entered a state of war internationally have aroused semi-official criticism from the French side, believing that Britain and France have already made it clear that they will fulfill their mutual assistance agreement to protect Poland. At the same time, London welcomes Mussolini's statement that Italy will continue to be neutral and avoid expanding the conflict. As for Italy's preparations to deal with all events, it is considered a natural precautionary plan that all neutral countries must take. However, the British side finds it difficult to agree with Mussolini's opinion that hostile actions can be stopped now, because the British war aims have been clearly announced by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and cannot be changed due to the temporary collapse of Poland. (Reuters, 25th)

Rome - The Fascist Party is quite disappointed with the response of Britain and France to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's call for an end to the European war. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, published an opinion in the Italian People's Daily, saying that if this opportunity is not accepted, the turmoil will spread to Central Europe. (Reuters, 25th)

Berlin - The "German General Report," reflecting the views of the German Foreign Ministry, commented on Mussolini's speech in yesterday's article, stating that the Italian Prime Minister recognized the responsibility of leading Italy, a world power, and the protector of Fascism, and made appropriate remarks to the people of the country and the world on the current situation and its consequences. Mussolini exposed the double policy of the democratic countries towards Poland and restoring Poland in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles as an illusion, because the Soviet Union's participation in the Polish war has eliminated the possibility of restoring Poland. The report believes that Mussolini will maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude and be prepared to deal with any extraordinary events. The report concluded that Mussolini can represent the true peace front and represent the majority of people who hope to localize the war and limit the war period. (Haitong, 25th)

Berlin - Political figures in Berlin believe that it is expected that Britain and France will reject Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal to localize the war, but they are very surprised by the lack of sufficient reasons for the rejection. The reasons of Britain and France are nothing more than that Britain and France declared war on Germany because they had an obligation to assist Poland. However, the Soviet Union's position on Poland is the same as Germany's. Why don't Britain and France declare war on Russia? Political figures in Berlin pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal at this time was not accidental, but because the first phase of the war had come to an end, it was an appropriate time to mediate peace. Now that his proposal has been rejected, Italy's attitude must be affected. As for Germany, whether it has the confidence of final victory or enters a new stage of the war, it has the supply of a large number of minerals and agricultural products from Poland, and the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in military, economic, and political aspects. If Britain and France want to reject the peace talks, they should go to the end. According to Berlin political circles, in the international arena, Britain originally hoped that Japan would adopt a pro-British attitude, but due to German diplomatic intervention, the Soviet Union and Japan have signed a truce agreement, and Britain has felt disappointed. In addition, Romania has adopted an isolationist attitude towards Britain, and Turkey is also working hard to adjust relations with the German-Soviet group. It can be seen from this that the international situation is not necessarily favorable to Britain and France. However, Germany has no demands on Britain and France, so it does not start an attack on the Western Front, but is waiting in strict array. (Haitong, 25th)

### German Propaganda Minister Refutes Rumors

Berlin - The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that Propaganda Minister Goebbels made a speech to the newspapers yesterday, first stating that he had issued a statement some time ago that the neutrality of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg should be respected, and now he is willing to declare that other neutral countries are also respected by Germany. A newspaper in a certain country once carried a report that six leaders of the German National Socialist Party possessed huge amounts of money and had secretly deposited them abroad, which is absolutely untrue. This was fabricated by an American journalist, Hungerbock, who was in London at the time. I believe this is a lie made by the British intelligence department. At that time, it was rumored that the private property of the main figures of the National Socialist Party totaled 900,000 pounds, or 500 million marks. This statement was then published by American newspapers, and British and French newspapers were also happy to reprint it. At this time, even the newspapers of various neutral countries were competing to publish the war. In order to counter this lie, I only have one method of counterattack, and because Hungerbock claims to have various documents sufficient to prove that we actually have funds deposited in banks in the United States and Britain, I used radio broadcasting to ask him to publish these documents in the newspapers of the United States and Britain. I am willing to offer a commission for each sum of money. If Hungerbock does have such documents, he only needs to lift a hand to earn 50 million marks within 24 hours (Havas, 24th)

### British and French Diplomatic Authorities Meet with Soviet Ambassador; Germany and the Soviet Union Have Different Dreams; It Is Considered Still Usable

Paris - Foreign Minister Tribert met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this morning for a long time. Political figures commented on this, saying that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. From this, it can be seen that Britain and France and the Soviet Union can maintain their diplomatic normalcy and talk to each other to determine their intentions. In addition, the Turkish diplomatic representative Sarajoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union at this time. Combining the trends of all parties, it is worthwhile to pay attention. Regarding the events in Eastern Europe, from the perspective of the position adopted by France in diplomacy, political figures recently made the following remarks, stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once said in his speech that if Britain and France were really fighting for Poland, why not declare war on the Soviet Union? It is known that Britain and France declared war on Germany because they received an application from Poland on September 1, and immediately provided assistance in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement. However, Poland did not make the same request after the Soviet army entered the country, and from a military point of view, the Western European countries could not directly attack the Soviet Union, so declaring war would not help Poland, let alone promote practical political cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union. This is unwise and does not need to be said. The German-Soviet agreement may not last long, and this war will last for a long time. For this reason, although the Soviet Union is in the position of an accomplice to Germany, since the country has declared that it will continue to maintain neutrality, it is better to formally accept it than to reject it in vain. In short, this war is a long-term war of attrition. The conflicting goals of Germany and the Soviet Union are numerous. The union between the two is only temporary. (Havas, 25th)

The Japanese army retreated to Taolingguozhenshi. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and pursued, attacking Taolin on the 22nd. The Japanese army resisted for a while. After the Chinese army bravely charged and killed more than 200 people, the Japanese army was unable to support and collapsed to the area of Chang'an Station Linhu. Taolin was recovered. (25th)

桂林 - A few Japanese troops were found on the north bank of the Guishui River Jiatang (northwest of 汨罗) on the morning of the 24th and are currently confronting the Chinese army across the river. Dozens of Japanese cavalrymen are also harassing Qingniwan, west of the river. (25th)

桂林 - A part of the Japanese army that landed at Yingtian arrived at Dongtang Nanhu (southeast of Yingtian) on the morning of the 25th. The battle there is extremely fierce.

桂林 - The Japanese army that crossed the Xinqiang River on the 24th fought fiercely with the Chinese army near Changhu (southeast of Xinqiang) all day. A force of more than 5,000 people invaded southwest of Dajing Street (northwest of Changle Street) at noon, seemingly trying to spy on Changle. The Chinese army is intercepting with strong forces. The Japanese army at the Xinqiang intersection moved southwest on the morning of the 25th, seemingly intending to attack Hua汨罗. The Chinese side is strictly guarding against it. (25th)

重庆 - According to the news here today, the offensive of the Japanese army in northern Hunan, both land and sea, was annihilated by the Chinese army on Saturday and Sunday, killing more than 3,000 people.

重庆 - The war in northern Hunan is still going on on both sides of the Xinqiang River. It is reported that since September 18, the Japanese side has suffered as many as 10,000 casualties. The general public attaches great importance to the current war in northern Hunan, because it can test the strength of the Chinese and Japanese armies after two years of war. Whether the Japanese army can still attack and what kind of performance the Chinese army will have after two years of training and re-equipment can all be known from this. This war in northern Hunan only concerns the fate of Changsha and cannot determine the final victory or defeat, but its results can reveal the future military positions of China and Japan. According to the Chinese side, the purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Changsha is only to set off firecrackers to decorate the "new government" that is about to be formed. (Reuters, 25th)

高安 - After the Japanese army was defeated in Gaoan, they gathered more than 2,000 remnants and invaded west from Fengxin on the 23rd, launching fierce battles with the Chinese army near Yecheng in Shangfu for days. The Chinese army bravely fought back, forcing back the Japanese army and killing more than 200 people. Starting on the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army attempted to attack again fiercely, and the battle became more intense. Until the afternoon, the fighting was still mixed near Shangfu. After the Japanese army on the front line of Gaoan suffered a major blow, they did not dare to invade again, and the war turned silent. (25th)

桂林 - The center of the war in central Jiangxi seems to have shifted between Fengxin and Shangfuzhen. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Xubu arrived in Luofang Yecun on the 23rd and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army.

常德 - Japanese warships in Dongting Lake have been harassing everywhere recently. They attacked and occupied Liuxingshan on the evening of the 23rd.

重庆 - According to the Dagong Daily, the offensive of 60,000 Japanese troops against northern Hunan, which began last weekend, has caused the waters of the Xinqiang River to turn completely red due to the Chinese army's indomitable response. The Japanese army, with the fierce bombardment of 30 gunboats and the assistance of 200 speedboats, was able to land at Yingtian, 47 miles north of Changsha. Before the Japanese army successfully landed at Yingtian, there were dozens of tug-of-war battles, and both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for Xiangyin, 7 miles south of Yingtian, it was completely bombed by Japanese aircraft on Saturday and Sunday. According to Huafang military intelligence, the commander of the Japanese army is Nishihara, the commander of the Japanese division. Nishihara's strategy is different from the side wing flanking strategy that the Japanese side is happy to use, and he is good at breaking through the middle. Nishihara was originally in the Nomonhan area. Recently, the Japanese side planned to attack Changsha and Yichang, so he was transferred to the Dongting Lake area. As for those who lead the Chinese army, they are Xue Yue and Guan Linzheng, both of whom are brave and good at fighting. (Associated Press, 25th)

重庆 - According to a Hua Fang strategist told the Associated Press reporter that the current war in northern Hunan is the largest war since the fall of Wuhan and Nanchang. The goal of the Japanese army's attack this time is obviously Changsha. When Wuhan fell last year, Hua Fang had expected that the Japanese army would attack Changsha in one go, but after capturing Wuhan, the Japanese side was obviously exhausted, so they had to give up their attempt to occupy Changsha at that time. The senior Hua Fang strategist also said that since the fall of Wuhan and Nanchang, in terms of Hua Fang's entire occupation, Changsha's position is no longer important, but the purpose of Hua Fang sending elite troops to guard northern Hunan is not only to defend Changsha, but also to deplete the Japanese army's military fire and manpower. In the second phase of the war of resistance, the strategy adopted by Hua Fang is to use various opportunities to deplete the strength of the Japanese side in preparation for the third phase of the war of resistance. He also said that the Chinese army in northern Hunan has fought very bravely for a week and has caused more than 6,000 casualties to the Japanese army so far. As for the current strategy adopted by the Japanese army in northern Hunan, it is Nishihara's strategy. The breakthrough on the Nanchang front last time was due to his strategy. Now that the Japanese side plans to attack Changsha and transfer Nishihara from the Hashinle River, they will of course follow his old strategy. According to the current plan of the Japanese side, it seems that they will first take Changsha, and then advance along the highway to the northwest to Shashi Yichang. At the same time, they will also go south from Changsha to open up the Yuehan Road, trying to establish contact with the Japanese army in northern Guangdong. (Associated Press, 25th)

长沙 - The Xinqiang 汨罗 lines launched bloody battles at the same time on the evening of the 24th and the morning of the 25th. A part of the Japanese army that sneaked across the Xinqiang River joined those who landed at the Jiuma Mouth of the Deer Horn and invaded south in two ways. One way invaded Rongjiawan and Huangsha Street along the railway, and the other way invaded the Changhu Highway along the Xinqiang to 汨罗口 Road. At the same time, the Japanese army that occupied Yingtian also invaded east along the south bank of the 汨罗 River, seemingly trying to capture 汨罗 in three ways. The Chinese army, with the morale of fighting more and more bravely, determined to succeed or die, and respectively fought against the Japanese army on the Xinqiang 汨罗 lines, and broke each of the Japanese armies. In this battle, the Japanese army left more than 2,000 corpses between Xinqiang and 汨罗, of which the corpses of Japanese officers and cadres accounted for more than 60. The Chinese army also captured many people and seized countless rifles, warhorses, and other military supplies. When the war was tense, the people on both sides of the 汨罗 River either lived peacefully or assisted in the war, which made the soldiers on the front line even more courageous. According to Takahashi Isshiki, the squad leader of the 116th Regiment of the 13th Division of the captured Japanese army, in this battle in northern Hunan, in addition to the ×th, ××th, and ××th Divisions and the Marine Corps, because of the heavy casualties from continuous attacks, the ×th Division, which is known for its combat effectiveness, has recently been newly transferred to reinforce it. The losses of the Japanese army can be seen from this. Also, after noon on the 25th, the Xinqiang 汨罗 lines were still in fierce fighting. (25th)

### Ferocious Battle on Hongtun Road Lasts for Ten Days; Chinese Army Wins Repeated Victories; Intense Street Fighting Erupts in Fucheng Town; Japanese Reinforcements Suffer Heavy Casualties

Luoyang: The battle situation on Hongtun Avenue has become increasingly fierce since the 10th. The Japanese army entrenched in Fucheng Town was besieged by the Chinese army's ×× unit. They broke in through the southwest gate, resulting in intense street fighting. On the 16th, 600-700 Japanese soldiers from Hongdong reinforced, and 500-600 Japanese soldiers from Beiping Town also took the opportunity to invade from the south, attempting to coordinate with the Fucheng battle. They were intercepted by the Chinese army's ×× unit in Caoyu Village and Chuan Town, respectively, resulting in heavy casualties for the Japanese. On the 17th, the Chinese × unit continued to clear out the Japanese forces retreating to the central area of Fucheng, and the street fighting intensified. On the same day, hundreds of Japanese soldiers from Anze came to aid via Gao Village East, and more than a thousand Japanese soldiers arrived from Linfen to Xiwu Cen (east of Fushan).

With the cover of fierce artillery fire, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers who passed through Xiwu Cen sneaked into Mabi Village on the 20th (northeast of Qinshui). After the Chinese ×× unit launched a large-scale counterattack on the 21st and 22nd, attacking from both the north and south, the Japanese could not withstand it and retreated. The Chinese × unit then ambushed them in Caojia Cen and Songshu Bei (both northwest of Mabi). The Japanese suffered even heavier casualties. Currently, most of the Japanese have escaped from Xiwu Cen, with a part hiding in various valleys, and the Chinese are searching. In summary, since the situation on the Hongtun Highway became tense, after ten days of fierce fighting, the Chinese army has been winning repeated victories. The Japanese army has suffered nearly a thousand casualties. The Chinese army has also captured one artillery piece, 60-70 rifles, and a large amount of other military supplies.

"I do not believe that the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have any intention of attacking Hong Kong. What I do not understand is why the Hong Kong authorities are preparing defenses so actively. Furthermore, after the outbreak of the European war, it is difficult for Chongqing to obtain supplies of arms, so the Japanese side is not preparing to destroy it immediately, but hopes that after the establishment of a 'new central regime', it will cause internal strife."

(Associated Press telegram of the 25th)

Panama City: The Pan-American Conference opened yesterday in a completely harmonious atmosphere. This proves that the representatives of the twenty-one American republics unanimously believe that this conference must achieve various practical results so that the Western Hemisphere will not encounter crises in the economic and other aspects due to Germany's aggressive actions. Representatives of various countries all expressed sympathy for the British and French people here. Conversely, the nineteen German expatriates here are no less than "isolated." The general opinion can be seen here. Foreign observers here also said that since US President Roosevelt came to power, the relationship between American countries has obviously made great progress. The policies promoted by Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles have sufficient reason to be clearly demonstrated at this conference, that is, "the united relationship between American countries is not a castle in the sky" and will become more and more obvious. The issues to be discussed at this conference are nothing more than (1) the protection of American transportation lines, (2) the protection of the territories of American countries, (3) the adjustment of the economic life of American countries since the outbreak of the European war.

Regarding this point, the current Neutrality Act stipulates that US citizens can still grant "normal short-term commercial credit" to belligerent countries.

### British Intelligence Agency Refutes German Claims

London: According to the intelligence agency, although the German Foreign Ministry's recently published documents on the final stage of the German-Polish dispute have been disguised in many ways, it is difficult to erase the truth or blame others for the war. The German government did not mention a word about the illegal appointment of Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in Danzig, as the head of the Free City of Danzig, or the fact that the British government had opposed Germany from the beginning using an ultimatum to demand that Polish representatives must arrive in Berlin by midnight on August 30 to receive the proposal. Germany then said that it had delivered its proposals to the British Ambassador Henderson and explained it in detail to him, but did not specify the date. Germany criticized Britain for rejecting Italy's mediation, but also explained that Britain had stated that it would refuse negotiations unless Germany stopped attacking Poland and agreed to withdraw German troops from Polish territory. In this German document, the meetings between the British Ambassador and Hitler on August 23, 25, 28, and 29, and the meetings between the British Ambassador and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the evenings of August 30 and 31 are not mentioned. Therefore, the content does not seem very accurate. The reason why Hitler and Ribbentrop did not show the people the situation in the country during these two days is very obvious. They have various motivations and do not want to show the German people and the world the truth, that is, that the crisis was caused by Germany's actions. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)

### Swedish and Finnish Cargo Ships Sunk by German Submarines En Route; British Cargo Ship Halsall Also Suffers Disaster

Oslo: The Swedish merchant ship Ballater, weighing 1,500 tons, was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes 15 miles off Langsund on the southern coast of Norway. A Norwegian torpedo boat saw it and often sent 18 to 20 Swedish sailors ashore. The ship was carrying paper pulp to England. This is the fourth ship sunk by German submarines off the coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula in three days. At the same time, according to Berlin news, German officials agreed with the sinking of two Finnish ships carrying celluloid to the UK at the end of the week, saying that if German submarine captains allowed ships carrying military supplies to sail to the UK, they would be committing treason. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)

Berlin: The British cargo ship "Halsall" was sunk by a German submarine near Cork yesterday. Among the 34 crew members, two women escaped in a lifeboat and 12 were missing. It is said that the ship was attacked without any warning. Three people were shot. (Associated Press telegram of the 25th)

Amsterdam: The "Handelsblad" published today a list of merchant ships sunk from September 2 to 23. It is said that a total of 41 merchant ships were sunk, including 31 British ships, 4 German ships, 2 Finnish ships, 1 Dutch ship, 1 Greek ship, 1 Belgian ship, and 1 Norwegian ship. The newspaper stated that the British ships sunk totaled 140,445 tons, accounting for 0.75% of the total tonnage of merchant ships, and the lost fishing boats are not included. The German merchant ships lost accounted for only 0.33% of the total tonnage. (Haitong telegram of the 24th)

Capital of Sweden: Two Finnish ships, carrying celluloid and wood pulp, were sunk in the Kattegat Strait (between Norway and Denmark) by German submarines. Upon hearing the news, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in Northern Europe were worried about the escalation of German submarine warfare. The Finnish newspaper "Uusi Suomi" stated that celluloid and wood pulp are not contraband, and it is not appropriate to allow submarine captains to decide what goods are contraband. The Finnish newspaper "Hufvudstadsbladet" stated that it is undoubtedly clear that Finnish ships did not carry contraband. Sweden, as a celluloid exporting country, naturally feels anxious. The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated that the celluloid carried by the ships is not contraband for either Britain or Germany. The "Dagens Nyheter" stated that Germany claimed that it would not interfere with neutral countries' trade, but now it has gone back on its word. The "Aftonbladet" stated that the Swedish authorities intend to request an explanation from the German government regarding this matter. (Havas telegram of the 24th)

Capital of Sweden: The Swedish cargo ship "Gertrud Bratt", carrying a batch of celluloid for papermaking to the UK, was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes en route. The Swedish newspapers were already very anxious about the sinking of two Finnish ships by German submarines yesterday. Upon hearing this news, they became even more uneasy and indignant, as can be seen in today's newspaper comments. The newspapers all said that celluloid should not be considered contraband, and this item is not included in the German list of contraband. Sweden's interests, which are closely related to foreign trade and survival, will be greatly threatened by German submarine warfare. The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated, "German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder recently issued a statement that he would not interfere with the trade of neutral countries. This matter is contrary to the above statement. It seems that most of Sweden's export goods have been included in the German contraband list. Our country's import and export trade will be impossible to maintain in the future." The "Dagens Nyheter" stated, "Celluloid is an important export product of our country, and we should continue to find ways to export it and resolutely resist Germany's claims." (Havas telegram of the 25th)

Capital of Lithuania: Regarding the sinking of two Finnish ships by German submarines, according to reliable sources, Finnish Minister to Germany Wu Limaia protested to Germany because of this. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop replied that German submarines are allowed to sink ships of various countries carrying celluloid in wartime, which is permitted by custom, and neutral countries should regard this as a warning when transporting goods to the UK. (Havas telegram of the 25th)

London: The British cargo ship Halsallside was sunk by a German submarine. Twelve crew members are missing, including the captain, chief mate, and third mate. According to a wireless telegram from the ship, the German submarine fired without warning. Two crew members died on the spot. Although the captain tried to escape quickly, there was no chance. Two lifeboats were destroyed, so 15 crew members escaped in a small boat that usually only carries seven people, and seven others left the ship on a raft. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)

Helsinki: The German side claimed that the three Finnish ships sunk by German submarines in the past three days carried celluloid that could be used to make explosives, and the location of the three ships was too far from Germany to be detained, so they were sunk. According to Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, the UK has detained thousands of tons of celluloid bound for Germany, so Germany has taken this action to show retaliation.

### A Comparative View of the Two European Wars (Continued)

— Chen Chuxiang

For years, Britain's policy of tolerating Hitler was not without reason. She feared France's dominance and took precautions to prevent it. Therefore, she pulled up Germany to restrain France. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact, they both indicated that Britain desperately wanted them to be enemies, which was also based on the recognition of Britain's role. In general, if we acknowledge that the Sarajevo incident was the fuse of the previous Great War, and that Germany fought to fulfill its alliance with Austria, and Britain fought to maintain Belgium's neutrality, etc., were all excuses, then we must also acknowledge that the Danzig and Corridor issues were the fuse of this Great War, and that Britain and France fought to fulfill their promise to Poland, and Germany fought to lift the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and Poland's mistreatment of Germans, etc., were all excuses. Regardless of their proclaimed war aims, if we consider them comprehensively, it is more appropriate to say that Germany was pursuing a policy of dominance in Europe, which Britain could not tolerate, and France was even more unwilling to sit idly by, leading to the war. This argument seems to imply that Germany is the instigator, but my response is that whether the policy of dominance in Europe should be pursued, and whether Britain should prevent it, are not for me to defend, let alone to take sides.

Before the previous Great War, there had been four crises. This time, it seems that there have not been so many crises. It is also interesting to compare the locations where the crises of the two European wars occurred. The crises of the previous European War, except for the third Balkan crisis that occurred in Europe, the other three did not occur in Europe. The points of contention were all on the opposite side of the Mediterranean Sea, in Africa in the colonies. This time, only Italy's annexation of Abyssinia was outside Europe. If we include it as a crisis, the crises before the previous European War were all clearly caused by the direct conflict of interests between the two main parties, such as the Franco-Italian dispute over Tunisia, the Franco-German dispute over Morocco, and the Austro-Serbian dispute over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The conflicting parties in the various crises that have occurred this time are not so simple. In the Abyssinian incident, Britain stirred up all the members of the League of Nations to oppose Italy. The Spanish Civil War, if it is also called a crisis, is even a recognized small-scale world war. Only the Sudetenland crisis last autumn was relatively similar, but the strength of Germany and Czechoslovakia differed greatly, which was still not as "evenly matched" as the two sides in the previous four crises. However, the Sudetenland dispute is still the best comparison with the Austro-Serbian dispute in the previous war. Serbia was weaker than Austria, and Russia, although it wanted to help it, feared Germany. As a result, it persuaded Serbia to compromise, and Austria, because Serbia had Russia behind it, temporarily satisfied with obtaining Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise, given Austria's usual ambitions, it might not have had to wait until its crown prince was assassinated to take action against Serbia (of course, Germany's permission and assistance were even more important). What is different is that during the Sudetenland crisis, Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to buy temporary peace in Europe, and later lacked the determination to guarantee it, so Czechoslovakia eventually fell. In this Polish question, if Poland had yielded or Germany had retreated, it would have been very possible to temporarily turn it into a crisis without becoming the fuse of a great war. However, the so-called meaning of Poland's yielding is that Poland would have to sacrifice its exports and access to foreign trade. If it did not have Britain and France behind it, it might have been able to consider it. With Britain and France behind it, and Britain and France believing that they had reached the highest limit of tolerance and had to insist, then Hitler would naturally say that this war was caused by Britain giving Poland a blank check, encouraging it to be tough on Germany. If Germany did not have the stimulant of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, it might have been able to temporarily retreat a little, but that assumption still has many questions. If what Germany and the Soviet Union concluded was truly a military alliance as rumored outside, Germany could rely on it to offset the mutual assistance between Britain and France to Poland, and even fundamentally eliminate the courage of Britain and France to help Poland. What Germany has obtained now is only to use the Soviet Union's power to jointly destroy Poland so that it can fully deal with Britain and France. Since the Soviet Union has stated that it is still willing to maintain neutrality with Britain and France, whether friction will occur after direct contact between Germany and the Soviet Union is highly questionable. No wonder some people say that Hitler is "working for others," while Stalin is reaping the benefits.

However, Britain and France repeatedly stated that they would abide by their promise to aid Poland, and Hitler himself also assumed that Poland's toughness was caused by Britain's promise to provide assistance in various circumstances. If what he said was really what he thought in his mind, then he would not necessarily be completely mistaken in judging that Britain and France would not intervene in the war. Perhaps he was confident that he would win this war, but we cannot but understand the weaknesses and pains that a dictator cannot express himself. Although he can erase the observance and guarantee of international treaties at any time, a word to the domestic audience is always a word, not to mention that Germany has been sailing smoothly for several years, and the current setbacks would greatly violate its honor and shake the public's faith in the government. From this point of view, we can conclude that the outbreak of this war has its inevitability. Germany wanted to dominate Europe and pursued it, but Britain and France could not tolerate it and aided Poland to resist Germany. Within the first two or three days of the war, the general view was that after Germany achieved its goals in Poland, it would present a fait accompli to Britain and France and request peace talks. Now Britain, France, and Poland have mutually agreed not to make a separate peace, and the Soviet Union, although it has sent troops to divide Poland, Britain and France still claim that they will help Poland until its sovereign rights are fully restored. It can be seen that the possibility of a quick end to this war seems very small. Looking back to the beginning of this century, Austria followed Germany's lead in everything, so its development can be compared to Germany's own development. In addition to Germany's own ambitions, it ultimately could not be compatible with Britain's traditional policy, which led to the war. The events before and after are remotely opposite. Although the saying that history repeats itself is still debatable, it is not too much to say that the evolution of history has a fairly fixed law. In 1914, Germany, Britain, and France were the main actors, and they are still the main actors now, and they are still standing on the opposite sides as before. The direction of the two confrontations is also the same. Poland has replaced the position of Russia in the previous war. The previous war was launched by Austria and Germany, but now it is Germany. However, the direction of actual action is different. The attitude of Russia (Soviet Union) is the most important influence. In the previous war, the German General Staff initially adopted a western offensive policy, wanting to use lightning tactics to first subdue France, and then turn its troops to the east. Therefore, it violated Belgium's permanent neutrality and first launched an offensive on the western front. On the eastern front, it was because the internal affairs of Tsarist Russia were corrupt, and secret mobilization had exceeded two weeks, and it had already announced formal mobilization, but the troops had not yet been concentrated. Because it had nothing to fear from Russia, it only adopted a defensive posture, waiting for work at leisure. This time, Germany's goal was originally Poland, so it adopted the fierce offensive on the eastern border that was the western front in the previous war, while the western border relied on the Siegfried Line as the Great Wall, focusing on defense. In the previous war, Russia attacked East Prussia, but this time its replacement, Poland, was attacked by Germany and the Soviet Union. France was originally beaten, but this time it adopted a posture of hitting people (to be continued).

### Tzu Lien Hui Disposes of Children from Disaster-Stricken Educational Institutions

The Joint Disaster Relief Association of Philanthropic Organizations has been handling the work of sheltering refugees and providing relief since the war. People from all walks of life in the city have highly praised it. Because of the difficulty in raising relief funds and the fact that the number of refugees has indeed decreased significantly compared to before, it has been decided to end the operation, giving those refugees who can support themselves funds to dismiss them. However, they are quite troubled by the educational affairs of the adults and refugee children that have been handled. After several consultations, it is reported that a decision has been made. Those who are truly unable to do so but have excellent academic performance will be recommended to transfer to various schools in the city.

### Charity Tennis Exciting Program Xu Chengwei vs. Wang Wenzheng Wang Wenzheng Gives Up Handicap Semi-Finals Li Guofan Zhang Dingzhao to Decide Champion on Saturday

The handicap tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Tennis Club, the semi-final of the men's singles Wang Wenzheng vs. Li Guofan, was originally scheduled to be played at the Shanghai Tennis Club at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday. It is learned that Mr. Wang gave up the final rights to Li Guofan in order to induce younger generations. Therefore, although Wang and Li went to the stadium on time the day before yesterday, they did not officially compete, but practiced doubles with Zhang Dingzhao and Liang Dexian. Therefore, Zhang Dingzhao will compete with Li Guofan for the championship in the men's singles final at 2:00 pm on September 30. The charity tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been extended to two consecutive days this weekend (i.e., September 30 and October 1), and ten box seats have been added in time to adjust the seats and increase revenue. It is now learned that the first box seat has been sold by Mr. Pan Zhiquan and Shi Zhaoji for 100 yuan in legal tender. Enthusiastic philanthropists will surely rise up in response. The original admission tickets issued for September 23 and 24 can be used for September 30 and 31. Among the charity tennis performance programs, there is also an exciting program, Xu Chengwei will perform a singles match with Wang Wenzheng. Since Xu came to Shanghai, there has been only one official game, which was a 2-3 loss to Carson. This game was held at the Citibank General Assembly, and only one or two reporters were present. Many tennis players, because they have not seen Xu's true face of Mount Lu, are looking forward to it very much. Yesterday, at the suggestion of Mr. Shen Zhenchao of this newspaper, and urged by Mr. Chen Qihao, he has generously agreed to perform a singles match with Wang Wenzheng. Judging from their results against Carson, their strength is difficult to distinguish. Once they meet, it will be the most exciting performance of tennis players this season.

### Hong Kong Football League Opening Postponed Until October 7

Hong Kong News. The Hong Kong Football Association held a meeting on the 12th at the Guangdong Bank on the fifth floor, and the resolution has been seen in the previous communication. The details are recorded below. The attendees included Huang Jiajun (representatives of Groups B and C), Yi Shishe Lanchi (Hong Kong Club), Jubei (Police), Binwu (Army), Guba (Navy), Holland Shi (Eastern), Chen Hanming (South China), Jianjin (St. Joseph), Gaodunbei (Honorary Secretary), Sousa (Deputy Honorary Secretary), and many others. Chairman Bi Laite was unable to attend due to business, and Huang Jiajun represented him. Regarding the opening of the Group A, B, and C leagues, which was originally scheduled for September 23 (Saturday), representatives of various associations successively expressed their opinions, all of which were that the league did not need to be suspended, but only that the game schedule be slightly delayed. The representatives of the Army and Navy also thought so. As a result, everyone agreed to postpone the league for two weeks and open it on October 7 (Saturday). The case was passed.

Double Tenth Festival Charity Match

The General Assembly resolved that a charity football match will be held on the National Day of October 10 for the Hong Kong Yingzhang Chinese Branch, with the Chinese League against the Hong Kong League at the Hong Kong Club Stadium. The Governor of Hong Kong will attend to watch the game. The players of the two teams will be selected by the Management Sub-Committee. The representative of the Hong Kong Club, according to the proposal of Yi Shidulan, said that for any charity competition held at the Hong Kong Club Stadium, the Hong Kong Club would rather sacrifice 10% of the ticket revenue to obtain 150 free admission tickets for members. As a result, all the committee members agreed to this matter.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition

The Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai in November this year, and Hong Kong had already agreed to the request. Recently, the outbreak of the European war has raised this issue for discussion. According to Mr. Huang, "In view of the current situation, it is difficult to decide whether to go or not, because many members of the volunteer army of various associations cannot get away to Shanghai, and military personnel also feel the same difficulty. It is best to wait for a few weeks and listen to Shanghai's opinions before making a decision." Everyone agreed and passed. Regarding the issue of how much time should be added after the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition ends in a draw, both sides held their own opinions. Hong Kong insisted that 20 minutes be added after the draw (10 minutes for changing fields), while Shanghai insisted that 30 minutes be added (15 minutes for changing fields). Recently, the General Assembly received a letter from Shanghai stating that the Shanghai General Assembly Committee members still insisted on the 15-minute proposal. If Hong Kong's final decision still maintains the original opinion, Shanghai can also accept it. As a result, the Hong Kong committee members passed the proposal to add 20 minutes after the game ended in a draw because the Shanghai side had made concessions.

Harboring Selling Pressure, Foreign Exchange Reverses and Loosens, Sassoon Sells British Gold, Buys American Currency

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices showed a half-yuan increase for the Japanese yen, reaching 26.5 yuan, and a 0.25 increase for the Dutch guilder, totaling 11.25 yuan. Other currencies, such as British and American, remained stable. The grey market for British and American currencies had dissipated due to the disappearance of various rumors, which gradually stabilized market sentiment and led to a slight easing of market conditions. However, the morning's opening was slightly soft due to weak sales from non-professional traders. British gold was quoted at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, and the US dollar at 6.875 yuan. But soon, Shanghai Chinese yarn and cotton merchants, along with Hong Kong Electric, suddenly exerted selling pressure, and the buying interest of a certain bank also improved. As a result, the situation immediately reversed and eased. In the afternoon, further selling pressure came from Hong Kong via telegrams. Although Western merchant Sassoon absorbed some US dollars, the position still felt ample. British gold once traded above 4 shillings 2.8125 pence, and the US dollar also eased to 7.09375 yuan. Chinese merchants suddenly seized the opportunity to switch from selling to buying at low prices, and Sassoon also absorbed US dollars. Therefore, the closing price for British gold was 4 shillings 2.5 pence, and the US dollar at 7.0625 yuan. Compared to last weekend, British gold eased by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.15625. The trend for September and October futures was similar to the spot market. Midway, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly sold British currency and bought US currency at an exchange rate of 3.9761 yuan. Furthermore, American bank Chase Manhattan entered with larger sell orders and exited with smaller buy orders, conducting US dollar swaps with Chinese merchants, with a discount of 0.09375 US dollars, resulting in a monthly interest rate of about 1.35%.

Dutch and Japanese Exchange Rates Lengthen

At the beginning of the morning, there were no telegrams from London with the prices from major firms or Bank of America. London's raw gold remained fixed. Exchange rates for British vs. American and British vs. French remained stable, while British vs. Shanghai decreased by 0.125. American vs. British fell by 0.25, American vs. Shanghai decreased by 0.05, and American vs. French decreased by a small amount of 0.025. The Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4 shillings 1.5625 pence for British gold and 6.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to last Saturday, British gold was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was slightly softer by 0.03125. After opening, Western merchant Sassoon sold spot British gold to non-professional traders at 4 shillings 1.875 pence, a stable condition. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, Dutch and Japanese currencies lengthened, while the rest remained stable. When the silver equalization tax was announced, there were no increases or decreases. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly entered spot US dollars at 6.9375 yuan, with an exchange rate of 3.9761 yuan. Later, Chinese yarn and cotton merchants, along with Hong Kong Electric, successively sold spot British gold to non-professional traders such as Chase Manhattan at 4 shillings 1.875 and 2.1875 pence, and spot US dollars at 6.9375 and 7.0625 yuan. At this time, the hardest British gold was traded at over 4 shillings 2.5 pence, so the underlying trend slightly eased. Approaching noon, there were slight September and October swap transactions. Chase Manhattan discounted US dollars by 0.09375 to Chinese merchants for arbitrage, which was about 1.35% monthly interest. Extending to the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings 2.1875 pence for British gold and 7 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the morning opening, British gold eased by 0.0625 and the US dollar hardened by 0.125.

### Gold Market Initially Rises Then Slightly Weakens, Revolving Around 4,100 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold grey market conditions initially rose then weakened, with the trend revolving around 4,100 yuan. The various false rumors from the past week began to subside today. However, the final result was a slight downward trend due to the easing of foreign exchange. The opening was encouraged by the slightly tight foreign exchange, reaching a high of 4,120 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling from silversmiths, the price immediately returned to a low of 4,100 yuan. However, soon a Hong Kong group suddenly created a buying trend, forcefully purchasing over 300 taels, and securities firms also frequently absorbed gold, causing the market outlook to strengthen. The price rose to a high of 4,168 yuan. Subsequently, due to the easing of foreign exchange, silversmiths and gold firms competed to aggressively sell, and the securities firms also reversed their position to sell, leading to an unsustainable situation. The price plummeted to 4,080 yuan. At noon, the condition slightly stabilized, closing at 4,115 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial condition was still stable. Subsequently, due to the continued slight easing of foreign exchange, retail appetite suddenly waned. In addition, a certain gold firm tended to sell on behalf of speculators. Although the Hong Kong group still had some buying appetite, the position still felt oversupplied. The price once fell to a low of 4,064 yuan. Later, retail investors took advantage of the low prices to raise the market, and the price rebounded to close at 4,085 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to last weekend's noon close. Trading was still active throughout the day, with over 1,500 taels traded. Silversmith jewelry gold also fluctuated, ultimately remaining unchanged. Customs gold remained stable.

Spot Small Silver Yuan

Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially opened with news of slightly soft foreign exchange, the situation was stable. Gold firms initially sold ten taels to money exchange businesses for 4,120 yuan, 15 yuan higher than last weekend's noon close. After opening, due to silversmith selling pressure, the price immediately fell back 20 yuan. Silversmiths sold thirty taels to money exchange businesses for 4,100 yuan. Afterwards, the appetite of a certain money exchange business improved (absorbing on behalf of the Hong Kong group), and sellers became fewer, immediately raising the price by 40 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought ten taels from a fellow firm and a cash firm, each at a price of 4,140 yuan. At this time, because the foreign exchange slightly turned from soft to hard, the sellers were slightly more active, and the price once retreated to 4,115 yuan. However, soon the Hong Kong group revived the buying trend, and the securities firms also tracked and absorbed purchases, causing the market to trend upwards again, soaring by 53 yuan. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange businesses for 4,168 yuan. Subsequently, the Hong Kong group and others stopped buying to observe, and because foreign exchange continued to harden, the securities firms also reversed their position to sell. Silversmiths and a certain gold firm also sold quite forcefully, and the market outlook became unsustainable, soon plummeting by 88 yuan. Cash firms sold ten taels to money exchange businesses for 4,080 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stabilized, the selling trend of silversmiths and a certain gold firm slightly subsided, so general retail investors took advantage of the low prices to absorb purchases, recovering 50 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought twenty taels from securities firms for 4,130 yuan. Approaching noon, the price fell again. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels among themselves for 4,115 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon market initially opened flat. Money exchange businesses bought ten taels from silversmiths, still at 4,115 yuan. Subsequently, because foreign exchange carried hardness, a certain gold firm frequently sold, and at the same time silversmiths also still had a selling appetite, immediately weakening the price by 20 yuan. Silversmiths sold ten taels to gold firms for 4,095 yuan. At this time, another Yu firm absorbed on behalf of the Hong Kong group, and securities firms also slightly improved their appetite, so the price recovered by 10 yuan. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange businesses for 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm's selling trend became increasingly strong, forcefully selling on behalf of speculators. In addition, there were few buyers, and the price actually collapsed by 41 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels among themselves for 4,064 yuan. Later, the selling trend slightly subsided, and gold firms and money exchange businesses took advantage of the low prices to absorb purchases, so the price slightly rebounded. Gold firms bought ten taels from money exchange businesses for 4,085 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price decreased by 20 yuan compared to last weekend's noon close. It was heard that after closing, silversmiths and money exchange businesses in the field traded 30 taels among themselves, with prices all the same as the evening closing price. Later, money exchanges bought ten taels from silversmiths, with a price of 4,090 yuan. The selling price of cash firm's original brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. The current standard gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.

At 3:00 PM, the price decreased by 5 yuan. At 4:00 PM, the price recovered by 5 yuan. In the end, there was no change. It was calculated that both Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang were still suspended at 415 yuan, with the purchase price decreased by about 20 yuan.

### British and American Treasury Notes Are Actively Demanded and Rise Exclusively

Yesterday's foreign currency market trend turned soft. After the foreign exchange market was repeatedly sold off by Hong Kong telegrams, the market was quite hard, resulting in American gold notes initially rising slightly in the morning, then immediately falling back to 14.35 yuan. The result was a fall of 0.3 yuan. British gold notes also fell by 0.6 yuan, Hong Kong notes decreased by 0.02 yuan, Annam notes fell by 0.35 yuan, Robi notes decreased by 0.2 yuan, Korean notes decreased by 0.005 yuan. The trend for Japanese gold notes was still strong, and the final price was still 1.345 yuan. British and American treasury notes were in high demand, so they continued to rise uniformly by 1 yuan. Otherwise, there were no changes.

The interest rate for the Qianye Association remained unchanged, opening at 0.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities

Domestic Debt Trading Quiet, 25th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Lottery Held in Chongqing

Public debt grey market trading was no longer as exciting as in the previous few days. Large bullish investors were still waiting for the right time to move. Yesterday's buying and selling saw very few large investors entering or exiting. Those seeking to sell could not obtain the desired price, so they also returned disappointed. Those making up for purchases could easily obtain the goods. Trading all belonged to scattered retail investors. Afternoon trading was initially good then weakened, smaller than in the morning. The market price result was slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. The 96 issue reversed to become better by 0.1 yuan. The number of transactions was around 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Yarn and Cotton

Industry Stockpiling, Cotton Prices Expected to Rise

The trading of native cotton white packages was still fairly weak. Factory Shenxin and other factories had slightly improved appetite, but the amount consumed was not expanded. Japanese merchants were also in a wait-and-see attitude. Industry sentiment was firm. Although the current source of Tongzhou cotton was still actively arriving, difficulties had occurred in the Huangpu River. Generally, people were worried about future risks. Therefore, a certain cotton firm's intention suddenly changed course. For goods with excellent quality, the opening price was 150 yuan, which was 7 yuan higher than the previous day. It exclusively consumed several thousand packages, flocking to the stacks to stockpile and wait for prices to rise. Cotton prices with slightly inferior quality and moist cotton were still stable. Over 3,200 packages of Tong cotton continued to arrive from Subei, 800-900 packages from Changyinsha, and 1,500 packages from Beisha. The current cotton opening price list is on the left.

In other news, the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai yesterday did not have much change. However, the inventory in Shanghai was not high, so the cotton price reversed to be high. The willingness of industry members to sell was very loose, and they were temporarily unwilling to sell. Currently, raw materials above 32 counts were very rare in the market. Industry members had a small amount of spot goods, but they were not planning to sell them. Factories had a very strong need for this type of cotton, and it was very difficult to purchase. Yesterday, the market price for American species new special cotton that could spin 20 counts was over 190 yuan, and the White Rock price was 172 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was relatively calm yesterday. Because exporters were not active, the market was unusually stagnant. Later, because some bulls settled and industry members slightly sold off, the result was a closing price that fell by 6-7 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell 6 rupees including forecasts. The Egyptian Liverpool market was closed.

### Coarse Yarn Sales Are Active

The yarn market is still firm, but the rising trend feels more gradual. In fact, part of the psychology is that its bottom has already been high, and the amount of funds has been reduced. Therefore, the rising power of upper-body yarn prices is gentle. However, the prices of medium-count yarns are relatively cheap, so they are slowly rising. For the 10-count coarse yarn of the guest group and Hong Kong group, sales are smooth. Because the price distance from 20-count yarn is too far, and it is also the peak season, market transactions have greatly increased. The profits of factories are not as thick as fine yarns, and they are relatively thin.

The opening sentiment for current yarn in the morning was still tight. Because raw cotton arriving in Shanghai had difficulties in the Huangpu River, people were optimistic. The opening price immediately rose by 10 yuan. The single price for 20-count Double Horse stack was 750 yuan, and the spot price was 800 yuan. There was a slight fluctuation in the middle, but the 10-count coarse yarn saw a healthier appetite from the guest group, and the market condition was indeed rising. By the time of closing, the momentum was slightly flat and tired. The amount of transactions was 1,255 packages in half a day. The market quotations for 20-count Double Horse rose by 15 yuan, Tiannv rose by 10 yuan, Muyang rose by 9 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 5 to 10 yuan. The amount of purchases from each group is listed on the left:

Hong Kong 600 Fellow Firms 560

Mainland 95 Total 1,255

Rice Prices Difficult to Lower for a While

Du Geng: Yesterday, there was no arrival of goods from Hebei for each group. The new goods from Che Lun, Baozi, Kunshan, Jiading, and other areas were only 3,000-4,000 packages. Therefore, the opening market was in good spirits, and there was a desire to shout high prices. Afterwards, the local street shops acted because the market was closed yesterday, which suddenly tightened the situation. The prices of goods rose all the way. If Gengjian all increased by about 1 yuan. By the evening market, the purchasing of the local street suddenly relaxed, and the Autumn Festival was approaching. Therefore, after a movement, the condition was tired. As a result, the market quotation of new goods and new sharp declined by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. It was calculated that special Chang Geng was 39 yuan, the market price was 35 yuan, special Xi Geng was 38 yuan, high goods were 36 yuan, middle goods were 34 yuan, Su Tong Kun Geng were 33-34 yuan, and Kun Zhuan Zhoupu and other new Geng were 26-27 yuan.

As for Su Kun Jia Hu and other new Yang Jian, the opening price was 26 yuan to 25.5 yuan, Lu Jian was 25.5 yuan to 25 yuan, Jiangbei Jian was 24.8 yuan to 24 yuan, and Wuhu Jian high was 25.2 yuan, the market price was 24.5 yuan, the final price was 23.5 yuan to 22.5 yuan, and Bian Yuan was 32-33 yuan. The number of transactions was over 6,000 packages in the total market.

Guest Xian: In recent days, the arrival of goods from Jiangbei has been blocked by a certain party. Road transport inland has also been blocked. In order to prepare for the week holiday and the Autumn Festival break, the sellers were all maximizing their purchase, and once raised by more than a yuan in the morning. Following that, a Japanese sold the entire batch of goods at once with the price being at 22, 23, and 24 yuan for the goods of high, medium, and low quality respectively. The sellers all turned to look at the prices, so the market prices fell back by 0.5 yuan. The result was only about 0.5-0.6 yuan higher in price. The high Guest Xian was 25.2-25.3 yuan to 24.8 yuan, and the final market price was 24.5 to 23 yuan.

### Prices Rise Again with Slightly Active Momentum

Flour: Yesterday, prices were high again. The demand for No. 2 flour was gradually increasing in Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and other places. Each Nanyang merchant's appetite for purchasing goods has also been connected, in addition to the Mid-Autumn Festival with the moon cake industry in bulk transactions occurring frequently. Total market local and guest transactions combined for about 50,000-60,000 packages. The No. 2 flour factory's market price has not changed, and is still 7 yuan in cash. The returned goods have been increased to 7.156 yuan, which is more than 0.1 yuan above last weekend. There were 50,500 bags of flour sent to Tianjin today, and 500 bags sent to Tanggu, and 13,000 bags sent to Hong Kong.

Wheat: The source of wheat is still not plentiful. There were more than 20,000 bags arriving in two days. Most of the carriers think the costs are high and want to sell at high prices, but the market and stockpiling households are not enthusiastic to buy and sell. So it is difficult for the market to be good. Fuxin factory bought from local markets, and other places from Suzhou and Taicang a total of 4000+ bags of wheat. Stacking households pulled up 4-5 carts. The highest price was at 10.02 yuan. The market price increased from a few minutes to a yuan from what was before.

Sexual Health

### Essential Knowledge for Youth: Health Can Promote the Growth of Love

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of a Medical University in Russia

What is the treasure of a healthy family? It's simply remembering the slogan "unity of spirit and flesh." The establishment of a family requires maintenance through both "spirit" and "flesh." Eating and sexual desire are natural, indicating that the relationship between husband and wife cannot be encompassed by the pure meaning of "spirit." Facts tell us that indulgence can harm the body, so pure materialism cannot maintain a marital relationship forever. In short, emphasizing one aspect is the most erroneous concept.

Unity of spirit and flesh is the key to building a happy home, something we should absolutely trust. So, how do we allocate it evenly? How do we practice it reasonably? A simple concept should be introduced to readers. Unsatisfied reproductive needs often lead to "estrangement," and may even tempt one party down an immoral path. Therefore, we must ensure the health of our reproductive functions. On the one hand, we must not indulge in self-harm, thus avoiding kidney deficiency. At the very least, this provides strong insurance against emotional breakdown. In daily interactions, both parties have a duty to support the development of affection. In short, both "spirit" and "flesh" should be allocated evenly, and their separate exercise should adhere to the two major principles of "propriety" and "moderation."

When the emotions between husband and wife are strong, the atmosphere of the family becomes harmonious and warm. However, if the body is not cultivated, love cannot grow. Therefore, health can promote the growth of the sapling of love, a point we deeply hope readers will pay attention to.

Indulgence is enough to harm the body. Excessive intercourse, especially for men, can lead to spinal cord symptoms, weakened lower limbs, mental decline, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation, and even incomplete development. Youth is like vibrant grass; if afflicted with the above ailments, wouldn't they lose their precious future entirely?

For the sake of love's future, such diseases must be treated quickly. German Jürgens' testicular extract preparation for men, "Panteston," is the leader among modern endocrine agents. Three doses a day effectively nourish the brain, blood, and essence. It is most suitable for nervous weakness, pale complexion, kidney deficiency, infertility, and premature aging. I have used it in clinical practice for seven years and have never encountered a case where it was ineffective, so I dare to introduce it to patients. The female "Panteston" is an ovarian endocrine preparation with the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.

Gonorrhea Anecdotes

### Leucorrhea Can Absolutely Be Cured Radically

— Dr. Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Is it really impossible to cure gonorrhea using scientific methods? In fact, it is not. Gonorrhea can be conquered with scientific methods. However, the method of treatment must be thorough and scientific, which depends entirely on the doctor's experience. If one can maintain health and heed the doctor's instructions, then those afflicted with gonorrhea can be cured. One must deliberate deeply and thoughtfully during treatment to avoid failure. However, I often see general gonorrhea patients eager for a cure. Because the disease cannot be cured immediately, they inevitably reveal anxiety. And the general over-the-counter medicines and doctors on the market cater to this, claiming that using such-and-such medicine or such-and-such treatment can completely cure the disease within two or three days. The result, however, is that they still cannot escape the pain of gonorrhea after three or four months, and they become more and more trapped in a state of confusing gonorrhea symptoms, which is irreparable. Therefore, it is necessary to use targeted therapy to completely eliminate the gonococcus because only by completely and fundamentally eradicating gonorrhea can one avoid adverse prognoses.

According to the analysis and testing of new drugs by doctors in various countries each year, the only drug worthy of being called a special medicine is "Kliron," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, which is sufficient to surpass any oral gonorrhea medication in the world. Because its bactericidal power permeates all the cells of the body, no matter where the gonococcus flees, it cannot escape the bactericidal circle of "Kliron." For gonorrheal prostatitis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, orchitis, urethral stricture, etc., taking "Kliron" can absolutely cure them, because the scope of its bactericidal power is not on the surface or in a local area, but directly eliminates the gonococcus at the site of the lesion. As for external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution," and women can use "Carder Sheath Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, so that internal and external routes are used to eliminate the gonococcus, and the cure is even faster.

### The Seriousness of Coughing

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Coughing is a symptom that is most easily overlooked. The reason is that those who cough do not have any immediately dangerous or terrifying symptoms, so they keep delaying treatment, and the cough becomes more and more severe, leading to an incurable state.

From a truly pathological point of view, coughing is a way for the lungs to expel harmful substances that have invaded from the outside world, and it is a form of resistance and defense. Using anesthetics actually reduces resistance. Based on my experience of more than 20 years and referring to experimental reports from doctors in various countries, the lung disease-specific medicine "Pulmonal," invented by Dr. Thome of Germany, is the most effective. No matter how stubborn and difficult to cure or how close to consumption a cough is, taking "Pulmonal" can relieve coughing and dissolve phlegm within three hours. Its effect of strengthening the lungs and preventing consumption is far above that of cod liver oil. This has been proven by doctors in various countries. —Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Health Tips

### The Depth of Harm from Masturbation for Men and Women

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Everyone knows that male masturbation can cause pathological changes in the spinal cord and brain nerves, so after prolonged indulgence, nervous weakness, back pain, and spermatorrhea occur, and the harm is endless. However, in women, there are also various harms, but compared with men, they are not as severe. According to expert surveys, female masturbation is not as common as male masturbation. The physiological harm suffered by those who engage in it is far less than the psychological harm. Because once a woman engages in masturbation, her beautiful virtues of chastity and tranquility are completely lost. Therefore, women who masturbate easily fall, and are mostly candidates for future prostitutes and adulteresses. But after prolonged indulgence, it can cause inflammation of the sexual organs, menstrual disorders, and frigidity. From a hygienic point of view, masturbation has hundreds of harms and not a single benefit. Young men should abstain from it. If you feel that your body is deficient, take the testicular essence preparation for men, "Panteston," at any time to restore the damage caused by masturbation. At the same time, take "Night-Eze Emission Pills" to stop spermatorrhea. For women, they can take female "Panteston" to remedy the situation.

Gonorrhea Musings

### Special Treatment for Gonorrheal Cystitis

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrheal cystitis occurs when a patient with acute or chronic gonorrhea undergoes poor local irrigation, or when engaging in intercourse while holding urine during chronic gonorrhea. All of these can cause the gonococcus to invade the internal bladder. Patients experience lower abdominal pain, frequent urination, cloudy urine, and even blood in the urine. If this continues day after day, the disease will become more severe. If treatment is not sought early, the original bacteria of gonorrhea will further invade the kidneys, resulting in gonorrheal pyelonephritis. This is a very serious condition, and treatment must be prompt. Because the spread of gonorrhea is increasingly prevalent, a variety of complications can arise. However, we must be careful about these treatments. If we use general local treatment or transmucosal bactericidal treatment again, it will not help and we will only make one mistake after another. We should be very careful.

In short, gonorrheal cystitis should be treated as soon as possible. My treatment for gonorrheal cystitis begins with a scientific examination to determine the location of the lesion. After diagnosing the location of the lesion, I use the gonorrhea-specific medicine "Kliron," as well as German electrostatic therapy and X-ray therapy, to work together. In this way, cystitis during acute gonorrhea can be cured in two weeks. If it has become chronic cystitis, then three or four weeks will absolutely cure it. I have 20 years of experience in the treatment of gonorrhea. Whether I prescribe oral medicine, apply surgery, or use electrotherapy, I can treat it according to the symptoms, and I can achieve the desired effect quickly. After the above treatment methods, the symptoms of gonorrheal cystitis can be quickly reduced and even completely cured in a short period of time, and there are absolutely no cases of failure. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, we will provide consultations for 20 patients each day. Each consultation will cost only 50 cents, and we will give away a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one dollar.

### Sham Police Actions Rampant: American Sailor Suddenly Detained, Held for Two Hours Before Release, US Forbids Officers and Soldiers from Going to Roads Outside the Boundary, Unwilling to Negotiate This Case with the Spurious Side

After the spurious police invaded the roads built beyond the boundary in West Shanghai and ran amok, causing trouble repeatedly, a public bus driver was kidnapped by thugs in Caojiadu the day before. That same evening, an American marine was detained by the spurious police for two hours. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department instructed the local police station to take stricter precautions in the important areas of the roads built beyond the boundary, causing the situation in West Shanghai to become tense again. Detailed reports are as follows:

Minor Incident Leads to Detention

According to the Continental News, an American Marine from the Fourth Regiment was detained by "Avenue" police in West Shanghai at 9:00 PM last night (the 24th) for a few hours, and was not released until 10:55 PM. The incident occurred in front of the Wellcome Café near Zhaofeng. As of late last night, the details were still unknown, but it is known that the American soldier had an argument with someone. The café's hired usher blew a whistle, and twenty "Avenue" police officers went to the scene upon hearing the sound. They then got into a struggle with the American soldier. The American soldier was outnumbered and overpowered, and was put on a truck and driven to the "Avenue" police station on Jessfield Road.

Released After Two Hours

The Public Concession Police Department and the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marines were immediately notified and began discussing the release of the soldier. After several hours of discussion, the American soldier was released. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps authorities feared that such incidents would continue to occur, so they immediately prohibited Marine soldiers and sailors from going to the Yu Garden Road area, and dispatched patrols throughout the area, ordering all sailors and Marine soldiers to leave. As a result, after 1:00 AM, the taverns and bars and apple game stores near Zhaofeng Park on Yu Garden Road had very few customers.

U.S. Orders Ban on Officers and Soldiers from Visiting

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, an American Marine was detained by "Avenue" police on Yu Garden Road last night. This morning (the 25th), a senior U.S. Navy officer told reporters that officers and soldiers of the Fourth U.S. Marine Regiment are now prohibited from going to the entire road area beyond the boundary in West Shanghai. This order was issued by Colonel Fagan, commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment, today and will remain in effect until further notice.

Unwilling to Conduct Investigation or Negotiation

Regarding this accidental incident, this morning, Lieutenant Colonel Murray, Executive Officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, stated that the Marine Corps is taking "routine actions" with regard to the Marine soldier involved in the incident. The U.S. Marine Corps does not intend to conduct any investigation or negotiations with other parties regarding this matter. After the accidental incident occurred, U.S. military patrols arrived in the Yu Garden Road area and ordered U.S. soldiers, including sailors of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, to leave the area. The order was carried out in an orderly manner without hindering the civilian customers of the taverns in the area.

Dispatch Teams to Investigate and Block Re-entry to the Area

There are also U.S. Marine patrols stationed near the Paramount Ballroom at the corner of Yu Garden Road and Jessfield Road, intercepting all vehicles heading to Yu Garden Road, aiming to prevent soldiers of the Fourth Marine Regiment from entering the area. Within half an hour after the accidental incident occurred, teams of three or four "Avenue" police officers patrolled every 400 yards on Yu Garden Road.

Police Department Has Increased Security

This morning, the Public Concession Police Department increased security on Yu Garden Road and other roads beyond the boundary. According to those who drove along the roads beyond the boundary, although the Public Concession police allowed the cars to pass without obstruction, the "Avenue" police stationed a few yards away from the Concession police would order the cars to stop and carefully inspect the cars before allowing them to continue driving. It is heard that the Police Department has received special instructions regarding its duties in the area beyond the boundary. However, the Municipal Council authorities were unwilling to disclose any new steps currently being taken in the area this morning.

Security Concerns on Roads Built Beyond the Boundary

The Caojiadu area has been outwardly calm recently, but a public bus driver was kidnapped there at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Police and spurious police officers witnessed the incident, but most did not intervene. Security is a concern. Yesterday, at (1) Jessfield Road and Connaught Road, (2) Connaught Road and Singapore Road, and (3) Jessfield Road and the branch road of Brenan Road, traffic was entirely directed by spurious police. Concession police retreated to the sidewalks to keep watch. At the remaining stations such as (1) Jessfield Road and Robison Road, and (2) the intersection of the branch road of Brenan Road, spurious police and Concession police were still stationed, maintaining the original double-station state.

Situation Eases Yesterday Afternoon

At the intersection of Jessfield Road, Edinburgh Road, and Haig Road, the police station originally sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the area, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Yesterday afternoon, there were only four Chinese detectives patrolling on the sidewalks, and the situation seemed to have eased. Traffic at the Qiu Garden front and the intersection of Connaught Road was entirely managed by spurious police. However, there were more spurious police stationed in front of Qiu Garden, a total of eight. The situation from Kangjia Bridge to Malu Bridge remained the same as before, with no changes seen. There were six spurious police officers each stationed at the intersections of Yu Garden Road and Jing'an Temple Road, on the sidewalks at each corner. Traffic was also managed by spurious police. The original eight stationed police officers had been reduced to four, and the situation was not as tense as before. The two spurious police officers stationed at the entrance of the Meiliyuan Lane on Great West Road had not retreated. The number of trucks carrying spurious police on Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road had decreased significantly yesterday.

Police Station Takes Strict Precautions

The situation at the intersection of Haig Road and Edinburgh Road has been more tense than other places since the spurious police stationed there on the 17th. The police station has taken very strict precautions. However, there were only six detectives stationed there yesterday, and the armored vehicle had also been moved to another location. The fortress built by the Japanese and spurious side in front of the No. 448 Lin's Mansion is still under construction. The number of spurious police defending it had been reduced from the original dozen or so to six yesterday. From Difeng Road to Fahua Town, armed spurious police are still patrolling in formation from time to time.

### Japanese Residents Oppose the Electricity Company's Price Increase, Have Appealed to the Municipal Council

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News yesterday (the 24th), the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Road Federation met on Saturday and Sunday nights and unanimously opposed the Shanghai Power Company's proposed 120% fee increase. The committee has recently appealed to the Municipal Council, protesting the Bureau's approval of the power company's continued fee increase. They will take concrete action after receiving a response from the Municipal Council.

### Various Industries Suggest Establishing a Price Evaluation Committee to Trade Associations, But in Fact There May Be Difficulties, Hoping the Authorities Will Suppress Hoarding and Manipulation

The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously issued a notice to the competent authorities in various places, together with the local relevant chambers of commerce and trade associations engaged in daily necessities, to establish price stabilization committees to handle the price stabilization of local daily necessities in order to suppress investment manipulation and stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various places. Now, various provinces, cities, and counties in non-occupied areas have successively established price stabilization committees as ordered. As a result, prices in various places have stabilized, and there has been no speculation or manipulation. As for Shanghai, due to the harsh environment and special circumstances, various speculators hoard goods because the government's power does not reach them, resulting in soaring prices.

Capitalists Hoard on a Large Scale

Since the outbreak of the European War, general asset holders have been hoarding goods, especially daily necessities such as food, fuel, oil, and sugar. The soaring prices are unprecedented, and the prices are not uniform, which is very distorted. The livelihoods of citizens are greatly affected, and legitimate merchants have difficulty trading. It is heard that various trade associations have suggested to the trade associations,

Suggest Following Government Regulations

Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to work with the Concession authorities to establish a Shanghai Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, limited to daily necessities. The method should be based on the government's promulgated measures for price evaluation and suppression of speculative manipulation during extraordinary periods. However, after considering the establishment of the Price Evaluation Committee, the various industry associations,

In Shanghai, the Facts are Difficult

Believe that there may be difficulties in Shanghai in fact. However, it is hoped that the Concession authorities will investigate and deal with those who speculate, hoard, and manipulate daily necessities on the market, in order to maintain security and avoid affecting the livelihoods of citizens.

### Various Debts Due at the End of September: Principal and Interest Paid on Time, Gold Bond Discounted by the Four Banks, Suspension of Payment for the Telecommunications Public Bonds

The Ministry of Finance has always maintained its creditworthiness. Domestic bonds are regularly drawn for repayment of principal and payment of interest. Before the principal and interest are due, they are allocated from the designated collateral items and handed over to the banks that pay the principal and interest for payment. There have never been any delays, which has gained the trust of bondholders. According to inquiries from the banking community yesterday, the public bonds with principal and interest due on September 30 include: (1) The Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 17, issued in November of Year 17, with a fixed amount of 45 million yuan. This is the twelfth repayment of principal, amounting to 1.125 million yuan. Because it is collateralized by customs revenue, after the government was forced to suspend payment of principal and interest, the National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China to change the payment method to discounting by the four banks. In Shanghai, it is paid in six installments to the Hui Gong; (2) The Consolidated Guangdong Financial Public Bonds, issued in October of the Republic of China Year 25, with a fixed amount of 120 million yuan. This is the sixth repayment of principal, amounting to 2.4 million yuan; (3) The Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging US Dollar Public Bonds, issued in April of the Republic of China Year 26, with a fixed amount of 2 million US dollars. This is the fifth repayment of principal, amounting to 40,000 US dollars. The principal and interest of the above two types of public bonds due will be paid on time by the Central Bank and other payment agencies; (3) The Telecommunications Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 24, issued in October of the Republic of China Year 24, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan. This is the sixteenth repayment of principal, amounting to 400,000 yuan. Its competent authority is the Ministry of Transportation, and its collateral is the revenue from international telegraphic fees. Now, because the revenue from international telegraphic fees has been stolen, payment of principal and interest has been temporarily suspended.

### The Japanese Erected Boundary Markers in Section A North of the Suzhou Creek, Marked with Chinese and English to Indicate the Security Boundary Line, Four Places Erected Within Section A, Forcing Residents to Get Vaccinations Again These Days

In Section A, north of the Suzhou Creek, which encompasses the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, after the British and Japanese defense lines were changed, the Japanese army has erected a boundary line on the east side of North Henan Road. The work of compulsory vaccination is also continuing. The details are described as follows:

Erect Boundary Markers on North Henan Road

Since taking over the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road, in addition to the Japanese soldiers stationed at the west entrance of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, there have been no other changes. However, at 1:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese military vehicle suddenly drove to the entrance of North Henan Road, carrying more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, who erected white signs with red characters bearing the words "British-Japanese Security Area Boundary Line" in Chinese and English at various intersections on the east side of the road.

Four Intersections Have Been Set Up

According to a survey conducted yesterday evening, the locations where the above-mentioned boundary signs were erected include: (1) the northern boundary of the Tianhou Temple Bridge on North Suzhou Road; (2) in front of the Sanmin Hospital on Tiantong Road; (3) on the side of Zhang Shunxin Sauce Surround on Qipu Road; and (4) the southern end of the small vegetable field at the intersection of Wenjianshi Road. Signs have not yet been erected at the intersection of Haining Road and Old Bazih Road.

Compulsory Injections Continued Yesterday

Under the canvas tent erected by the Japanese army on the side of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the west entrance of North Jiangxi Road on Haining Road, local residents continued to be forced to receive vaccinations and issue vaccination certificates yesterday. The vaccination date has been limited to the end of this month. Those who do not have a vaccination certificate after the deadline will lose their residential qualifications in the area.

Vaccination Deadline is the End of the Month

Because local residents are subject to the above coercion, the tent is crowded with people waiting for injections, and order is easily disrupted. Starting the day before yesterday, two Japanese soldiers were dispatched by the Japanese side to suppress the crowds. Yesterday, two "Avenue Police" were added. One of the Japanese soldiers also held a rattan whip and waved it at any time to drive away idlers watching nearby.

Defense of North Henan Road Remains Unchanged

The former British military garrison at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazih Road and the Railway Hospital at the west end of the road have not been occupied by the Japanese army. At the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road, in addition to the British soldiers still guarding the post, British soldiers are also stationed in the bunker on the right side. At the entrance of Qianjiang Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, there is a barbed wire frame, and a British soldier is stationed there. As for the situation on the roads between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road, everything is as usual.

### British Airways Opens New Route: Southampton to New York

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1575 the day before yesterday, stating: It has been notified in this Bureau's Notice No. 1560 on July 26 of this year that Pan American Airlines has opened two new air routes, Marseille to New York and Southampton to New York. Furthermore, we have received a letter from the French Postal Administration stating that British Royal Airways has also opened the Southampton to New York air route from August 5 of this year, and will alternate flying with Pan American Airlines. We are submitting the latest flight schedules of the three routes. Please check, etc. After inquiry, the extra airmail surcharges that should be paid for airmail transported via the Southampton to New York route of British Royal Airways are the same as those of the Marseille to New York and Southampton to New York air routes of Pan American Airlines. The flight schedules of the three routes are enclosed for public information. (Table omitted)

### Southern City Refugee Area: Starting to Adjust Refugee Relief, Quota Set at 20,000 People, Registration Begins, Father Jacquin Attends Office Regardless of Weather

Regarding the recent situation of refugees in the Southern City, according to a report yesterday from a certain gentleman at the branch office of the Southern City Refugee Area Supervisory Committee, the details are as follows:

Southern City Refugees: Nearly 20,000 People

When Shanghai first experienced hardship, Father Jacquin, based on his humanitarian standpoint and past experience, organized the accommodation of refugees from the Southern City, with numbers exceeding 100,000. Subsequently, with the westward movement of the National Army, approximately eight-tenths of the refugees have left Shanghai voluntarily or been evacuated over the past two years. Currently, there are 19,209 refugees (including 10,197 men, 5,204 women, and 3,708 child refugees). There are also 19,700 residents of the area who have been affected by the war and are also provided with relief equivalent to that given to the refugees, but they do not reside in the shelters.

88 Shelters Established

A total of 88 refugee shelters have been established in the Southern City, mostly in public places. The hygiene management and various facilities are generally satisfactory. However, due to the special circumstances, the education of child refugees has not been as widespread as the establishment of schools in the concession shelters. Each refugee is provided with six taels of rice per day. To ensure the health of the refugees, the Southern City First Hospital and Cian Hospital provide daily medical care and medicine to the refugees.

Economic Resources are Very Depleted

As for economic resources, these rely solely on donations from charitable organizations and individuals, as well as a portion of the surplus from French merchant charity lottery tickets. Therefore, the economy is severely depleted. Starting from September 13, the relief provided to residents of the Southern City will be reduced by half (three taels per day) since most residents in the area have jobs and a basic livelihood sufficient to sustain them. Starting from October 1, it is planned to set the quota for refugees at 20,000 people, and registration is now underway to adjust the arrangements. If investigations reveal that there are residents who genuinely cannot sustain their lives, they will still be provided with relief, and it is planned to establish another shelter.

Current Relief Cost is 70,000 Yuan

Furthermore, an investigation reveals that the existing number of refugees is in a dire situation and cannot be reduced further. The monthly relief cost cannot be determined precisely due to fluctuating rice prices, but it is currently around 70,000 yuan. Father Jacquin attends the office daily regardless of the weather and frequently inspects the various shelters. His spirit of humanitarian service is deeply commendable.

### After the Price Stabilization Ends, Rice Prices Rise Again Yesterday, The Prohibition Order on Tribute Rice Has Not Been Lifted, and National Rice Continues to Arrive, There is No Consideration for a Second Round of Price Stabilization

The price stabilization operation has ended. Mr. Yu Qiaqing said that he considers this price stabilization to be very satisfactory. The gentlemen of the Rice Merchants' Guild have sacrificed their time and effort for the public good, which is truly commendable. Regarding the process and accounts of the price stabilization, the guild will publish them to the public soon. However, seeing the crowded situation of civilians rushing to buy rice, he deeply regrets that it was a drop in the bucket and could not benefit everyone universally. Originally, it was intended to discuss and proceed with another round of price stabilization, but since the origin of tribute rice has not lifted the export prohibition order, and national rice will also arrive continuously, the price of rice is bound to fall, and there is no need to consider it for the time being. He has not heard about the previous rumors that various groups will issue medals to the staff of each price stabilization center to commend them.

Transfer Completed, Scheduled Review

The five tribute rice price stabilization centers in the two concessions have all concluded, and all transfer procedures have been completed. All items used in each center, such as measures and containers, have been returned to the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Guild. In addition to the rice sold and the funds received, which were reported yesterday, the reporter of the New Voice News has further investigated and recorded the following: the five tribute rice price stabilization centers experienced a total loss of 197 piculs of tribute rice and residual rice. The first center had a loss of 100 catties of leftover rice, the second center 293 catties, the third center 354 catties, the fourth center 147 catties, and the fifth center 157 catties. In addition, the first center had 31 catties of other leftover rice, and the fifth center had 100 catties of rotten rice. Together with the cost of the hemp bags, they were all taken back by the association's supervisors. According to the fourth center, 12,000 one-dou tickets and 10,990 five-sheng tickets were sold, but there was one one-dou ticket and two five-sheng tickets, totaling six yuan, for which rice had not been collected. Because the rice has been completely measured, the six yuan has been left for the rice seller to collect upon verification with the original rice tickets. To be accurate, the one-dou tickets should be changed to 11,998 tickets, and the five-sheng tickets should be changed to 10,988 tickets. Now that the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Guild has completely concluded the five tribute rice price stabilization centers, it is scheduled to convene a meeting of the directors of the five centers after the Mid-Autumn Festival to review the conclusion matters.

Announcement of the Conclusion of Broken Rice Price Stabilization

Regarding the price stabilization of 1,000 bags of broken rice in the four price stabilization centers, all were sold out on the 24th. The total amount of rice sold by each center was 1184 piculs and 2 dou, with a loss of 43 piculs, 2 dou, 8 sheng, and 5 shao, 6 catties of extra broken rice, and 10 catties of leftover rice. The association's supervisors have taken back all of them. The total revenue from the sales was 16,578.8 yuan in national currency. The second center has sold broken rice tickets that have not been collected, and the rice has been left in the guild for purchasers to collect with their tickets. Furthermore, there was a discrepancy in the figures reported yesterday by the fifth center, with 800 one-dou tickets and 4,356 five-sheng tickets sold. This morning, the reporter of the New Voice News visited Qu Zhenhua, the executive committee member of the Rice Merchants' Guild, at the bean and rice market. According to Mr. Qu, the decision to carry out the tribute rice price stabilization was due to the scarcity of rice (8,000 bags), which was not enough to solve the problem. However, the fluctuating price of rice recently has had a significant impact on people's food. To stabilize the rice market, it is essential to facilitate the source of national rice, increase reserves, eliminate hoarding, and encourage price reductions. In the rice-producing areas, new crops have already entered the market. He is actively engaging in negotiations to facilitate the flow of national rice, and it is expected that a large amount of national rice will be shipped to Shanghai in the short term. It is reported that the price of rice rose again yesterday.

Rice Prices Rose by One Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday, merchants registered a total of 4,287 bags of rice for sale at the Rice Market Management Committee. A total of 200 piculs of river cargo arrived. Due to the impact of the end of the price stabilization, the market outlook was higher, and prices rose again. White japonica rice rose by half a yuan per picul, with the highest price being 37 yuan per picul. Changshu and Wuxi new indica rice also rose again, reaching nearly 26 yuan per picul. The highest price for Jiangbei indica rice was originally only 23 yuan per picul, but it has also risen again.

### Busy Settlement Before the Mid-Autumn Festival

The Time for Acceptance and Payment at the Check Clearing House and Reserve Treasury is Extended

Because tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, all factories, businesses, trading firms, companies, and Shanghai-based offices of various places in the city should, following commercial practice, settle the accounts with all parties and the receivables and payables before this Mid-Autumn Festival, adhering to the old practice without change. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the accounts of business transactions will be renewed. The receipts and payments of commercial transactions are now mainly based on cash (legal tender) and checks (checks, banker's drafts, remittances, etc.). There are unusually high volumes of mutual receipts and payments. The settlement procedures handled by the Central Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, various commercial banks, foreign banks, and major remittance offices have become extremely busy. The volume of receipts and payments has increased several times compared to normal days. The check clearing house for the silver and money industries and the reserve treasury of the money industry association are the central hubs for the settlement of merchants, and the office hours and time for accepting and paying checks have been invisibly extended.

### Fierce Battles Continue in the Territory of Chuansha County, Both Chinese and Japanese Troops Have Casualties, Multiple Japanese Planes Flew to Provide Assistance Yesterday

After Xu Zhidao, the Special Commissioner of the Pudong Loyalty and National Salvation Army Free Army, took office, he has now completed the reorganization of various units and actively strengthened his forces. Therefore, the Japanese side pays special attention to him. The Pudong war, which had been dormant, has become fierce again. According to people from Pudong who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese side had recently dispatched

a team of about 150 Japanese soldiers with light and heavy weapons, attacking Huangjialu and Datieqiao in two routes. This area is the defense zone of Xu Chengde, under Xu Zhidao. After Xu learned of this, he quickly assigned the first company to the south of Datieqiao, the second company to defend the Niuduzi area, the third company to be responsible for Huangjialu, and the fourth company to the Liuzaogang area. At the same time, they counterattacked the Japanese troops advancing on the highway. For a time, the fighting was fierce, and the sound of small mortars

lasted for eight hours before stopping. Then, because it was inconvenient for Xu's troops to defend Laogang to the death, they retreated to the west of Erzaohong, holding strongholds in the outer river and pond areas. After a short rest, they again divided into teams to counterattack west from Laogang. The battle is still ongoing. It is reported that the Japanese side suffered heavy casualties in this battle. On the National Army side, officer Han Shulin was killed, and soldiers Liang Zhifa, Yang Deming, Li Shoudao, Qiu Mingqing, Xu Dechang, and messenger Yang Jinrong were wounded. Commander Xu

has provided compensation, with a bonus of 10 yuan for each wounded soldier, 20 yuan for each wounded officer, and a burial fee of 20 yuan for each soldier killed, to show his appreciation. Yesterday morning, several Japanese planes, carrying bombs, went to assist in the fighting.

### Crew Strike on the Nagasaki Maru, Temporary Suspension of Sailing Yesterday

The Nagasaki Maru of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha was originally scheduled to sail to Nagasaki, Japan, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, but it was unable to depart due to a crew strike. The reason was to demand severance pay and guarantee of treatment in the new company. It is reported that the ship will soon be transferred to the newly formed "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." by the Japanese side. According to the crew, the old company has suffered losses over the years, but the company has refused to acknowledge this.

### Expansion of the Double Tenth Festival Disaster Relief Campaign

The Public Unanimously Supports the Cause, Donations Continue for Another Year

October 10th is the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, will launch a disaster relief campaign throughout the country on that day to raise funds to provide relief to compatriots in distress. According to reporters from the Daguang News Agency, the various groups in Shanghai greatly agree with Mr. Xu's proposal. As the Double Tenth Festival is approaching, they are currently exchanging ideas and preparing to expand the campaign. They also plan to send personnel to visit refugees in various shelters. The public in all sectors believes that in this extraordinary period, when the country is in great difficulty, and considering Shanghai's unique environment, they do not plan to splurge on the Double Tenth Festival or hold celebratory ceremonies. Their belief in the War of Resistance and National Construction is even more steadfast. In addition to the city uniformly raising flags and taking a day off, they are determined to enthusiastically support the disaster relief campaign. Businesses and other sectors that originally pledged to support refugees and donate to disaster relief, although the one-year period has expired, are mostly voluntarily continuing for another year to maintain the relief provided to refugees and stabilize the order of the isolated island.

The purpose of towing the seven cotton barges to Hongkou is unknown. It is reported that the cotton has been forcibly purchased by Japanese factories, so it was towed there for unloading. However, when asked, the merchants from Shen Yuanlai and others were unaware of the barges being towed to Hongkou. They are currently trying to negotiate the release of the detained barges. The cotton transported by the Tonghe Wheel the other day was unloaded onto two iron barges due to the above-mentioned reason. It was unloaded at the Observatory Wharf yesterday. There were more than ten cotton barges originally parked at the site last Saturday. The unloading was disrupted by the Japanese side, so the work was stopped immediately. It is now learned that it has been completely unloaded.

### Appeal Debate in the Case of Notorious Bandit Ta Yongkuan and His Son, Verdict Scheduled for the 30th of this Month

Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, Li Bihua (erroneously reported as Hua), three bandits from Anhui Province, notorious salt smugglers, taking advantage of the westward retreat of the National Army in the winter of the year before last, gathered bandits in the Ruanxiang area of Songjiang, claiming to be guerrillas, and set fire, killed, looted property, and raped women everywhere. They also forcibly robbed two women, Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, from Xihutang, and forced them to marry Jia Zhou and Bihua as wives. Li Jia Zhou then shot and killed Lin's mother and buried her. Li Yongkuan, claiming that the Lin family had no descendants, sold Lin's house to a local bully, Lu Baoren. At the end of last spring, they were disarmed by the regular army. Unable to gain a foothold, Li and his family, along with the two women,

fled to Shanghai and hid in Xujiahui in western Shanghai, confining Lin and She and prohibiting them from moving freely. Until last December, the two women escaped and reported to the French police, who arrested Li and the other three people one after another. Stolen goods, such as leather clothing, gold bracelets, and gold rings from the Lin and She families, were found in their home and sent to the Second Special Court. After investigation, the French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against them for robbery, murder, rape, and illegal detention. Lin and She also filed an incidental civil suit, each requesting 8,000 yuan in consolation money and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. Because Li and others committed crimes in the interior, regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the Second Special Court submitted a request to the Third Higher Branch Court, which then submitted it to the Supreme Court, designating the Second Special Court

to hear the case. As a result of the trial, on the 16th of last month, Li Yongkuan was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for continuous robbery and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Li Jia Zhou was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for continuous robbery, five years of imprisonment for rape, and fifteen years of imprisonment for murder, to be served concurrently for eighteen years, and fifteen years of deprivation of civil rights. Li Bihua was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for continuous robbery and five years of imprisonment for rape, to be served concurrently for ten years, and eight years of deprivation of civil rights. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Regarding the civil suit portion, it has been concluded by the civil court. On the 23rd of this month, a verdict was issued ordering Li Jia Zhou and Li Bihua to each compensate Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian 800 yuan in national currency. Li Jia Zhou also had to bear 200 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. All these details have been recorded in this newspaper. Because Li

and his three sons were dissatisfied with the criminal verdict of the Second Special Court in the first trial, they jointly retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as agents to file an appeal with the Third Higher Branch Court. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Gu Hongbiao and Xiang Zu, and Prosecutor Zhao Changmin, convened a joint trial. According to the reasons for the appeal stated by Li and his sons, they did not believe that the looting and robbery were such. They claim that, with Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi, the local town leaders, as matchmakers, they married Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian as daughters-in-law. It was only after arriving in Shanghai that Lin and She were instigated by others to falsely accuse them of robbery and murder, resulting in severe sentences.

They requested a clear investigation, the revocation of the original judgment, and a declaration of innocence. Then, the original plaintiffs, Lin Xiuhua and Yu Yuexian, stated the circumstances of being robbed, forced into marriage, and the three robberies in their home, as well as the process of Li Jia Zhou killing Lin's mother. The court also summoned witness Zhang Hongkui and the investigating detective for questioning. As the details of the case were clear, the court ordered the opening of the debate. First, the prosecutor stated his opinion, saying that it was learned that the appellants had committed such a serious crime during a period of local disorder, and they should be punished severely according to law to deter wrongdoing. The original judgment of imprisonment seemed lenient. He requested the presiding judge to make a judgment according to law. Then, after lawyers Yao Zhaodi of the French Concession authorities and the defense lawyers Fan and Yu debated, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 30th. The appellants were still returned to the detention center.

### Assaulting Mother and Daughter

The Two Convicts Dissatisfied with the Sentence, the Appeal Trial Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Gu Yang, a woman from Jiangbei living at No. 96, Dakang Lane, Kangdi Road, had a sixteen-year-old daughter, Fendi, who worked in a silk factory. She had to pass in front of the house of her fellow villager, Jiang Xiaosizi (licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council to operate a cesspit), at No. 152, Xiachengfang, Renshou Lane, Caishi Road, twice a day, morning and evening. Jiang Zimei, the son of Jiang Xiaosizi, was sixteen years old this year. Every time he saw Gu's daughter passing by, he would touch her hands and breasts

and sexually harass her. On the afternoon of July 11th, at 6:00 p.m., when Gu's daughter was returning home from work, passing by Jiang's house, Jiang Zimei again harassed her and hugged her, dragging her into the house. After she struggled and cried out, he released her and she fled home. She cried and told her mother, Gu Yang. That night, the mother and daughter went to Jiang's house to argue, but were beaten and injured by Jiang and his son,

and their clothes were torn. Gu Yang and her daughter then retained lawyers Li Mingzhou and Lian Ze to request an injury examination from the Second Special Court. Afterwards, they filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Jiang Xiaosizi and Jiang Zimei for assault and indecent assault, and filed an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation for medical expenses of 60 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen. The defendants retained lawyer Wei Weiqing to defend them and filed a counterclaim

accusing them of defamation. As a result of the initial trial, Jiang Xiaosizi and Jiang Zimei were sentenced to detention for assault, which could be converted to a fine of two yuan per day. Gu Yang's self-accusation against Jiang Zimei and counterclaim were both dismissed. Gu Yang was found not guilty. Because Jiang and his son were dissatisfied with the verdict, they retained lawyer Song Yuntao to file an appeal with the Third Higher Branch Court.

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., presiding Judge Wu Tingqi convened a joint trial and summoned both parties and witness No. 332 to the case to question them about the situation at the time. He then announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the verdict for the 30th.

### New Tricks of the Con Artists, the Spring Lock Scam Fails, Pan Qiliang Arrested While Trying to Escape

Pan Qiliang (24 years old) from Changzhou, and Jiang Shiguang, Zhang the Tea Seller, Qian Boxiang, and others who are at large, usually set up fictitious firms or use a gambling game called "1234" to swindle people out of their property.

There are countless people who have been deceived by them. On the 22nd of this month, Pan and others used the same trick again. They went to Ruicheng Hardware Store in Zunde Lane, Qingmen Road, pretending that they had opened a Dasheng firm in the Jin Yu Inn on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession. They claimed that they had been entrusted by a merchant to buy twenty dozen new-style spring locks (worth more than 600 yuan), and they would bring the money back as soon as the goods were delivered. Ma Songquan, the manager of the store,

believing them to be true, prepared the goods and ordered his apprentice, Lu Wenqiao, to follow Pan. As soon as they arrived at the inn, two men took the goods, and told Lu to follow Pan to the bank to collect the money. Unexpectedly, Pan seized the opportunity to escape halfway. He was spotted near Maidiyan Road by detectives Ke Enqing and Ke Enhong of the French Concession Police, who, seeing that his

expression was flustered, stepped forward to arrest him. He confessed the truth after being taken to the police station. Therefore, Pan Qiliang was sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court yesterday for investigation. After Judge Zhu examined the case, he ordered a postponement of the hearing for further investigation and arrest of accomplices, as the investigation was still needed. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Theft at the Jianye Silk Factory, Suspects Arrested

At around 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, more than a dozen armed bandits broke into the back door of the Jianye Silk Factory at No. 551, Tokyo Road, Shanghai West, silenced those who made a sound with guns, and stole six large packages of raw silk (weighing about 130 pounds), worth more than 6,000 yuan, before fleeing with the stolen goods. After reporting the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station, detectives Xu Decheng and Wu Dekui were dispatched to investigate the factory. Chen Aliang, the cook from Shaoxing, Ye Jincai, the cook, and Gao Jinrong, a laborer from Yangzhou, were suspected of colluding with the bandits as insiders. Chen and the other three were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan described the case and requested their detention. Chen, Ye, and Gao, the three suspects, stammered in their confessions and denied the charges. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation.

### Impersonating the Fire Brigade to Sell Fire Extinguishers: Young Man Guo Yao Arrested

A local young man named Guo Yao (also known as Guo Bianting), impersonated the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade to print a large number of cards to sell fire extinguishers for the Dahua Fire Prevention Association. He was arrested by Detective Ding Yu and handed over to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. He was prosecuted for fraud and other crimes. Judge Fang Qinghuan interrogated him in the courtroom. The defendant, Guo Yao, admitted that he was a salesman for the Dahua Fire Prevention Association, but denied impersonating the Municipal Council Fire Brigade, claiming that the Dahua fire extinguishers were approved for sale by the Fire Brigade and were not illegal. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Ding Yuhua, who testified, "I run a lunch box business. Now, due to rising prices, business is slow, and I cannot afford to install a fire extinguisher. The defendant said he was sent by the Fire Brigade and insisted on installing one for 18 yuan. That's why I called the police. I don't know if he is real or fake." After verifying the statements, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing until next Monday.

### Continued Trial of the Moales Case: Testimony of the Autopsy Doctor

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the case of Moales, an employee of the Municipal Council's Health Department, accused of causing death by negligence, continued its trial this morning (the 25th) at the British Police Court, with Registrar Haines presiding. Dr. Gang Wright testified that on the morning of September 9th, he dissected the body of a Chinese man at the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital. The deceased's face showed evidence of being beaten. An examination of the deceased's heart revealed that it was about twice the normal size due to several diseases. If the deceased had to engage in any strenuous work, these diseases would likely have caused his death within two months. Other witnesses called to court this morning included Mr. Hui of the Public Works Department, who described the terrain of the area, and Mr. Kepenntan of the Health Department, who accompanied the defendant on the night of the incident, also testified about the circumstances of the incident. The defendant's lawyer, Li Kesi, cross-examined the witnesses. The case was adjourned until 10:00 AM on Friday.

### Smoking Opium: Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment, Commutable to a Fine

Ye Meisheng, a Ningbo native residing at the residence of the late Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Youren, is fifty years old. Recently, the Police Department received a tip that his home was an opium trafficking center. Yesterday morning (the 25th), a large number of Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to surround the entire residence and search it. Ye Meisheng was arrested on the spot, and dozens of taels of opium, dozens of cans of opium paste, two valuable opium pipes, opium lamps, and other items were confiscated and taken to the police station. In the afternoon, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the court for prosecution in accordance with the law. Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned him, and the defendant confessed to smoking opium. The court verified the statements and immediately pronounced the verdict, which stated: "Ye Meisheng is sentenced to six months of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for one year, and ordered to quit opium within one month. If he commutes the sentence to a fine, it will be calculated at three yuan per day."

### Police Officer Becomes a Bandit: Sentenced to Twelve Years Imprisonment

Li Ziming, a Shandong native who previously served as Chinese Constable No. 774 at the Huishi Police Station, demanded a bribe from Jin Meisheng, the owner of Swallow's Nest at No. 4, Lane 527, Yihua Road, on October 19th of last year. When Jin refused, Li shot and injured him. On the same day, he also shot and injured Yang Ronghua, the doorman of the Shengsheng Trust Company at No. 80 Ningbo Road, and fled his post. On July 8th of this year, Li and his accomplices armed with weapons robbed Yan Yuncheng's home at No. 1297 Yuyuan Road of 20 yuan in legal tender. During their escape, they opened fire on Japanese Constable No. 789 and Chinese Constables No. 2189 and No. 2495 along the way. Li was shot and injured and captured. When he was sent to the First Special Court for trial, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning and sentenced Li Ziming to seven years of imprisonment for conspiring to break into a residence and steal at night with deadly weapons, six years of imprisonment for attempted murder, and seven years of imprisonment for continuous attempted murder, to be served for a total of twelve years. One pistol and four bullets were confiscated and temporarily stored at the police station.

### Grand Wedding of Ai Sun

Mr. Ai Weichao, who studied electrical engineering in England and is an outstanding talent in our country's machinery field, currently works as an engineer at the British-owned Wanbao Yangxing in Shanghai. Yesterday, he married Miss Sun Yuanzhen, the eldest daughter of Mr. Sun Liangzheng, at the Moore Memorial Church. Miss Sun graduated from the Department of Sociology at Tsinghua University and has a deep understanding of Chinese and Western cultures. Mr. Ai and Miss Sun were old classmates and are both devout Christians who share the same ideals and are a perfect match. It is said that they will go to Kunming after their marriage to serve the academic community. Yesterday, many prominent figures from the business and academic circles attended, making it a grand occasion.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor of your newspaper:

Having read the news article "Lawyer Yang Yiming Assaults People, Shops Jointly Provide Proof" in your newspaper on the 21st of this month, it states that Judge Qiu presented the joint public statement signed by more than 30 shop residents of Siyi Village, who witnessed Yang's assault, to Yang for inspection. Yang Yiming then stated in court that since the shop residents had personally witnessed the incident, he requested the court to summon them to appear in court for questioning. Judge Qiu verified the statement and announced that the case would be re-examined at a later date. We are extremely surprised by this. Lawyer Yang Yiming does indeed reside at No. 33 Siyi Village, Huixi Street, Xujiahui, in the same village as the shop residents. However, the shop residents did not actually witness him assaulting Madam Song Wang from Songjiang. How could they have signed a joint public statement? It is clear that unscrupulous individuals are using our names to deceive others. We were about to write a letter requesting a correction when we saw the letter from Lawyer Yang Yiming in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, which stated that "the truth of the case will be judged fairly, and as for the joint statement from the shops discovered during the trial to be irregular," etc. This confirms that the shop residents have unintentionally offended their neighbor due to the pranks of others, and it is a completely undeserved disaster. This not only fabricates rumors but also concerns personal reputation. Therefore, in addition to waiting to be summoned for questioning, we dare to write this letter for correction and hope that it will be published to clarify the truth for the public. We are deeply grateful for this.

Sincerely,

Representatives of the shops in Siyi Village:

Huang Liansheng, owner of Huixin Shop

Yang Qinshan, owner of Huiji Workshop

Representatives of the residents:

Guo Xihua

Song Yunsheng

### Spark-like Life

— Guo Guo

Sparks - bright, burning. And the life of youth should be like that spark.

The life of youth should be vigorous, full of light and heat; but even so, it is still not enough. We should use the brilliant "light" emitted from our own lives to burn away the dark side of society, so that countless people who have fallen into the black prison can use your "light" to climb out of the black prison; and the huge amount of "heat" emitted in your life should be used to warm those who feel cold, so that they can also generate the same huge amount of heat as a driving force for advancement.

The creation of sparks is due to the collision of two "forces". The idea of living is inherent in human beings, and then, certain improper desires arise. If human beings do not sanction those improper desires and eliminate them, but instead want to satisfy them, then not only will conflicts between people increase as a result, but the justice of the world will also be completely destroyed; the evolution of the world will inevitably stagnate, and may even exceed the barbarity of the primitive era. People have an instinct for doing good: to fully develop what is right, and to sanction and destroy what is wrong. The force that stimulates desire may be unavoidable, but the ability to restrain desire is even more excellent. The encounter and collision of the two "forces" will emit bright, burning sparks in life. This "heat" drives them forward, and this "light" illuminates them to seize great objects. If we give this kind of person a name, then it is "hero". And youth should have a "heroic" life - here, we must recognize that a personal "hero" does not exist, whether for oneself or for the public. We evenly promote these two "forces", make these two "forces" fight fiercely, and make our own lives full of light and heat, like a spark.

The so-called spark-like life is not mysterious, just as the spark itself is not a mysterious thing. Primitive humans saw the fire come and go without fixed time, sometimes seeing it set off a flame that burned the sky, and sometimes seeing the flame disappear without a trace, and felt that this was a mysterious and elusive thing. But thanks to the efforts of scientists, they learned that "fire" is just a phenomenon of combustion, and combustion depends on the support of gases (such as oxygen, etc.). The birth and death of flames are closely related to the amount of oxygen content. In ancient times, humans were "ruled by fire; but in modern times, humans control "fire". Regarding life, we should also take off the mysterious coat. The power of "gods", "ghosts", and "fate" can never shake or control our lives. To fan the flames of our lives, we must first increase the content of "air elements" in our lives. The reason why the flame of a person's life is dim is because the content of "oxygen" in their life is too thin. I dare not say that this is the truth, but the boundary marker between the "bitterness" and "happiness", "fulfillment" and "emptiness" of life is here.

Sparks - bright, burning, and the life of youth should be like that spark.

### Love of the River

— Tang Wei

——Records Picked Up From Ashes——

For some reason, I decided to live with Lao Chong.

Our residence is at the end of the street, a board room near the river; this place is very much like the fairy cave in "Liaozhai". Artemisia clings to the three-sided walls, and unknown insects chirp day and night, not allowing you to have a moment of quiet thought; - fortunately, we have escaped the white Russian vagrants and prostitutes. The drunken songs after drinking always make me occasionally hear them, but because they are too far away, I find them vaguely interesting.

The river water by the window is like a mirror lying face up, and the lights render countless mottled golden spots on the water.

I am fascinated by it.

The overlapping ripples, the crane-wing-like shadows of sails, ridiculed me several fire-like rams; I decided to leave it several times, - but soon I appeared again on its floating sand embankment.

Now, the Songhua River also seems to have changed its appearance; its huge figure seems to be a virgin who has just been ravaged, lying tired and in pain.

I can't bear to look at it any longer, and I don't know what force is secretly teasing me! I can't sleep peacefully.

It's late at night.

I walked onto the floating sand embankment again. There was no sound of dust, and I lowered my breath. I gently held up the river water with my hand and kissed it on the mouth - this tender comfort made the river water sob even more deeply.

Across the river, the barking of dogs and the lush villages are beckoning me affectionately in the shadows!

I watched over everything living in this cruel fate until the autumn mist dampened my hair.

It was already dawn when I came back.

Lao Chong told me that this section of the river is often used as a secret execution ground by the port military police at night, and I realized that I had just taken a big risk unknowingly.

### Holland Waiting with Spears as Pillows

— Written by Philip Debock, Translated by Wang Baishi

Today's Holland is still as strong as before. Compulsory military service has been further expanded. Every man between the ages of 19 and 55 has the obligation to perform military service. Generally, every 19-year-old youth must undergo eight months of military training. Those with higher education receive even longer training and are commissioned as reserve officers (N.C.Os). From the ages of 19 to 28, they serve in the field army, and after this age, they join the national defense force. Therefore, although Holland has a population of only nine million, it has nearly 800,000 soldiers. These troops are fully trained, well-equipped, and can be mobilized within 24 hours; some (such as those defending the border or coastline) can be concentrated within six hours.

The main component of the Dutch army is the field army - the most elite unit; they are ready to strike at the fierce aggressor at any time.

The Dutch border does not have strong fortifications like the Maginot Line or the Siegfried Line. Furthermore, the border line is too long. To build such fortifications, even for the wealthy Netherlands, would be too expensive. But it cannot be said that Holland has no defenses at all. On the border with Germany and Belgium, many posts and other defensive works are scattered without deviation, surprising neutral observers.

The Dutch army is not used to invade other countries, but to resist aggression. Its defensive line is built according to the natural terrain. Currently, its biggest hypothetical enemy is the German army. The first natural defensive line in the east is the Ysel and Meuse rivers, which flow north and south. West of the Zuider Sea and Maastricht, there are high mountains and steep ridges, forming an exceptionally strong natural defensive line. Even in peacetime, it is firmly guarded. Along the line are many guard posts, dark intercept platforms, and countless solid trenches and other defensive works. The bridge markers on the river are planted with mines in peacetime, so in an emergency, the government in The Hague only needs to give an order, and they can immediately be blown to pieces.

The second defensive line is in the Eem River basin. This is a small river that flows north from Wageningen (on the Rhine River), along Amersfoort, into the Zuider Sea. The entire river passes through a ten-mile-wide plain. This plain is surrounded by large mountains in the east and west. If the Rhine River water or the Zuider Sea water is introduced into this plain, it will immediately become a vast ocean one or two feet deep within one or two hours.

Readers may not be able to imagine how effective this flooding defense line would be. The flooding near Dixmuyde during the last European war can be said to be close to this strategy; however, that was only used as an expedient measure. Holland is now planning it in detail in peacetime, and its effectiveness is of course greater. Holland accurately knows the source of the water, has established many water gates, and people (mostly reserve soldiers) live near the water gates so that they can open the gates at any time. Holland also fully knows the direction of the water flow, the size of the flooded area, and the water depth at each location. In peacetime, they have prepared special maps to mark all of this.

In 1914, the accidental flooding of the Western Front saved the British, French, and Belgian armies from defeat. Therefore, Holland's well-prepared waterlogging strategy can at least strike a blow to the enemy, while greatly helping the country's army defend the motherland, there is no doubt about it. They will then completely flood the ground, with just enough water so that it is too shallow to sail, but deep enough to make it impossible to distinguish between the hundreds of small canals that intersect and cut across the Dutch pastures and the land, greatly hindering the enemy army. The enemy's heavy tanks will be completely ineffective and will have to wade through the mud.

The Dutch military authorities are confident that many flooding defense lines will not be breached by the enemy. However, the people behind the defense line may suffer terrible aerial bombardments, which may lead them to abandon the defense.

Therefore, air defense has become a major issue for Holland. The Dutch Air Force consists of three regiments, and all the aircraft and combatants are very good. Dutch civil aviation has a long-standing reputation in the world.

There is one regiment of anti-aircraft artillery, and the equipment is the latest.

As for maritime defense, Holland relies mainly on submarines, motor torpedo boats, and other small warships. Most of the large warships are used in the Dutch East Indies. These small warships, driven by the famous Dutch sailors, rushing and crashing in the shallow sea, are precisely the vanguards that are difficult for the aggressor to deal with!

Whether Germany dares to break Holland's neutrality and attack it recklessly, who knows?

### Heart's Song

— Wen Xi

I wish for a violent storm, a high tide of waves, to drive away the sorrow that lingers in my heart all day long.

I cannot see the smile of youth, nor the enthusiastic surge of young people; everything is followed by shadows.

I feel empty all over, as if I am starving, and I am gradually developing a disgust for this world.

The previous life was in the dark, but sometimes it was also full of happiness. Comparing it with the present, I only get "unbearable memories". Therefore, people build their lives on the "future". This unblown flower bud is placed in a passionate heart and cultivated with all their energy.

The current suffering can only be endured. The dim light is not to be mourned. Even in the darkness, my will cannot be obscured.

I wish for a cup of bitter wine, swallowed into my throat, and the last tear to fall, and then I will say goodbye to pain.

I wish I could sing a few short songs every day, telling my wishes, so that I can have a pure heart and not enter the muddy stream.

Arts and Entertainment

### The Future of Spoken Drama in Shanghai Yang Liu

Some theories in the world seem to remain just theories forever. When those who advocate these theories put them into practice, their work changes direction. It is certainly accurate to say that drama cannot be separated from the masses. Drama is propaganda, it is education, even the most ardent advocates of art for art's sake cannot deny this. The direction that progressive drama practitioners have been striving for in recent years has been in this area. Not only drama, but drama is just a wave in the huge tide of "cultural people going to the masses." But looking at the isolated island, when will this fervent faith go? There are many people engaged in the drama movement, and many drama troupes have been established one after another. However, the object of their work is not the ideal of how to attract a large audience, thus creating a situation where spoken drama has no mass support. Of course, it can also be said that this is due to their weak abilities, but their fatal flaw is not here. In their minds, they despise the audience of the "Living Buddha Jigong" who are full every day, the audience of "Burning the Red Lotus Temple," the masses in the civilized theaters of Tianyunlou and the Great World, and even the audience of the Green Treasure Theater.

The audience of "Living Buddha Jigong" and the civilized theaters have their own historical basis, so let's not discuss them for the time being. The Green Treasure Theater has only been in Shanghai for one or two years, but now it occupies a superior position in the entertainment industry, which is not accidental. In addition to one or two so-called movie stars as a gimmick, the rest of the Green Treasure Theater are still just old characters from civilized theater troupes. However, their performing style is "spoken drama," not "civilized drama." If we want to delve into it, then they have indeed adopted the strengths of civilized drama and put them into the form of spoken drama. Therefore, the success of the same script when performed at the Green Treasure Theater will far surpass that of the current theaters that use spoken drama as a gimmick. Conversely, even without a good script, the Green Treasure Theater can still rely on the actors' "special skills" to maintain itself.

Therefore, professional spoken drama theaters open and close, and it always seems difficult to gain a foothold. Although they have repeatedly failed in business, they can still comfort themselves by thinking: "It is said that the audience in Shanghai is too naive." This idea is certainly justified. Taking the "Swastika Palace" and "Lafayette" in front of us as examples, their hosts are always people with experience in studying drama, but when they stage an unfamiliar script, they have no confidence in success. They cannot establish a strong faith in the audience. After staging an unfamiliar script, the audience shakes their heads and leaves, and to be honest, there are more unsatisfactory scripts than satisfactory ones! After that, the audience they have only has a part of the spoken drama enthusiasts, and the general public will never have a good impression of the clumsy spoken drama.

If spoken drama activists do not focus on winning over the audience, they can only watch it decline day by day. But how can we win over a large audience? In addition to focusing on training actors' skills, the most important thing is a change in psychology -- even if the audience is naive, don't give up on them. The masses are originally naive, but they need to be educated, so that you can cultivate them to have a high level of appreciation. Don't let them only watch "Living Buddha Jigong," and don't let them always be just "the audience of the Green Treasure Theater!"

After Watching Huang Jinrong's New Roles

On the twenty-first day, Huang Jinrong met with people from all walks of life on the stage. The reporter was able to witness the grand occasion and recorded it as follows:

First Day

Wu Yanheng's "Picking the Hua Che" was on stage before eight o'clock. Mr. Wu's tall figure, the appearance is the appearance, the physique is the physique, and the movements are clean and neat. His voice is also loud, and the singing and recitation are wonderful. The large section of "Pomegranate Flower" sounds like a small building, and the loud shout has the wonderful effect of stopping the clouds. The gathering of fights and the martial arts of picking the car are fiery in the rules. When Liu Yongli, who played the target, and Wu Yanheng fought each other, they exhausted the beauty of peony and green leaves. Yang Shisen later performed "Empty City Stratagem." The singing on the city tower was full of charm, and a few lines of the "rocking board" were even more wonderful. Then, Song Dezhu performed "Fighting at Xin'an Station." Because he learned from Xun Huisheng, the stage steps were very different from Xun's wonderfulness. Running around, it was simply a mess on the stage. The recitation also learned from Huisheng, which was extremely moving. The voice was slightly hoarse, but the melody was appropriate, which was really good. The acting lacked delicacy, and sometimes it was excessive. The wedding chamber scene was mediocre. The best scene in the whole play was the "Martial Arts Contest to Recruit a Son-in-Law." Fighting with Li Debin was seamless and wonderful to the point of perfection. Li Debin's young man, although he can strictly abide by the norms, is too rigid. Ai Shiju is still the same as before, and Ci Shaoquan's voice is brighter and has made a lot of progress.

Second Day

On stage, Yan Chong performed "Evil Tiger Village," which was another scene. The body and feet were quite good. "Evil Tiger Village" cannot be pleasing without martial arts and literary singing. To be able to sing, recite, act, and fight, one can be competent. Yanheng can be said to have all four, so the performance is wonderful from beginning to end. "Beating the Drum and Cursing Cao" is Yang Xiaolou's signature play, so of course it is good. Xiaolou's drum has always been called a masterpiece, and no one else can do it. Yuan Shihai's Cao Cao is better than Ma Jun, and there are several Hao school postures when listening to the drum. He is worthy of being a disciple of the Hao family. Later, Song Dezhu performed "Flooding Jinshan Temple." Dezhu played the White Lady. In the scene where she begged Fahai to save Xu Xian, there were many movements, and the performance was methodical and the style was beautiful. The stilt work showed even more skill. Mao Shilai and Yan Shishan were more than twice as good as Bai Yushuang.

Mr. Wang from Northeast China Hua Zhi

Since the Huaxin Company filmed the humorous and interesting films "Mr. Wang's Difficulties in Eating" and "Mr. Wang and the Second Landlord," it has aroused a deep impression in the society. Because Mr. Wang and his partners Xiao Chen, Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Chen, and Xiao Ayuan, express the turbulent life of the lower class in the isolated island, it is too incisive. Mr. Wang and other typical characters are from the pen of cartoonist Ye Qianyu. Originally, only people near Shanghai knew him. After he was on the screen, the publicity was wide. Recently, Mr. Wang has appeared in Donglansheng, and people there are said to be filming Mr. Wang's films. The matter started like this. An art magazine called "East Asia Sightseeing," published in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, reprinted Qianyu's paintings and renamed them "The Unofficial History of Mr. Chen's Trip to Beijing," which tells the story of Mr. Wang and Xiao Chen going to Nanjing to become officials. It is very popular among the general public. Some speculators heard that Mr. Wang's films were very popular in Shanghai, and they also wanted to imitate them, so they planned it. However, they filmed silent films, and there were no standard talents like Tang Jie, so the results were said to be inferior.

### Brief Reports on the Art Scene Hua

"Sai Jinhua," which will be staged at the Xuan Palace Theater during the Mid-Autumn Festival, is based on Xiong Foxi's script and adapted by Wei Ruhui. The content is quite lively, with Peking Opera singing and other scenes. Lan Lan is playing Sai Jinhua, so Lan Lan is working hard to practice Peking Opera these days.

Zhang Shankun personally directed "One Night Queen," which will be screened at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:30 this afternoon.

"It's a bit embarrassing not to watch" "Wen Su Chen" has been greatly revised by the original author Zhu Shilin after it was put on the screen. For example, Wen Su Chen on the stage has many concubines, but Wen Su Chen on the screen has nothing but a clumsy wife at home; therefore, Liu Jiqun said to people: "I don't have the good fortune of Qi Lintong."

"Song of Shanghai" is set for the 29th night

Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

### Being Clever Turns Out to Be a Joke

As for the fact that Sister Thirteen wrote poems on the wall after that, of course it was not to wipe the blood off the knife out of fear. Besides, she was clearly holding a precious knife that killed people without seeing blood. Except for the possibility that there might still be blood on the handle of the knife, it is a deception to say that blood could be stained on the back or blade of the knife. Furthermore, even if the precious knife was unfortunately stained with blood, it would never be like saving someone from the river, controlling the water for half a day. What's more, it's not enough to control and flick it, and finally wipe it on the sole of the shoe, that's simply cursing Sister Thirteen's precious knife. He would not have thought that He Yufeng was originally a Han Chinese with bound feet, not a Manchurian with big feet. How could the three-inch golden lotus wipe clean the blood stains on both sides of a knife that was four or five inches long and about two feet long? Isn't this another unreasonable absurdity? Looking at this play, it's just a change in the costume of boots and shoes, but it has already caused the above joke. From this, it can be seen that those who advocate reforming old plays must consider everything carefully in order to avoid being ridiculed, but how easy is this!

I once saw Chen Laofuzi (Delin) play the Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting Her Mother." Because he often saw the back of the Empress Dowager Cixi when he was serving in the inner court, he also slightly imitated the Empress Dowager's steps and the dignified and generous attitude when he was about to leave the stage in the play, and added the gongs and drums on the stage. It really had a look. Later, Wang Qinnong imitated it and became famous for it. In recent years, even though singers in Beiping such as Zhu Qixiang were far inferior in singing skills, they also won the welcome of the audience by selling these few steps. Who knew that a certain actor who played "Sister Thirteen" would go even further. When he played the role of Empress Dowager Xiao, he staggered every step when he first came on stage, just like the movements and steps of Cao Fu, who played the role of "Tianmen Walks in the Snow." He hunched his back to deliberately show an old and decrepit appearance. (107)

will be performed at Lafayette Theater, and a grand reception is prepared.

Guohua Company will produce all costume films in the future. Several months ago, the Shenxin and Liangbao cover advertisements had collected dozens of folk stories such as "Du Shiniang" and "He Wenxiu." Recently, it may be published again,

to avoid other companies using the same stories.

In addition to Xuan Palace and Lafayette, someone is planning a spoken drama theater. The site has been selected, which is a theater in Shanghai that is most suitable for performing spoken drama, but there are still problems with the actors, so it is not convenient to announce it for the time being.

In addition to meeting Chen Yunshang on the screen, the photos taken by herself are now specially taken by photographer Lang Jingshan in the latest style, as many as two or three hundred kinds, with unique and precious postures. It is said that the first batch of twenty-four new styles will be sold from today at the four major companies on Nanjing Road, the China National Products Company, and the Shanghai Grand Theater.
