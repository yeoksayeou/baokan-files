### British and Japanese Authorities Released Negotiation Results Last Night Chamberlain Still Claims China Policy Has Not Changed No Problem with Aid to Legal Tender and Tianjin Deposited Silver

(London) Today's House of Commons meeting, the whole venue was in an atmosphere of eager anticipation, quietly listening to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the Anglo-Japanese agreement. The Prime Minister said that before the start of negotiations between the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on resolving the Tianjin incident, preliminary talks had been held in Tokyo from July 15th. The Japanese government stated at the beginning of the discussion that if progress could be made in eliminating misunderstandings between the two sides and establishing better relations between the two countries, it would be necessary to acknowledge the review of the background to the Tianjin situation. This matter has nothing to do with the British government's China policy, but is merely a matter of fact. As the war is currently being conducted on a large scale in China, the Japanese army must seek its own security and maintain public order in the areas it occupies, so it has to take action to prevent this force from being hindered. In order to clear the way for discussing the Tianjin incident, the British government has reached the following agreement with the Japanese government: "The British government fully recognizes the reality of the large-scale war currently underway in China, and recognizes that when this situation continues for a long time, the Japanese army in China has special needs to ensure its own safety and maintain public order in the areas under its control, and should prevent or eliminate any actions or events that hinder the Japanese army or benefit the enemy. The British government has no intention of assisting any actions that may hinder the Japanese army from achieving the above-mentioned goals, and will take this opportunity to clearly inform British officials and expatriates in China that they should not engage in such behavior or plans, in order to demonstrate the British policy on this matter," he said.

After the Prime Minister finished reading the plan, Communist MP Gallacher shouted, "Shameful." The Prime Minister then replied to a question from Labour MP Fletcher, stating that Britain had not agreed to anything in the guarantee negotiations that would harm Chinese legal tender or the right of British loans to the Chinese government for any purpose, and emphasized that the negotiations were limited to the Tianjin local dispute. He also replied to a question from Labour MP Henderson, stating that the concessions made by Britain did not, in effect, recognize the sovereignty of the Japanese armed forces over the occupied parts of China. He also replied to a question from Labour MP Benn, stating that he did not want to clearly state which land was under Japanese control. Benn had asked, "Is the British government not agreeing to a policy direction to be carried out in this area? What is this area?" The Prime Minister replied, "The area controlled by the Japanese." Labour MP Shinwell then asked whether this statement did not contain the meaning that the British government was now colluding with Japan. Conservative MPs all shouted, "No." Conservative MP Churchill asked whether this answer did not contain the meaning that the British government was maintaining strict neutrality. Labour MP Greenwood wanted to know whether there had been any changes to Britain's China policy. The Prime Minister replied, "No, the declaration does not contain any meaning of the British government making any changes to the Chinese government," he said. (Reuter, 24th)

Labour MP Strauss then requested the Prime Minister to provide assurances that the silver in Tianjin, worth Â£2.5 million, would not be handed over to Japan. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, "The Japanese government has never made any proposal on how to dispose of this silver." Labour MP Belcher also asked, "Is this silver deposited in a British bank, and as the situation in Tianjin is unstable, should it be moved to a safe place?" Under-Secretary Butler replied, "Please submit this question in writing." Labour MP questioned again, "Does Under-Secretary Butler mean that the Chinese government wants our country to hand over this silver to Japan?" Under-Secretary Butler replied no. (Havas, 24th)

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 10 p.m. that Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador to Japan had held successive talks since July 15th, and the results are announced as follows: The British government fully recognizes the reality of the large-scale combat operations underway in China, and recognizes that during the continuation of this state, the Japanese army stationed in China can put forward special requests in order to ensure its own safety and maintain the security of the areas under its control, and that it is necessary to eliminate all actions and causes that are harmful to the Japanese army and beneficial to its enemy. The British government should make it clear to its officials and nationals in China that it has no intention of taking any actions or measures that may hinder the Japanese army in achieving the above-mentioned goals, and should control such actions when such actions are taken, in order to confirm the policy. (Domei, 24th)

### Britain Asks Japan to Suppress Exaggerated Propaganda Prohibit Newspapers from Publishing Excessive Demands and Must Stop Anti-British Incitement

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax made the same remarks in the House of Lords today as Prime Minister Chamberlain made in the House of Commons today. The Foreign Secretary also stated that both Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie were aware during the talks leading to the Anglo-Japanese compromise that: (1) The Japanese government does not harbor the intention of preventing the British government from raising any cases that may occur in the future; (2) The British government has expressed the opinion that nothing in the plan affects the obligations of other powers; (3) Sir Robert Craigie had informed the Japanese government that it was imperative not to encourage newspapers to engage in mutual accusations and extravagant demands, which would only hinder the outcome of negotiations on local disputes that were about to begin; (4) Sir Robert Craigie had made strong representations regarding the anti-British movement. The Foreign Secretary continued that this riot would largely come to an end as a result of the compromise that had now been agreed upon. At the same time, it was also heard that Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had declared that the Japanese government had determined its policy and could control riots that did not conform to this policy. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Cecil then rose to speak, asking to pay attention to a certain statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, and it was heard that the British government, in view of this statement, was prepared to declare that it did not advocate reversing its usual policy towards General Chiang Kai-shek. The Foreign Secretary replied that he did not wish to make detailed comments on Hiranuma's statement before receiving an official report, but recalled that Prime Minister Chamberlain had clearly stated in the House of Commons last week that Britain could not change its policy at the direction of any other country, and that the British government would certainly maintain this position without hesitation. (Reuter, 24th)

(Tokyo) When a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters today, he was asked whether the actions that threatened Britons in China would end now that the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference on the Tianjin issue was being held. The spokesperson replied that the Japanese had no connection with the anti-British movement currently underway in China. (Reuter, 24th)

Editorial

### New Appeasement Movement

The changes in the international situation are truly similar to the sunny and rainy weather of these days. Since the Munich Agreement, the offensive of the aggressors has become increasingly arrogant and despotic, the map of Europe has changed again and again, small and weak countries are in danger, and the credibility of Britain has plummeted. Chamberlain resolutely ignored the ridicule at home and abroad, but very hesitantly wavered between the anti-aggression front and the appeasement policy.

The new "appeasement" movement is brewing not only in compromising with Japan, but also in Europe. It is said that a "peace" plan related to Danzig is being drafted to "calm" Hitler, while German economic expert Walter is in talks with London. As for the Far East, the negotiations between Craigie and Arita in Tokyo have already established preliminary concessions to "improve" the relationship between London and Tokyo. Europe and the Far East are one body; apart from China's resistance, which is a unique glory, everything else is stealthy and ambiguous. A certain newspaper in Paris said, "Britain's position in Europe will be strengthened due to the Anglo-Japanese compromise," which is completely the self-consolation of a pitiful worm, a self-mockery. Frankly speaking, today the eastern and western aggressors have completed close contact, and the compromise in the East has not only encouraged the advance of the eastern aggressors, but also induced the arrogance of the West. To go back further, what was the result of the Munich humiliation? It was Japan's seizure of Hainan Island, intensifying the threat to the interests of Britain and France; to go back closer, what was the result of Japan's blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin? It was Hitler's intensification of his coveting of Danzig, and the rise of the anti-British movement in Germany and Italy. And the compromise in Tokyo will inevitably have its consequences.

The Munich Agreement was the result of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. It left a painful lesson for the world, and it planted a greater and deeper root of disaster in the international community. Therefore, the "new appeasement movement" that once again compromises with the aggressors, in addition to expanding and deepening the international crisis, Britain making further concessions, is war. According to the Associated Press, French political circles have reacted with disgust to Chamberlain's attempt at a "new appeasement movement," and they believe that this attempt is completely detrimental to France, "First, as a result of this new appeasement policy, France's allies will inevitably abandon it one after another; second, after Germany obtains the actual benefits of the new appeasement policy, it will be insatiable and will continue to demand concessions; third, if the new appeasement policy is implemented, Italy's demands for French colonies will be revived." Yes, the result of France's following Chamberlain in Munich greatly weakened its own position, and if France wants to safeguard its own interests and security, it must resolutely oppose that "new appeasement policy."

Chamberlain's "new appeasement movement" has unfavorable effects on the Far East, but it will never create a "Munich of the East" situation as the aggressors hope. Because although Chamberlain wants to repeat the tragedy of Munich, China's firm self-reliance in resistance will inevitably make Chamberlain unable to direct the tragedy. Although China welcomes any assistance from foreign forces, it does not rely on the assistance of foreign forces. Therefore, even without foreign assistance, it will inevitably continue to resist. Moreover, it is by no means the entire international community that is following Britain's retreat.

### President Chiang's Opinion on Anglo-Japanese Negotiations The Aim of the War of Resistance is to Complete the Revolution and is Not Affected by the External Environment The Government is Determined to Maintain Legal Tender and Consolidate the Financial Foundation

(Chongqing) President Chiang expressed his opinion at the joint memorial week of the Central National Government on the 24th, roughly saying that no matter how difficult the environment is, there must be a way to resist the war, and the more difficult the environment, the more practical the way to resist the war, the greater the strength, and the faster the period of final victory. The current war situation is indeed more consolidated than before, and it is allowed that in the military aspect, the battle reports from various war zones have been completely stabilized, and are absolutely different from the situation before the retreat from Hankou. The internal spirit is even more united and absolutely consistent. No matter what difficulties, they can be broken through, and the more difficult it is, the more it can encourage struggle. All countries that have been revolutionized and revived in the world are like this. Haven't the Soviet Union and Turkey experienced difficulties and been subjected to long-term and strict blockades in the process of revolution? It was once said that today's difficulties are not considered difficulties, and there will be ten times or a hundred times more difficulties than today in the future, but we will definitely be able to struggle strongly in extreme difficulties and dangers to achieve victory. This war of resistance is a struggle to complete the revolution, and the revolution is absolutely not affected by changes in the external environment. Now all countries in the world, the vast majority of the people, are supporting justice and reason, and sympathizing with our war of resistance. We will absolutely not be isolated, and as far as the past is concerned, our revolution originally had no material basis. Chiang also mentioned the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, believing that in fact there would never be a Far East Munich. Because friendly countries are countries that value credibility and understand the overall situation, they can never abandon their own obligations and legal stance, nor will they ignore their own interests. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use Munich as a comparison. It must be known that China is the Republic of China created by revolutionary struggle and self-reliance, which is completely different from the situation of Czechoslovakia's founding due to the results of the European War. After more than two years of war resistance, the walls are particularly clear, and the war resistance mentality of the national military and civilians is particularly strong. The Chinese nation will never succumb to any difficult environment and abandon its sacred duty of self-hygiene and survival. As far as ourselves are concerned, the government has always believed in the motto of "Heaven helps those who help themselves." No matter in military affairs, diplomacy, or economy, it has been decided from the beginning to support itself, struggle independently to the end, and naturally hope that there will be more and more friendly countries to assist. Without assistance, it is even more necessary to persevere in the struggle to the end. After the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations, our strength in resisting the war can not only be strengthened, but also be more lasting. It is permissible to forget one characteristic, that China is a revolutionary country, and no matter what hardships it encounters, it must have the determination to struggle independently, and never have a mentality of reliance and wait-and-see. Chiang then discussed the economy and finance, saying that the foreign exchange rate was manipulated by speculators in the Shanghai black market, and there was a temporary shaking phenomenon a few days ago, but the government will definitely always maintain the price of legal tender, supply legal foreign exchange, and implement appropriate controls. The government has a definite grasp to consolidate the financial foundation. Regarding the control of foreign exchange, the government has studied a more complete and appropriate overall method to seek fundamental stability. It must be known that the financial and financial foundation of the war of resistance is in the inland. The financial economy in the inland has been established in the past year, so it can now be responsible for declaring that the government is determined to maintain the value of legal tender with all its strength, and will definitely be able to maintain the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign exchange as much as possible. This is no problem. There are more than sufficient preparations for the use of legal tender in the occupied areas, and it will be maintained with all our hearts to ensure that our people's livelihood is not affected in the slightest, and that our compatriots do not suffer any loss. Now that a new policy is being implemented, the economic foundation will be more consolidated in the future, and there will be great progress in the national economy and the people's livelihood. It must be known that this change in the foreign exchange rate is absolutely beneficial to the war economy, and will absolutely not have any unfavorable effects on the war of resistance, because all military equipment and military supplies have been fully prepared, and now there is no need to use a single cent of the foreign exchange fund to replenish military equipment. Moreover, all provinces have had bumper harvests this year, which not only increases exports, but also provides a richer supply of daily necessities. At the same time, due to the change in the foreign exchange rate, it can reduce unnecessary imports, curb huge leaks, and create natural savings. In short, the war of resistance originally relied on self-reliance in economy and independent combat in military affairs as the basis. If we can strengthen ourselves and help ourselves, we will be able to get the help of friendly countries in the world. (24th Electricity)

(Chongqing) Well-informed sources here declared last night that, regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, as a result of Britain's expression of compromise to Japan, the Chinese government will seriously consider the memorandum of compromise jointly issued by Britain and Japan before expressing its attitude again. Although Chinese people are disappointed with the news of Britain's concession to Japan, they are not surprised. At the beginning of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, Britain had already accepted the conditions proposed by Japan that were unfavorable to China. Political observers believe that this has indicated Britain's intention to compromise. Chinese officials here stated that although Britain has changed its attitude, China's policy of resisting the war will not change, and it will still adhere to its initial determination to resist the war to the end. It is said that Britain's change of attitude will affect China's combat effectiveness in material terms. It must be known that China's current resistance is not entirely based on foreign aid. The reason why the war of resistance has been able to last until today is entirely due to the manpower of our country. The spokesperson continued that China now has at least enough arms to support it for another year and a half. (Haitong, 24th)

### First Anglo-Japanese Roundtable Conference Discusses Tianjin Security Issues Organizing a Committee to Discuss Some Details Newspapers Predict that It Can Be Concluded Within the Month

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks entered the second stage on the 24th, and began to discuss specific issues regarding the Tianjin case. At 8:40 this morning, British Ambassador Craigie first went to the Foreign Minister's residence to discuss future matters with Foreign Minister Arita, and then left at 8:50. Then, at 9:00 a.m., the British and Japanese representatives all arrived at the residence of the Foreign Affairs Officer, and at 9:20, the meeting was held in the form of a roundtable conference. The Japanese attendees included Minister Kato, Consul Tanaka, Major General Shikito, Colonel Kawamura, and other related administrative officials (Domei, 24th)

(Tokyo) The British attendees were Craigie, Military AttachÃ© Picot, Tianjin Consul Herbert, Commercial Secretary Maclay, Second Secretary Goebbels, and Third Secretary Bland, Third Secretary Allen of the British Embassy in China (Reuter, 24th)

(Tokyo) The first Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference opened at 9:20 this morning. Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie first introduced the representatives from their respective countries. Then, Foreign Minister Arita put forward the Japanese conditions regarding the specific issues of the Tianjin case, and requested that discussions be conducted according to the Japanese conditions. The British side agreed to this, and then Minister Kato explained the various conditions in detail. The British and Japanese representatives gradually conducted the meeting, and temporarily announced a break at 11:25.

The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 12:15 p.m. on the 24th that in order to discuss various issues related to the Tianjin incident, representatives from Britain and Japan held the first meeting at the residence of the Foreign Affairs Officer at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th. Minister Kato first gave a comprehensive explanation of the Japanese viewpoint, and British Ambassador Craigie only gave a simple reply to this, without going into details. Then, the Japanese side added explanations, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 4:00 p.m. today, and then the meeting was adjourned.

In the previous Arita-Craigie meetings, because no one else participated, they were all conducted in English. However, in today's first roundtable conference on the Tianjin issue, the Japanese side spoke entirely in Japanese. First, Minister Kato spoke in Japanese, and then Administrative Officer Asami translated it into English. On the British side, Ambassador Craigie spoke in English, and Secretary Brahm translated it into Japanese. During the subsequent meetings, the Japanese side continued to use Japanese. (Domei, 24th)

(Tokyo) Regarding the Tianjin incident, after the opening of the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference today, the British and Japanese representatives conducted general discussions on the issue of maintaining the safety and public order of Tianjin. Then, a committee was organized with two representatives from each of Britain and Japan to clarify some of the details raised during the conference. The next full roundtable conference will be held when the committee has completed its report. The committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita will invite the British and Japanese representatives to lunch tomorrow. After the continued meeting this afternoon, the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following communiquÃ©: The second Anglo-Japanese talks were held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:10 p.m., focusing on general discussions on the issue of maintaining the safety and public order of Tianjin. Some points need to be clarified in detail, which will be discussed by a committee organized by British representatives Picot and Herbert, and Japanese representatives Tanaka and Ota. The committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and a full roundtable conference will be convened after the report is completed. It is heard that the two meetings this morning and afternoon have proceeded smoothly, and the two sides exchanged opinions on the issues of maintaining Tianjin's security and order and police administration in a free and frank manner, without any fierce disputes. Some newspapers predict that these talks can be peacefully concluded within this month (Reuter, 11-14th)

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese on-site negotiations on the 24th continued from 4 p.m., discussing the security and police issues that are considered the most difficult to resolve in the on-site issues. Based on the general understanding established between Arita and Craigie the other day, the Japanese side requested the British side to cooperate in eliminating various anti-Japanese activities in the concession, and stated the Japanese claims regarding (1) strictly suppressing anti-Japanese movements in the British Concession, (2) jointly investigating anti-Japanese criminals in the British Concession, and (3) removing anti-Japanese Chinese employees of the Concession Public Bureau. Although the British side understood the spirit of the Japanese claims, it expressed opinions on strictly suppressing anti-Japanese movements and jointly investigating anti-Japanese criminals, hoping to cooperate with the Japanese side within the scope of not harming the autonomous security maintenance rights of the concession. There is still some distance between the opinions of the British and Japanese sides on this, so in order to obtain a consensus between the two sides on specific issues, it was decided that a small committee would be organized by Japanese Consul Tanaka, Major Ota, British Consul Harbutt, and Major General Picot for evaluation. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 p.m. In general, the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference will be held again on the 26th. (Domei, 24th)

### US State Department Official Observes Japan Should Not Be Complacent

(Washington) State Department officials stated last night that Tokyo's arbitrary misinterpretation of the Arita-Craigie Agreement will make it more difficult to maintain the balance of power in the Far East in the future. However, regarding the point that Britain has recognized the state of war within China and will no longer aid China, the State Department has not yet obtained confirmation. However, if the Japanese side interprets the Anglo-Japanese agreement as a victory for the Japanese side, it will inevitably make a big mistake. Well-informed sources said that this agreement is by no means a victory for Japan, because Britain has only accepted the position that the United States has already recognized, but under this position, the freedom of the Japanese side is also greatly restricted. (Associated Press, 24th)

### London Daily Telegraph Says Britain Has Not Recognized Japan as a Belligerent

(London) The Daily Telegraph recently carried a report saying that both Britain and Japan have expressed concessions, but the extent of the concessions that the Japanese side has reported and the claim that Japan has been successful are all exaggerated. It is important to know that in the joint communiquÃ© issued by British and Japanese representatives last night, Britain did not recognize Japan's demand for belligerent rights. (Haitong, 24th)

### British Newspaper Discusses the Tokyo Talks

(London) The Times published an editorial today expressing its opinion on the memorandum signed by British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, saying that the Tokyo plan clears the way and a dangerous dispute can be ended, placing British neutrality on a foundation that is the same as the neutrality implemented by the United States and other countries. The promise given by Britain can only be criticized by those who are prepared to resist or obstruct the Japanese army. This move by Britain cannot be regarded as abandoning China or harming the interests of any foreigners in China. According to the opinion of neutral diplomats, the British government has achieved a more moderate solution than was initially possible, which can be congratulated. The rhetoric of the Axis powers during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations has indicated that the success of the negotiations will greatly disappoint Germany and Italy. Today, the Kokumin Shimbun, the organ of the Japanese military, has issued a warning that Britain will engage in alienation between Japan and the Axis powers. The reason why the Japanese government is comparatively accommodating in resolving the matter is due to various factors, and the domestic situation is one of them. The domestic extremists are currently using the anti-British movement to cover up the resurgence of their activities. The majority of the Japanese ruling class is frightened by this dangerous undertow, and is quietly supporting the resolution behind the scenes. At the same time, the Japanese government also understands that if it misses the current opportunity, Anglo-Japanese relations will become enemies and cannot be salvaged. (Reuter, 24th)

### Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing, Chinese Planes Fight Back Vigorously, Over One Hundred Bombs Dropped Before Retreating

(Chongqing) On the 14th, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing at dusk, as the new moon rose. Fierce fighting broke out with the Chinese Air Force. The Japanese planes, heavily struck by the Chinese planes, were in disarray and quickly retreated, unable to sustain the battle. Today, the Chinese Air Defense Command reported that the Japanese planes were divided into two groups: the first group with eighteen planes and the second group with nine planes, totaling seventeen planes, flying west to attack Chongqing. After receiving the report, the Chinese Air Force was ready and waiting. Soon, the Japanese planes entered Chongqing airspace in two groups. The Chinese ground searchlights immediately focused and searched for the Japanese planes. Upon finding the Japanese planes, the Chinese Air Force bravely fought back. Under the heavy fire of the Chinese forces, the Japanese planes dared not linger and hastily dropped over a hundred incendiary and explosive bombs in several suburban areas before attempting to escape. The Chinese Air Force continued to pursue and fire fiercely. According to eyewitnesses, one Japanese plane was seen emitting white smoke and plummeting from the sky. After driving the Japanese planes out of the country, the Chinese Air Force reorganized and returned to base. According to a subsequent investigation, a fire broke out at one location in the suburbs where bombs landed, destroying dozens of houses. There were some civilian casualties, but the number is unknown. (24th dispatch)

### Serious Anti-British Riot Erupts in Tanggu, Kailuan Mining Bureauâ¦Asiatic Petroleum Companyâ¦Jardine Matheson & Coâ¦All Attacked, British Side Lodges Protest with Japan

(Tianjin) A serious anti-British riot and demonstration occurred in Tanggu last night. The British destroyer HMS Thracian (1,045 tons) arrived there this morning and is docked at the Asiatic Petroleum Company wharf. The British Consul-General in Tianjin and the British military authorities have separately lodged protests with Japanese personnel and military authorities. The sequence of events is as follows: Last night, about two hundred rioters began rioting, first attacking the Kailuan Mining Bureau buildings, throwing bricks and stones, and smashing doors and windows. They then went to the residence of the manager of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil station, destroying its doors and windows, cutting the telephone lines, and throwing bricks and stones at the company's huge oil tanks, but without causing damage. They then rushed to Jardine Matheson & Co., smashing many doors and windows. Finally, they rushed to Butterfield & Swire, but there was no violence. According to Chinese rumors today, a larger anti-British riot will soon be held in Dagu. Today, a reporter from a certain newspaper asked a Japanese military spokesperson, given the frequent anti-British demonstrations occurring in various parts of China, whether the Japanese army had the ability to maintain peace and order. The spokesperson replied that this anti-British movement was spontaneous, originating from the people themselves. The Japanese army currently has the ability to maintain peace and order, so while sympathizing with the anti-British movement, it will still suppress any attempt to disrupt peace and order, because rioting is illegal. The spokesperson admitted that when the riot occurred in Tanggu yesterday, the Chinese and Japanese police forces there were perhaps insufficient. However, he could not provide a concrete answer to the question of why the authorities, who were nearby when the riot occurred yesterday, did not suppress it. The reporter further asked how long it would take to disperse an anti-Japanese demonstration if one occurred. The spokesperson smiled and replied, "The Japanese have been working to change the feelings of the Chinese people since 1931." Reporters also inquired about the restrictions placed on the Tianjin Concession and whether there was any possibility of relaxing them. The spokesperson replied that there would be no change in these restrictions while the Tokyo talks were in progress. (Reuters, 24th)

(Weihaiwei) The anti-British movement has now spread to Weihaiwei. Anti-British leaflets are being distributed everywhere, and the Chinese-language Xinminbao, sponsored by the Japanese, is also publishing vehement articles attacking Britain. An organization calling itself the Chinese Patriotic Anti-British Association is the body behind this movement. The Xinminbao stated that any Chinese still working for the British should be sentenced to death, and that all British people must be expelled from Weihaiwei, with Chinese people monitoring their departure and not allowing them to return to China. The text frequently used phrases such as "ferocious British," "hateful British," "unwelcome British," and "shameless British." (Reuters, 24th)

(Guangzhou) Although the Japanese authorities here are said to have prohibited anti-British demonstrations and parades, anti-British propaganda in Chinese newspapers is intensifying daily, branding Britain as the representative of white imperialism and the common enemy of the yellow race in Asia. One newspaper carried an editorial stating that as Japan becomes increasingly strong, Britain will lose all its interests in China. (Reuters, 24th)

### Japanese Dispatch Reports Soviet-Japanese Air Battle, Also Artillery Battle

(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters announced at 12:20 PM that on July 23, in the air over the Nomonhan battlefield, the Japanese Air Force engaged in combat with seventy Soviet-Mongolian fighter planes and sixty bombers, shooting down forty-two fighter planes and two bombers, totaling forty-four planes. In addition, Japanese planes attacked Soviet-Mongolian fighter planes hidden on the ground, setting one on fire and destroying several others. Four Japanese planes have not yet returned.

### Xianghe Steamer Searched by Japanese, Gold and Silver Bars Confiscated, Three Crew Members Arrested

(Tianjin) The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Xianghe steamer was stopped and boarded for inspection by armed Japanese personnel on Saturday night downstream of the British Concession, a process that lasted for over two hours. As a result, two gold bars and several silver bars were confiscated, and three Chinese crew members of the steamer were arrested. Initially, one Chinese, one Japanese, and one Korean person boarded the ship, claiming they wanted to meet a certain Chinese crew member of the ship. The Japanese and Korean individuals were armed. Subsequently, a Japanese military police boat carrying plainclothes armed personnel and customs officers docked alongside the ship, demanding to search it. As a result of the search, two gold bars and some silver bars, the quantity of which is unknown, were found and confiscated by the customs officers, who said they would report to the customs authorities. The three Chinese crew members of the steamer were then arrested before the armed personnel left the ship. It is noted that this armed boarding and inspection is highly irregular, as only customs officials are authorized to board and inspect ships. It is reported that Jardine Matheson & Co. has taken up the matter with the relevant authorities. (Reuters, 24th)

### Wounded Company Commander Returns to the Front Line

(Chongqing) Company Commander Li Zongdai, a disabled officer of the second degree, has applied to return to the front line. He came to Chongqing to report to the responsible authorities and await assignment. Company Commander Li is from Qixia, Shandong, and is twenty-two years old this year. In 1934, he left Nankai Middle School in Tianjin and later joined the Taiyuan Military Branch School. After graduating, he was assigned as a probationary platoon leader in General Pang Bingxun's unit. After the July 7th Incident, he followed the army in battles along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. In the battle of Cangzhou, his leg was hit by shrapnel. After treatment, as his ability to walk was not impaired, he insisted on being discharged from the hospital and returning to the front line. At that time, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River, captured Jinan, and advanced south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Witnessing the homeland of Confucius and Mencius overrun by the iron hooves of the Japanese army, he was filled with anger and pain. He went to southern Shandong and took a position as a training cadre in the people's anti-Japanese self-defense army, leading a unit of militiamen to conduct guerrilla warfare in Taian, Qufu, Sishui, and other places. Subsequently, Teng County fell, and the right flank was under severe pressure. Li was ordered to return to his original unit and fought in the Battle of Taierzhuang. He charged into battle and was about fifty meters from Taierzhuang when his right eye was pierced by a Japanese bullet. He recovered after several months of treatment. Because his right eye was blind and his left leg was slightly lame, he was classified as a disabled officer of the second degree according to regulations. He was entitled to an annual pension from the state to live out the rest of his life. However, Li was unwilling to live such a leisurely life in the rear and insisted on returning to the front line. Upon arriving in Chongqing, he paid his respects to his alma mater's President Zhang Boling. President Zhang regarded Li's two injuries and his return to the front line as a model for young people and soldiers. In addition to commending him in person, he presented him with a screen bearing the four characters "Sacrifice Self to Save the Country." (23rd dispatch)

### Yangtze and Yellow Rivers Both See Rapid Rise in Water Levels, Very Dangerous for Ferry Boats on Both Banks, Waterways Below Fugou Flooded

(Chongqing) Here, the surface of the Yangtze River is currently rising rapidly, once rising nearly thirty feet in twenty-four hours. The high water level and rapid currents make crossing the river between the north and south banks extremely difficult and very dangerous. Hardly a day goes by without seeing the tragic scene of capsized boats. Male and female passengers on the boats are swept into the rushing river amidst cries for help, and are quickly swallowed by the whirlpools. Reports from Chinese sources in Henan Province also state that the water level of the Shi River in that area has risen sharply, and the flooded waterways below Fugou are currently over fifty feet wide, making crossing the river almost impossible.

### Disagreement Among British Cabinet Members Regarding European Situation Resolution Plan, Halifax Demands Thorough Investigation of Source, Hudson Declares it Arose from Private Discussion, Chamberlain Declares British Government Has No Intention of Lending Money to Germany

(London) Herr Walter, a Counselor of the German Ministry of Economics, is currently here to attend the whaling conference. He discussed a plan to resolve the European situation with the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, last week. Regarding this matter, Hudson issued a statement last night, which has been reprinted by various morning newspapers. The wording is largely the same, but the reaction is remarkable and noteworthy. The Labour Party's Daily Herald stated, "Minister Hudson has discussed a 'plan' with Herr Walter, representative of General Goering, the dictator of the German Four-Year Plan. A certain newspaper revealed its contents a few days ago, claiming that Britain would lend Germany Â£100 million, and Germany would sign an agreement promising to reduce its existing armaments and setting a limit on future armaments as a condition for the loan. When Foreign Secretary Halifax learned of this, he was furious and insisted on investigating the source of this plan. It is said that Prime Minister Chamberlain will summon Hudson to provide an explanation, and if he is not satisfied, Hudson will inevitably resign to apologize for embarrassing the cabinet." Regarding this matter, Hudson made a statement to reporters from this newspaper last night, saying, "It is true that I discussed a plan with Herr Walter, but so far, the details that have been circulated outside are inconsistent with the truth. I hereby clearly state that my discussions with Herr Walter were conducted entirely in a private capacity, and this will become clear sooner or later." (Havas, 24th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently declared in the House of Commons that the British government has no intention of lending money to Germany, nor does it intend to negotiate this matter. Whether there is any possibility of negotiating this issue, I do not know. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

(London) After the details of the conversations between the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, and Herr Walter, Counselor of the German Ministry of Economics, were disclosed, there were rumors that Hudson was uneasy in his position. He subsequently provided an explanation to Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the Prime Minister was satisfied, so he is unlikely to resign. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

(London) Regarding reports that a senior official had initiated a plan to lend Germany Â£100 million as a reward for Germany's agreement to limit its armaments, the Daily Mail and other newspapers reported today that the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, had not mentioned it. (Reuters, 24th)

(London) The Daily Express recently reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to issue a statement to the House of Commons today regarding Britain's intention to lend a huge sum of money to Germany. According to the report, the loan plan was proposed by the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, to Herr Walter, representative of the German Ministry of Economics. The newspaper believes that when Chamberlain issues the statement regarding the plan, he will firmly express Britain's opposition to Germany's further expansion of its military hegemony in Central Europe. Chamberlain will also advise Germany that if it wants to stop the waste of the arms race and save the world economy from bankruptcy, Germany should pursue a different policy. (Haitong, 24th)

(London) Regarding the plan for Britain to lend a huge sum of money to Germany, the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, recently wrote to the Daily Express and the Daily Mail, stating, "The loan plan was not proposed by British officials to Germany, as reported in the newspapers, but was proposed by me to Herr Walter, representative of the German Ministry of Economics, in a private capacity. The amount of the loan was not discussed at the time." It is said that the loan plan suggested that if Germany were willing to abandon Czechoslovakia and were willing to limit or reduce its armaments, Britain would be willing to facilitate Germany's access to world raw materials and provide economic assistance to convert its arms industry into peacetime industries. Hudson touched upon the loan plan in a speech he delivered in Harrogate yesterday, saying that to maintain peace in the world for the next thirty years, countries with overpopulation should redistribute the world's undeveloped land. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)

German Newspapers Mock Loan Strategy

(Berlin) German political circles today acknowledged that when German economic expert Herr Wohlthat spoke with the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, in London, he may have heard about the possibility of granting Germany a loan. If so, Herr Wohlthat certainly did not listen to it in an official capacity, but rather listened to the opinions expressed by his host as a guest. German newspapers denounced the talk of a loan as British bluster, saying that the loan campaign was a clumsy strategy. (Reuters, 24th)

France Feels Apprehensive

(Paris) Here, there is great satisfaction over the collapse of Germany's "peace offensive," but the uneasy atmosphere caused by another unpleasant piece of news has not been completely eliminated. It is rumored that Britain intends to lend Germany 100 million pounds in exchange for Germany disarming and recognizing the status quo in Europe. While French authorities are confident that they can thwart any German attempt to isolate them, they are still very apprehensive that Britain may seek to "bribe" Germany. France not only loathes the results of Chamberlain's appeasement policy, but is also worried about a new appeasement policy towards Germany through political and economic means behind closed doors. France believes that any such attempt would have major implications and would be detrimental to the country: First, the new appeasement policy would result in France's allies abandoning it one after another; second, Germany, having gained the benefits of the new appeasement policy, would be insatiable and continue to demand concessions. Finally, French authorities believe that Italy's demands for French colonies would also be revived as a result. The French have repeatedly urged London to accept Soviet conditions and conclude a Franco-British-Soviet peace pact, and the above view is the best explanation for this. (Associated Press, 24th)

### Forster Declares Danzig's Military Preparedness, "Ready to Deal with All Events"

Danzig Albert Forster, leader of the Nazi Party in the Free City of Danzig, today addressed 4,000 shipyard workers here, making the first public acknowledgment of Danzig's military preparations, saying that Danzig no longer needs to rely on Germany. "We are now prepared for all events. Other countries may engage in military preparations, but they cannot catch up with us. We have the right to reclaim stolen land, and we will reclaim it." (Reuters, 23rd)

Warsaw The semi-official Polish newspaper Kurier Polski published an editorial yesterday arguing that the Polish people should fulfill their historical mission of fighting for national freedom and fight for their country with a cheerful spirit. The article stated, "The situation at the mouth of the Vistula River was created by the Treaty of Versailles, and we must now improve it. We believe that it will be difficult to avoid war in order to resolve the Baltic Sea issue. Only guns can calm the development of the Polish nation. The Polish people must go to war together for the issue of the city of Danzig. Poland's territory should include part of German Upper Silesia and all of East Prussia, except for the city of Danzig. If war breaks out, Poland will certainly be able to eliminate the claws of Prussia, lay the foundation for long-term peace for the country, and then conquer Silesia, East Prussia, and Mazovia." (Haitong, 24th)

### German-Soviet Trade Negotiations Resume

(Moscow) A semi-official statement issued yesterday said that German-Soviet negotiations on trade and credit issues have resumed in Berlin. Observers here commented that the recent rumors have been swirling, saying either that a German military delegation had come to the Soviet Union or that the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, would be traveling to Moscow. These rumors are sufficient to create a negative impression, and the Soviet semi-official side has issued the above statement to correct them, not to exert pressure on Britain and France. (Havas, 23rd)

(Berlin) According to Japanese sources, Germany is negotiating a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The German Foreign Ministry has firmly denied this, and responsible parties have reiterated that the scope of the current negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union is limited to credit and trade issues. However, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Neutrality, which was concluded on April 20, 1926, is equal in nature to a non-aggression treaty and has not been declared invalid. The Soviet representative in Berlin still seems to regard it as fully valid. According to Article 1 of this treaty, the signatory countries shall maintain contact on all political and economic issues relating to the interests of both parties. Article 2 stipulates that if one of the signatory countries is involved in a conflict with another country without being provoked, the other party shall remain neutral. Article 3 stipulates that if one of the signatory countries is involved in a conflict with another country without being provoked, causing it to suffer financial and economic sanctions, the other party shall not participate.

### French Troops Completely Withdraw from the Sanjak Region, Handover Procedures Completed, Celebrations Held Throughout the Territory

Ankara After France and Turkey agreed last month to return the Sanjak region of Syria to Turkey, the last batch of French troops stationed in the Sanjak paid their respects to the Turkish flag this morning and left the region. This is the most prominent sign of Franco-Turkish friendship. Thousands of spectators sang the French and Turkish national anthems to see the French troops off. Turkish flags are now flying throughout the Sanjak region, and Turkey is scheduled to hold celebrations for three days starting today. (Reuters, 23rd)

Turkish Capital After France and Turkey concluded an agreement on June 23 to return the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic (French Mandate) to Turkey, the handover was completed a few days ago. Celebrations were held today throughout the country and in the Sanjak region, with particularly enthusiastic celebrations in the region. Delegations from the National Assembly and French and Turkish troops participated in various ceremonies to express the close friendship between France and Turkey. The semi-official newspaper Ulus commented, "Our country is a sincere ally of France and a loyal neighbor of the Syrian Republic. Therefore, today's celebration of the return of the Sanjak region to our country also has the significance of celebrating the close cooperation between Turkey, France, and Syria.

Our people are full of self-confidence, and this should not be difficult to achieve." (Havas, 23rd)

### Hungary Discovers Large Oil Field, Oil Wells Reach Twenty

Hungarian Capital Many oil fields have recently been discovered in various parts of Hungary. If they can be properly developed, the country could become one of the major oil-producing countries in Europe within a few years. Germany has always been very concerned about the development of Hungary's various economic resources. In addition, the success of a certain American company in exploiting oil in NagykÃ¡nizsa has attracted even more attention. The company began conducting investigations as early as 1918, when only two oil wells were discovered. Now, the number has increased to twenty, producing 15,000 tons of oil per month, enough to meet four-fifths of the country's needs. Two oil pipelines have also been built, one 16 kilometers long and one 30 kilometers long, running from NagykÃ¡nizsa to refineries with a capacity of 320,000 tons. In addition, the oil field in the MÃ¡traverebÃ©ly area produces only 900 tons of oil per month and there is no prospect of increasing production. (Havas, 23rd)

### Rumors of Goering's Assassination Resurface; Heated Argument During High-Ranking Leaders Meeting

(London) According to yesterday's *Reynolds News*, the rumor that German Aviation Minister General Goering was recently injured in an assassination attempt by an unknown number of people has been largely confirmed. This newspaper, a left-wing publication, often publishes sensational news. Yesterday, after quoting official denials of Goering's assassination, the newspaper claimed to have obtained ample information about the incident from refugees newly arrived in Warsaw and German deserters who fled across the border to Poland. The report stated that the incident occurred one night when General Goering and Hitler were driving from Berlin to Goering's Carinhall estate, located forty miles from Berlin. When they were within ten miles of their destination, suddenly six bullets were fired at their car. One bullet struck Goering's arm, but Hitler was unharmed. After the incident, Goering's escort vehicles immediately searched the area and arrested two young German suspects. The newspaper claimed that the assassination attempt occurred after a meeting of high-ranking Nazi leaders, during which a heated argument erupted between Goering and Propaganda Minister Goebbels. During discussions regarding the Danzig issue, Goering advocated for aggressive action. In response, Goebbels mocked Goering's courage, prompting Goering to retort, calling Goebbels a rogue.

### Rumors of French Cabinet Reshuffle

(Paris) This morning, "Le Populaire," the mouthpiece of the independent socialists, a newspaper sponsored by the French left wing, prominently carried rumors of a possible change in the French cabinet. According to speculation from parliamentary and business circles, the Foreign Minister may be among those replaced. *Le Populaire* reported that Prime Minister Daladier has not yet decided on a successor for the Foreign Minister. It is said that Daladier has two people in mind to succeed Bonnet: one from the Radical Socialist Party and the other from the moderate faction. There are also rumors that the Finance Minister will be replaced. Mandel, the current Colonial Minister, seems to be the most likely successor to Reynaud, as Reynaud and Mandel are the only two current cabinet members who belong to the right wing.

### Britain Promises Loan to Poland

(London) The *Daily Express* reports that Britain has agreed to Poland's request for a loan and will allow Poland to use part of the loan to purchase goods outside of Britain. It is reported that Halifax and Chamberlain both agree with Poland's views. The main motivation for this loan is not commercial but political cooperation. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)

### Former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengqi Speaks in Hong Kong, Recounting the Lugouqiao Incident

(Hong Kong) Wang Lengqi, the former magistrate of Wanping County and a key figure in the Lugouqiao Incident, now resides in Hong Kong. He recently gave an exclusive interview to a reporter from the Associated Press, detailing the facts before and after the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident. The Lugouqiao Incident has attracted worldwide attention. This is the first time the events have been recounted by the protagonist. Mr. Wang stated, "As everyone knows, the Lugouqiao Incident was, in fact, the starting point of this Far Eastern war. Wanping County and the Lugouqiao Bridge are on the Pinghan Railway, only a few miles from Beiping. Wanping and Fengtai on the Pingpu Railway are the most important strongholds of Beiping. After the Japanese army occupied Fengtai in September 1936, they coveted Wanping. Initially, the Japanese announced that they wanted to purchase 6,000 acres of land between Fengtai and Wanping to build barracks and an airfield. At that time, I was the county magistrate. Japanese officials contacted me more than twenty times to negotiate the purchase of land, but each time I refused. The Japanese army then conducted military exercises outside Wanping, ignoring Chinese protests. Eventually, they even conducted night exercises. On the evening of July 7, 1937, at 10 p.m., without prior notification to the Chinese authorities, the Japanese army dispatched a company for field exercises. Under these special circumstances, I ordered the city gates closed as a precaution. I then learned that the Japanese had notified the Chinese authorities in Beiping that one Japanese soldier was missing during the exercises. It was claimed that the soldier was killed by the Chinese garrison or people of Wanping. I immediately ordered a search inside and outside the city, but we could not find any trace of the 'missing' soldier. The Japanese expressed their dissatisfaction and demanded permission for Japanese troops to enter the city to search. When I refused the Japanese demand, the Japanese army fired several shots at Wanping City. Later, I was summoned to Beiping. By this time, it was midnight on July 7th. After arriving in Beiping, I immediately negotiated with the Japanese special service organization. I and the Chinese authorities in Beiping firmly resisted granting permission for Japanese troops to enter Wanping County. The incident almost turned into a comedy when we received notification that the missing Japanese soldier had been found. However, the Japanese were not embarrassed and still insisted that China and Japan investigate the cause of the Japanese soldier's disappearance. The Japanese insisted on immediately forming an investigation team, composed of three members each from China and Japan. I was selected as one of the Chinese representatives. As we were leaving Beiping at dawn, I was invited to meet with Colonel Mutaguchi, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Wanping. Mutaguchi strongly opposed the formation of an investigation team and demanded that I take emergency measures to punish those responsible for the Japanese soldier's disappearance. When I stated that I could not accept his demands, Colonel Mutaguchi ordered eight Japanese trucks to Wanping, informing me that the Japanese army intended to handle the matter themselves. I immediately left Beiping. When I reached the right side of the iron bridge, about two-thirds of a mile northwest of Wanping City, I was stopped by a Japanese officer. He was carrying a map of Wanping City. I saw a unit of Japanese soldiers behind the Japanese officer, carrying machine guns and mortars, heading towards Wanping County. The officer claimed that the situation was already tense, and if the incident could not be resolved satisfactorily, the Japanese had decided to take military action. Their definition of a satisfactory resolution was that all Chinese troops stationed in Wanping must withdraw, and Japanese troops would enter Wanping from the east gate. Representatives from both sides would negotiate a final resolution. When I protested and insisted on appointing an investigation team to negotiate a resolution, the Japanese officer angrily said that the gates of Wanping City must be opened wide, and if I did not comply with Japanese demands, my life would be in danger. I felt unable to persuade them and traveled with other members of the investigation team to Wanping. After we entered Wanping City, the Japanese army launched a dawn attack on Wanping City with machine guns and mortars. I reported to the Beiping authorities by telephone. At this time, I understood that the Japanese army was determined to seize the city. I then ordered my small number of soldiers to return fire. The battle began. After several hours of intense fighting, both sides suffered casualties. Reinforcements from both sides arrived. The Japanese dispatched 3,000 troops from Fengtai and Beiping, while the Chinese dispatched a battalion of reinforcements led by Colonel Ji Xingwen to Wanping. At 3:30 p.m. on August 8, Japanese Colonel Mutaguchi sent a letter to me through a Chinese civilian, continuing to demand that the Chinese army withdraw from Wanping. I continued to refuse and sent his demands to the Beiping authorities. However, this result angered the Japanese commander, so he ordered a tighter encirclement of Wanping City. A Japanese brigade arrived at the front lines, and the fighting resumed. At the same time, the regiment of He Qifeng stationed at Babao Mountain attacked the flank of the Japanese army, and the fighting was very fierce. At 6 p.m., the Japanese brigade commander sent a letter to me, claiming that the Japanese army would bombard Wanping with heavy artillery, advising the general Chinese population to evacuate, and ordering the two Japanese representatives on the investigation team to leave Wanping before the bombardment. I replied that the Beiping authorities were concerned about the safety of the Chinese civilians and that the two Japanese representatives intended to remain in Wanping City. After receiving my reply, the Japanese immediately bombarded Wanping with heavy artillery, causing extensive damage to the city. At 8 p.m., a battalion of He Qifeng's regiment routed the Japanese army, and the remaining Japanese troops fled to Shagang, taking refuge in the defensive fortifications built by the Chinese army in 1935. At the same time, the attitude of the Beiping authorities hardened, and reinforcements from both sides continued to arrive at the front lines. The Chahar-Suiyuan Political Council also presented a counter-proposal to the Japanese, demanding that the Japanese army immediately withdraw from Fengtai and Wanping. That night, our army launched a night attack on the Japanese army. Because the Japanese army was entrenched in defensive fortifications, our night attack was not very successful. I then learned that the condition for the Japanese army to withdraw from Wanping was that the regular Chinese army would withdraw outside Wanping City, and 300 security guards led by General Shi Yousan would arrive in Wanping from northern Hebei to replace the regular army. However, the security guards did not arrive until the next morning (July 9). It was said that they had been detained by the Japanese en route. Fifty security guards led by Zhou Siqing arrived first. Because Zhou was a pro-Japanese official of the Chahar-Suiyuan Political Council, I resolutely refused to accept them. Soon, the entire team of 300 security guards arrived. They had been disarmed. When they arrived, the Japanese pretended to withdraw, but in fact, they were reinforcing their troops. Although I withdrew my troops at the time, I was aware of the Japanese plot. Later, negotiations continued, but without success. Until the 12th, my subordinates continued to clash with Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, I was summoned to Beiping to participate in negotiations. Along the way, I saw a large concentration of Japanese soldiers. The fairness of the so-called negotiations was evident. While the negotiations were in progress, the Japanese army began a large-scale attack on Wanping. The Sino-Japanese War thus began. On July 30, I was ordered to withdraw from Wanping. At that time, the 29th Army also withdrew from Beiping to southern Hebei. As I left Wanping, I could not help but shed tears. After twenty-three days of bombing, the city had been reduced to rubble. The suffering of the civilians who could not evacuate was particularly heartbreaking. However, this sacrifice was worthwhile. From the ashes of Wanping, a new China has grown, united and moving toward liberation. I deeply regret that I could not perish with the city, but it was worthèå»¶æ®å(to prolong life uselessly) in order to wait for our army to re-enter Wanping." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

### Japanese Warships Gather Off the Mouth of the Min River; Fuzhou Enters a State of War; Factories All Moved Out, Order Remains Good; Chinese Army Positions in Pingtan Shifted to Fuqing

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the fall of Shantou on June 23, the situation in Fuzhou has suddenly become tense due to its proximity to Guangdong. The authorities immediately strengthened coastal defenses and actively evacuated people and goods. As expected, on the afternoon of June 26th, six Japanese destroyers and cruisers arrived off the mouth of the Min River, anchoring in the waters off Mazu Ao and Chuan Shi Island. Together with the existing destroyer and two motorboats, there were a total of seven warships and two motorboats. The cruisers also carried nine aircraft. At 5 a.m. on the 27th, an aircraft carrier carrying more than 30 aircraft arrived off the mouth of the Min River. Five Japanese warships also arrived in the waters of Gaoshan District in Fuqing County, eastern Fujian. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 27th, the Japanese warships launched four motorboats carrying more than 40 sailors, covered by nine aircraft. They also opened fire on the coast of Changmen from the warships, forcibly landing on Chuan Shi Island off the mouth of the Min River, occupying the foreign building of the Great Eastern Electricity Company established on the island by the British. More than eighty young men on the island (the island has more than a hundred households, all engaged in fishing) were captured and taken to the warships, while the elderly and weak were driven off the island. They then installed four gun emplacements on the island, and

Threatening Changmen

Along the coast, and more than two hundred civilian boats plundered in the coastal areas of Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, and Fuqing counties were all sunk between the first buoy and the second

Courageously Repelled

At 11 a.m. on the 30th, the Japanese warships anchored in Mazu Ao also dispatched more than 20 marines, allied with more than 100 pirates from the Ao, forcibly landing on Yidou Island between Weimen and Chuan Shi, looting extensively before retreating. At approximately 8 a.m. on July 2nd, two Japanese transport ships arrived off the mouth of the Min River, along with many rubber boats, anchoring in the waters off Mazu Ao. There was no action on this day due to heavy fog along the coast. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 2nd, the Japanese warships anchored in Lianjiang County dispatched more than 40 marines, allied with more than 200 pirates from Nan'gan Tang, in more than 30 motorboats and sailboats, covered by aircraft, forcibly landing in Dinghai Township, Lianjiang County. At approximately 3 p.m., they advanced to Xiaocheng Township, about five miles from Dinghai, and the situation became quite serious for a time. The Chinese local forces rushed to intercept them, and at approximately 6 p.m., they retreated from Xiaocheng to Dinghai. At approximately 10 p.m., they retreated onto motorboats and sailboats and left. At approximately 5 p.m. on the 3rd, eight Japanese warships and two submarines anchored in Lianjiang County, and nine Japanese warships in Changle County, all headed toward Pingtan County. At approximately 10 a.m. on the 4th,

Arrived in Pingtan

At approximately 5 p.m., they dispatched more than 50 marines, allied with more than 300 pirates from Yu Ahuang's gang from Dongsha Island, to invade Guanyin Ao in the northeast of Pingtan again, covered by four aircraft. The warships also opened fire on the shore to boost their morale. The local forces stationed on the island immediately rose up to meet them. They held out for one night, and at approximately 9 a.m. on the 5th, unable to withstand the bombing by the aircraft and the shelling by the artillery, they began to cover a portion of the population to cross the sea and retreat to Fuqing County. Pingtan was thus lost. After the Japanese soldiers and pirates landed, they appointed Yu Ahuang as "county magistrate" and searched the people for food, legal tender, and young men to transport to the warships. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 6th, three of the seventeen Japanese warships anchored in Pingtan returned to Chuan Shi Island and Mazu Ao off the mouth of the Min River. From the 7th to the 11th, the Japanese warships along the coast of eastern Fujian remained unchanged. There were a total of twelve warships in Chuan Shi Island and Mazu Ao, five in Fuqing, and fourteen in Pingtan. As for air raid alarms, they were constant, with as many as six or seven per day, and at least three. Each time, the number of aircraft taking off ranged from one or two to eight or nine.

Bombing Locations

Mostly in various places along the coast off the mouth of the Min River. There have been few casualties among the people. As for the city of Fuzhou, all factories have been moved out, and most of the shops have also closed. More than half of the people have been evacuated. The streets are very quiet and have completely entered a state of war. However, the order remains very good.

### Flourishing Night Market in Guilin; Valleys All Converted into Air Raid Shelters

Guilin Correspondence: Guilin is located in the northwest corner of Guangxi Province, not far from Hunan Province. The customs and folklore are roughly similar to those of Hunan, and the language is also similar to that of Hunan. However, the vigor and vitality are, after all, different from those of Hunan. As far as Guilin is concerned, whether in the city or countryside, rich or poor, old or young, eight or nine out of ten people are wearing military uniforms and black cloth shoes.

Simple Living

Even we wanderers cannot live here. Precisely because it is simple, they value extra money very much. Because men throughout Guangxi Province have to go to war to maintain order, most of the people farming and going to the market are women. Even if there are men, they are at least fifty years old. Before dawn, they carry a load of firewood or rice and vegetables into the city to sell, and then exchange it for a load of lime or pig feed and run back to eat. Some eat before entering the city, so Guilin has both a morning market and an afternoon market. During these two market times, it is simply impossible to walk on the sidewalks. Recently, because people are afraid of air raid alarms in the morning, the afternoon is especially crowded. The night market lasts until at least twelve o'clock. The scenery of Guilin is indeed extraordinary. The mountains of Guilin are entirely stone mountains. At the junctions of the large stones, there are large old pines and lush small bushes. At the same time, the mountains of Guilin, unlike anywhere else, do not slowly rise and slowly fall. They are completely one to the east and one to the west. These mountains are so high that it can really make your neck stiff from looking up, and each mountain is very, very close. And of these many mountains, there is practically no mountain without a cave. It is truly

Mountains with Caves

These caves are connected or not connected. The large ones can hold seventy or eighty thousand people, and the small ones can hold at least seventy or eighty people. Each mountain cave is a natural air raid shelter. These air raid shelters, no matter how many thousand-kilogram heavy bombs you throw at them, are very difficult to destroy. Therefore, although many houses in Guilin City have been bombed, the number of casualties is very, very small. Unlike other places, where dozens die and hundreds are injured when there is a bombing. Therefore, every sunny morning, there is a constant stream of friends taking mountain cave tours and avoiding air raid alarms. Seven Star Cave is the most famous mountain cave in Guilin.

The Cave is Large

Winding for as long as three or four li. In large places, twenty or thirty thousand people can hold meetings, and in small places, only one person can pass through. The rocks in the mountain cave have things like rabbit heads, Jiang Taigong fishing pool, fishing nets, Taibai Jinxing alchemy platform, lychee mountain, Buddha hand mountain, stone drum, eagle catching chicks, there are so many that it is impossible to remember them all clearly. The few names listed above are all extremely realistic wonders. Elephant Trunk Hill is also very strange. It is a mountain in the river with a hole passing through below. Looking at the mountain from a distance, it really looks like an elephant's nose stretching into the river to drink water. And boats travel back and forth in this hole. Also, when the sky is overcast, the mountain fog covers the mountainside, and the sharp mountain peaks are hidden and visible. Sometimes, miles of mountain fog looks like a dragon, which is very beautiful.

### Steps and Measures for the Ministry of Education to Organize University Courses - University Courses to be Piloted from This Autumn for One Year - Specialized Courses to Begin Compilation after Summer Vacation - Courses to be Revised Once Every Five Years Starting the Year after Next

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education's Statistics Department recently published an article entitled "Steps and Measures for Organizing University Courses," as follows:

Organizing courses is not a matter that can be accomplished with a mere sigh. Therefore, after several years of effort, it has not yet been promulgated. In February of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], after Minister Chen took office, he was determined to improve courses and decided on the principles for organizing courses as: (1) setting unified standards; (2) emphasizing basic training; (3) emphasizing essential subjects. A draft of the "Measures for Organizing Courses in the Liberal Arts, Science, and Law Colleges of Universities" was prepared and sent to professors and experts in universities across the country for consultation. It was supported by a large number of people. The principles proposed in the draft are recorded as follows:

(1) Setting Unified Standards: University courses have always been determined by each school, allowing for free development according to local conditions. However, the standards set by each school are quite different, resulting in different subjects and uneven levels, losing the consistent spirit of university education. Therefore, the first principle of organizing university courses is to establish unified standards, starting with the mandatory courses. Elective courses will not be fully determined for the time being, leaving room for each school to consider and adapt. This regulation not only aims to raise the level of general university courses, but also to align with national cultural and construction policies.

(2) Emphasizing Basic Training: The existing courses in universities divide into specialized fields too early, and the basic training in general academics is not well-grounded. The various disciplines complement each other and have no strict boundaries. Students specialize too early, which is not in line with the path of advanced studies. Therefore, university courses should first pay attention to the cultivation of a broad academic foundation. The most basic subjects in liberal arts, science, and law should be designated as common mandatory courses, and then students should specialize in one field, so as to conform to the principle of proceeding from breadth to depth, and prevent students from becoming biased due to specialized research.

(3) Emphasizing Essential Subjects: The setting of subjects in general universities is inevitably too complicated, and the knowledge gained by students is inevitably fragmented and disorganized, failing to grasp the essentials and the gist of a scientific discipline. Therefore, the setting of university subjects in the future should strive for integration and concentration, so that students can have sufficient cultivation and in-depth study of the essential subjects of a discipline, and have a spirit of integration. All obscure and trivial subjects can be studied by students on their own and will not be included in the university curriculum. As for the organizing measures, the original draft listed nine organizing items:

1.  The mandatory and elective courses of all colleges and departments in national universities shall be determined by the Ministry. Mandatory courses must be uniform throughout the country. Elective courses may be adjusted by each school within the scope prescribed by the Ministry, with reference to actual needs.

2.  In the first academic year of each university college, emphasis should be placed on basic subjects, without dividing into departments. Departments will be divided from the second academic year onwards. In the third and fourth academic years, practical subjects will be set up as appropriate, depending on the nature of each college and department, in preparation for employment after graduation.

3.  Chinese and foreign languages are basic tools. Strict examinations should be held at the end of the first academic year. Chinese should be able to read ancient and modern books and write fluent texts. Foreign languages should be able to read foreign language reference books for the subjects studied in each college in order to pass. Otherwise, students must continue to study until they reach the above standards before they can graduate.

4.  Universities will still adopt the academic year system. The amount of learning in each subject can be calculated in credits. Each credit stipulates that the teacher must teach for one hour per week, and the student must study on their own for two hours per week. For subjects that require more self-study time, the teacher's teaching time should be reduced to one hour per week for every two credits.

5.  In addition to lectures and discussions by teachers, teaching in each subject should simultaneously emphasize self-study, discussion, and exercises or experiments. The scope of examinations should include not only the materials taught by the teachers, but also the materials for self-study, discussion, and exercises or experiments.

6.  Teachers should specify in detail the list of self-study books and other reference materials for each subject, supervise students to read them on time, and make notes. Students in liberal arts colleges should study famous works of ancient and modern times, one or several for each subject. Discussions should also be held during class to cultivate students' spirit of independent research.

7.  The number of exercises or experiments that students must do must be clearly specified for each subject. All exercise and experiment reports should be reviewed by the teacher on time.

8.  In addition to requiring students to pay attention to their usual exercises, each department should also specify several important subjects in the senior year courses to guide students in writing academic papers. The topics should be assigned or approved by the faculty.

9.  Graduation examinations should include important subjects in the four academic years of each college and department. The types of subjects can be determined by each school, but there must be more than five types.

Based on the above requirements, the courses are divided into three categories: (1) common mandatory; (2) departmental mandatory; (3) departmental elective. The steps for organizing and compiling them are planned as follows: (1) Investigate the subjects of each college and department in national universities, analyze and study them; (2) Invite professors from each university to express their opinions, and formulate an ideal subject list for each department; (3) Based on the actual situation of each school, and with reference to the opinions of each professor, invite experts to prepare the following drafts separately: 1. Draft list of common mandatory subjects for each college/department of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Engineering, Agriculture, Commerce, and Teacher Training; 2. Draft list of departmental mandatory and elective subjects for each department; (4) Send the draft list of common mandatory subjects for each college/department to experts and presidents/deans for review, convene meetings for discussion, and issue them to each school for trial implementation; (5) Send the draft list of departmental mandatory and elective subjects to several experts in the same department for review; (6) Send the original draft and review opinions to each college for distribution to professors and lecturers in each department to convene meetings to discuss and express opinions; (7) Based on the opinions expressed by each college and department, revise the draft again, convene a university course division discussion meeting, determine the departmental subject list, and issue it to each college for trial implementation; (8) The 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939] will be the period for each university/college to pilot the newly revised curriculum. The results of the trial implementation and the outline of each subject should be reported to the Ministry by the autumn of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940]; (9) In the autumn of the 29th year, convene the second university course discussion meeting, revise the subjects based on the results of the trial implementation, and formulate the university course outline; (10) From the 30th year of the Republic [i.e., 1941], implement the prescribed courses, and revise them once every five years thereafter; (11) The curriculum of each vocational school will be compiled starting in the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. The steps will be the same as the measures for organizing university courses.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Subsidy for Private Schools This Year - The Second Installment to be Distributed on the 28th

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) of the Shanghai International Settlement tries its best to accept requests for subsidies from Chinese private schools within the Settlement.

### Rumors Have Become the Past - Shanghai's Financial Situation Turns Stable - Banks Receive Many New Deposits - Foreign Exchange Prices Have Reached the Lowest Level

Recently, there have been many rumors in the market, some saying that the Ministry of Finance will issue new decrees to restrict withdrawals again, and some saying that certain banks will withdraw from Shanghai, which has caused great anxiety among the people. The reporter interviewed an authority in the banking industry to inquire about the truth. According to him, the original intention of the Ministry of Finance was to tighten the money supply and prevent foreign exchange speculation and arbitrage, but it unexpectedly led to villains spreading rumors and rushing to withdraw from banks. The withdrawal tide has long passed, and banks have received many new deposits. However, the current money supply in the market is still suffering from excessive tightening. The Ministry of Finance will certainly not restrict withdrawals again, causing unnecessary disturbances. As for the current sharp contraction of foreign exchange, it can reduce imports and greatly reduce the demand for foreign exchange. Moreover, with the tightening of the money supply in the market, foreign exchange prices have reached the lowest level and will not contract again. This is a simple and easy-to-understand relationship between supply and demand.

Foreign Exchange Stabilizes

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee maintained the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the HSBC Bank of England has continued to provide as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. Therefore, the foreign exchange black market price has stabilized. Yesterday morning, the HSBC Bank of England quoted the pound sterling at four pence and the US dollar at 7.75 yuan, the same as the quotation on Saturday. The actual market price was four pence and a half for the pound sterling and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar, which had eased. Then, the foreign exchange price tightened again due to the fierce buying by Japanese banks. However, because the yarn brokers were tight, they retaliated, so although the Japanese banks bought fiercely, the price did not tighten very much.

Gold Price Fluctuations

After the gold black market assembly point opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, it rose to 3,830 yuan at the opening.

It then fell to 3,500 yuan. The morning closing was 3,600 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 3,550 yuan. The major silver and gold shops initially quoted 350 yuan yesterday morning, then changed to 400 yuan, and finally to 360 yuan. The quotation was changed six or seven times in one day.

Securities Decline

In the securities black market, after the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank allowed discounting and borrowing of the principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of July, the unified government bonds rebounded sharply. Yesterday morning, due to reports of British and Japanese compromise news, speculators spread rumors again, causing prices to fall back. The closing price of Type A was 50 yuan and 4 jiao, down 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen. Type B was 42 yuan and 1 jiao, down 1 yuan and 9 jiao. Type C was 41 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, down 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. Type D was 40 yuan and 2 jiao, down 1 jiao. Type E was 40 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, down 2 yuan. Regarding the remittance exchange rate, yesterday it was 250 yuan.

Japanese Yarn Hit

According to a report from the mainland, "China News and Opinions Compilation" criticized yesterday (the 23rd) that the decline in the value of legal tender is a major blow to Japanese yarn mills, because the Japanese side cannot dump its cotton yarn in the local market and other parts of the occupied areas. At present, Japanese-operated spindles in Shanghai are no less than 1.3 million, while those operated by Chinese merchants are only 500,000. The Japanese obtained legal tender by issuing Huaxing banknotes and military tickets, and purchased a large amount of foreign cotton. In the first five months of the year, it reached more than 59 million yuan, six times the amount of foreign cotton imported in the same period last year. They used Shanghai's cheap labor to make a large amount of foreign cotton into cotton yarn and dumped it in the Chinese market, making huge profits. The victims are the Chinese. Now that the value of legal tender has fallen, Japanese yarn mills will find that the cost of purchasing foreign cotton is very high, making it difficult for them to compete with locally made cotton yarn.

Concert at Zhaofeng Park

The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a string concert at Zhaofeng Park on the afternoon of the 25th from 9:00 to 11:00 (weather permitting). There are seven programs.

### The Second Phase of Construction Government Bonds to be Issued on August 1 - Total Amount is National Currency 300 Million Yuan - The Fund is Managed by the National Debt Committee

In order to raise funds for construction projects, the National Government issued the 28th Year of the Republic [i.e., 1939] Construction Government Bonds, with a total amount of 600 million yuan in national currency. It is stipulated that they will be issued in two phases, with 300 million yuan in each phase. The first phase was issued on April 1 at face value. The second phase will be issued on August 1. The interest rate is set at 6% per annum. The repayment of the principal of the bonds will begin on January 31, 1942, and will be paid off in 25 years. The surplus profits of the state-owned enterprises that have been established and newly established, as well as the special funds for construction projects added to the salt tax, are designated as the fund and are managed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The repayment of principal and interest is designated as the Central Bank and its entrusted banks.

### New Foreign Exchange Pool: Allocation Among Banks and Money Shops - Banks Allocated 40 Million Yuan, Money Shops Notified to Allocate 10 Million Yuan - Collateral Extremely Solid, Credit Beyond Question

To restrict withdrawals and consolidate the foundation of the legal tender, the banking and money industries previously joined with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Bank of China, and the Foreign Banks' Association to prepare for and implement a new foreign exchange pool system. In addition to separately appointing members of various committees, the total amount of this new foreign exchange pool was set at 50 million yuan in national currency. It is understood that the amounts allocated to each bank and shop have now been fully determined. The Commercial Bank of China has been allocated 25 million yuan, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China together 15 million yuan, and the money shops 10 million yuan, totaling 50 million yuan.

Banks Allocated 40 Million Yuan

The members of the Bankers' Association, except for some state-owned banks, are all privately-owned commercial banks. For this new foreign exchange pool system, although the allocation of the total amount of exchange ticket reserves has been actively implemented, each bank must also provide collateral at this time to guarantee the total amount of exchange tickets. According to a banking magnate speaking to a Dagongshe reporter yesterday, the allocation of the 25 million yuan for commercial banks is nearing completion, with each bank providing written descriptions of the collateral. The 15 million yuan for state-owned banks is being allocated by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China, and the association is not responsible for the allocation.

Money Shops Notified to Allocate 10 Million Yuan

The Money Shops Association has more than 40 member shops. For the implementation of the new foreign exchange pool system, this fixed amount of 10 million yuan must be allocated and distributed in advance. Unlike the banks, where the association handles the allocation on their behalf, according to a Dagongshe reporter's inquiry yesterday, the Money Shops Association, due to the imminent implementation of the new foreign exchange pool, has already notified each member shop separately to inquire about the amount of reserves needed. Once the reports are received, the total amount and descriptions of the collateral to be provided can be compiled and submitted to the review committee, so that each shop can be reviewed whenever it uses these new tickets.

Strict Restrictions on Attached Collateral

The total amount of the new foreign exchange pool reserves has already been allocated. However, each bank and shop must attach reliable collateral within its ticket issuing authority. The strictness of this collateral is to solidify the credit of the exchange tickets, so that all industries can firmly believe in it and circulate it in the market. The types of collateral are limited to cash, silver, title deeds, securities, and goods. After review by the review committee, the tickets can then be circulated.

More Innovative Procedures for Obtaining

The implementation of the new foreign exchange system is more creditworthy than previous checks and promissory notes. Checks are sometimes returned, and promissory notes often have usage limits. Although this new type of ticket is similar to the previous ones for money shops, once the recipient verifies it, it can be used at any time. Banks and money shops can present the ticket to foreign banks, and can also transfer it to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China. It is expected that future attempts by malicious individuals to undermine the currency policy will be difficult to implement, because it is impossible to withdraw cash or speculate in foreign exchange.

Withdrawal of Deposits in Accordance with Regulations

Furthermore, regarding the payment of exchange notes, there is much rumor due to a lack of clarity. Specific details are as follows: (1) Deposits made before August 13 will be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's financial stability measures. Whether fixed or current deposits, except for companies and firms that genuinely need it for commercial purposes, which may be paid by interbank transfer, private individuals and ancestral halls will not be accommodated in any way to prevent currency outflow. (2) Deposits made after August 13 will be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's telegraphic instructions, that is, starting from June 22, for deposit payments, except for those paying wages, withdrawals up to 500 yuan per week will be paid in legal tender, and amounts exceeding 500 yuan will be paid by exchange, for interbank transfers only. However, there is no restriction on exchange payments.

### Legal Tender for Place Names in North China - Immediate Payment of Sight Drafts - If Purchasing Local Products, Funds May be Remitted Inland - Banks Considering Ways to Smooth the Process

After the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications made efforts to redeem small amounts of banknotes from place names in North China, the situation has gradually stabilized. It is now reported that the two banks, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage and to encourage capital to flow into the interior, have been notified by their head offices to revise the following two measures: (1) All those who come to redeem banknotes issued in the name of Tianjin, Shandong, and Lu or Hankou notes issued by the Bank of Communications will be paid with sight drafts payable in the original issuing location or in Chongqing. (2) To facilitate the purchase of local products in the interior by holders of notes, remittance to the interior may be considered. After these measures are taken, it is hoped that a solution will be found for those who already hold banknotes from North China and Hankou, and that it will no longer be profitable to transport banknotes to Shanghai.

Banks Consider Ways to Smooth the Process

Banks are currently considering ways to smooth the process. It is reported that the Trust Department of the New China Bank has already been entrusted by some domestic goods manufacturers and inland schools to handle purchasing and payment of tuition fees. Therefore, for all funds remitted to Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and other inland areas such as Pingjin, preferential exchange rates will be offered. Recently, it has also accepted remittances of banknotes from North China and Hankou. If banknotes from North China and Hankou are redeemed in whole amounts, it may also be accommodated at the respective exchange rates. As the season for inland products arrives, many manufacturers need to take cash to the interior to purchase goods. If all banks can do the same, the difficulties of inland exchange can be somewhat eased, and the circulation of banknotes from Hankou and North China in the market can also be greatly helped.

### War in West Shanghai Escalates and Continues

The Continental Daily reports that residents of the western district of Shanghai heard the sound of machine guns and the explosions of hand grenades and mortar shells last night (the 23rd) while going to bed. Chinese guerrillas were again clashing with Japanese soldiers. However, the scale is far larger than any of the past three or four months. The battle began at 7:30 in the Hongqiao and Longhua districts and was still going on at 1:30 this morning (the 24th). The repeated sounds of machine guns and mortars indicate that the Japanese soldiers were not just practicing. The Japanese army used illuminating mortar shells to detect the location of the guerrillas, followed by the sound of heavy machine guns and intermittent hand grenade explosions. According to Chinese sources last night, a large unit of 3,000 men from the New Fourth Army had arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai. This unit had been active in the Suzhou area, hindering Japanese military transportation. It was decided to cross the river. Now that the new Chinese troops have arrived, the Japanese army has also received reinforcements, constantly disturbing the villages west of the concession. The New Fourth Army is now building trenches and stationed not far from the Hongqiao Airport.

### Bei Xinjing Tightens Security

As a vital waterway, Bei Xinjing has tightened security in recent days due to the erratic movements of mobile units in the western Shanghai area. Ferries to the concession failed to depart on the 24th, and flights to Suzhou and Wuxi were also postponed. It is reported that over a hundred ships coming to Shanghai from the interior are being blocked outside the port of Bei Xinjing.

### New Subsidiary Currency Notes to be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month

The number of new notes reprinted by the Ministry of Finance this time is sufficient for the entire city of Shanghai. It is heard that the responsibility for distribution will still be entrusted to the banking and money industries. The new notes are expected to be shipped to Shanghai in early next month.

### US Fleet Commander Hart Arrives Today - Inauguration Ceremony Held on Flagship with Great Solemnity - Hart Promoted to Admiral After Taking Office

As Admiral Yarnell urgently needs to relinquish his post and return to the United States, the solemn inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held today on the USS Augusta flagship. The USS Augusta flagship has been moored at the head of the line of US warships in the Huangpu River since carrying Admiral Yarnell to Shanghai.

The other three admirals are the US Navy's director of tactics, the commander-in-chief of the US Fleet, and the commander of the US Fleet's battle force. After taking office as commander-in-chief, Rear Admiral Hart will remain in Shanghai for another week. After seeing Admiral Yarnell and his wife off to the United States, he will take the USS Augusta flagship to North China for his first inspection after taking office. The US gunboat USS Minnow specifically rushed from the Yangtze River defense line on the 22nd to participate in Rear Admiral Hart's inauguration ceremony today.

Commander Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol, and other officers will also participate in the inauguration ceremony. All US warships in the Huangpu River will hoist flags in salute. It is heard that Admiral Yarnell will leave Shanghai for the United States on the first of next month after relinquishing his post.

### Shanghai-Chongqing Postal Remittances - Limits Remain the Same - But Limit for Tianjin-Shanghai Remittances Revised to 20 Yuan

Rumors have been circulating that Shanghai-Chongqing remittances are being restricted due to financial changes in Shanghai, with Chongqing-Shanghai remittances limited to 20 yuan per person per day. A Xin Sheng She reporter inquired with the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau yesterday and learned that there have been no changes to Shanghai-Chongqing postal remittances. The limit for remittances from Chongqing to Shanghai remains 200 yuan per person per day, and there is still no limit for remittances from Shanghai to Chongqing. As for remittances from Tianjin and Beiping to Shanghai, there has been a slight change. The limit for remittances from Tianjin and Beiping to Shanghai is now 20 yuan per person per day, while the limit for remittances from Shanghai to these two locations remains 200 yuan per person per day.

### Japanese Troops Land in Xiaocheng, Min River, Unsuccessful

More Than Ten Japanese Warships Moored at the Mouth of the Min River - Haimen and Zhenhai Attacked Unscathed

According to shipping industry sources, five Japanese warships arrived in the Xiaocheng waters on the morning of the 22nd, opening fire and launching several speedboats full of armed Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison immediately returned fire. However, due to the strict Chinese defenses, the Japanese troops were unsuccessful. Currently, more than ten Japanese warships are moored outside the mouth of the Min River.

Haimen Bombed

Haimen in Zhejiang was bombed by three Japanese aircraft at around 9:00 a.m. on the 21st and 22nd. Chinese losses were minimal. Currently, four Japanese warships are moored in the Taizhou waters, constantly launching speedboats and patrolling the coast. Two Japanese warships arrived in the Huanghua waters of Wenzhou on the morning of the 23rd, firing more than ten shots at the shore before leaving. Although the port of Wenzhou is currently blockaded, the situation is very peaceful, and the market is gradually flourishing.

Bombing of Zhenhai

Zhenhai was bombarded by Japanese warships on the 22nd. According to shipping industry sources, the two Japanese warships moored in the Ligang waters have left. Currently, one Japanese warship is moored in the Qiliyu waters. Shanghai-Ningbo flights are still stopping at Qiliyu without hindrance.

Ship Traffic

The Lihe and Moufu ships sailed from Qiliyu, Zhenhai, at 7:00 a.m. yesterday and arrived outside Wusong at around 8:00 p.m. that evening. Due to the curfew on the Huangpu River, they were postponed until this morning to enter the port and dock. The ships carried hundreds of passengers and cargo. The Beide and Hana ships are currently outside the blockade line of Zhenhai. They began unloading cargo yesterday to Ningbo. It is not known when they will return to Shanghai.

### Suspects in Newspaper Office Attack Referred to Special Court No. 1 for Trial Yesterday - Due to Complexity of Case, Investigation Must Continue - Police Refuse to Release Information

French Concession on Special Alert

The Sino-American Daily and Evening News offices at 130 Changgeng Lane, Avenue Edward VII, were suddenly attacked at 8:30 p.m. last Saturday by more than 20 thugs armed with Mauser pistols and hand grenades in four Yunfei automobiles. They attempted to break into the two newspapers to commit violence. However, the Sino-American Daily's tea boy, Mr. Wu, cleverly closed the iron gate, preventing the thugs from entering the Sino-American Daily. The thugs then took out their weapons and fired at the Sino-American Daily, while also breaking into the composing room of the Evening News to carry out sabotage, while also firing randomly. At that time, the Chinese and Western police officers and the head patrol officer on duty nearby heard the alarm and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene and surround the thugs. Because they resisted with guns, the detectives also fired back, and bullets flew everywhere. A group of thugs took the opportunity to escape the encirclement in the original cars numbered 12235, speeding away.

Sabotage Carried Out

When they fled through the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road, they encountered the patrol team of the Lao Zha Police Station, resulting in a second fierce battle. In total, more than 200 shots were fired by both sides, and as many as 23 people were killed or injured by stray bullets, including three dead and twenty injured. One of the dead was a British citizen. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At that time, Western Detective Chief Mao Ya, Chinese Detective Chief Liao Guihe, Detective Kang Zengxiang, Gao Zhen, and others from the General Police Department arrested Shen Yufeng (26 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at 10 Huangjia Lane, Daxi Road), and arrested Ding Rongsheng (39 years old, from Zhenjiang), Ju Bailin (32 years old, from Jiangbei), Zhang Ruzeng (32 years old, from Jiangbei), and Tan Zhixing (24 years old, from Jiangbei). Ding, Ju, and Zhang were all suffering from gunshot wounds. The Lao Zha Police Station also arrested Wu Yiwei (29 years old, from Guangdong, residing at 12 Cihe Lane, Jiujiang Road). It is understood that when Shen Yufeng was arrested, he was still carrying weapons. The above-mentioned detainees were transferred to Criminal Division 1 of Special Court No. 1 by the police station at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, briefly stated the facts. He said that after the arrest of the suspects, the police station immediately launched an investigation. Although a part of it has been clarified, it cannot be made public at present, and the case is complicated and the investigation will take time. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed for two weeks for further investigation. As for the suspect Shen Yufeng, his past conduct was particularly bad. He had been judged by the law about ten times for crimes. Wu Yiwei had also been subject to criminal sanctions. Judge Xiao Xieben approved the request and ordered the suspects to be temporarily detained and the hearing postponed to Tuesday. The bodies of Huang Xiwu and Qian Zaisheng, who were killed by stray bullets, were also inspected by Prosecutor Song of Special Court No. 1 yesterday morning, confirming that they were killed by bullets, and ordered their bodies to be collected.

Western Newspapers Detail the Events

The North China Daily News reported that as a result of the violence committed by terrorists on Avenue Edward VII on Saturday night, detectives from the Central and Lao Zha Police Stations have recovered eleven potato-shaped hand grenades, six new-style automatic Mauser pistols, and 200 empty shell casings. They interrogated the suspects, witnesses, and patrols on the scene day and night yesterday in an effort to investigate the case. According to what is known for certain, this violence was meticulously organized but ultimately failed. It now seems that in addition to the 20 people who arrived at Jiangxi Road in four Yunfei automobiles at around 8:15 p.m. on Saturday, there were also a large number of accomplices and so-called "lookouts" stationed at key points to deal with every patrol officer stationed nearby. The terrorists entered 130 Changgeng Lane, Avenue Edward VII in three groups. The English "Evening News," the American "Sino-American Daily," and the printing house of the English-language Continental Daily are all located in this lane, adjacent to the Thames Building. The terrorists intended to disrupt the above-mentioned newspaper offices, kill people, and destroy machines as much as possible, to prevent the newspapers from being published. More than ten terrorists broke into the Evening News on the second floor of the Thames Building, firing many shots and killing one typesetting worker. Another dozen or so terrorists broke into the "Sino-American Daily" on the third floor, but were blocked from entering because the door was locked. Another team of terrorists broke into the Tonghui Trust Company opposite the Thames Building. An elderly tea boy from the company tried to close the door in front of the armed thugs and was shot and killed. At the same time, the terrorists became frightened and retreated in embarrassment into Changgeng Lane, turning toward Avenue Edward VII, firing into the sky and brandishing hand grenades as they fled. At that time, one hand grenade was thrown out, and another exploded in front of the Thames Building. Many terrorists fled into the French Concession, and gun parts and bullets have been found in various streets of the French Concession.

Opening Fire on People

Most of the terrorists fled into Jiangxi Road and threw out the third hand grenade. At least one group of terrorists got into their cars on that road and drove back to their hideout. However, they encountered a patrol search team on Hankou Road. Two of the four cars occupied by the terrorists were found abandoned in the French Concession. The third car was hit by five bullets by the patrol on Hankou Road and could not drive. The events of Saturday indicate that these terrorists were undoubtedly the same terrorists who committed a similar act of violence at the Guide News editorial office at 130 Ningbo Road on June 16. Furthermore, it seems certain that the hand grenades used by the terrorists on Saturday were the same as the two hand grenades found on Nanjing Road on the morning of July 16. The two grenades may have been discarded at the last moment by the terrorists, who decided to throw them away because they were too dangerous. At the same time, a large number of suspects have been interrogated thoroughly.

Confidential Interrogation

The police officers in charge of handling the case refused to disclose any information about the case yesterday. However, it is heard that only four suspects are still being held. Most of them have committed crimes and are from Jiangbei. However, the events of Saturday were truly shocking and were a rare display of courage in this city. Wilson, who died at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday night from a bullet wound in the heart, was attending to customers in a tavern across the street from the shooting when he heard the sound and ran to the door, intending to cross the street to help the patrol officers. His friend tried to stop him, advising him not to risk being shot. However, Mr. Hui shook off his friend's grip and ran toward Changgeng Lane. When Mr. Hui was about to arrive, fifteen shots were fired at him, and Mr. Wilson was seriously injured. He tried to use his last strength to run across the street back to the tavern, but collapsed in the middle of the road.

Collapsed

A French soldier crawled to the side of the injured Mr. Wilson, risking great danger to drag him to the French Concession and call an ambulance to rush him to the hospital. A Chinese detective, who had already been shot and was lying in a pool of blood, apparently shot by the patrol officers, still held a gun in one hand and raised his detective badge to fire at the fleeing terrorists until they had escaped. The detective was also rushed to the hospital. Western Head Constable Weiduson was nearby and also risked his life to run into Changgeng Lane and capture one of the suspects currently being held. When the suspect was captured, he was holding a Mauser pistol and a hand grenade in each hand. In the subsequent exchange of fire on Hankou Road, Trainee Western Head Constable Cibufuloski, who led the search team, was quite brave. Although within range of the terrorists' guns, he only fired when he was sure that he would not harm pedestrians. He also captured two suspects. A Chinese patrol officer had his handgun stolen by the terrorists when they exited the lane. Although outnumbered, he still chased after them, and was shot in the right knee and fell to the ground. He should also be given special attention. While the detectives were busy working in the office, the reserve patrol officers of the police department searched various hotels and shooting locations from 8:30 p.m. on Saturday night to 8:00 a.m. yesterday, continuing to search for weapons. The injuries of the injured people have not changed. Three of them are seriously injured, and the others, although needing treatment, are only slightly injured. Hope Skajaya, a 19-year-old dancer at the Palais Cafe, was shot in the knee when she got off a public bus at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Avenue Edward VII. It is heard that her injury has slightly improved yesterday and she has been transferred to the Russian Church Hospital on Shanzhong Road. At the same time, senior police officers held a meeting yesterday morning to study the severe precautionary measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents. The four suspects are scheduled to be tried at Special Court No. 1 this morning. The police department will request that they be remanded in custody. Coroner Luten and Executor Compel of the U.S. Court for China inspected Wilson's body yesterday morning and approved its transfer to the International Funeral Home. The trial is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. this morning. The details of how the terrorists obtained the four cars were also found out yesterday. It seems that one of the terrorists rented four cars from the Yunfei Car Rental Company on Yidingpan Road at around 8:00 p.m., and after getting into the first car, followed the other three cars to Zhuanbang Lane. The North China Daily News reported on July 7 that this lane housed the headquarters of 150 heavily armed terrorists, and on July 2, the search team of the police department was shot at in this lane. After the four cars arrived at the lane, about 20 people got into the cars and ordered the drivers to drive to Jiangxi Road, where the shooting began. Although not confirmed, it seems certain that the terrorist group was instigated by an organization supporting a certain party.

Appears Certain

According to the general opinion yesterday, the police department will strongly negotiate with the "Great Way" authorities regarding special criminals entering the public concession at will from Yidingpan Road and other boundary roads. The trial of the two Chinese men who were shot and killed is scheduled to begin this morning. It is heard that the injuries of the injured suspects are still satisfactory, enough for the detectives in charge of the case to interrogate them. The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the French Concession Police Department has taken special precautions to prevent a recurrence of the terrorist attack on Avenue Edward VII on Saturday night, sending out two mobile armored vehicles to guard outside the Great American Evening Post building, and erecting barbed wire on Haig Road near Yidingpan Road, where the terrorists have their headquarters. The Public Concession Police Department is also on alert and has stepped up its patrol measures.

### Yesterday's Chaotic Rice Market: Highest Grade White Rice Reaches Price Ceiling; Rice Merchants Claim Unobtainable at Limit

In recent days, the price of rice in this city has continued to rise, leading to chaotic trading in the rice market. The highest grade of white rice has already reached the price ceiling of 20 yuan per picul (stone). The Rice Merchants' Guild reported that their members are saying that there is no high-quality rice available in the market. Purchasing at the limited price only yields the lowest grade rice, which the public misunderstands, causing difficulties for businesses. They requested a proper plan to maintain the situation. The Guild held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue in detail. They resolved to advise all member rice merchants to be patient for the time being. When purchasing goods in the market, they must strictly adhere to the price ceiling and not exceed it. Any under-the-table transactions exceeding the price will be accounted for at the limited price. Any such transactions should be reported to the Guild so that it can be reported to the authorities for investigation. At the same time, the Guild will formulate appropriate measures to cope with the situation. They will also send a letter to the Public Works Department (å·¥é¨å±) reporting the chaotic market conditions and the impossibility of purchasing high-quality goods at the fixed price, requesting them to strictly correct the situation in order to maintain the price ceiling.

Price Ceiling Revision Immediately Causes Rice Price to Rise

The authorities in the International Settlement and rice industry groups agreed on a good strategy to set a price ceiling of 21 yuan, with proportionate differentials for medium-grade and lower-grade rice. Since its implementation, the price of rice has fallen daily. *Changbang tejing* (å¸¸å¸®ç¹ç²³, a type of rice) even fell below the 20 yuan mark. Therefore, the authorities in the International Settlement, seeing that rice prices were trending towards equilibrium, revised the price ceiling to 20 yuan. However, as soon as it was implemented, the trend changed from sluggish to expensive. Furthermore, the foreign exchange situation has tightened recently, making it likely that it will not be possible to continue ordering Saigon rice. As a result, rice merchants are taking the opportunity to cause trouble, and outsiders are hoarding and manipulating the market, leading to a sharp rise in market prices.

Yesterday's Market Highly Abnormal

Today, the 24th, the market situation appears highly abnormal. All kinds of damaged and old rice are approaching the 20 yuan mark. The situation is very chaotic. People in the rice industry are repeatedly asking the supervisors in the market to lift the price ceiling. However, they are all resolutely refused. However, given this situation where one side is seeking high prices and the other side is seeking low prices, the rice market is bound to come to a standstill. As a result, the more than 400 rice merchants involved in direct transactions will be greatly affected, indirectly affecting the food supply for citizens throughout the city.

Stock Owners Should Be Forced

Therefore, it is hoped that rice merchants will cooperate with each other and resist this abnormal rice market by refusing to purchase. On the other hand, it is hoped that the authorities will impose the strictest mandatory measures on the stocks and owners of all rice warehouses, ensuring that they sell at the limited price. After implementation, it may be possible to temporarily curb the arrogance of hoarders.

### British Destroyer HMS Duncan Damaged and Sailing South

The British China Fleet destroyer HMS "Duncan" previously carried British Far East Commander-in-Chief Admiral Noble to Weihaiwei and cruised in the waters of North China. Unexpectedly, it recently collided with a target ship during exercises. HMS "Duncan" sustained minor damage and has now sailed south to Hong Kong to be repaired in the naval dockyard. Once repaired, it will sail north again.

### Anti-British Incident in West Shanghai: Appropriate Response by Italian Troops Averts Major Unfortunate Incident; Western Police Officer Released Unharmed

Police and Italian Officers Discussing the Matter

The *North-China Daily News* reports that last night (the 23rd) at nearly 8 p.m., Police Officer Watterson, responsible for the Bubbling Well Road police station, was dragged into the "Great Way" (å¤§é) Police Station and mistreated after tearing down an anti-British poster near the Italian Marine Corps headquarters on Robison Road. At the time, Watterson was not in uniform. Several minutes later, the Italian Marine Corps arrived and surrounded the "Great Way" Police Station, ordering the "Great Way" police stationed on the public concession roads along Robison Road to leave. The "Great Way" police complied, and Watterson was released.

Bayonets Fixed

A unit of Italian Marine Corps faced the police station and stood guard for over an hour. Due to their swift and forceful action, a major unfortunate incident was avoided. The commander of the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai told reporters last night that he received news of the incident and sent his troops to the scene. He did not think much of it and considered it over. He ordered the "Great Way" police to leave the public concession roads because they had no right to be stationed there armed. While Watterson was being mistreated in the police station, the station telephoned another "Great Way" police station requesting reinforcements. As a result, a truckload of reinforcing "Great Way" police

travelled along Kiaochow Road

but were soon stopped by an Italian patrol. The Italian officer told the "Great Way" police that if they wanted to go to the Robison Road police station, they could go, but they were not allowed to carry weapons on the public concession roads. The "Great Way" police then left the truck and left their weapons, running to the Robison Road police station. The posters that were being torn down were

removed by Italian soldiers.

It was later confirmed that the anti-British posters contained a photograph and advertised an anti-British parade. These posters had already been torn down from billboards twice yesterday by Public Concession police officers without incident. When the posters were repeatedly put back up, Watterson decided to

go to the scene himself.

As soon as he tore down the posters, five "Great Way" police officers ordered Watterson into the police station. Watterson, knowing that resistance was futile, complied. The extent of Watterson's mistreatment was

not confirmed last night.

However, reporters saw Watterson last night looking as normal as usual and showing no signs of injury. When Watterson was

dragged into the police station,

his chauffeur telephoned the Bubbling Well Road police station, and a squad of police officers arrived. Shortly thereafter, Italian soldiers also arrived, and Watterson was immediately released. Italian officers and police officials will discuss the matter this morning (the 24th).

### Another Clash in Hongkew Anti-British Demonstrations

In the area under the jurisdiction of the Dixwell Road police station in Hongkew, adjacent to the extraterritorial area, a dozen or so Chinese again engaged in private, localized anti-British propaganda and posted slogans on the border at around 8 p.m. yesterday evening. At the time, the incident was witnessed by Mr. Wells, a British employee of the Public Works Department (å·¥é¨å±). He immediately reported it to the Dixwell Road police station, and a British police chief, Shih Tung (é£å), went to stop them. However, the dozen or so Chinese paid no attention to him, resulting in another dispute. The "Great Way" (å¤§é) fake "police station police" also happened to see the conflict between the two sides on the border area and immediately took all the people to the fake "police station." The police station received the news and reported it to the authorities. As of midnight, negotiations were still underway.

### Mail Ship Canada Arriving This Afternoon

The Changxing Company mail ship *Canada*, departing from Canada, passed Kobe the day before yesterday (the 23rd) and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7 p.m. this afternoon, docking at the Hongkew Gonghexiang Wharf. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared launch and disembark at the New Customs Wharf at 8:30 p.m. that evening. The large ship will set sail at 4 p.m. tomorrow (the 26th) for Hong Kong and Luzon. The passenger launch will depart at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow.

### Secret Brothel Cracked on Route Massenet: Prostitutes are all Concubines of Wealthy Men; Patrons all from the Automobile Class

Recently, the French police suddenly received a tip-off that there was a secret prostitution establishment (commonly known as a high-end "salty meat shop") in a certain building on Route Massenet. The prostitutes there were all concubines of wealthy men, and the patrons were all from the automobile class. Ordinary people could never try it. It was said that the price per visit was at least 50 to 100 yuan, and even with that it was difficult to get a glimpse without being introduced by a regular customer. After receiving the report, the police chief sent detectives for secret investigation for over a month before confirming the truth. As a result, at around 9 p.m. the night before last, a large number of detectives and police were mobilized to surround the building from all sides and then rushed in together. Sure enough, as many as 12 concubines of wealthy merchants were arrested, and the madam, Zhang Li, was also arrested and taken to the police station. At the time, they were all fined in accordance with regulations and released.

### Gold Ingots Stolen: Four Thieves Arrested

Cai Degao, a 72-year-old Jiangxi native residing at No. 596 Route PÃ¨res Froc, French Concession, carried five gold ingots and four gold forks with a total value of 2,200 yuan with him at 9 a.m. on the 22nd. At the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan, he boarded French Business Route 7 tram, intending to deposit them in a friend's safe deposit box in Shantong Road. Unexpectedly, when the tram passed the Hualong Road stop, Cai realized that the gold ingots beside him had been stolen by pickpockets. He immediately got off the tram and reported it to the French police, requesting their arrest. Inspector Wang Rusong, detectives Gao Meihui and Ma Yizhi, and Detective Xu Jintang investigated and learned that the theft was committed by four Jiangbei natives, Lu Yanqun, You Shaofeng, Chen Jinsheng, and Xu Ruyou. After apprehending the thieves, they went to Room 315 of the Liang'an Apartments on Songshan Road to divide the loot. They then arrested the four suspects, Lu, You, Chen, and Xu, and recovered the original loot, with one gold ingot missing. Yesterday, they were handed over to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court, requesting detention for investigation and a rescheduled hearing. After Judge Qiu Huanhuan questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and a rescheduled hearing.

### Trafficking in Girls: Three Offenders Sentenced to Six Years Each

Li Huanran from Anhui, Lin A'er (local), and Madam Wang Ma, a woman, specialized in luring and abducting young girls and selling them to other cities for profit, dividing the proceeds. From January 24 to April 26 of this year, they (1) abducted Sun Jiang's 7-year-old daughter, Xiuli, residing at No. 437 Fujian Road; (2) abducted Gu Awen's 8-year-old daughter, Yueying, on Tianjin Road; (3) abducted Teng Changlin's 6-year-old daughter, Fuying, near Ningbo Road on Fujian Road; and (4) abducted Wu A'kun's 6-year-old daughter, A'mao, near the intersection of Tianjin Road and Fujian Road. They sold them to institutions established by their accomplices in Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places, and then resold them to brothels where they would be made prostitutes when they reached a slightly older age. The case was uncovered, and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishi Police Station arrested them and handed them over to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the judgment in the 3rd Criminal Court yesterday morning, sentencing Li Huanran, Lin A'er, and Madam Wang Ma to six years of imprisonment each as a warning. The evidence was confiscated.

### Doctor Beaten After Administering Vaccination

At approximately 10 a.m. yesterday morning, Dr. Xu, sent by the French Municipal Council's Sanitation Department, was administering vaccinations in front of Xiechang Wood Shop at No. 1159 Route Haig, Zikawei. A certain young woman surnamed XX, residing at No. 25 Datongfang on Rue Mgr. Favier, was passing by the area when the doctor grabbed the woman's arm and forced her to be vaccinated. As a result, the two sides had a verbal argument and wrestled with each other. A large crowd of onlookers gathered and beat the doctor severely. Later, the police arrived and took both sides to the police station for questioning. However, the perpetrators had already scattered and fled.

### Lavish Banquet: Unexpected Calamity; Magnesium Flash Photography Burns Waiter's Eyes

At approximately 6:30 p.m. yesterday evening, on the second floor of the Broadway Building at the intersection of Broadway and North Soochow Road in Hongkew, the Japanese Naval Commander hosted a banquet. Over two hundred people attended, including Western guests such as German and Italian commanders and people from the puppet organization, such as Fu Xiao'an and Zhou Wenduan. At the time, news reporters were taking magnesium flash photographs. Unexpectedly, the electric light flashed and a waiter, Su Yongbiao (17 years old from Ningbo), who was nearby, had his right eye injured by the magnesium flash. His eyeball protruded, and he fell to the ground unconscious. People called an ambulance and rushed him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Su's right eye was severely injured and is feared that he may lose sight.

### Selling Drugs Punishable by Law

A local ruffian, Yuan Deming (17 years old), has recently been selling heroin on behalf of a Korean surnamed XX, who has fled, at No. 615 Tiantong Road, earning a daily wage of 50 cents. At approximately 6 a.m. on the 23rd, he was arrested by Chinese police No. 926, along with 70 small packages of heroin, and taken to the Huishi Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the First Special District Court, and the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested strict punishment. Judge Jiang sentenced Yuan to six years of imprisonment and confiscated the evidence.

### Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case: Escaped Criminals Continue to Be Apprehended; Higher Third Branch Court Will Re-try the Case Soon

After Tang Jiapeng, former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated to death at midnight on June 18, 1933, the French police arrested the criminals Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi one after another. The case was handed over to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution. After three trials, the final judgment sentenced Zhao to life imprisonment and Zhang to 20 years of imprisonment. During the execution of the sentence, Zhao Guangfu reported to the French police that Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Theater, had instigated the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, and that he had

handed over a pistol at the Jiangnan Hotel on the original site of the Asia Hotel. Zhang Xiaosizi was listed as a witness. The French police dispatched detectives to arrest Gu Zhuxuan on September 10, 1935, and handed him over to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution in accordance with the law. The preliminary hearing was presided over by former Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, who sentenced Gu Zhuxuan to 15 years of imprisonment for murder. Gu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court. The Criminal Court President, Zhu Huanbiao, ruled that Gu Zhuxuan was innocent. Because the French Police Department refused to accept it, it petitioned the Higher Third Branch Court Prosecutor to appeal to the Supreme Court. Subsequently, within the appeal period, Gu applied to the Higher Third Branch Court to stop his detention and

was allowed bail. It was ordered that Gu pay a 20,000 yuan surety for being on call. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and recognized that Gu was indeed guilty. It ruled to revoke the original judgment and return the case to the Higher Third Branch Court for further investigation and trial. The Higher Third Branch Court received the Supreme Court's judgment and case file and held a hearing in October 1937, summoning Gu to court for questioning. At that time, because

the key witnesses in the case, the informant Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi, had been transferred to the Second Prison in Beixinjing under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. They had been taken to military agencies in the rear area after the outbreak of the war and could not be transferred to the case for questioning. The Higher Third Branch Court considered that the case could not proceed and reported it to the Ministry for verification, causing the case to be delayed for more than a year and unable to be concluded. Zhao Guangfu escaped to Shanghai after the war moved inland, and again joined the ranks of bandits. Recently, Zhao was arrested again in the Public Concession for

robbery and was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the First Special District Court. The Higher Third Branch Court learned of this and prepared a document yesterday morning to send several French police officers to the First Special District Court to transfer Zhao Guangfu to the case. The case of Gu Zhuxuan being sued for instigating murder will be tried soon. Wang Xinggao, who was also involved in the case, was arrested before Gu and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the first trial. He appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court and was acquitted at the same time as Gu Zhuxuan. During the appeal period, he also paid 20,000 yuan

surety and was released on bail. The French Police Department petitioned the Higher Third Branch Court Prosecutor to appeal to the Supreme Court, and the case was returned for retrial at the same time as Gu's case. Because Wang escaped on bail and could not be summoned to court, the court notified his guarantor that they could not surrender the person and ordered them to pay part of the bond. The guarantor was unable to pay, and the store was sealed and auctioned off. At the same time, an order was issued to arrest Wang Xinggao and bring him to justice for questioning.

### Music Teacher Punished for Raping Female Student

Zheng Miaoying, daughter of Zheng Gu, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 11 Baoxing Lane, Rue du Consulat, is 16 years old and has a beautiful appearance. In July of last year, she invited Wang Peizhi (37 years old, Shandong native), residing at No. 4 Yiruli, Tiantong Road, to come to her house every day to teach Miaoying how to study Peking opera. Because Miaoying was naturally intelligent, she was able to perform on stage in about half a year. On the evening of December 2nd of the same year, Wang took Miaoying to the Tianchan Theater to practice her art. After the performance, Wang accompanied her home. On the way, he told the girl that her voice was not yet mellow and needed to be broken before she could sing high. The girl was then lured into his valley and was repeatedly raped, resulting in a hidden pregnancy. Her mother noticed that her abdomen was gradually growing larger, and she learned the truth after questioning her. She then reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang and transferred him to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution. It is now known that Judge Zhang has completed the trial of the case and announced the verdict yesterday: Wang Peizhi is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of 16.

### Female Worker Commits Suicide out of Resentment

Zhang Yang, a 38-year-old widow from Henan, was living alone in the home of the Little Sisters (å°å§å¦¹) at No. 171 Xuzhen Road, Zikawei. Three months ago, she was introduced to work as a female worker at the Zhenggong Weaving Factory in Beihujiazhai, Hongqiao. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of last month, while working in the factory, her left hand was accidentally crushed by the motor and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. She was discharged from the hospital on the 4th of this month, but had not fully recovered, but was already disabled. Recently, she was sad about her pitiful life experience and bleak future, so she had the idea of ââgiving up on life. She hanged herself with a belt next to the stairs the night before last. She was found by a cohabitant, but had already died of suffocation.

### Re-mentioning "Humor"

â Xiao Ren

Speaking of it, it already sounds like old news. A few years ago, we made a big commotion advocating for "humor," seemingly to the point where even eating and sleeping had to be done with a touch of "humor." However, the result, apart from translating a few quotes from George Bernard Shaw and re-copying a few sections from "Laughing Grove Records," left nothing behind.

At the time, some people opposed it, saying that "humor" couldn't be everywhere. They cited the story of Zilu tidying his hat strings before his death, believing that such "humor" was not something anyone could emulate. But this was still said by people who didn't understand "humor."

"Humor" is not a fly, which is absolutely correct. But the story of Zilu is really not an example of "humor." Our past "scholars" always had to declare their status at the time of death, like Zengzi's "changing mats," and the later ceremonies where many "loyal ministers" put on their court robes before sacrificing themselves, were all this kind of behavior. To regard such stories as "humor" would make "humor" seem like our domestic product, and eventually it would still become a fly. In reality, both those who advocate "humor" and those who oppose its advocacy are outsiders to "humor."

In any case, "humor" is not a product of this place. We have always emphasized "etiquette," unwilling to be proper but having to feign propriety, leaving no place to accommodate "humor." When we no longer talk about "etiquette," then a "Damn it!" can dismiss everything. To be more "refined," there is only the exposure of private scandals and petty jokes about taking advantage, which, though sometimes witty, are most suitable the more sickening they are. This is precisely the consequence that "etiquette" has bestowed upon us: the more we are bound by "etiquette" for a long time, the more we will move towards the "un-etiquette" side. This explains why we have never had "humor."

Because we don't have it, that's why we advocate it. The saying is correct, but the reality doesn't work. "Humor" arises in places with higher culture and more leisure. We might as well not talk about culture, but just with leisure, we first struggle to have this condition. Yet "humor" cannot be forced to look like it. And even if it looks like it, there are very few people who appreciate it. Most people are preoccupied with their hungry stomachs, where would they have the time to savor "humor"? It is inevitable that "humor" writers ultimately cannot be born among us, and that "humor" advocates ultimately have to cling to George Bernard Shaw and "Laughing Grove Records."

But does this mean that we have absolutely no shadow of "humor" before our eyes? Not quite. "Humor" still exists, but it is not advocated, nor is it deliberately acted out. Rather, it is when the person involved does things with a straight face, not thinking about "humor" at all, but precisely reveals a "humorous" style. But you need to know how to see itâthat is, you need to know the way of seeing.

This kind of "humor" is exactly the opposite of deliberately made "humor." The more tense the times, the more of it there will be. The reason is that some upper-class people will be caught off guard by the rapid changes of the times, so there will be constant wonderful things happening. For example, when a certain professor advocated something unreasonable at a meeting, and was opposed by the entire room to the point of helplessness, he pointed to certain two characters on the plaque, saying that it was because he saw that plaque. For example, a writer always boasts of not caring about politics and not being affiliated with any party, but suddenly writes a large article in a certain publication, and when someone questions him, he says: "I have no politics or parties in my heart!"âIf you pay attention to wonderful things like this, you can collect some. Who dares to say that these are not the highest standard of "humor"?

There are also larger things, such as Suzhou not allowing storytellers to tell "Conquest of the East," which not only exceeds the level of general "humor," but is really an unprecedented marvel. No matter how talented a "humor" master is, they have no ability to do it.

The central publication "The Analects," which once advocated "humor," can no longer be seen. However, the "Selected Works of Humor" published by "The Analects" Society still lie on old book stalls and are sold as waste paper. Seeing the book's exquisite binding and pristine white paper, one cannot help but feel pity. I don't know if those celebrities who once advocated "humor" still aspire to it. If they haven't lost heart, I think it's better to change things up, not talk about "literature," but discuss "events," and it would be more practical to compile two volumes of "Selected Humorous Events" of the past. This is not "anti-Japanese eight-legged essay," and it doesn't seem to greatly harm "spirituality." What do "humorists" think?

### One Hundred Patriotic Ci Poems to the Tune of Man Jiang Hong

â Zou Xiao

Recently, I saw Li Zongye's "One Hundred Patriotic Ci Poems to the Tune of Man Jiang Hong," published by Commercial Press, one of the student's Chinese Studies Series, starting from Yue Fei, going through Zhang Xiaoxiang, Chen Liang, Liu Kezhuang, Xin Qiji, Liu Guo of the Southern Song Dynasty, Wen Tianxiang of the late Song Dynasty, Zhang Huangyan, Wu Yi, Qian Sule of the late Ming Dynasty, Qiu Jin, Liang Qichao of the late Qing Dynasty, and ending with modern people Hu Hanmin and Liu Yazi. It is both meaningful and very unique.

Because I liked this book, I had a silly urge and spent several days painstakingly flipping through one hundred kinds of "Famous Qing Ci," and found some that Li Zongye had not included:

(1) Dong Wukai of Wujin has a Cangwu Ci, a poem "Passing by Jinsha Temple and Respectfully Rhyming with the Original Poem Written on the Wall by Yue Ewang," which says: "Donning armor and throwing down spears, passing by the Xiao Temple, the morning bell has just stopped. Imagining that day, anger causing the hair to stand on end, with a heart full of loyalty and bravery. The sword's qi chills the Yangxian grass at night, the brush sweeps away the Jinsha moon. Brushing the broken stele, remaining regret faces West Lake, sharing the sorrow. â The shame of Huaibei, is difficult to wash away, the discussion of Huaixi, is difficult to extinguish. Sighing that Huanglong has not been drunk, the Ou still incomplete. The pool water sings in autumn with the words of famous scholars, icy tears sprinkle the blood of heroes. Look at the dense pine and cypress facing south branches, towards the twin towers." In addition, there is also a poem "Worshiping the Tomb of Yue Ewang Respectfully Rhyming with the Original Poem" and a "Worshiping the Tomb of Lord Zhongsu," which are not listed. (2) Zhao Huaiyu of Wujin's Qiulai Yin, the first poem is "Rhyming with the Tomb of Yue Ewang," which says: "Twelve golden tablets, the winds and waves started, the ambitious plan ended. Thousands of years later, I come to mourn, still with intense feelings. The northern cavalry does not neigh on the spring Long grass, the cuckoo still sings on the southern branches. Drinking with you lords in Huanglong, is my lifelong goal, the Northern Expedition, difficult to clear. Returning to the North Temple, the injustice is difficult to extinguish. Sighing that after the Great Wall is broken, the water is depleted and the mountains are incomplete. A three-foot Ma Jin Chi Mei statue, a handful of yellow earth, the blood of heroes. Seeing the bones of the Song family, remembering the evergreen, an empty mausoleum pass."

(3) Feng Dengfu of Jiaxing's Zhongyunxian Pavilion Ci has a poem "Inscribing the Statue of Qin Liangyu, the Heavenly Woman of Shizhu," which says: "Hundreds of battles for the rivers and mountains, how many are there with moth eyebrows and swallow foreheads? Supporting half the wall, the Madam's city is there, the wind and clouds formation is dark. White pole gold spears, the heavenly decree land, bright makeup iron cavalry, reporting to the heavenly day. Seeing the portrait painted first with a beautiful woman's picture, the bow shoes are narrow. â The Green Calf is hated, the Yunyang is in distress. The emerald sleeves are broken, the Zongzhou strategy. Thinking of the grand hair of Rong, the colors of the high platform. The king's tent talks about the Thai moon at night, the cotton robe is stained with the blood of the fierce river. Sighing for the nationalæ®, the children are all heroes, crying through the orchid." (Honglan, Liangyu's daughter-in-law)

(4) Wang Peng of Lingui's Bantang Dinggao has a "Respectfully Writing the Ink After Yue Zhongwu Wang Gave General Wu's Precious Sword Line," which says: "Thunder and rain empty hall, the morning rushes to unroll, dragon and snake rise. Looking up to worship, gathering as if seeing, the sword light is full. The wish is so high, the mountains want to regret, the friendship is solemn, the cups complement each other. Thinking of the night shield ink dripping, singing and crying. â Darkly sounding qi, sad song. Thousands of times, cyclically read. Sighing that the king's sword can be borrowed, where can the shame be washed away! Sadly looking at the millennia, people cannot be seen, seeking a trail, the east is still covered. Asking who is it, wiping away tears and harmonizing sad songs? Yan Terrace built." There is also a poem "Visiting the Shrine of Yue Ewang in Zhuxian Town Respectfully Writing," which is not listed.

In Li's selection, the late Song Wen Xin Qiji and Liu Guo, etc., seem to be placed in reverse order. Also, in Dong Rong's note, it is said that Jiang Shiquan's "Guilin Frost" is a patriotic drama, but its meaning is not entirely the same as that of the same person's "Winter Green Tree," because what Guilin Frost writes is that the Han army inlaid red banner horse Xiong Zhen is loyal to Qing Kong, which is relatively secondary.

### Dream of Banners and Flags

â Ding Di

A group of people, emaciated by suffering, with radiant smiles on their faces, smiles hiding tears, forming a wall, with hearts of steel, a surging torrent. Unknowing children, reaching out, arbitrarily yet familiarly fiddling with the golden light of the cherry tassels on swords and spears, blinking in the warm, charming sun. Red tiger whiskers, floating on swords and spears, axes and halberds, exuding wisps of smiles. In the laughter, honey offerings are dedicated to millions of sincere hearts. Everyone completes a solemn and unwavering prayer. Years of excessive vigilance have reduced enjoyment and sleep. Blessings to the exiles at the ends of the earth, blessings to the iron-like warriors in these difficult times, their hearts have become emaciated. Years of cold in hell, they didn't believe there would be today, they would see the banners and flags of their dreams.

Is this a dream?

Excessive joy or sorrow often makes people wonder if this is not reality but a dream. Indeed, we love this dream too much, we love it, pursue it, grasp it, and don't let it escape from our hands. One day, the dream came. Clouds of joyous doubt paint the banners and flags with a layer of dusk, the color of dreams, hazy and subtle. We stubbornly paint joy with clouds of doubt. Carrying a pile of thick days and months, waiting, anxiety and hard thinking, outlining many bleak silhouettes of the morning moon, meeting again in old dreams, and encountering each other again at dawn, you should say this is a dream, is it realistic?

Thanks to my travel experiences, I have had several opportunities to enjoy the sweetness between this true dream. You have no reason to say this is a dream. But you are too excited. Joy is often accompanied by doubt. Although I don't like dreams, when I rushed to a desolate city wall, I saw a flag hanging on the flagpole, fluttering in the strong wind, swaying proudly, I did wonder if it was a dream. On a dilapidated small hill, a group of soldiers were cooking, and cooking smoke was rising. You should say this is not a dream? How wonderful the banners and flags, how beautiful the bugle calls. As for dreams, I know that is not it. The happiness is realistic, but alas, I have carried a pile of dreams of banners and flags, wading through too many long years. Coming from old dreams, and encountering each other again in reality. I think banners and flags are too lovely. I would like to have a wonderful enjoyment. Let the hands in the dream touch the yak tails in surprise, blessing the reunion, blessing the exiles, and also blessing the returning fighters. I should say with surprise and admiration: "It is our banners and flags after we parted!"

Oh, we should bless the reunited group of people, for a flag pole, many people have buried their bright red hearts, in the soil, cultivating flowers of freedom. Stepping over flesh and blood and corpses, stubbornly and fiercely planting their foremost banners and flags. There are many people who, when isolated and helpless, let their hurried breathing accompany them, keeping watch over the banners and flags. Everyone has a dream of banners and flags. Young enthusiasts trek through mountains and rivers, to find their love, letting the wind and sand age their years. Those who are isolated on "insulation islands," to find their love, have repeatedly suffered misfortune and insult, entangled in kudzu vines. Those who are frozen in hell deliver their bitterness, those who travel through difficult journeys also tell of their hardships and emaciation. Banners and flags are covered with tears, coming from dreams, carrying a pile of thick days and months, full of waiting, anxiety and hard thinking, and I have encountered each other again in reality.

I remember very clearly coming from the dream, my face still bearing the breathlessness of pursuit and the tension of competition. We have seen the banners and flags after our parting again. You should say how beautiful this is. There are no tears, no sorrow, only radiance and laughter. Although he is somewhat emaciated, he is also more mature, and one disaster has made him more vigorous.

In schools, in city streets, in squares, on the river surface, in the windy and grassy borderlands, in the southern country where red beans grow, on the boundless seaside, at the source of high mountains and great rivers, covering the vast fields like a yurt, we can see familiar banners and flags everywhere.

Thank you for this happy reunion. I bless a group of people, blessing those who pursue and seize those banners and flags.

"These are our banners and flags after we parted!"

### Observation

â Su Li Woodcut

### Red Devil Vasika

â Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

They looked at him calmly, very seriously, but it was difficult to fathom what they really thought of Vasika from their eyes. Ajiusnia, helping the procuress, helped him put on his coat; all the girls were in the kitchen, wearing melancholic, astringent faces, silent.

"Goodbye!" Vasika immediately lowered his head, not looking at the girls' faces, saying, "Good...bye!"

Several of them silently nodded and said goodbye to him, but he didn't see this. But Lida said softly:

"Goodbye, Vasily Milonovich, goodbye... goodbye..."

The doctor's assistant and the yard man held Vasika under his armpits, helped him up from the bench, and took him outside. But he turned his head again to say goodbye to the girls:

"Goodbye... I... reallyâwhat do..."

Another two or three people responded:

"Goodbye, Vasily..."

"No need to worry about anything!" He shook his head, his face showing an expression completely unlike his usual one.

"Goodbye! For the sake of Christ's face... his... that..."

"Taken away! He's a good man..." Ajiusnia fell on the bench, sobbing sadly.

Vasika shivered, raised his head, his eyes shining strangely. He listened very carefully to the sobbing, stopped, and said softly with trembling lips:

"Really, stupid woman! What a stupid woman!"

"Let's go! Let's go!" The doctor's assistant frowned, urging.

"Goodbye, Ajiusnia! Please come to the hospital..." Vasika said loudly.

But Ajiusnia continued to sob.

"Why did you leave me?"

The girls surrounded her, looking at her face and the tears flowing from her eyes.

Lida leaned over her, roughly comforting her:

"Ah? What are you sad about! He won't die! Yes, go to him, ... yes, you can go tomorrow..." (The End)

### How Strange is the So-Called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (3)

â Song Daren

Experience Cannot Be Relied Upon

Mr. Ding said: The achievements of Chinese medicine rely on experience, and Mr. Zhang also said that Chinese medicine had its experience long before the emergence of Yin-Yang theory, as if experience is very valuable; but experienceânot scientific experimentationâis just the discovery of human instincts. All civilized and uncivilized peoples, even general animals, possess this kind of experience, which is not a value specially advocated by Chinese medicine. Moreover, experience is something that cannot be relied upon. Mr. Ding gave the example of old fishermen at sea and archers, saying: "Almost every old fisherman at sea can warn in advance when there will be a strong wind, big wave, or rainstorm, and astronomers also issue the same warning, and the results obtained are the same," and also said: "We can easily see in books that there are archers who can hit the target every timeâdoes that mean that everyone who practices can hit the target every time? Also not possible, ... we understand very well that the accuracy of modern artillery shooting, ... does that mean that everyone who practices can shoot accurately, it is possible, why is it possible, because the accuracy of artillery is based on instruments, the instruments calculate the angle accurately, and the shooting will definitely be accurate," and so on. Then, now that astronomers have predictions for weather changes, reporting them a few days in advance, without the slightest error; the range of artillery can be measured using precise geometric trigonometry, naturally hitting the target every time. Why should we abandon the gifts bestowed by scientistsâscientific toolsâand desperately yearn for this kind of unreliable experience, stubbornly refusing to wake up? You must know that science is a principle that everyone can learn and master, but this kind of experience can only be obtained when one is "old," and it is not necessarily accurate. Let me give a few examples of "experience not matching the facts," I am afraid that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ding will have to admit it after reading it!

According to Aristotle's principles, the rate at which all objects fall depends on the weight, with heavier objects falling faster, and our experience tells us the same, which no one has ever denied; but Galileo's experiment proved it to be incorrect. One day, in front of the entire school and the citizens, he ran to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, carrying two iron balls, one weighing one pound and the other weighing one hundred pounds; he put the two balls in a box, turned the box over, causing the two balls to fall simultaneously, but saw the two balls falling side by side, finally landing on the ground at the same time with a clang, thus the ancient legend was proven to be completely wrong. In fact, the rate at which an object falls depends on its resistance to air resistance.

Also, ancient astronomers, after seeing the phenomenon of "the sun rising in the east and setting in the west," experienced a theory of "heaven moving and earth being still," which is absolutely true and has never been doubted for thousands of years, but it is completely reversing the facts, a preposterous nonsense, becoming a great joke in the history of Chinese astronomy.

Whether this kind of experience is correct or not is not very important anyway because it has nothing to do with the human body. Here I want to talk about the human body experience of Chinese medicine: for example, like wet eczema, almost every Chinese medicine doctor or ordinary patient knows that its cause is dampness, everyone says the same thing, without any difference, so there is no reason to be wrong. Their basis is that when the disease occurs, this eczema no longer itches. It was originally damp, but now it has become not damp, then it must be that dampness is hidden inside causing trouble. This is pure experience, which everyone believes in without doubtâalas! even now there are still people who believe in itâbut the fact is not so, generally speaking, stubborn skin diseases have been parasitic in the human body for a long time, and their itching and secretion have become equal to normal phenomena. If other diseases are contracted, and the cells are affected by other causes, the itching and secretion work stops, which really has nothing to do with whether it is damp or not; therefore, only based on the phenomena of the disease, using a cursory and superficial observation, to determine that it is damp causing trouble, this fallacy of reversed cause and effect is really not to be taken as a lesson.

There are various causes of abdominal pain, some originate from cancer and ulcers in various parts of the stomach and intestines, as well as gallstones, liver diseases, or various parasitic diseases, definitely not any liver qi, stomach qi, cold pain, heat pain, this kind of unfounded speculation, catching shadows, can arbitrarily determine right and wrong. In the past, I don't know how many healthy organs have been wronged under the fingers of the magically powerful Chinese medicine doctors; but the real lesion is casually let go, allowing it to spread and grow until it is beyond recovery. This artistic experience (?) is really absolutely unacceptable. If they could use their artistic experience to accurately point out the location of the patient's lesion and its pathological form, or could identify which kind of bacteria or protozoa is causing the trouble; then how could scientific new medicine not be sincerely convinced and willingly admit defeat, it is just a pity that Chinese medicine does not have such great art that shocks the heavens and makes the ghosts cry, I am afraid that even if they experience for thousands of years or tens of thousands of years, they will definitely not be able to experience it, what can be done about this?

### A Brief Discussion of Food Poisoning

â Zhang Shibin

Any edible substance that, upon consumption, causes poisoning is collectively known as food poisoning. Briefly distinguishing them, they contain the following three minor different meanings:

(1) The food itself has already deteriorated, and poisoning occurs after eating it.

(2) The food itself has no changes, but it contains substances that can cause poisoning.

(3) The food is normal and has no changes, and it is of good quality, but the eater has a peculiar constitution that causes poisoning from this food.

The first situation is the most common type of food poisoning. We can often see it in newspapers. Seafood is undoubtedly the most common poisoned food. Because the seafood we usually buy in the market is dead rather than alive, we must pay close attention to the length of time after death. Although some seafood can be distinguished by its discoloration and fishy odor, it is not difficult to identify, but it is very easy to be deceived by the vendors' skillful exaggeration or the buyers' desire for cheapness. In short, seafood that can be used as food for us will inevitably undergo some degree of deterioration after a considerable period of time after death. Even if it is stored in a cold storage room, it will only slow down the change. Eating this deteriorated food often causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, belching, and even vomiting, headache, dizziness, and facial flushing. However, this type of poisoning often occurs in a family or a group, but the onset varies in speed, and the symptoms vary in severity. It is rare for it to only occur in one person. This type of poisoning is easily known by people.

In the second case of poisoning, the food is often mixed with special substances, and intentional placement constitutes a violation of criminal law, which can be heard and seen in society from time to time. Conversely, unintentional poisoning is most often related to food containers or cooking utensils. For example, using copper pots can introduce mineral poisons into the food, or the container may contain poisons, and one may accidentally put food into it. In addition, rats or cockroaches may gnaw on food and spread poisonous bacteria on top of it, which also happens from time to time. It was once heard that in a certain factory, in the morning of summer, seven-tenths of the workers suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, as well as headaches, so the whole factory was in an uproar, and it was suspected that the food eaten last night contained poisonous substances, so the kitchen was carefully inspected. One side questioned the workers with milder poisoning, only to find out that several workers had secretly brought chickens into the factory to cook last night, and added burdock, and did not use chopsticks when stirring, but used several copper wires bent to replace them. After chemical examination, it was proved that it was caused by copper salt poisoning. In this type of poisoning, the eater is often unaware of it, and it comes from the deliberate or unintentional actions of one party.

For the third type of so-called peculiar constitution, there are many examples. For example, after eating certain foods, some people feel itchy all over, or after eating certain foods, their faces and ears turn red as if they were drunk, or they feel nauseous, dizzy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc., and some even faint suddenly. The strangest thing is that a certain athlete, who is tall and strong, cannot eat shrimp. Even if he eats a little, he feels severe headache and dizziness and faints suddenly. After a while, he vomits and has diarrhea. It takes about half a day to recover, but the degree of allergy will definitely increase afterward. Even adding shrimp to the soup and drinking it will cause the same poisoning. Most of this type of poisoning is known and can be prevented. For this poisoning, it is better to regard it as a special reaction of the liquid in one's own body to the protein of shrimp, rather than considering it mental.

For the above-mentioned causes of food poisoning, the first and second items must be treated by a doctor as soon as possible, otherwise it will endanger life. The third item only requires you to be careful at all times to avoid it.

Common Knowledge of Diseases

### Stomach Ailments (4)

â Zhuang Weizhong

Second is vomiting. One-third of patients with peptic ulcer have this symptom, not everyone. Vomiting usually occurs when in pain. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, the vomit will naturally not have changed much, but if it takes a little longer, the vomit will be acidic chyme. This type of vomit is most harmful to the teeth. Generally, if the ulcer is in the cardia of the stomach entrance, vomiting occurs immediately after eating. If it is in the pylorus of the stomach outlet, vomiting occurs two or three hours after eating.

Third is gastric bleeding, which is due to the erosion of blood vessels by the ulcer. The eroded blood vessels are large and small, so there is more or less bleeding. When there is a lot of bleeding, hematemesis and melena are seen. The author has seen many people die from blood loss due to heavy bleeding. If the amount of bleeding is very small, it is not visible on the surface. Only chemical methods can be used to check whether there are blood components in the stool, which is called occult bleeding. Hematemesis may not have a cause to look for, it comes suddenly, or it is induced by physical or mental labor or overeating. Usually, there is severe stomach pain before hematemesis. Part of the blood often migrates to the intestines, so the stool is black.

The difference between gastric bleeding and pulmonary hemorrhage is what most people are eager to know, so I will write a little about it: The blood from hematemesis (gastric bleeding) is discharged with vomiting. When it coagulates, it does not contain air, it is dark red, the reaction is acidic, and it contains food components. It occurs suddenly, the duration is short, and there is a feeling of belching and pressure in the upper abdomen. Few people have a rise in body temperature, and the stool is black. The blood from hemoptysis (pulmonary hemorrhage) is coughed up with coughing. When it coagulates, it contains air, the blood is bright red, the reaction is alkaline, and it is mixed with mucus and pus. The duration is long, and there is a feeling of heaviness, pain, or rising temperature in the chest. It is mostly feverish. In addition, it should be noted that if it is originally pulmonary hemorrhage or bleeding from the mouth, nose, pharynx, or throat, part of the blood is swallowed into the stomach and vomited out again, it is easy to be confused with gastric bleeding.

Fourth is hyperacidity, that is, excessive stomach acid.

In addition, patients often complain of acid reflux, heartburn, thirst, and erratic appetite, sometimes even increased appetite, but when a severe pain occurs, they reduce their food intake for fear of eating.

### Pay Cash for Consultation Fees

Since foreign exchange has tightened and drug prices have soared, drug merchants who hoard drugs have made no small profit of ten times. Doctors buy drugs and refuse to keep accounts, and must pay in cash. The drug merchants' self-seeking can be said to be detailed and thorough, but it has a significant impact on the doctors' side. Patients often get used to keeping accounts and settle at the end of the month. According to the current situation, they must pay in cash for the pharmacy, but they cannot collect in cash for the patients. The burden of bearing the advance payment will make the turnover difficult. The Doctors' Association of this city, in view of this, specially announces to the patients that they are requested to pay in cash from now on. It is hoped that the patients will understand this difficulty, sympathize with it, and cooperate with it.

Tight at First, Then Loosening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no change. The British and American markets were quite tortuous in the dark market, with fluctuating and unstable conditions. The morning market opened with a hard trend, with British exchange at four shillings six and a quarter, and American exchange at nine yuan, but no transactions were heard. After the opening, the banking sector suddenly came to grab fiercely, causing foreign firms and speculators to also start activities. Moreover, there was a temporary lack of maintenance, so it was a momentary state. British gold actually shrank to four shillings one and seven-eighths, and American exchange also softened to eight yuan twenty-five. After 9:30, because the market's exchange bill discount was high, reaching 270 yuan, it was even more difficult to obtain cash. Therefore, the grabbing wind was slightly restrained. In addition, the Bombay Silver Company and the Chinese yarn and flower gangs competed to throw and sell, and the Western merchant Sassoon also strongly sold futures, causing the market to turn back hard. After entering, the Hong Kong Electric also suddenly came to supply and sell, so the potential became more stable, and the results were slightly longer.

### Unstable Foreign Exchange, Gold Market Still Chaotic, One Day of Fluctuations Outside of 300 Yuan, Transactions Stillæºat More Than 2,000 Taels

Yesterday's cash raw red dark market conditions: because foreign exchange was still quite tortuous, the market situation also changed violently. At the beginning, it was rising, and then it fell sharply. The difference between the high and low prices was also as much as 330 yuan. At the beginning, it was heard that foreign exchange had been fiercely grabbed by Japanese banks, and it suddenly became extremely tight. It was also heard that banks were reluctant to supply British gold above 4 shillings 25. Therefore, the general public thought that the exchange market would shrink violently again, and they felt panic and raised prices by releasingçs to each other. It is said that a certain silver building (on behalf of the wealthy) and a certain silver firm (on behalf of foreign firms) raised prices even more fiercely. In addition, sellers disappeared, so the morning opening soared to 3,830 yuan, which was the highest peak of the day. Later, because foreign exchange suddenly turned loose and hard, it aroused the selling wind. Silver building gangs and cash houses took advantage of the high price to sell ahead of each other. The market situation suddenly turned against them and poured down to the lowç of 3,500 yuan. Later, because the wealthy came to absorb at low prices again, the situation turned stable. The noon closing was still standing at 3,600 yuan. In the afternoon, because foreign exchange returned hard, the price of gold also fell again to 3,510 yuan. As a result, it closed at 3,530 yuan, which was aæ¶¨ of 60 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Transactions were stillæºat more than 2,000 taels. The price of silver building ornaments also rose sharply first and then stepped back. The larger firms once hung up 400 yuan, and finally hung up 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, and Chinese and British pure gold and other items all fell back slightly.

Raw Red Re-æ¶¨ Sixty Yuan

Since the morning, eachæ¡ (ten taels), at the beginning, because it was heard that foreign exchange was extremely tight, people's hearts were abnormally firm andæ. Buyers releasedçs to purchase. It is said that a certain silver firm raised prices more and more fiercely. For a time, sellers disappeared. At 9:25, the market opened, which was a huge æ¶¨ of 360 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. A certain silver firm enteredéå· twenty taels, the price was 3,830 yuan. After the opening, although a certain silver firm and a certain money exchange industry absorbed each other, the foreign exchange suddenly tightened and returned to loosen, so it aroused the selling wind. Silver building gangs and cash houses competed to sell, and the situation turned against them and poured down. They broke through the three hundred-yuan barriers from 3,800 yuan to 600 yuan in succession, almost breaking into the 3,500 yuanå³å£. At present, Yuå· sells fifty taels to the money exchange industry, the price of 3,500 yuan is the lowestç of the day. Later, because a part of the silver building gang suddenly came to make up, and foreign exchange did not report continued hard, soæ£æ· who had sold short that day also came to make up, so the market situation re-trended upward and flew up by more than 100 yuan. Money exchange industry mutually made fifty taels, the price was 3,630 yuan. Near noon, the money exchange industry continued to sell, and the price was pressed down by 40 yuan. Money exchange industry sold fifty taels to a certain silver firm, the price was 3,590 yuan. Later, the cash house came to sell again, and it fell another 20 yuan. Cash house sold fifty taels to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,570 yuan. Extended to the noon closing, a certain money exchange industry entered fifty taels from the silver building gang, and the price rose to 3,600 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial opening was firm and stable. The market opened and immediately made a high of 10 yuan. Cash house sold fifty taels to theéå· (on behalf of speculators), the price was 3,580 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold number continued to absorb, and a certain silver building also hadçº³è, so it rose another tenä½ yuan. Silver building gang entered fifty taels from the cash house, the price was 3,595 yuan. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange continued to report a return to hard, and people's hearts wereèç². Cash houses and money exchange industries competed to sell out, and the price poured down 85 yuan. Money exchange industry sold ten taels to the silver building gang, the price was 3,510 yuan. At that time, there were many buyers at the price limit of 3,500 yuan, so the slightly seen return to high silver building brought in fifty taels from the money exchange industry, the price of 3,530 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, it æ¶¨ 60 yuan compared to the noon closing on the previous Saturday. The total daily fluctuation was 330 yuan. The selling price of the cash house's æ¬è¾ gold was 10 yuan higher than the raw red. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were some transactions.

Ornamental Gold Also Rose and Fell Indefinitely

Every tael of silver building ornamental gold waså out, and at the beginning, it did not change. Until 9:30, it suddenly rose sharply by 35 yuan. More than two minutes later, it continued to rise sharply by another 15 yuan. At that time, the larger firms once hung up 400 yuan. At 9:50, it returned slightly by 30 yuan. At 10:10, it fell back another 5 yuan. At 10:35, it fell back again by 5 yuan. At 11:16, it suddenly rose sharply again by 10 yuan. At 11:40, it suddenly fell back again by 5 yuan. At 3 pm, it returned slightly by another 5 yuan. After this, there were no changes. The result was a æ¶¨ of 10 yuan. The larger firms changed to hang up 360 yuan, and the new firms were 358 yuan. Theæ¶è¿ had no fixed price.

Chinese Pure Gold Fell Back with London

The buying price of Chinese cash from the Central Bank fell back to 1,000112 yuan 3è§. The listed Customs gold remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan 3è§9å6é. The Shanghai standard æ é price fell back 3è§, calculated at 1,207 yuan ç©´è§. This was caused by the London telegram of the 22nd, where the price of English pure gold fell slightly by half a shilling seven per ounce.

### British and American Gold Pounds Rise Three to Five Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange changed dramatically. The raw red market conditions also followed the chaotic exchange market. As a result, it æ¶¨ 60 yuan. Foreign currencies changed dramatically, rising first and then falling. British and American gold pounds were in short supply, and the market price rose and fell with the raw red changes. As a result, the increase was quite large. British and American gold notes rose a lot. Hong Kong, French, Canadian, and other notes were in high demand and rose. Japanese gold notes were in demand and the situation was even. The evening market was still 1 yuan 1è§. Korean notes were firm, and the evening market was 8è§9å. Public Association transactions were notç. Longchang åº Hengmaoè¿ US notes for 100 yuan, and åº æ£®æ³°è¿ US notes for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds rose 3 yuan, British gold notes rose 1 yuan 2è§, American gold pounds rose 5 yuan, American gold notes rose 4è§5å, Hong Kong notes rose 5å5å, French notes rose 5å, Canadian notes rose 5è§, and other currencies did not change.

### Exchange Bill Discount Sees New High Price Again

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills continued to rise, but on that day, it was high first and then slightly returned. Every thousand yuan was once raised to the highest price of 270 yuan by those who urgently needed cash. Then it gradually returned low, to about 250 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it fell back to 240 yuan, which was 25 yuan higher than last week'sç©´. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was still calculated at 1è§6å in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Outlying Place Name Banknotes Should Still Be Used in Unity

Since this city stopped using North China place name banknotes, recently, the ä¸­äº¤ two banks have specially set up exchange offices foré¶æ numbers of Tianjin and other place name banknotes below 10 yuan, and still allow exchange. However, the restrictions are extremely strict and crowded. As for outlying place name banknotes other than North China place names, such as Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other place name banknotes, although reports state that they can still be used, most merchants and banks refuse to accept them. Part of them were previously issued by commercial banks, such as ä¸­å, Zhejiang Xingye, and China Reclamation (the above three banks' cash and guarantee reserves have been handed over to the receiving bank for counting), and Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial and other bank banknotes have been received. However, if the receiving bank exchanges outlying place name banknotes issued by these banks, it is rejected. If they are exchanged at the original issuing bank, they say that the reserve fund has been handed over to the receiving bank and has nothing to do with the bank. Such negotiations often occur, making it impossible for the banknote holders to exchange them, and they are likely to become waste paper. It is hoped that the receiving bank should publish an announcement stating that, in addition to North China and Hankou place names, all outlying place name banknotes, whether issued by the bank or the commercial bank banknotes received, should still be used in unity, andä¸æµ· place name legal tender can be exchanged at any time, and send a letter to the silver and money industry associations, requesting them to notify all banks to accept and use them, so as not to hinder the circulation of legal tender and maintain the confidence of the banknote holders. Now I will list the names of the receiving banks for the reserve funds of the eight commercial issuing banks as stipulated by the Issuing Reserve Committee.

### Bank Reserve Meeting Raises Exchange Bill Interest

The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city has revised the exchange bill interest, which has been implemented since yesterday (the 24th), which is four points higher than the 17th. As for the public loanææ¬¾ interest and the acceptance bill discount rate, they have not moved. The following is the exchange bill interest market:

### Securities: Domestic Debt Falls Again

Yesterday's dark market for securities rose and fell quite quickly, rising slightly at first and then later, and finally still slightly weak. The trend showed signs of stability. A financial magnate informed the reporter yesterday that the decision to pay both principal and interest had been made and would still be handled in the same way as before, but it would be paid by exchange bill. The rumors about discounted interest may be different. The date of interest payment is not far away, so let's wait for confirmation. In terms of the environment, the financial situation has improved after the banking industry has made every effort to maintain it. However, the Sino-Japanese negotiations have a relationship with the future of China's resistance war. Although the specific situation cannot be predicted, people's hearts are still uneasy. Therefore, the market fluctuates faster with the different psychology of each person. Yesterday's general situation was that small banks and money houses had a slight tendency to sell goods to seek cash. For example, Tiansheng Lianhe sold more, followed by No. 18, 41, and 64, which all sold. Tongyu also provided a slight amount. Therefore, the opening was slightly lower by about one yuan. Category C continued to be slightly lower to 0.07è§, which was 2 yuan 34è§ lower than the previous week. Later, short sellers took advantage of the small to make up, such as Hongkang, Tongkang, Xieda, Songmao, Dingkang, and Hengfu, which all bought in. The market price suddenly returned to good by 78è§ to more than one yuan. Finally, scatteredæ·s slightly sold out, and it fell back slightly by 23è§. The market price fluctuated and was unpredictable, changing several times a day. As a result, it fell back slightly by 1 yuan 6è§å to 2 yuan. However, because Category D did not open on Saturday, it was only slightly lower by 1è§ compared to before. Both Categories C and D also found new low prices. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about 700,000 yuan. The following is a summary table:

Category Highest Lowest Closing æ¯åæ¥

Unified A 0.7049.50 50.40 Down 1.65

Unified B 4.0041.90 42.10 Again 1.90

Unified C 42.0040.70 41.15 Again 1.85

Unified D 40.2540.20 40.10 Again 0.10

Unified E 41.8040.70 40.85 Again 2.00

Stock trading mostly had a market but no transactions. For example, the selling price of Chinese Electric shares was 5 yuan 6è§, and the selling price of Zhejiang Xingye Bank shares was 65 yuan. None of them were traded because theæ¶¨é£ of foreign exchange and raw red has been too strong in recent days, and most people have no time for this.

The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's delivery was quite large and ended early. There were no special highlights in the stock market. Yihang shares and Kaiping shares rose slightly, but most other stocks did not change much. The rubber stock market was firm, and most stocks were in demand. However, stocks such as Botu Annan, Lipai, and Ximenbu were all neglected. If a Sino-Japanese compromise can be achieved, it should enable the stock market to have good progress and the foreign exchange market can also be firm. If the two are uncertain, investors will hold back and be wary.

### Cotton Yarn: Sales to Customers Decrease, Yarn Prices Still Rise; Double Horse and Shepherd Brands Rise Again by Ten Dollars

The yarn market is showing signs of recovery, but customer sales have significantly decreased. Aside from some purchases by traders from South China and Hong Kong, the volume is minimal, only 230 bales. Other traders have shown little activity. The general sentiment among yarn dealers is bullish. The exchange rate premium for banknotes is extraordinarily high, reportedly reaching 270 yuan, which has slightly suppressed market activity. In the afternoon, it was heard that the exchange rate for drafts has increased again.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened this morning with a consensus that prices were likely to rebound due to the significant drop in the previous day. This, combined with the contraction of foreign exchange and a slight rise in gold prices, spurred renewed interest. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns was 545 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 533 yuan. Shortly after, the aforementioned news was confirmed, and buyers rushed in, causing prices to surge suddenly. The situation became more tense, with prices jumping by ten yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns reached 555 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 545 yuan. However, actual sales were weak. Later, it was heard that the British exchange rate had contracted, leading to another price increase. The highest price for Double Horse spot goods initially reached 561 yuan. Subsequently, due to a sharp increase in exchange surcharges and unfavorable news, prices retreated again. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 556 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 543 yuan. The total trading volume for the half-day was only 710 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by eleven yuan, and Shepherd brand yarn rose by ten yuan. The Yong An Factory offered 40 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn at 610 yuan, available immediately. Today, 455 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 600 bales to Beihai, 500 bales to Haiphong, 130 bales to Yantai, and 120 bales to Tianjin. Yesterday, 2,250 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Tianjin. The amount purchased by various traders is listed below:

Fellow traders: 480
Hong Kong: 230

Total: 710

The Japanese yarn market opened with rising prices, followed by a sharp increase in exchange surcharges, reaching a high of 270 yuan. The yarn, mainly sold for cash, was inevitably affected. Combined with sluggish customer sales, the asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn was 414 yuan. However, with the brisk trade in Piqiu yarn for the next month, market prices are expected to be high.

### U.S. Cotton Export Subsidy: Temporarily Set at 1.5 Cents per Pound

Regarding foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market was relatively quiet yesterday. The opening price dropped slightly by 2-3 points due to short selling by Southern traders. Dealers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the government's announcement of the U.S. cotton export subsidy terms. Later, prices rose slightly due to favorable news from Liverpool and Bombay, and strong support from the banking sector. The closing price was better by 1-2 points. Indian cotton fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton remained closed.

Regarding foreign cotton trading in Shanghai, the detailed rules for the U.S. government's export subsidy were announced yesterday after the close of the New York market. The subsidy has been increased to 1.5 cents per pound. However, to ensure the success of this plan, Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace has the authority to increase or decrease the subsidy at any time. The subsidy terms will be effective from midnight on the 27th of this month to June 30th of next year. According to Wallace, it is estimated that U.S. cotton exports for this year will reach 3.4 million bales by the end of this month. This is the smallest figure for U.S. cotton exports in 60 years. He hopes that with the implementation of this subsidy, exports can increase to 6 million or 7 million bales next year. Local manufacturers were pleased to hear about the implementation of the subsidy. However, the inability to extend exchange rates and the lack of financial easing mean they can only wait and see. Large quantities of foreign cotton have arrived recently. The "Levrubank," carrying several tens of thousands of bales of Brazilian cotton, is scheduled to arrive today and dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong.

Spot cotton trading saw some transactions, but factory demand remained limited. In reality, the discount rate for legal tender is rising daily, and with tight credit conditions, there is little hope for business development. However, occasional deals are made among traders, but the quantities are small, so market prices have not fluctuated much. Regarding sources from northern Jiangsu, there were 286 bales of Tongzhou cotton. Exports included 250 bales of cotton to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Bailuo cotton: 100.0 - 102.00, 200 bales
Traded for cash with godown delivery among traders.

Tongzhou cotton: 20.00, plus 10 bales
Traded with exchange settlement for godown delivery.

### Piece Goods: Textile Mills Dare Not Accept Forward Orders; Exchange Sales Prices Increase

Domestic Cloth:

Yesterday, the cloth market turned stable. Various parties uniformly expect higher prices for forward contracts, and mills are unwilling to accept them. Spot trading remains active. Cash prices remain unchanged, while exchange prices are affected by the premium, rising by an additional 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Dyeing costs have increased by about 50%, so dyeing cloth prices have also risen slightly. Speculators traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and dyed cloth. Traders from Yantai on the northern route bought over 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth from Dasheng and Yihua. Guangdong traders bought over 40 bales of fine twill from brands like Ai Zi. Local dyeing factories bought one thousand several hundred double bolts of colored twill and gray cloth, mostly for dyeing and sale to Guangdong traders. Orders from local traders are nearing completion by the end of the month, and deliveries are becoming increasingly busy.

Eastern Cloth:

White cloth is affected by high cash premiums, resulting in sluggish sales. Sales prices continue to soften. Spot prices for Longtou fine cloth remain at only 14.25 to 14.3 yuan. However, forward contracts are popular among traders, with next month's goods trading at 15 yuan per piece. Yanghe fine cloth was traded among dealers at 14 yuan. Japanese trading houses offered 14.1 yuan, but fine twill was consistently weak, with prices falling by about 1 jiao per piece.

Exports:

Piece goods exports on the 25th: 46 pieces to Tianjin, 200 pieces to Yantai, 45 pieces to Hong Kong, 8 pieces to Beihai, and 50 pieces to Haiphong. In addition, 155 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 24th, and 740 pieces arrived from Tianjin.

### Silk and Tea: Filature Silk Sold for 3,000 Yuan; Factory Agents Aiming for Even Higher Prices

The local silk market sees strong interest from British, French, and American trading houses. However, because the exchange rate is more stable than before, silk prices have not risen sharply despite brisk trading. Filature B-grade silk, 78%, sold for 3,000 yuan, all being Tin silk. Local manufacturers are aiming for even higher prices. Yesterday, Renchang, Baiduo, Renji, and other firms purchased a total of 60 dan. Zhejiang silk from six firms, with Qilin and Running Horse grades, are being actively purchased for export. Yesterday, Xinfu, Dachang, and others traded 150 dan at a price of 1,700 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan compared to ten days ago. For B-grade silk, the increase is 800 yuan.

In overseas silk markets, New York was closed on Sunday. Yokohama spot prices were 1,268 yuan, the current month was 1,241 yuan, and the forward December price was 1,170 yuan, up 2 to 8 yuan from last Saturday.

One bale of rayon arrived from Tianjin yesterday.

### Needle-Shaped Eyebrow Tea Sales Active

Needle-shaped eyebrow green tea sales are becoming more active due to the still low prices. Prices have rebounded from 60 yuan to 67-68 yuan. Baochang, Xiehe, and other firms have also slightly increased their purchases of premium grade eyebrow tea. The selling price for premium grade tea is 320 to 345 yuan, and the selling price for standard eyebrow tea is 275-276 yuan. Most merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach due to extremely tight credit conditions and high risks.

Yesterday, 196 packages of tea arrived from Hong Kong, and 15 boxes were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Rice Merchants Hoarding, Leading to Scarcity

Domestic Rice: After a period of rapid price increases, all goods have been capped at the limit price. Yesterday, sentiment became even more bullish, with both traders and customers seeking to buy. Local stores also had very high demand. However, at the same time, suppliers, believing that market prices could not rise further, were unwilling to sell and did not display samples. The market only saw early and late rice from the riverbanks, as well as general Huangsu japonica rice and aged customer glutinous rice. The situation was chaotic, and prices were all at the limit price. Therefore, trading in the market appeared quiet. There were rumors that those urgently needing rice were privately making deals above the limit price due to a lack of supply. However, these deals were extremely secretive, making it impossible to confirm. Given this situation, the upward trend in the rice market, despite the strict price limits imposed by the British and French authorities, may be difficult to contain. Wuxi Huangsu japonica rice was traded at 20 yuan, Yangjian at 20 yuan, Dujian at 19.5 yuan, aged customer glutinous rice at 16 yuan, and Zhajian at 15.6 yuan. Variable glutinous rice also followed the trend, with the price of foreign glutinous rice surging to 21.5 yuan. A total of 1,400 to 1,500 bags of goods from Songjiang Nangang, including Che Lun Bao Zi, arrived via the river.

Customer Indica Rice: Yesterday, although sales to inland areas decreased, local stores and speculators were even greedier. Total trading volume reached approximately 5,000 bags. Unpolished and medium-grade machine-milled indica rice increased by another 4-5 jiao, while medium-grade machine-milled indica rice was also quoted at the limit price of 16 yuan. High-quality Wuhu indica rice and Beijing indica rice were not available for sampling.

Foreign Rice: After opening at 24 yuan the day before, suppliers found that the higher costs due to the contracted foreign exchange rate made it difficult to agree on a price, so they insisted on not selling cheaply. However, local retailers, noting the good quality, made many inquiries. New Saigon rice jumped by one yuan, with a price of 25 yuan. Aged Saigon rice rose to 22.8 yuan, but suppliers were unwilling to sell it off cheaply again. Total trading volume was only slightly over 300 bags.

### Nanyang Flour Sales Turn Brisk; Factory Prices Continue to Rise by One Jiao; Wheat Continues to Be Hoarded

The flour market continued to rise by one jiao, with factory prices for No. 2 flour at 4.85 yuan. Local customers all paid in cash. Since the tightening of foreign exchange and rising prices, the flour market has been trending upward. However, due to sluggish customer sales and problems with recovering payments, it has not risen steadily. Yesterday, demand from Xiamen and other places in Nanyang suddenly turned strong. Although the exchange rate situation meant that there were no large transactions with the Northern traders, retail sales were also quite active. Therefore, factory prices continued to increase by one jiao, and customer requests for payment via exchange were rejected. Total trading volume was over 40,000 bags, all purchased by local customers in small quantities. Currently, flour mills have reduced production, so the market is quite lively.

New wheat arrivals continue to increase, mainly Anhui wheat, followed by Changzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Suzhou wheat. Since traders from Shantou made inquiries the day before, sentiment has been boosted. Combined with rising flour prices, suppliers are holding firm. However, Chinese and Japanese factories are not very interested, while hoarding continues to be active. A total of over 1,500 bags of Changzhou, Danyang, Kunshan, and Suzhou wheat were sold at prices ranging from 6.88 to 7.1 yuan, an increase of 2-3 fen from the end of last week.

On the export side, on the 25th, 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei, 1,000 bags to Tanggu, and 4,000 bags to Tianjin.

### Oil and Oil Cakes: Oil Prices Soar; Soybean Oil Exports Substantial

Yesterday, the oil market remained strong. The unprecedented high prices of the 21st reappeared. Although purchases by local and Hong Kong traders decreased, trading was very lively, causing market sentiment to soar. Peanut oil initially softened but then rose, ultimately increasing by 1 to 3.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. A total of 300 containers of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 43.5 yuan, before falling to 42.5 yuan. Two hundred barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded, with the price rising from 54 yuan to 56 yuan. Fifty barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded at 52 to 52.2 yuan. Soybean oil rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan. A total of 100 containers of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 36.1 yuan, 50 containers of Qingqi oil at 36.5 yuan, 100 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil at 49.5 yuan, 300 barrels of Kobe Dalian oil at 50.08 yuan, and 300 containers of Yanqui oil at 36.9 yuan. Prices have exceeded the record of the 21st.

On the 24th, 1,000 barrels of tung oil were shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 containers of soybean oil to Tianjin, 1,090 containers to Yantai, and 5,565 tins and 578 containers to Qingdao. On the 24th, 1,340 tins of sesame oil were shipped to Qingdao. On the 25th, 500 tins of sesame oil were shipped to Hong Kong. Also on the 25th, 2,535 tins and 422 containers of crude oil, 355 bags of soybeans, 800 bags of groundnut kernels, and 575 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Constrained by Discount Rate

According to the London telegraph, the sugar market remained relatively unchanged yesterday, with August at 7 shillings, December at 6 shillings 2.5 pence, and March of next year at 6 shillings 3.75 pence. Local guild quotes fluctuated due to the tightening of the exchange rate premium. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar varied slightly, with local godown at 34.3 yuan and foreign godown at 34 yuan. Re-export goods were at 26 yuan. Taikoo Car White B-mark West godown was at 37.2 yuan to 37 yuan, and East godown was at 36.8 yuan, with about 200 bags traded, with little fluctuation. CW-mark West godown was at 36.4 yuan, slightly lower, CW-mark was at 34 yuan, slightly lower. DY-mark West godown was at 35.8 yuan, East godown was at 35.6 yuan, with about 200 bags traded. HX-mark was at 35.6 yuan (West godown) and 35.4 yuan (East godown), slightly lower. H-mark Car Red remained unchanged. Spot price for Dutch Red rose by 0.5 yuan to 27.5 yuan. Re-export initially rose by 0.5 yuan to 20.5 yuan, then rose by 0.4 yuan to 20.9 yuan, with 100 bags traded. Domestic sugar quotes were uniformly raised due to the high exchange rate premium. Full Three Spikes was quoted at 40 yuan, Zhengmian Red at 30 yuan, Tiquing at 24-25 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 23 yuan, and Gaodiao Qing at 21 yuan. Some offered Huizhou white at 36 yuan, an increase of 5-6 yuan compared to before, with only a few dozen bags traded. The rest did not result in transactions.

Sugar imports yesterday included 294 bags from Beihai, 1,675 bags from Haikou, 2,390 bags from Hong Kong, and 40 cases of rock sugar from Beihai.

### Coal: Refined Coal Rises by Eight Yuan; Large Quantities of Indian Coal Arrive in Shanghai

Refined Coal: Recently, business has picked up because coal briquette prices have risen from 38 yuan to 51 yuan, an increase of over 10 yuan per ton. Therefore, prices are also being raised accordingly, effective immediately, by eight yuan. For transactions among dealers, large refined coal is 52 yuan per ton, and small coal is 50 yuan. Retail prices at door-front stores are 2.8 yuan and 2.6 yuan per dan.

Indian Coal: Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Induna" arrived from Calcutta carrying 7,936 tons of coal. After import, it was anchored at floating docks 33 and 34 for transshipment. In addition, the "Linasie" arrived from Calcutta carrying 3,734 tons of Indian coal, and 1,500 tons of coal from Hong Kong (the telegram may be in error, so it may not be this amount). The more than 3,000 tons of Indian coal loaded is managed by Jardine Matheson themselves, so after the ship arrived in Shanghai, it berthed at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the "Harmouic" also arrived from Calcutta carrying 7,180 tons of coal. The location where it will berth upon arrival in Shanghai has not yet been determined. These two ships are expected to arrive on the 28th.

### Metals: Black Iron Billets Rise Steadily

Trading in black iron billets was once lively before the foreign exchange rate changed, but since the tightening of foreign exchange, sales in various channels have been severely hit, and it has become sluggish again. However, the market has recently shown some signs of easing. As a result, local thermos bottle factories, can factories, printing factories, and tin printing factories have slightly increased their purchases. However, sales to customer traders are negligible because Tianjin is blockaded, and there are no ship spaces available to Qingdao and Yantai, making it impossible to ship goods for export. Furthermore, southern ports have been blockaded since yesterday, causing all shipments to the north and south to halt. Standard selling prices, on the other hand, have been steadily increasing. Initially (about a week ago), each box was sold for 125 to 40 yuan, but after the dramatic changes in the foreign exchange rate, it increased to 45 to 50 yuan. However, (in the last two days) each box cannot be bought for less than 50 yuan. It is said that some have been quoted at 60 yuan per box.

### Seafood: American Squid Soars

American squid prices have soared due to low supply and dwindling inventory. Trading has been quiet for a long time. However, recently, the foreign exchange rate has contracted sharply, and the discount rate has risen, causing market anxiety. Yesterday, a batch was sold at 200 yuan, a surge of 60-70 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Tapioca Flour and Sago Continue to Tighten

The tapioca flour market continues to rise. Each brand has increased by one yuan compared to before. Renqiang is at 24 yuan, Flying Unicorn is at 22 yuan, 3X and KG are both at 21 yuan, and Double T is at 19.5 yuan. Sago is also rising, with large granules selling for 29 yuan and small granules for 14 yuan, all for cash.

### People Swimming in Piles of Gold: Scenes in Front of Silver Shops

â (Gu Zhibin)

On the afternoon of July 21st, a lively scene unfolded at the entrance of a certain silver shop on a corner of Nanjing Road. It was unprecedented since the silver shop's opening and, even more so, a new record for the silver shop industry since ancient times.

Under the strong sunlight, the sidewalk was packed with people, all craning their necks, staring blankly at the crowded people inside the shop, with expressions of disappointment on their faces. A few people were vigorously squeezing inside; having just squeezed into the door, they were pushed back out again, sweat rolling down their foreheads onto the ground, panting for breath, with angry tones hanging on their lips. But there were also people who strode out of the shop with triumphant expressions on their faces, as if they had already achieved victory.

On the left side of the sidewalk stood a short, elderly man with a long white beard on his lips, shaking his head and sighing. He muttered to himself, "Give up the thought! Making a fortune is not for old men like me. I've been waiting since morning, without even a bite to eat. The market price plunged from over four hundred yuan to three hundred and fifty yuan, and the people selling gold are still crowding together, and in ever greater numbers. If I had the strength, wouldn't the profit of forty or fifty yuan already be in my hands? Forget it! Making a fortune is no longer for old men like me!" He turned around, lifted his heavy steps, and gradually left the crowd.

The fluctuations in market prices stirred up a noisy clamor.

Among the crowd in front of the counter were young girls, young lads, rural women, fashionable wives, boys in Western suits, and even two foreign women with high noses and green eyes adding a touch of color. When the noise subsided slightly, suddenly a country old woman, with a trembling voice, her hand inserted into her pocket, her face flushed red and purple, momentarily turning from purple to white, from white to green, two tears bursting from her eyes. It turned out that the gold bracelet hidden in her pocket had disappeared without a trace.

On the other side of the shop, a young couple was arguing. "I told you to bring out those three gold rings in the morning, but you would only bring one. The market price differed by sixty yuan between the morning and afternoon, wasn't that an unexpected loss of twelve yuan? Hey! Someone who refuses to listen to others!" The man glared angrily at the woman.

"Did you come with me this morning? Why didn't you mention that again? Now you're blaming me. You should take some responsibility as well. Maybe if we wait a few more days, the market price will go up again!" The woman also refused to show weakness in her reply. Upon hearing this, a hint of a smile appeared on the man's face, indicating that there was still some hope. The two squeezed out of the shop.

Among the crowd were people who were specifically inquiring about market prices, some who were making small speculations, selling when the market price rose and buying when the market price fell, and some who were just watching the excitement, making the crowd even more crowded.

Under this special environment, the silver shop had invisibly become a small gold exchange.

### The Gold Rush of Ducks

â Hui

"Guilders are clever, gold pounds are foolish; all our ducks are swans."

ââEnglish, Boughtonââ

Along with the recent hurricane, the soaring gold prices have created a tense situation. The lovability of gold, after all, is ancient.

But the "ducks" of Shanghai are not foolish, although they also understand the collection of gold pounds: and the rise of the gold rush is precisely a good show for the ducks. Because they are willing to be disturbed several times a day by the uneasy waters.

When the war started, friends who had seen German Marks became smarter and were secretly calculating the legal tender in their safes, moving to deposit it in foreign banks. The family fortune in the foreign safe may not be a "business for thousands of years."

Doubting again and again, they felt that foreign money was not as good as gold, so they bought it en masse. The market made several breakthroughs in a row, and the price of gold soared like a thermometer immersed in boiling water.

I remember a year ago, for the purpose of strong-arming Czechoslovakia, Hitler was testing the waters in Europe. At that time, there was no lack of heroes who were ready for action. Then Chamberlain offered a "flower from the thorny bushes" and "pigeons from the food tray" to the head of the Munich Conference, and Europe was temporarily "peaceful." But when the terror of the world war weighed down on people's hearts, the ducks floating and sinking in the gold rush also stirred extraordinarily fiercely, and the clever guilders and foolish gold pounds rose and fell, and they were hesitant all day long.

A year has passed, and the good show of Danzig is being rehearsed again. The dictator's conspiracies are a set of magic tricks, and those who play with fire will eventually light the bomb. How confused will the Shanghai gold fanatics be then? Only the god of war knows. Now their squabbling has made the exchange a complete duck pond.

Why don't the ducks go to the "inland river"? The wise master will protect them. After all, the life of storms and waves on the isolated island is a headache.

Naturally, unless we are on the land of our motherland, we will not get the protection of freedom. When the capitalists staying in Shanghai transform themselves into national capitalists in the inland, "all our ducks are swans."

### Biographies of Female Storytellers

â Shen You

On the Charity Performances of Female Storytellers

"Records of the Pleasure Quarters": "The foreign concessions have always had 'book chambers,' which are naturally areas where the beautiful women of Shanghai gatherâ¦ Among them, about fifty are well-known. Some aficionados have written prefaces for the 'book chambers' of the foreign concessions, embedding the names of these beauties within them, making it possible to know them all at a glance, without lamenting any omissionsâ¦" This is sufficient to illustrate the completeness of the surnames of the leading female storytellers contained in the "book chamber prefaces" of the time. Combining this with the several general records mentioned earlier, it can be seen that the female storyteller who was most often the center of attention was Li Peilan. Wanxiang Liumengshi, in Volume 1 of "Songnan Mengyinglu" (Records of Dreams and Shadows of Southern Song), has a biography of Li Peilan, which reads:

Li Peilan, the mistress of Meixiang House, possessed a jade-like figure and a quiet, taciturn nature. She had an elegant and clean disposition, and there were no uncouth guests in her presence. Those who entered her room felt that the tea set and incense burner were arranged perfectly, the windows were bright and the table clean, and not a speck of dust could be found. If a guest pleased her, she would engage in endless conversation without the slightest sign of fatigue. She readily agreed to help those in urgent need and would give away a thousand gold pieces without the slightest reluctance. Is she not the "Ji Bu in Rouge" that Yu Danxin mentioned, and not the other?

She was extremely commendable in her character. A guest who listened to the zither music in the fragrance of plum blossoms also wrote a poem for her, saying: "With crystal bones and jade entrails, she has washed away the fashionable makeup of the times. Not only does she possess a clever mind and skillful hands, but she also writes thirteen lines on dark silk paper." This is a testament to her praise. The "writes thirteen lines on dark silk paper" mentioned here likely refers to another commendable deed of Peilan. At that time, there was a famine in Yuzhong (central Henan), and a certain gentleman drew "Iron Tears Picture" to solicit donations for disaster relief. Peilan read it with sorrow and immediately donated three hundred silver dollars. She also asked Yun Jian Hui Hongchaozhu to draft a small announcement to encourage her sisters in the profession to help. The announcement was both affectionate and moving. "Mengyinglu" and Huang Xiexun's "Chujing Shushe Lingmo" (Random Notes from the Chujing Study, 1878), Volume 2, both contain it:

â¦Now, as Jin is still in distress and the disaster in Yu is reported, the government is deeply concerned about the friendship with its neighbors, and good people are planning to move grain. Looking at the new "Iron Tears Picture," it is no different from witnessing the past. There is little grass with roots on the ground, and no intact corpses in the fields. Tens of thousands of households are selling their daughters and cooking their sons, enough to make ghosts and gods weep. For thousands of miles, there are only blue flames and white bones, enough to make heaven and earth grieve. Yet you, children, sing passionately, and the embroidered banquets are just beginning. Disdaining simple treasures, you are tired of unadorned green zithers. The lights burn all night, and the joy knows no bounds. The songs and music fill every household, and the pleasure is endless. The money that people make doing evil is spent on your charming smiles. Your lives are already as fleeting as catkins in the wind. How can you squander gold like dirt and exhaust your blessings in the next life? Therefore, let us awaken to the situation, create small opportunities, advocate donating three hundred gold coins, and offer a word to our sisters. We humbly ask each of you to provide assistance and show great compassion. In the midst of lively gatherings, imagine the scenes of desolation. Saving many lives is better than burning incense. Accumulating a thought of secret merit is better than reciting scriptures. We hope that you will gather sand into a pagoda and collect fur into a robe. Donate a hairpin from your temples or a brocade from your headdress, slightly reducing the luxury in the northern district, to allow the people in central China to prolong their breath. Even flower-faced servant girls, intimate maids, procuresses, and pimps can have a compassionate heart and contribute to the cause. Buddhism originally advocated equality, and righteous acts require the participation of the masses. Rely on this good cause to cultivate future rewards. May we widely sow the seeds of blessing, save the poor people who have no one to turn to, leave the sea of suffering together, and prove ourselves to be compassionate beings.

According to "Lingmo," this "Iron Tears Picture" was painted by a gentleman from Wuzhong and consisted of twelve scrolls, which were hung all over the streets at that time. In fact, it was not only the "book chamber" girls in the early years of the Guangxu reign, but also the prostitutes in the following years who often helped with various disaster relief efforts. The famous prostitute Li Pingxiang once used painting to help the victims of the disaster. Now, during this time of bitter warfare, China is trapped in a great historical disaster, and the call for charity sales echoes throughout the country. The storytelling community is not one to lag behind in righteousness, and they often perform to raise money for disaster relief. However, although female storytellers are becoming more prosperous again, and there is even a collective organization called "Puyu Society," they have been silent on these kinds of charity events, which is regrettable. It is hoped that the Puyu Society can rise in time and make the charitable acts of decades ago reappear today, and further promote and glorify them.

### Women on a Deviant Path

â Qi Hua

"Girls on Probation"

Produced by Warner Bros., Shown at the Da Guangming Theater

We have a story: A robber, at the moment of his execution, demanded milk from his mother and bit off her nipple. He said, "You spoiled me since I was a child, you didn't discipline me, so I ended up being a robber and being executed. May this scar give you a lesson!"

Regardless of whether this story is true or not, or whether it is a sermon from our predecessors, it shows the importance of family education.

The playwright of "Women on a Deviant Path" took two women who grew up under absolutely different family educations and whose different results as a subject. Unfortunately, he catered too much to the story and failed to make a strong contrast between the different environments of Connie and Cidy. For example, the father of Connie who restraints her daughter, portrayed as a ridiculous stubborn old man, not a parent with long-term vision. Cidy's romantic nature is only supplemented by a word from Connie's father. Afterwards, Cidy and her boyfriend Tony robbing the bank didn't strengthen the process of her depravity. If he could focus on this aspect, this play would be more moving and the performance will be more powerful.

The director doesn't seem to grasp the focus of the play, the whole play develops steadily, with more emphasis on Cidy's depravity, and the climax is on the police detective chasing Tony, falling into the old rut of general detective movies. However, in portraying the personalities of Connie and Cidy, they are very clearly characterized.

Kien Brelanne's Connie, played very movingly in the scene where she stubbornly refused to tell the truth after being arrested. Sheila Blobroley's Cidy, her villain is also well acted, such as indifference when stealing clothes in the store; stubborn and rude in prison; the indecent gestures when forcing Connie to pawn the ring, all show that she is a promising actress.

### Case of Assault on Missionaries in Jiujiang

Christian believers in Jiujiang wanted to build a church in a nearby county, so they first sent two young believers to the county government to seek an audience with the magistrate, intending to request the issuance of a public notice for protection. The magistrate replied that he was busy with official duties and could not meet them. The two young men thought it was an excuse and were willing to wait outside the yamen gate to meet the magistrate after he finished his official duties. As a result, more and more residents gathered to watch, and the atmosphere became turbulent. The magistrate, fearing trouble, ordered them to be met in the main hall. Unexpectedly, the two insisted on being led into the inner hall for their presentation, and the magistrate had no choice but to lead them in. During the discussion, the crowd had already squeezed into the yamen. The magistrate declined the request of the two young men, citing the lack of soldiers and police in the county seat, making it difficult to provide protection. As the two young men withdrew, they saw the crowd gathered in layers, with a menacing intention, and retreated back in fear, requesting the magistrate's protection. The magistrate had no choice but to escort them out of the crowd himself. Thus, the magistrate walked in front, with the two young men following closely behind, surrounded by yamen runners, who escorted them out of the crowd. The magistrate said that this place was safe and then turned to leave. But as soon as the magistrate turned around, the crowd shouted in unison and rushed forward. Initially, the crowd had refrained from causing trouble because they saw the magistrate in front, suppressing their anger. Now that the magistrate had left, their anger erupted and could no longer be contained. Seeing this, the yamen runners were unwilling to offer any protection and disappeared without a trace. The crowd closed in and threw stones, raining down like locusts. Seeing that there was no way out, the young men decided that running was the best option and fled for their lives. The crowd shouted loudly and chased after them. The two young men ran out of the city gate in one breath. By this time, it was getting dark, and the pursuers were about to catch up, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Reaching the city moat, they found no bridge to cross, and it was a dead end. The two young men leaped into the moat and swam to the other side. The pursuers, seeing them swimming, also swam to pursue, but because their swimming skills were inferior, the young men managed to escape. In the dark of night, they ran back to Jiujiang. The shock and panic in their hearts were indescribable. The next day, they reported the incident to the American consul, who has now sent a formal letter to the Chinese officials, demanding that the county compensate them with silver.

### The Great King and the Second King: A Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness (1)

â Li Feishu

âRandom Memories by the Plum Blossomsâ

The comrades in the theater industry have a stronger sense of unity against foreign insults than any other group. Often, because of a small matter, they can call out, and the whole group responds! This enthusiasm and courage are enough to resist the humiliation of foreign forces and are very commendable! I always hope that this spirit will be maintained and not lost! Even more, I hope it can be promoted and extended, truly suitable for this "epoch-making" period.

But then again, there are also many comrades in the theater industry who are brave in private fights, and in the comrades who perform martial arts plays, nine out of ten have this characteristic. I remember on the way to America, colleagues chatted to break the silence, and Mr. Xu Lanyuan told a story of "Rivalry in the Wilderness," which I found to be comical, unexpected, and unpredictable! The humor and lasting appeal of the story is like reading Lin Yutang's Analects. If the reader does not believe it, please see what Mr. Xu said in my "Travel to America Diary":

Ah, in our acting troupe, there is a saying that "the one who doesn't make a sound is the real hero." Although this saying refers to the thugs who patronized gambling dens at the time (Fei'an: gambling dens are gambling places, thugs are hooligans), the evil fight between the Great King and the Second King strengthened the "law" of this saying.

The Great King was Xu Deyi, and the Second King was Zhu Xiangquan. Both of them were good at martial arts plays. Although they belonged to the same troupe, they disagreed with each other and their feelings were like ice and charcoal. They often quarreled and then fought. In the backstage, they never exchanged a word.

One day, all the actors backstage suddenly discovered a strange and rare fact that puzzled them. That is: Xu and Zhu suddenly became close! After the play was over, they always went out together. Sometimes, if Xu's play finished first, he would sit quietly on the prop box and wait for Xiangquan. After he finished singing, they would go out together. If Xiangquan's play finished first, he would wait for Deyi in the same way. They had never been so close before, and now they suddenly changed their behavior, which made the colleagues backstage amazed. Everyone had deep doubts and didn't know what they were doing? Where were they going together? This lasted for a month!

Later, after sending someone to investigate, they discovered their secret. It was truly meaningful!

### Miss Chen Yanyan Speaks with Tears: Movies are My Life

â Recorded by Leng Fang

ââThe Regretful History of a Film Careerââ

Editor's introduction: Chen Yanyan, formerly known as "Beautiful Bird," has been famous in the silver screen for nearly ten years. Her artistic abilities have long been recognized, so there is no need to say more. What I want to emphasize here is that this article details her past film career, which is not only full of sincerity and emotion, but also proves that her dedication and teamwork are the reasons for her success. It is worthy of our joy and praise.

Time flies like an arrow! I have been in the film industry for nine years, and the past seems like a dream. Fortunately, I have a good reputation in my work, which is comforting. But there is a hidden pain in my heart that I regret all the time, and it is a great regret that I cannot eliminate.

This is the beginning of my film career. Because it is so heartbreaking, I can't bear to say it. For nine years, it has been deeply engraved in my heart, and I have never told anyone about it. So some of the records in film magazines are just superficial things that are not entirely true, and not the truth I said myself. I am so heartbroken that I really don't have the courage to tell this.

Is this something worth telling everyone? â To the many moviegoers who love me. Thinking of the past, my heart is extremely sad. Where should I start?

â¦During my childhood, my family fell into poverty. The old capital, where I lived for generations, was my home. The family situation was very simple. There were only three of us, father, mother, and me, the only daughter. My father was very old-fashioned and conservative. He was a moralist. In my childhood, I studied at a church school called "Sacred Heart." When I was ten years old, my father thought that girls should not run out as much as they used to when they grew up. So he hired an old teacher to set up a private school at home, teaching me day and night, year after year. In this way, I finished reading the Analects, Mencius, and Ancient Prose. When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, in addition to diligently copying large and small calligraphy scripts, I also liked to paint very much. I copied a lot of meticulous flower paintings, which were very interesting. But I had no teacher to teach me, so I was just scribbling. These immature works are laughable and not worth anything.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

â Xu Muyun

The popularity of Yin Yanqiu reminds one of the decline of Guan Dayuan

But he met Jin Song's lyric in "Hongluanxi" which says, "You have me eating out of your hand." For twenty years, he has simply been helping his nephew Guan Dayuan, and has not left him for a day. Not only does he not seek progress, but he also gets worse and worse. As a result, Dayuan is restricted from changing a word or a tune. Because if he occasionally changes the old chapter, his zither teacher uncle will have to fumble on stage. Imagine singing Peking opera like a stereotyped article, wouldn't that be too dull? Dayuan has suffered such a big loss from him, but he still does not dare to dismiss him and hire someone else. Therefore, no matter where he performs in Ping, Tianjin, etc., his huqin has never received a good evaluation. This is very different from the situation where Ma Yunliang and Yang Maizhong, Wang Shaolou and Chen Hongshou, and the zither teacher and the actor are fighting for applause. According to people who care about Dayuan's future, if Dayuan wants to get more applause on stage, he must first solve the Chen problem and hire a high-level zither teacher. Whether he has the courage to do so is not known to outsiders.

Dayuan knows about a hundred plays, and there are also many old scripts collected at home, which are probably left by Jia Lichuan's uncles and nephews. Tan school plays are not just "Zhuo Fang", "Kong Cheng", "Ma Cao", "Peng Bei", "Hong Yang Dong" and "Niao Pen Ji". There are still dozens of plays with armor, python robes, knives, guns, tossing pigtails, somersaults, and so on. Why doesn't someone invite Guan Dayuan, who is not yet old and is both civil and military, to leave Pingnan and go south, so that he can show his talents, instead of letting him be depressed and frustrated, and submerging his learning? This is really unfair. (66)

### Letter (Translation)

â Sincerely, Chairman of the Cultural Theater Troupe Committee, Helmick July 22nd

Dear Sir,

Your newspaper recently published an article stating that the Chinese Cultural Theater Troupe has returned from performing in the United States, but has not disclosed the amount of funds raised or how the funds were used. The local committee only assisted in the organization and trip to the United States, and was not involved in the funds raised in the United States. The troupe members are only related to the artistic aspects, and do not ask about economic matters. Those who are in charge in the United States are the American Medical Aid to China, the China Association, and the China Relief Association. These three groups handle all the money and directly remit it to Chinese relief organizations. The troupe will obtain reports on the receipts and expenditures of this trip from these three groups. The local committee in Shanghai has not yet received the financial report from the US organizers. However, these three groups have remitted more than one million US dollars to China last year. When the local committee receives the report, it will be announced.
