### Chinese Army Repeatedly Charges into Yuncheng; Fierce Street Battles Annihilate Many Japanese Soldiers; Japanese Army Repeatedly Makes Contact Attacking Northward from the Bojin Highway; Chinese Forces Control the Outskirts of Fengxin, Japanese Situation Perilous; Japanese Advance Along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway, Suffering Over 500 Casualties

(Xi'an) Since their defeat at Zhongtiao Mountain, the Japanese have been gradually withdrawing to Yuncheng to regroup. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to charge into the city multiple times, engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese and killing many of them. Yuncheng is now under strict guard. Japanese Commander Sugiyama recently transferred two brigades from the Zhengtai Line, Taiji, and Taishan, to reinforce Yuncheng, Wenxi, Anyi, Houma, and other locations. (13th Dispatch)

Yingde. On the morning of the 11th, a unit of over 200 Japanese infantry from Longkou arrived near Ping Shan Lianglong. A Chinese unit went to engage them, and in the fierce battle that lasted until 11:00 AM, over half of the Japanese troops were annihilated. Over 800 Japanese infantry came to reinforce them, along with four Japanese aircraft providing air support. Another unit of over 800 infantry and cavalry attempted to outflank the Chinese on their sides via He'anli Qiling. The Chinese army launched fierce attacks from multiple directions, and the bloody battle is still ongoing. (13th Dispatch)

Zhaoqing. At noon on the 12th, two Japanese warships sailed to the Heqing River area, patrolling the waters before shelling and harassing the Helu Lishui area in Heshan County. The Chinese side suffered no losses. (13th Dispatch)

(Xi'an) Over 10,000 Japanese troops from Yicheng and Jiangxian have been fiercely attacking the Chinese forces from Peiziling, Diaoshangou, and other places for days. The fighting is extremely intense. On the morning of the 11th, in the battle of Yangjiamen, a Chinese unit valiantly ambushed the enemy, killing over 600 Japanese soldiers. (13th Dispatch)

(Luoyang) On the Jinnan front, the Japanese army that invaded Wanghe southwards captured Qinyuan on the 7th. On the 8th, they continued to flee southeast towards Dongjiacun and Zhongcun, where they joined up with over 1,000 Japanese troops from the Hongtun Highway, Liangma. On the 10th, they advanced to Heshen Temple (west of Tunliu). A Chinese unit has already rushed to intercept them. According to military experts, the current Japanese actions seem to be an attempt to sweep away the large Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi, and to seize Changzhi and Jincheng to deploy heavy troops, thereby reducing the threat to their rear and protecting the safety of the Daoqing, Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines in preparation for a future invasion south across the Yellow River. However, the large Chinese army in southern Shanxi is gathering, moving flexibly, and possessing great strength. This Japanese move is nothing but a pipe dream. (13th Dispatch)

(Xi'an) The Japanese army in the triangle area of southern Shanxi has not made any major moves recently. In the past ten days, 5,000 Japanese troops from Boa'ai on the western section of the Daoqing Railway have been attacking northwards along the Bojin Highway, engaging with the Chinese army near Lanchezhen. The fighting is quite fierce. Over 20,000 Japanese troops from Handan on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have reached Wu'an, appearing to be attacking Dongyang. Over 10,000 Japanese troops along the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines are attacking southwards along the highways. Another division is attacking eastwards from Anze and Fushan and along the Hongtun Highway, while the main Japanese force is attacking eastwards in multiple directions along the Longqin Highway and the southern area, attempting to invade the Chinese guerrilla base areas in southeastern Shanxi. For days, various Chinese units have been fiercely battling the Japanese in areas south of Liaoxian and Qinxian, northwest of Qinshui, southeast of Anze, and east of Qinshui. (13th Dispatch)

Wengyuan. On the 12th, over 3,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery used artillery fire as cover to advance along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway towards Jigongji, Shiba Ridge, Huangwang Ridge, and Pingshan. The Chinese army met them head-on. In the bloody battle that lasted until dusk, the Japanese troops were unable to hold their ground and retreated towards Longkou. In this battle, over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, along with over 100 military horses. (14th Special Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese sources, of the five routes by which the Japanese army attacked Zhongtiao Mountain, up until now, they have captured Liaoxian, Qinxian, and Hehafen (transliteration). The fighting in the Boa'ai area is also extremely fierce. In northern Jiangxi, the villages and towns on the outskirts of Fengxin are under Chinese control, and the Japanese troops in Fengxin are in a very precarious situation. The Japanese troops in Yuekou Junshan in northern Hunan have also been cleared by the Chinese forces. In northern Jiangsu, the Chinese army has recovered Siyang. In the Hangzhou Chongde area, the fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies is also extremely fierce. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Tianjin Concession Blockaded for a Month, General Situation Unchanged, Japanese Sentries' Inspections Looser Than Before, Anti-British Movement Spreads in Kaifeng and Qingdao, Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Be Held in Tokyo Today

(Qingdao) Today, someone threw two hand grenades into the British Consulate, which landed in the open area of the consulate and exploded with a loud bang. The people inside the consulate and those nearby were startled, but no one was injured. Only the consulate building was slightly damaged. After receiving the news, the Japanese side immediately expressed its apologies to the British side and decided to investigate the perpetrators. It is currently unknown who committed this act. Some say that someone threw the grenades from a car while passing in front of the consulate, while others say that it was done by professional anti-British activists. As for the Japanese consulate, some believe that the Japanese side knew about this beforehand, but claimed that it was done by anti-Japanese elements to increase the difficulties in Anglo-Japanese relations. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tianjin) It has been a month since the Japanese side blockaded the British and French concessions here. Although the Japanese newspapers in this city and the Chinese newspapers they control have been carrying out extensive anti-British propaganda, the general situation remains unchanged. The supply of food into the British concession has returned to normal, but prices remain extremely high. The inspections by Japanese sentries are also looser than before, so no incidents have occurred on the British side. However, the situation in the Haihe area is relatively serious. At the same time, foreigners in this city believe that after the failure of the Tokyo conference, the situation here will become even worse. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to news from Beiping today, the anti-British movement in Kaifeng is also growing daily. Yesterday, over 1,000 Chinese controlled by the Japanese side held a demonstration in the streets of Kaifeng. After the demonstration, the crowd went to the churches and schools of the British people, demanding that the British withdraw from Kaifeng. It is reported that the British in Kaifeng have agreed to withdraw from Kaifeng within four days. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations will begin here tomorrow. At the same time, large-scale anti-British demonstrations are scheduled to be held in Tokyo and other towns tomorrow. Similar gatherings will also be held in North China. It is reported that a total of 100,000 people will participate in the anti-British demonstration in Tokyo tomorrow, passing by the Tomb of Fallen Soldiers. Political circles and public opinion are all declaring that Britain can no longer try to escape and must explain its attitude towards the "changed situation in China and the Far East." The Japanese side insists that Anglo-Japanese relations should be finally resolved, otherwise the Tokyo talks will be meaningless. (14th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Qingdao) Anti-British demonstrations will continue today and tomorrow. The British consulate here is currently unguarded. The British warship HMS Lowestoft left Qingdao on Tuesday, with only the destroyer HMS Diamond remaining here. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) News from Tianjin states that the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese has now moved from verbal propaganda to attacking British expatriates. In addition to the destruction of a British church in Shanxi province earlier this month, the situation in Kaifeng is also becoming serious. All Chinese people in the Protestant church and hospitals have been forced to resign, and the British expatriates will be ordered to withdraw within a certain period of time. In Tianjin, the so-called Anti-British Supreme Committee is also discussing so-called effective anti-British measures, which are said to put the British in a difficult situation. Furthermore, in the British concession, there have been repeated incidents of arson at the residences of Chinese police officers. (13th Dispatch)

(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, the British and Japanese authorities will immediately hold negotiations in Tokyo. Various newspapers here have commented on this matter. The Daily Express reported that "Although we cannot fight Japan at its doorstep, we can cut off its foreign trade with our navy in places beyond its reach. This is a very easy thing to do. Our country is also one of Japan's largest customers, and the Japanese government hopes that the financial circles here will provide it with credit and financial convenience. If it takes a risky move and wants to fight our country, then our country should destroy its economic system." (14th Havas Dispatch)

(London) During today's meeting in the House of Commons, Labour MP McLean inquired about the arrest of British Army Attache to China, Lieutenant Colonel Spear, by the Japanese army, saying that Lieutenant Colonel Spear would be tried by a Japanese military court and that the government had received formal notification. He also said that Lieutenant Colonel Spears had been arrested for over six weeks, and since Japan had not declared war on China, it had no right to exercise control over third countries within Chinese territory. He asked whether the government intended to demand the restoration of Lieutenant Colonel Spear's freedom from the Japanese military on this basis. Foreign Office official Butler immediately submitted a written reply, stating, "Regarding the first point, the government has not received formal notification. As for the second point, I already made a statement yesterday." (According to official Butler yesterday, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is continuing to work to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Spear.) (13th Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) Colonel Hirota, who is in charge of the blockade of Tianjin, told a reporter from the Berlin "Attack Report" that as of July 11, 3,000 Chinese residents had moved out of the British concession in Tianjin since the Japanese implemented the blockade. Since the implementation of the blockade, a total of 148,000 residents have left the British concession, while only 145,000 people have entered the British concession. The 3,000 people who moved out are mostly workers, and the British authorities are now doing their best to prevent the Chinese working class from leaving, so as not to affect various businesses in the concession. When the reporter asked when the Japanese blockade of the British concession would end, Hirota replied that this would depend on the attitude of the British, as the Japanese side demanded that Britain recognize Japan's position in the Far East. (14th Haitong Dispatch)

(London) Labour MP Maclean inquired in the House of Commons today about the shooting of the British tugboat "Saxon" by Japanese soldiers in Tianjin on Sunday, and suggested that the Japanese authorities should be notified immediately that such actions should not occur again. Foreign Office official Butler replied that the report received by Foreign Secretary Halifax did not say that Japanese soldiers had shot at the British tugboat, but rather that on July 10, Japanese soldiers had shot at a barge owned by the Datian Tugboat Company, injuring three Chinese. The Japanese soldiers opened fire seemingly because of a small Chinese boat, which had been detained by the Japanese side but had escaped and approached the British barge. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

### The United States Disregards Japanese Threats

(Washington) Regarding the Shanghai Japanese naval authorities' statement yesterday that Zhangzhou, Dongshan, Zhao'an, and other places in southern Fujian would soon be included in the military operations zone, and that the Japanese side would not be responsible for the lives and property of third countries in those areas thereafter, and requesting that expatriates from third countries withdraw from those areas immediately, US Secretary of State Hull stated that US Asian Fleet Commander Yarnell and the US diplomatic representatives in the East would certainly disregard the Japanese threats, and if the lives and property of US expatriates were damaged, they would certainly hold the Japanese side responsible for compensation. However, the State Department has only heard this news via wireless radio and has not yet received a formal notification from the Japanese side. (13th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Side Temporarily Suspends Water Supply to Gulangyu

(Xiamen) The Japanese side has currently suspended the water supply to Gulangyu due to machine repairs, for a period of two days, and promises to resume normal supply on Sunday. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

The Chinese army met them head-on and fierce battles broke out. The Japanese used a large amount of poison gas. In the bloody battle that lasted until 6:00 PM, fierce street battles broke out in Ningjiazhai, Hanjia, and other places. Fortunately, the Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely and finally defeated the Japanese army one after another by 11:00 PM, causing them to flee in five routes.

(13th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Wang Kemin Opposes "Federal Government"

(Beiping) Japanese reporters here were shocked to hear the statement from Wang Kemin, the head of the Beiping "Provisional Government," opposing the establishment of a "federal government" in the Japanese-occupied areas. Wang, who had just returned to Beiping after attending a joint meeting in Qingdao of senior Japanese officials and officials from the Beiping and Nanjing "governments" under Japanese protection, told Chinese, foreign, and Japanese reporters today that the Qingdao meeting did not discuss the proposed new government, and that Wang Jingwei did not participate in the meeting. He also said that the next meeting, scheduled for August, would also not discuss the new federal government. Japanese reporters were greatly surprised to hear this and asked many questions, but Wang Kemin's answers only made them more discouraged. It is reported that the "Provisional Government" does not intend to issue any statements in support of or in response to Wang Jingwei's recent declaration and peace appeal. The people of North China have different opinions on Wang's remarks, with some supporting them and others criticizing them. The "Provisional Government" generally agrees with Wang's hope for an end to the war, but opinions differ greatly on the methods of achieving peace. (14th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### On Stabilizing Prices

Since the soaring of prices, many people have discussed it, but without helping to stabilize prices. It is known that mere words are not enough to solve the problem. It is also true that talking about stabilizing prices today is untimely, unsuited to the place, and unsuited to the people. Why do I say this? Because today is a time of war. In wartime economics, the value of currency loses its standard, production loses its regularity, and transportation loses its convenience, so how can prices not change? The place is the occupied area, and the situation is extraordinary after the land has fallen. Mencius said, "How can the world be settled? It must be settled in one." Today, the environment is complex, and there is nothing more unstable than prices. Therefore, seeking price stability is not too difficult? As for the people, there are many talented people, but who can take charge of the overall situation and coordinate the causes and effects of price increases and decreases? Who can adjust the surpluses and deficits and equalize the highs and lows? Who can effectively manage it? Even with brilliant skills, it is impossible to bring spring back. Even with great talent, it is difficult to realize ambitions. This is why Shanghai's prices ultimately remain restless and uneasy.

What's more, the perception of price expensiveness varies from person to person depending on their circumstances. First, the basis of daily life is different. The high prices of rice, wheat, cloth, oil, salt, and vegetables are not as painful to those with a comfortable life as the rising prices of cigars, champagne, gasoline, and pollen. The money spent on a single throw in a dance hall is enough for a commoner's food for a month, so those who are struggling to make a living are indifferent to it. Second, the tastes are different. Those who eat wheat are different from those who eat grains, and those who eat meat are different from those who are vegetarians. Their empathy is separated from each other. If the level of life is very different, their feelings are also different. Only those with the same tastes have the same feelings, and only those with the same feelings have the same compassion. Third, the concept of currency value is different. For example, the price of one dan of rice, calculated in British pounds, is only a few shillings, which is not worth mentioning. One US dollar is a small number, but it is enough to provide food for Chinese refugees for two months. If half a pound is combined with one Chinese currency, then the amount that is given to people's ideas is no longer a small number. Fourth, the interests are different. The majority of consumers want prices to fall, while those who manipulate and hoard goods are afraid that prices will not rise. It is like people are afraid of hurting benevolence, and those who shoot people are afraid that they will not hit, which is what they truly want. Fifth, the business vision is different. For example, if the price of rice does not rise above twenty-one yuan, how can foreign rice be imported? As the price of rice soared, there was a large amount of foreign rice transactions. It can be seen that each has their own selfish motives, and the so-called price problem varies from person to person, and the difference is as great as between sky and earth. The rise in prices is like a straight line rising, so no matter how early or late the opportunity, as long as there is capital, it will always be advantageous and in control. The result of this is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Wealth will be concentrated in a few people. It is appropriate to celebrate for the rich, but how can we not imagine the crisis? If today's prices continue to rise rapidly, it will inevitably lead to social unrest. The vast majority of people will not have enough to eat or wear. If you think about it for a moment, what kind of world will it become? If that is the case, what is the value of the wealth they own? For example, in the occupied areas of the inland, products are stagnant. What is gold in Europe and the United States is now like dung in the inland. At every turn, there are arbitrary exactions and levies, which do not compensate for the losses. Storage is only for the sake of being plundered, and there is no way to appeal. Prices have fallen to the extreme, but is this a good phenomenon? Therefore, it is known that the so-called price problem has too many aspects, and it is not easy to say.

However, speaking practically, we cannot avoid being responsible for the financial sector. If the financial sector does not use its funds to be active in the commodity market, the transactions would not be so prosperous. If the financial sector does not accept speculative hoarding of goods at high discounts, the turnover would not be so flexible. Who can store thousands of dan of white rice at home? There are banks and warehouses. Who can carry hundreds of thousands of cash on their person? There are bank transactions. Even foreign exchange arbitrage, exchange discounts, capital flight, and soaring gold prices are all directly or indirectly related to the financial sector. Shouldn't it be the normal mission of the financial industry to develop production and support legitimate industry and commerce with the savings of the people's blood and sweat stored in the financial industry? However, due to their short-sightedness, they mistakenly believe that hoarded commodities are the only good object for mortgages and loans. This is obvious. They use their sleeves to dance well, and they use turnover as a means of support, thus fueling the trend of speculation. They wait for prices to rise and calmly observe the changes. How can the market price not rise? It is true that for a bank, the profit is high, and people flock to it, forming a trend. However, in terms of the mission of the entire financial industry, and in terms of the entire society and people's livelihood that the financial industry relies on, we cannot but hope that the wise men of the financial sector will persuade their colleagues and correct each other immediately. If this is the case, the part of the price increase caused by the financial industry will gradually return to normal. Although this is not enough to make all prices tend to stability, it will certainly be of great benefit to the society and people's livelihood.

### Japanese Troops Invade Chao-Shan: A Major Battle Expected Between Anbu and Jieyang

The northeastern gate of Chao'an has been razed to the ground. The county town of Chenghai has been captured by Japanese troops. Chinese troops have switched to a full offensive. Shantou communication: Aside from the more than 2,000 Taiwanese naval landing troops who invaded Shantou, most of the Japanese forces were transferred from Guangzhou. Units such as those of Hasegawa, Matsui, Takehara, and Hata, etc., were transported by ships overnight from Dongguan Taiping to Shantou, then transferred to motorboats and invaded the tributaries of the Han River and the coast of Jieyang. The Eastern Route Garrison Headquarters of the Japanese army in front of the Shantou Customs House is the Hata Brigade from Humen. The Soeda unit stationed around Qilu Waima Road is the Taiwanese naval landing force. The Fukuda unit stationed around the railway station in Chenghai Haoyu is an engineering unit that once built defenses in Zengcheng. The Japanese consulate on Shenzhao Road has been converted into the South China Military Transport Headquarters. A large quantity of artillery and equipment is stored in the open spaces of the Datong Swimming Pool and the Dongying School. The Central Bank on Yongping Road has been converted into the Japanese consulate. The newly appointed Japanese consul in Shantou is Takai Suehiko, and the vice-consul is Matsudaira Tadahisa. They began working on June 27th. The Japanese army uses the Soeda and Fukuda units, numbering about 600, to defend the rear of Shantou. The other units have all advanced toward Chao'an. Very few troops landed and stationed in Shantou. On the 26th, the city of Chao'an was surrounded by Japanese troops on three sides. Chinese troops constructed defenses at the West Gate Station, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain, fighting to the death to cover the evacuation of various government agencies and the people to the upper reaches of the Han River and the Tiandong and Liuhuang areas of Fengshun County. On the morning of the 27th, the West Gate Station and Hulu Mountain fell. Japanese artillery set up cannons on the mountain, and Japanese cavalry charged in from the West Gate and South Gate. A certain Chinese army unit refused to retreat and defended the North Gate, Jinshan, and the North Embankment, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese army. More than ten locations in the city caught fire that day. By the 28th, the fire had not been extinguished. The unit is presumed to have been completely sacrificed. The Japanese artillery on Hulu Mountain concentrated its firepower on Jinshan Middle School and the shops on Taiping Road. The East Gate and North Gate have been razed to the ground. The Xiangzi Bridge was blown up by the Chinese army themselves. Forty freight and passenger cars of the Chao-Shan Railway were also blown up by the Chinese army with hand-pulled grenades before they left. The Chinese defending forces fought in confusion until the evening of that day before retreating amidst the flames toward Zhugao Mountain and the north of Chao City, moving into the mountainous area. The Japanese army could no longer advance north. On the 29th, the Japanese Mauri cavalry unit, numbering about 1,000, and the Masaki floating boat unit, numbering about 800, marched south from outside the South Gate of Chao'an. Because the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, which had retreated into the Sangpu Mountain, received a telegram from Zhang Fakui ordering a swift counterattack and to sweep away the Japanese army in Jinshishi. There was a battle for three hours on the afternoon of the 28th. The Hua Zhenzhong Brigade received assistance from the local militia and swept away the Japanese transportation station in Longhu Yunbu Township. The 200 Japanese troops stationed there retreated by motorboat across Yinhu, awaiting reinforcements. At 7 a.m. on the 29th, the Mauri cavalry team galloped to the scene, rushed into Yunbu Township along the protective embankment road. The Hua Brigade had no choice but to retreat back to Jinshishi, destroying all the railways. The Masaki unit cleaned up the remnants of the Japanese army in Yinhu and then went downstream to Guanshan Township in Chenghai, landing on the embankment. At 3 p.m., they entered Chenghai City, and Chenghai fell. Bian, the magistrate of Chenghai, led the security team and strong men to resist the Masaki unit on the Huaru Neilu Township, Beilu embankment while crossing the river to Lianyang Donglu Zhanglin, because Chenghai City is in a low-lying basin, surrounded by river embankments on all sides, without any danger to defend.

The main force of the Japanese army is stationed outside the West Gate of Chao'an, and daily artillery battles with the Chinese army on Zhugao Mountain. The Japanese army, transferred from Guangzhou to Shantou along the Anjie Road, did not land in Shantou City, but instead used shallow-water warships and motorboats to sail up the Tuo River, engaging in fierce battles with the Zou Hong unit, the garrison commander of Chaozhou and Meizhou, in the Pao Taishi. Wu Qihui personally went to Qu Xi in Jieyang to supervise the battle, using 30,000 troops to guard Yujiao, Guanxi, and Jinkou on the Anjie Road, resisting the Japanese army attacking from both sides of Chao'an and Shantou. From the 28th to the 30th, the battle at Fengkou in Rongjiang was extremely fierce. When the Japanese army surrounded Chao City on three sides on the 26th, reinforcements from the upper reaches of the Han River rushed to the rescue. Those dispatched from Raoping advanced along the Cambodian coast of the Han River to the Nambei and Siji embankments of Chenghai Lianyang. The defending soldiers fought bitterly for six days, and the security team battalion commander was killed in battle. Another unit of reinforcements bypassed Anbu from Chenghai, already approaching Shantou City, and coordinated with the guerrillas in Sangpu Mountain, specializing in cutting off the Japanese army's rear support route in Chao'an. At this time, the Japanese army had changed its military focus and was heading towards Jieyang. On the 26th late at night, two Japanese shallow-water warships, towing civilian boats and rubber boats, carrying units of Hasegawa, Takehara, etc., invaded Pao Taishi in Jieyang, and used small boats to attack into Jinkou, Yuhui, and Qu Xi through the Xiao River, with the aim of seizing the Anjie Highway to prevent the Chinese army in Jieyang from entering Chao'an, and attempting to encircle the Chinese army retreating into the Sangpu Mountain, Qingmao Mountain, and Shenwu Mountain area. The above-mentioned mountains are the backbone of Chaozhou, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties, and can overlook the plains of the three counties. The Chinese army had made prior arrangements in this area, so a major bloody battle will occur at the junction of Jieyang and Anbu. Also, after the 26th, Japanese aircraft teams such as Yokoyama, Maruta, and Nakano flew to Heyuan, Laolong, Lechang, and Shaoguan, etc., to carry out bombings. More than 60 vehicles on the road were destroyed by bombing, and dozens of boats and ships carrying refugees were also sunk. Currently, millions of refugees are moving to the mountains on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, displaced and in dire straits. Also, after July 1st, the Chinese army will switch to a full offensive. Gunfire is often heard in the suburbs of Shantou at night. Villages and fortresses close their gates to defend themselves, and do not communicate with Shantou City. The Japanese army also does not dare to invade the villages and carry out offensives.

### Japanese Barracks in Changan All Destroyed

Haining communication: West of Wangdian on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, guerrilla attacks on the Japanese railway guards occur from time to time. Therefore, the Hangzhou-Shanghai train runs very slowly and is often suspended. More than 400 members of the Japanese Yamaguchi unit in Haining were transferred to Maqiao, and were ambushed by the Chinese army on the way. The exercise field, Japanese-style barracks, and brick and concrete fortresses built by the Japanese side at Changan Station were all destroyed by the Chinese side a few days ago.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line: Luoshe Station Attacked

The Sakabe Unit Suffered Heavy Casualties: Wuxi communication: More than 300 members of the Chinese army's Li Mingyang unit attacked Luoshe Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on the night of the 5th. The Sakabe unit of the Japanese garrison team stationed there suffered heavy casualties. The Li unit retreated to Donghenglin, which belongs to Changzhou County, due to strategic reasons. At the same time, when Japanese military supplies were being unloaded at Wuxi Station, 600 boxes of ammunition mysteriously disappeared. The Japanese army in Wuxi is now densely deploying sentries around the station to conduct a rigorous search.

### The Japanese Army in the Suchang Area is Exhausted

Fuhu Continues to be Bombed: Suzhou Communication: In recent days, Chinese troops along the Shanghai-Nanjing line have been actively moving around, making the Japanese army exhausted. On the night of the 5th, hundreds of members of the Chinese mobile team attacked Lujiabang Station, opening fire with the Japanese army stationed at the station. The Japanese army defended with bunkers. At the same time, there was fierce fighting between Dongguanyintang in Changshu and the Japanese army. The Chinese army also launched fierce counterattacks in Huazhou Xiayiqiao and Gehu, Yixing. The Japanese army was defeated, suffering more than 200 casualties. They then sent aircraft to various places on the 7th and 8th to conduct reconnaissance, and continued to indiscriminately bomb Gehu and other places. The Chinese mobile unit in Jiangyin also attacked the town. The Japanese army opened fire with the mobile team across the river in Shizijie Wujiaqiao. Both sides suffered casualties, and the residents fled.

### The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Scores Repeated Successes

Central Government Allocates Funds to Reward Troops: Taixian Communication: The Chinese army resolutely launched a counterattack on the county towns of Huai'an, Lianshui, and Siyang, successively entering the cities. Although Lianshui was abandoned again, it has given the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu a great setback. The morale of the Chinese army has been greatly boosted. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Han has repeatedly telegraphed the various battles to the Central Government. Yesterday, he received a commendation order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, forwarded by Director Cheng of the Xi'an Provisional Headquarters, and rewarded 10,000 yuan to the officers and soldiers who contributed to various battles in this resolution, in order to encourage them.

### Poisonous Atmosphere Rising in Qingdao: Japanese Forcibly Conscripting Laborers, Residents Flee: Machinery Factory and Paper Cigarette Factory Completely Shut Down

Dalu Bao reports: According to a reporter who recently arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao (on the 13th), the fields in Shandong Province are full of planted opium poppies. Qingdao is bound to become the most important export location for opium trade under the direct supervision of the Japanese. When he took the train to Jinan, he saw a field of opium poppies on both sides of the railway and drug dealers in each town busily preparing for a bumper harvest. Although there are laws in Shandong Province prohibiting the planting of opium poppies, a few people are arrested for planting opium poppies and are released after paying a small fine. The profit is eight yuan per mu. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean drug dealers are extremely active in Qingdao, preparing for this year's harvest. The Qingdao Japanese authorities are continuing to instigate anti-British sentiment, and the local laws and regulations are becoming increasingly lax. Shooting incidents occur from time to time. Most of the victims are Chinese people in the suburbs and city who are shot and wounded by Japanese soldiers. These Japanese soldiers seem to enjoy shooting innocent Chinese people as a form of entertainment. In addition to those who are shot and injured, there are also many who are stabbed to death. For example, one night a Chinese coolie came to a certain foreign hospital for treatment. His leg was stabbed severely by a bayonet. After being questioned by the surgeon who treated him, the injured person said that a Japanese soldier asked him for a cigarette, and when he did not get it, he stabbed him. The coolie was discharged from the hospital a week later. Japanese troops drive cars in Qingdao carelessly, causing frequent car accidents. So far, the victims have all been Chinese. After the accident, the Japanese troops do not stop the car and take the injured to the hospital. At the same time, Chinese youths in Qingdao are fleeing to the countryside in droves because the Japanese are forcibly conscripting laborers. One of the methods of forcible conscription is that Chinese youths between the ages of 18 and 25 must report to the puppet police headquarters to receive military training. Tens of thousands of people in Qingdao have fled to the countryside, and 20,000 people in Yantai have fled, resulting in a large shortage of labor in factories in the city. In Qingdao alone, the production of one oil factory has been cut in half, and the machinery factory and paper cigarette factory have completely shut down. Several clothing stores have also closed their doors, which is a direct result of the youths fleeing back to their hometowns.

### France Commemorates Democracy: Military Parade Held in Paris: Grandeur Unseen Since the European War: British Air Force Participates for the First Time

(Paris) A military parade was held in Paris today, with grandeur unseen since the triumphal parade of July 14, 1919. British troops and sailors also participated. Before the troop parade, the sidewalks of the streets were already packed with spectators, and traffic was almost blocked. The air force soared through the sky, led by five squadrons of the British Air Force. At 10:30 a.m., they paid tribute to French President Lebrun, and then flew back to London. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

(Paris) Today is France's National Day, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the Great Revolution. Due to the precariousness of the international situation, general emotions are particularly excited. Therefore, the celebration is more enthusiastic than in previous years. Furthermore, the British army, navy, and air force also came to participate in the parade, which is also unprecedented in French history. Spectators have been waiting at the parade's thoroughfares since dawn, and some even camped overnight. The troops participating in the parade were also assembled in formation at the Étoile before the parade. Tank formations were responsible for guarding the surrounding plazas near the square. President Lebrun, Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, and Minister of Aviation La Chambre successively arrived in cars. The President then got out of the car and took his seat, flanked by the King of Morocco, the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly Mushanov, the British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Pound, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall, the Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant-General Gort, and the British Conservative Party leader Churchill, all distinguished guests. At 9:30 a.m., a total of 52 nimble British Air Force fighter planes appeared in the sky. The troop parade then began, led by students from various military academies, followed by military bands, and then the British Guards and sailors. Then came the army, navy, and air force units of the French mainland, and troops from various colonies, totaling 30,000 soldiers of various races, 120 cannons, 350 tanks and armored vehicles, and 600 other military vehicles, presenting a magnificent spectacle.

### British Army, Navy, and Air Force Autumn Exercises: Extraordinary Scale

(London) Local newspapers reported that the joint exercises of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force to be held in mid-August this year will involve 80,000 naval personnel, 150,000 regular army personnel, 150,000 national defense force personnel, 30,000 national service personnel, and 150,000 air force personnel. According to the Daily Telegraph's naval correspondent, the British Home Fleet, including six battleships, five large cruisers, two small cruisers, two aircraft carriers, three destroyer squadrons, five submarine squadrons, and many auxiliary ships, will be commanded by Commander Forbes and participate in the exercises. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

(London) According to naval sources, when the British Navy holds exercises in August and September this year, more than 50 of the 130 ships belonging to the reserve fleet will participate, including one battleship, one aircraft carrier, four cruiser squadrons (totaling 16 ships), one minelayer, four destroyer divisions (totaling 30 ships), and four submarines. Furthermore, well-informed sources say that 12,000 officers and men of the Naval Reserve will also be called up. This is the first precautionary measure taken by the government, to show that Britain's national defense is fully prepared, and to maintain the advantage of proactive measures in both military strategy and diplomacy, in contrast to last year's failure to take defensive measures in time, which lagged behind Germany. It cannot be compared to that. According to reports, the British naval exercise was originally scheduled to be held in September, but it has now been brought forward to begin in August. At the same time, the air force will continue to send planes to French airspace for practice flights in July and August, and plans to conduct other exercises, in order to demonstrate the speed of progress in British air defense equipment and anti-aircraft gun teams. Although the detailed situation is still unknown, it must be widely publicized in advance, to show that this move by Britain has no meaning of panic and chaos, but has a warning nature. Only in this way can Germany clearly understand that an attack on Danzig will cause extremely serious consequences, and thus retreat in the face of difficulty. In addition, Colonel Schwerin, Director of the British Affairs Division of the German Ministry of Defense and military expert, recently came to England for a visit. He is said to have been deeply impressed by the strength of the British Air Force and the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft gun teams. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Franco Fetes Italian Foreign Minister: Franco to Visit Italy in September

(Paris) According to news received here today from Madrid, General Franco has accepted an invitation from Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and is scheduled to visit Rome in September. On his way back, he may also accept an invitation from Hitler to visit Berlin. Italian sources in Madrid also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has stated that if Franco visits Rome, he may later visit Madrid in return. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

San Sebastian, Spain. General Franco hosted Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at the San Telmo Palace last night. Invited to accompany him were members of the cabinet, as well as the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and the Holy See. The gathering was grand and unprecedented. At the end of the banquet, General Franco delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Italy's attitude during the Spanish Civil War was more bright and sincere than other countries that hoped that both sides of the civil war would be harmed, and then reap the benefits. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Spanish nation. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### British Military Expenditure: £730 Million: Budget Passed by the House of Commons: Expresses Determination to Uphold Freedom

(London) During a discussion of the budget in the House of Commons today, Finance Minister Simon stated that the total budget for national defense expenditures this year was previously £580 million, and it was possible that it would increase to £630 million. But in reality, it will now be £730 million. The amount to be borrowed will now reach £500 million, whereas the original plan was £380 million. He believes that issuing treasury bills to raise £150 million is possible. Only a portion of this year's expenses can be covered by current debt. Therefore, at the appropriate time, it is necessary to ask general investors, regardless of size, to actively purchase new national defense bonds. What other country in the world can find £900 million from daily taxes from the accounts owned by Britain? The remaining £500 million borrowed is an amazing figure. The Labor Party's motion of opposition was defeated by 206 votes to 141 votes. The case was passed on its third reading. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

(London) The House of Commons held a meeting today and passed the Finance Bill by a vote of 206 to 141 on its third reading, stipulating that the budget for the fiscal year 1939-40 totals £1.4 billion, of which £900 million should be taken from the state's current revenue, and the income tax rate and other tax rates should be increased to supplement it. The remaining £500 million will be raised by issuing public bonds. The largest expenditure item is national defense expenditure, totaling £730 million. Before the bill was submitted for a vote, Finance Minister Simon attended to explain it and provide reasons for the national defense expenditure, stating, "Our people have all made up their minds that no matter what changes occur in the future, we must have a way to maintain freedom, security, and national strength." Responsible individuals recently stated that the total amount of public bonds issued within this fiscal year can reach a huge £800 million, and the budget required for the next fiscal year is £500 million. Only £200 million of public bonds have been issued so far, and another £600 million can be issued, which is fully sufficient for use. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Soviet-Mongolian Joint Forces Announce Situation on Outer Mongolian Border: Fighting Temporarily Suspended East of the Khalkhyn Gol River: Approximately 3,000 Japanese and Manchukuo Troops Killed in Action: Over 100 Japanese Planes Shot Down

(Moscow) Semi-official sources recently received news from the General Staff of the Outer Mongolian and Soviet troops, stating that the Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese-Manchukuo troops had engaged in intermittent fighting from the 6th to the 12th of this month at Nomonhan and Buthaobo, east of the Khalkhyn Gol River. Previously, the Soviet-Mongolian troops had launched a fierce counterattack on July 5th, driving the Japanese-Manchukuo troops out of Outer Mongolian territory. However, on the morning of July 8th, Japanese-Manchukuo reinforcements arrived, carrying many tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft, and launched an offensive on the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River, invading Outer Mongolian territory. From then until July 12th, fierce battles occurred from time to time on the east bank of the river. The Soviet-Mongolian troops, covered by bomber escorts, repeatedly repelled the enemy and defended their positions. In total, 3,000 Japanese-Manchukuo troops were killed in action, over 3,500 were wounded, and 254 were captured. The Soviet-Mongolian troops captured 4 cannons, 4 tanks, 15 armored vehicles, and 70 machine guns. The Soviet-Mongolian side had 293 killed and 653 wounded. In addition, air battles occurred from July 6th to 12th in the skies over Lake Buir and Nomonhan and Buthaobo. The Soviet-Mongolian aircraft lost 11 aircraft, and 61 Japanese aircraft were shot down, with 12 pilots captured. From May 8th to July 12th, the Soviet-Mongolian aircraft had a total of 52 aircraft destroyed, and as many as 199 Japanese aircraft were shot down. As for the Japanese side's claim that the Soviet-Mongolian troops used poison gas and toxins during the fighting, the General Staff of the Soviet-Mongolian troops denounced it as a complete fabrication, intended to slander. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Soviet Newspaper Publishes Accurate Mongolian-Manchurian Border: Based on Chinese Postal Map

(Moscow) A Soviet newspaper recently published a map of the Lake Buir region and made the following comments: "In order to justify their provocations and seizure actions against the Mongolian People's Republic, the Japanese and Manchurian authorities have designated the Khalkhyn Gol River in official announcements as the border between the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchuria east and southeast of Lake Buir. According to official maps, the actual Mongolian-Manchurian border in that area does not run along the Khalkhyn Gol River. The accurate border is actually along the Kdulat-Vliin-Obo and Nomonhan-Butha-Obo line east of the river. This point is confirmed by the Chinese Postal Map, Map 43 (printed in Beijing in 1919). Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the border of the Mongolian People's Republic has been set in that area. Before the current incident occurred, the Japanese-Manchurian side had not raised any objections to the Mongolian-Manchurian border east of the Khalkhyn Gol River. The claim by the Japanese-Manchurian side that the border runs along the Khalkhyn Gol River is not supported by any official documents. This statement is purely fabricated. The purpose of this new invention by the Japanese army is to justify their provocations and seizure actions. (TASS dispatch, 14th)

### The Soviet Army Fights Bravely: Japan Admits Defeat: Japanese Army Officer Talks About the Situation

(Tokyo) Japanese Army Captain Nohara, returned to this place from the "Manchukuo" Outer Mongolia front line earlier this week. He praised extremely the combat strength of the Soviet army that fought with the Japanese army in the Nomonhan area. He said, "The Soviet army possesses frightening firepower, the Soviet artillery is very good, and there are huge tank formations. The infantry charges very fiercely. Every time they charge, they are accompanied by fifty or sixty Soviet tanks. When they advance, it is like the waves of a storm. When the first batch of tanks is destroyed by our (that is, the Japanese side from now on, the same below) flat-trajectory guns, the first batch of tanks will continue straight toward our army. Our flat-trajectory guns are very effective in shooting. Every three shots fired, one Soviet tank is seen destroyed. Our infantry throw gasoline at the Soviet tanks, resulting in the burning of many tanks. I was initially surprised that our army on the front line needed hundreds of empty soda and beer bottles. After investigation, I learned that these empty bottles were used to hold gasoline to attack Soviet tanks. Soviet bombers are not up to the task, but the machine gunners are skilled at shooting ground troops. I think that the Soviets will soon use more effective aircraft. The weather on the front line is bad. During the day, it is hot up to 130 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, but at night it is very cold. I participated in the Guangzhou campaign, and the weather there was not as bad as in Manchuria and Mongolia, and we had a lot of canned drinks. On the northern plains, I felt a lack of drinks. After returning to Hailar, I found drinking water to be particularly delicious. There are many mosquitoes in the north, like Soviet planes, and they seem to be carrying heavy bombs." (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

### Difficulties Remain in Anglo-Franco-Soviet Talks

(London) Regarding the matter of an Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, a certain prominent figure in the Conservative Party here recently declared that Poland and Turkey are the cornerstones of the anti-aggression front. In the event of war, they will surely receive assistance from the Soviet Union. This aspect is the most important area where the Soviet Union can contribute. Therefore, the formal entry of the Soviet Union into the anti-aggression front is not a critical issue, as the key lies with them, not with us. As for the ongoing Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations, if the Soviet side does not satisfy its own desires and refuses to compromise on the views of Britain and France, then successful negotiations are unlikely. The current obstacles encountered include the following two: (1) the problem of defining "indirect aggression." According to the Soviet view, it may intervene in the internal affairs of the Baltic states in the future, which is unacceptable to the British government. However, it hopes to find a way to protect these countries while preserving their independence and neutrality. (2) The Soviet Union insists on establishing a military agreement before formally signing a mutual assistance agreement, which would delay an agreement of a general nature and is therefore not the proper approach. Conversely, technical talks should be based on the completion of political negotiations. (Havas, 13th)

### Pittman Proposes Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan; US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Begins Discussion; Tokyo Expresses Resentment

(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday introduced a bill authorizing the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan). The bill is scheduled for discussion tomorrow and is being taken very seriously by diplomatic circles here. Supporters of the bill claim that this measure is not to be implemented immediately, but is rather a diplomatic weapon to exert pressure on Japan. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to pass it, but discussions on foreign policy that involve neutrality issues will be extremely heated, as can be foreseen. Furthermore, diplomatic circles are still unaware of what the government will do regarding the repeal of arms embargo provisions. Political circles say that the President may not directly apply to Congress, but will publicly issue a statement explaining the government's attitude towards neutrality and clarifying that the current neutrality laws must be revised before the outbreak of war. At that point, Congress can resolve various legislative issues related to domestic affairs and adjourn, and if international circumstances require it, the President can reconvene Congress within the shortest possible time. (Havas, 13th)

(Tokyo) Political circles here today declared that if the United States bans arms exports to Japan, Japan may take some kind of economic retaliatory measures to counter it. Regarding the proposal submitted by Senator Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, authorizing the President to prohibit any military supplies from being exported to Japan, well-informed sources in Tokyo do not believe that this bill can pass in both houses. They assert that if the United States believes that this can reduce Japan's war-making capabilities, then it is mistaken. Japan and "Manchukuo's" arms industries are advancing rapidly. If the United States implements arms embargo legislation against Japan, it will only strengthen Japan's development of its own military industries. As for oil, Japan is not afraid either. As long as Japan controls the western Pacific, the supply of oil will not be scarce. Moreover, Japan can take certain economic measures to retaliate against the United States, such as stopping the import of 300 million yen worth of American goods each year. At the same time, there are other measures whose result would be to make general relations between the United States and Japan tense. (Haitong, 14th)

### White House Issues Official Statement: No Discrepancies in Government's Views on Neutrality Law

(Washington) A certain American news agency yesterday issued a message stating that there were discrepancies between President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull regarding how the government should act to prompt the Senate to reconsider the issue of revising the Neutrality Law. The White House has issued a public announcement personally signed by the President to various newspapers to deny this, stating, "The news agency has issued a message to various newspapers stating, 'It is heard from government officials that there are discrepancies between President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull regarding how to phrase the message that President Roosevelt intends to send to Congress on the issue of the Neutrality Law.' The headline used by the Washington Times-Herald also stated that the President and Secretary of State disagree on the details of the Neutrality Law issue. In fact, this headline has absolutely no accurate basis, and the message issued by the agency is also not factual. This concerns national policy and should be warned against. It is hoped that newspaper readers will heed this warning. In the past, this news agency has issued inaccurate messages, and this President and the secretaries of the White House have repeatedly urged them to pay attention. Now, they are fabricating facts and escalating their past actions, reaching the extreme of absurdity. It is hoped that public opinion will pay attention to this. Various false messages do not need to be denied one by one by the White House, but in this particular matter, anyone who respects themselves would find it intolerable. Therefore, this President is making this statement in the form of a public announcement and specifically naming the news agency to prevent American newspapers and other news agencies from being lumped together with it." (Havas, 30th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to various newspapers, stating that he is studying with President Roosevelt and the majority leaders of Congress how to resubmit the issue of revising the Neutrality Law for discussion. It is rumored that there are disagreements between him and the President regarding how to prompt Congress to express its attitude, but this is not the case. (It is rumored that the President intends to submit a message of a threatening nature to Congress, but Secretary of State Hull believes that it may not be effective, and there are discussions about their differing opinions.) (Havas, 10th)

### Anglo-Polish Loan to Be Established Soon

(London) Financial circles here recently declared that the financial agreement between Britain, France, and Poland will be signed and established within days. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, economic advisor to the British government, held a final discussion this morning with representatives of the French and Polish governments. The basic terms of the agreement have been finalized and have been submitted to their respective governments for approval. Generally speaking, the Polish government's reply can be delivered here by tomorrow morning. According to well-informed sources, the main points of the agreement are to lend Poland a credit line of £17 million, part of which will be allocated from the British Export Credits Guarantee Department, and the other part will be equally shared by Britain and France to lend to Poland jointly. It is said that the Polish government originally wanted to borrow £40 million, and this £17 million may be the first tranche. If the Polish government has further needs for expanding its military preparations in the future, Britain and France will continue to lend them funds. (Havas, 13th)

(London) The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent reported that the British government will contribute £5 million and the French government £3.5 million to the fund for stabilizing Polish finances, so that Poland can put its troops in a state of mobilization. Britain will also expand its credit line to Poland to £8 million so that Poland can purchase raw materials for military supplies. (Reuters, 14th)

### Danzig Nazi Party Leader Holds Lengthy Talks with Hitler

Danzig A public announcement was issued here today stating that Nazi Party leader Forster and Czyrski yesterday met with German Chancellor Hitler and talked for two and a half hours, discussing the Danzig situation. It is said that Forster reported on the Danzig situation and discussed the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on Monday. Forster and others are expected to return to Danzig today. Hitler instructed them to convey his greetings to the citizens of the Free City. According to non-official sources, Germany has instructed Danzig to make various preparations, and there may be concrete developments soon. (Reuters, 14th)

(Paris) According to official sources here today, by the end of July, the German reserves and armed personnel will reach one million. (Associated Press, 14th)

### US President Orders Expedited Construction of Naval Air Bases; Pravda Urges Soviet Government Authorities to Pay Attention to the Military Importance of the Bering Sea

(New York) President Roosevelt recently issued an order to expedite the construction of naval aviation bases in the following locations: (A) two locations in the Pacific Ocean: (1) Palmyra Atoll, (2) Howland Island, (3) Midway Island; (B) two locations near Alaska: (1) Kodiak Island, (2) Sitka. President Roosevelt believes that these bases are of great importance to national defense, so he ordered the abolition of the eight-hour workday in order to complete the construction as soon as possible. (Haitong, 14th)

(Moscow) Authorities here declared that the Soviet government has not paid sufficient attention to the military importance of the Bering Sea and the sea route through the Bering Strait between the Pacific Ocean. Balaschov, director of the Bering Sea Navigation Bureau, published an article in Pravda today, declaring that the experimental period has ended and that actual development of the Bering Sea route should begin. At the same time, the navy should be trained so that the entire fleet can safely navigate the Arctic Ocean. (Haitong, 14th)

### On the Eve of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations, Anti-British Movement Held in Tokyo; Mass Rally Held in Hibiya Park; Demonstration March to the British Embassy

(Tokyo) A mass anti-British rally was held in Hibiya Park today, with 50,000 participants. Afterwards, about 15,000 people, carrying banners with anti-British slogans, marched to the British Embassy with a musical band leading the way. The Japan Times pointed out that this was the largest demonstration against any foreign country in Japan. At 1:30 p.m., the demonstrators arrived at the British Embassy and saw that the gate was closed and that 500 Japanese police officers were lined up in three rows to provide protection. About 4,000 violent elements threw bricks and banners with anti-British slogans into the embassy compound, repeatedly trying to break in and shouting cheers at the speakers who were inciting the crowd to rush into the embassy, but they were prevented by the police from doing so. The police twice used motorcycles to stop the crowd from breaking through the gate. Most of the demonstrators wore the military uniforms of veterans' associations, and there was one leader wearing a naval uniform. The police initially only tried to prevent them from rushing into the embassy, but after a quarter of an hour, they had to persuade the demonstrators to disperse. As for the staff of the British Embassy, they continued to work as usual, without any signs of disturbance. The resolutions passed at today's anti-British rally included a scathing condemnation of Britain as an enemy of justice and humanity. One hundred and forty members of the Tokyo prefectural and municipal councils divided into five groups and visited Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, the Ministers of the Army and Navy, and British Ambassador Craigie to deliver the resolutions. (Reuters, 14th)

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, after informing the Emperor of the fundamental policies for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations approved by the cabinet, convened a four-and-a-half-hour meeting of senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night to discuss the various situations that may arise during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Currently, national attention is focused on the preliminary talks between Arita and British Ambassador Craigie. The Asahi Shimbun commented on these preliminary talks, saying that if the British side does not show sincerity in changing its Far East policy, then efforts to resolve secondary issues such as the Tianjin incident will definitely fail. It is heard that both English and Japanese will be used during the talks. Currently, the staff of the British Embassy are working actively to cope with the great pressure they will encounter. This morning, three Japanese delegations went to the British Embassy to deliver protests against British East Asia policy. In the afternoon, after the mass rally in Hibiya Park, they marched to the British Embassy. Secretary Brian of the British Embassy received five Japanese representatives, who presented a lengthy resolution in the name of seven million citizens of Tokyo, demanding that Britain return its concessions to China and withdraw from the Far East. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today at a press conference that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked British Ambassador Craigie to meet with Arita at the Foreign Minister's official residence tomorrow morning for preliminary talks before holding a formal meeting on the Tianjin situation. The spokesperson declined to announce the details of the preliminary talks, saying that newspaper reports were purely speculative. When a reporter asked whether the decisions of the Anglo-Japanese conference would have a binding effect on the Japanese army in North China, the spokesperson replied that the negotiations were being held by the two governments. When asked whether the "provisional government" in North China was bound by this decision, the spokesperson replied, "The 'provisional government' has nothing to do with this negotiation." The spokesperson also replied to a reporter's question that the anti-British rallies across the country were purely spontaneous. (Reuters, 14th)

### The Future of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations is Bleak

(London) Official sources here have not yet received formal information about the opening date of the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo. Official sources are keeping silent about the possibility of Britain protesting to Japan about the anti-British movement in Qingdao, but the general impression is that Britain will warn the Japanese government of the impact of this anti-British riot on the Tokyo conference. The Daily Herald reported that if the demands made by Japan to Britain are as stated in the Japanese semi-official news, then these negotiations will be in darkness from the start. The Daily Mail said that Japan's war against China has failed. If we refuse to cooperate with them in China, Japan will not have the problem of fighting against Britain. If Japan risks doing so, then we can destroy its economic structure, but Japan will not push its demands to this point. (Reuters, 14th)

### American Authorities Closely Monitoring

(Washington) Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the anti-British movement that is sweeping across Japan, believing that it is completely instigated by the Japanese government. Since the Japanese government is still able to control the parliament, it is not possible that it lacks the ability to control these activities. Therefore, diplomatic circles generally believe that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will not have good results. In other words, after the failure of the Anglo-Japanese conference, the general interests of foreigners in the Far East will obviously deteriorate. Therefore, it is recognized here that due to the deterioration of the situation, the US Senate may change its attitude and tend to adopt Pittman's proposal to ban the export of arms to violators of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press, 14th)

### Tokyo Newspaper Comments on Threats to Britain

(Tokyo) The "Japan Times," which has close ties to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an editorial today commenting on the future Anglo-Japanese talks, declaring that if the Anglo-Japanese talks do not take into account the general sentiment of the Japanese people, then there is no hope of any success. Japan has mobilized more than one million people and spent more than one billion yen to establish a "new order" in the Far East. Diplomatic negotiations that do not take these facts into account will inevitably fail completely. Political circles attach great importance to this editorial, as the newspaper has always advocated Anglo-Japanese understanding. Now, on the eve of the start of the negotiations, it has also published such strong remarks, which reflects the views of the Japanese officialdom. (Haitong, 14th)

### Ambassador Kerr Remains on Duty; British Officialdom Denies Japanese Rumors

(London) Official sources here deny the Japanese rumors that British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Kerr has resigned and that his resignation has been approved, saying that this statement is purely a fabrication and has no basis whatsoever. (Reuters, 14th)

### US Purchase Price of Foreign Silver Unchanged

(Washington) The Treasury Department reduced the purchase price of foreign silver to 35 cents per ounce a few days ago. Today, it maintained this price and announced that it would not change it for the time being. (Havas, 13th)

Bombay The current strength of the Bombay silver market is mostly due to active replenishment by the short side. In the past half month, the mainland has absorbed an average of 160 bars of spot silver per day, but this number cannot be sustained for long during the monsoon season at current prices. According to well-informed sources, silver prices have now risen, and if the United States does not support them, market prices will inevitably gradually fall. (Reuters, 13th)

### Japan's "Anti-British" Activities in North China Aim to Monopolize the Market; Poorly Written Leaflets Posted Throughout the Streets; Generally Recognized as Worthless

The Zilin Daily's North Ping Communication of July 6 stated: The reporter was seized by a whim, spending the entire morning studying the anti-British leaflets distributed by the Japanese in Ping. The reporter had various experiences with Japanese propaganda, knowing in advance that it was a pure waste of effort. The Japanese propaganda is ineffective worldwide, and often causes the exact opposite of what they intend to promote. It is difficult to imagine something more foolish than these anti-British leaflets. The wording and content are laughable, and more harmful to the Japanese than to the British. First, the leaflets are written in very clumsy Chinese, with many sentences that are difficult to understand. They often use very obscure words that passers-by would not know. It is easy to find Japanese-style Chinese in the leaflets, with a "de" after every word. Why can't the Japanese leave this work to experienced Chinese people? The wording makes it seem written first by the Japanese, then translated word for word with a dictionary, or at least written by the Chinese, then edited by the Japanese. The content is childish and ridiculous. Besides criticizing Britain for helping General Chiang Kai-shek and protecting evil people in the British concession, the other crimes of Britain are just cursing. The Opium War is mentioned, but only in passing. This is not surprising, since the trade in drugs is the most prosperous business in North China today. The conclusions of the leaflets are just rampant abuse. The authors must have gotten so upset that they became disheartened and called out to "unite together to oppose British activities." The leaflets are unfocused, shallow, and odd. As anti-British propaganda, they are worthless, but as anti-Japanese propaganda, they are very effective. The Japanese are broadly advertising Anglo-Soviet aid to General Chiang Kai-shek, and the reporter is surprised. Japanese soldiers should broadcast these accusations in Japan, because their army and navy still cannot conquer China after two years, and they need to find excuses to satisfy the Japanese people. Broadcasting this information will only excite the Chinese people and let them know that this is very helpful to the Japanese. The Chinese people know that the real government is led by General Chiang Kai-shek, not pro-Japanese leaders, so the Japanese are not benefiting from this anti-British propaganda.

The mainland newspaper reported that a certain foreigner, who had lived in Qingdao for a long time, recently came to Shanghai from North China. Yesterday, on the 12th, he told the reporter that the British Consulate and British banks in Qingdao were stoned and attacked, which was the direct result of anti-British instigation under the Japanese. The unfortunate events against British interests in Qingdao will continue to occur. The recent strike against the British was in the form of special shipping regulations, which use sanitation as a pretext to require ships from Hong Kong and other ports to Qingdao to be quarantined for 24 hours for inspection. One British ship was forced to stay there for three days before being allowed to disembark. Another anti-British means was initiated by the water supply bureau of the puppet regime of the islands, which stated that water would not be supplied to foreign houses in the coastal area this year. Most of these houses are owned by British Chinese from all over China. At the same time, the demonstrations in the city, which started in early June, have reached their "peak" in the past few weeks. In addition to hiring coolies to march, the Japanese forced all Chinese, Japanese and Russian newspapers to engage in this movement. The New People's Newspaper, controlled by the Japanese, recently urged its readers to implement the following eight procedures: (1) investigate all kinds of British goods; (2) use skin paper to print "Do not buy or sell British goods" and distribute leaflets with anti-British slogans; (3) make everyone stop buying and selling British goods; (4) implement and expand the anti-British movement; (5) write to other cities and encourage the public to hold anti-British conferences; (6) organize anti-British groups; (7) post anti-British slogans everywhere; (8) print a list of British goods and distribute it to the public so they know which items not to buy. On June 29, Qingdao was full of these slogans, and many were pasted on the walls of the British Consulate. At the entrance of the Japanese Residents Association, there was a large cloth banner with the words "Do not discuss business with British banks and businesses." The leaflets all attacked the British, such as "For the happiness of the Chinese people, British interests must be destroyed," "Britain must change its policy in China," "Britain hinders the establishment of a new order," "Eliminate British capital," "Britain must immediately stop supporting Chiang," and so on. On a certain day scheduled for the anti-British conference, the Japanese went door-to-door to mobilize the people to attend the conference. Some Japanese yarn factories took a half-day holiday and claimed that workers could attend.

### North China's People are Very Aware of the Close Relationship Between China and Britain; Most Do Not Participate in the "Anti-British" Activities Instigated by Some Party

Tianjin Communication, some party is actively intensifying the "anti-British movement" in the occupied areas, attempting to post slogans, march and speak, and trying to incite. However, the true Chinese people have a deep understanding of the friendly friendship between China and Britain, and they have not been moved even in deep water. According to foreign travelers who have recently returned from various parts of North China, the situation in various places is summarized as follows:

Beijing

Some party-run newspapers in North China continue to attack Britain, sparing no effort, and even claiming that they secretly supply bandits and disturb public security. However, the residents have long seen through their roles and do not believe them.

Qingdao

The demonstrations in front of the British Consulate a few days ago were all carried out by Japanese ruffians who gathered hooligans and were quickly stopped and dispersed. Anti-British slogans were pasted everywhere, but the Chinese people, considering the intentions of the instigators and the friendship with Britain, did not take action. Therefore, the effect was minimal.

Shanxi

A missionary returning from Shanxi talked about the anti-British movement in North China, which was clearly initiated by a certain party. In fact, it has been repeatedly discovered that certain party members have participated in the vandalism of church property and the intimidation of missionaries. Churches and chapels were plastered with anti-British symbols, and there were even proposals to return to the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. However, the public has a high level of knowledge, so they are not moved.

According to reports from those who have personally experienced various places this time, apart from the unstable elements bought by a certain party, taking advantage of the situation, (for example, in Xiamen, the Taiwanese overseas Chinese organized an anti-British comrades association), the Chinese people have no so-called anti-British sentiment. Because Britain has provided a lot of assistance to China's economic construction in recent years, they disdain such despicable acts and are unwilling to participate.

### Manchuria is Japan's Heavy Burden

— Bo Ming

The author of the following article, using the pseudonym Guzo Hakwaisba, likely writing under a false name, elaborates in detail on how Japan has not gained even a small profit from seizing Manchuria, but instead has increased its heavy burden. This is indeed one of the major mistakes made by the militarists. He uses numbers to prove his arguments, which is not mere empty talk. From this, it can be seen that this time the militarists' war against China is repeating previous mistakes. The article was published in this issue of the *Millard's Review*, and is translated here, hoping it will be of interest to those who care about the current situation.

Translator

Japan's economic exhaustion has gradually arrived. Its cause is not only the current fighting south of the Great Wall of China but also the increasing burden faced by the Japanese militarists ruling Manchuria. When the war against China broke out in July 1937, Japan was already struggling due to the expenses in Manchuria, spending nearly 500 million yen annually for the past six years. Those expenses used for railways and various industries are listed as "investment," but this can only deceive fools. The railways built are mostly for military purposes, often running parallel to existing routes. Dividends paid are few, or even non-existent. For most of the railways, they are generally unlikely to ever be profitable unless some accounting tricks are used to make losses look like profits. However, these railways enable the Japanese army to transport troops from one area to another, constantly fighting against Chinese guerrillas. The new ports in northern Korea are used for the rapid deployment of Japanese troops from the mainland.

The railways are not only for military use against China but can also be used against the Soviet Union if necessary. The Japanese militarists, on the surface, bravely bluster and act arrogantly toward the Soviet Union, but secretly they are very afraid. Since being greatly alarmed last year and being forced to cede Zhanggufeng to the Soviet Union, the Japanese militarists have become even more fearful. To avoid being looked down upon by the Western powers and the Chinese, they are forced to maintain a provocative attitude. This is just empty talk, as they carefully avoid provoking a real war. "Border incidents" have occurred dozens of times. If the militarists really wanted war, each incident could be used as an excuse to launch an attack. However, the Japanese militarists certainly do not want to fight the Soviet Union. Fortunately for Japan, the Soviet Union also does not want to engage in direct, large-scale warfare with Japan.

### The Beginning of Soviet-Japanese Friction

However, this friction with the Soviet Union is the most unfortunate result of Japan's actions. The deteriorating relations with the Soviet Union are the most foolish actions of the Japanese militarists. For several years after the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty in 1925, there were very friendly relations between the two governments. The friendship between the Soviet Union and Japan was most evident under the Japanese civilian governments from 1925 to 1927 and from 1929 to 1931, but the militarists also followed a friendly policy. When the Fengtian government tried to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union in 1929, the South Manchuria Railway refused to allow the Chinese side to use its railway lines and vehicles to transport troops against the Soviet Union. In early 1932, when the Japanese and Manchurian armies began to fight fiercely, the Soviet Union allowed the Japanese side to use the Chinese Eastern Railway to repay the previous favor. Army Minister Araki Sadao advocated a close and friendly understanding with the Soviet Union. The Kokumin Domei, the military fascist party of Adachi Kenzo, openly advocated a new Soviet-Japanese alliance. Friendly exchanges of officers between the Japanese and Soviet armies were also common for a long time, until they ended in 1938.

In 1933, Japan's attempt to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway destroyed the previous friendly relations with the Soviet Union. This was a truly foolish endeavor, and a direct result of the Japanese army's arrogance after invading Manchuria. Even before that, some Japanese militarists and diplomats excessively vilified the Soviet Union, constantly harming the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. They naturally falsely claimed that Japan was the "bulwark against communism" in the Far East, creating a favorable impression on the dull conservatives in the West and gaining support for the Japanese militarists' aggression. In the West, Hitler used the same pretext to gain the support of the conservatives. (To be continued)

### Chinese Troops Capture Quanjiao

Quanjiao Correspondence: Quanjiao, 60 li from Pukou Station on the Jinpu Railway, was completely recovered by the Chinese army's Gao Senting unit at noon on the 10th. The Japanese army's Taniyoshi and Ozaki units were bravely driven out by the Chinese army. Puzhenpu was also recovered. The newly arrived Japanese troops in Quanjiao County suffered 67 deaths, with twice as many wounded.

### Overview of Higher Education Students Nationwide (2)

Significant Decrease in Student Numbers After the Outbreak of War

Wartime Situation

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Beiping, a city with cultural history, was first threatened. The fourteen universities and colleges in Beiping City failed to fully open. The seven universities and colleges in Tianjin and Baoding were soon destroyed. As the Shanghai war broke out and the war zone gradually expanded, most of the universities and colleges in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and the provinces and cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin, except for a few that tried to relocate or maintain operations with difficulty, were forced to shut down. The original sites of most schools were destroyed, and compatriots were displaced to other provinces. Due to the impact of the war, drastic changes occurred in the field of education. The increase or decrease in the number of students in universities and colleges in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) is very obvious. Except for some schools that have been suspended, such as National Shandong University, Provincial Anhui University, Provincial Shanxi University, Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College, Hebei Provincial Agricultural College, Hebei Provincial Medical College, Wusong Merchant Marine College, Shanxi Provincial Industrial College, Shanxi Provincial Commercial College, Shanxi Provincial Agricultural College, Shandong Provincial Rural Construction College, Beiping Municipal Physical Education College, Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College, and more than ten other schools, as well as schools where the survey was incomplete, such as Provincial Qiqin University, Private Qilu University, National Pharmaceutical College, and more than ten other schools, and four newly established and newly approved schools, where a comparison before and after is impossible, we can compare the number of students in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) with the number of students in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) in 70 schools such as National Central University to see the impact of the unprecedented catastrophe on Chinese culture. Among these 70 schools, those with an increase in the number of students in the 26th year compared to the 25th year were only National Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Northeastern University, Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, Provincial Chongqing University, Guangxi University, Gansu College, Sichuan Provincial College, Private Datong University, Wuchang China University, Guangzhou University, West China Union University, Xiangya Medical College, Lianzuo Engineering College, Fujian College, Wuchang Art College, and Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, a total of 21 schools. Among them, the schools with the largest increase in the number of students were National Yunnan University and Provincial Chongqing University, both exceeding the number of students in the 25th year by more than double. The next were National Sichuan University, Wuhan University, and Private Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, all exceeding the number of students in the 25th year by more than nine-tenths. However, the number of schools with a decrease in the number of students in the 26th year is also alarming. Private Guanghua University and Wuxi National Studies College both decreased by more than five-sevenths of the number of students in the 25th year. Private Jinling University decreased by more than seven-tenths of the number of students in the 25th year. The number of students in National Southwest Associated University in the 26th year, compared with the former National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Private Nankai University in the 25th year, and the number of students in National Northwest Associated University in the 26th year, compared with the former National Beiping University, Beiping Normal University, and National Beiyang Institute of Technology in the 25th year, both decreased by more than one-half. Others, such as Private Fudan University, Great China University, Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Law College, Shanghai Chih Tze College, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, Soochow University, Shanghai Art College, and Private Xinhua Art College, all had a decrease of more than one-half in the number of students in the 26th year compared to the number of students in the 25th year. In total, the 70 schools, including National Central University, had a total of 32,888 students in the 25th year and 25,746 students in the 26th year, a decrease of 7,142 students. Looking at the increase or decrease in the number of students in each school in the 26th year, it can be seen that inland schools, such as National Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Provincial Guangxi University, Chongqing University, Private West China Union University, and Sichuan Provincial Education College, all had a sudden increase in the number of students. Schools that moved from the war zone to the interior, such as National Central University and Northeastern University, also had an increase in the number of students. On the contrary, schools in the war zone and schools that moved out of the war zone later had a sharp decrease in the number of students. From this, it can be inferred that the total number of university and college students nationwide in the 26th year must be less than that in the 25th year. During this incident, countless young people in China lost the opportunity to continue their studies due to their hometowns becoming war zones, displacement to other places, and economic hardship. This is not only China's misfortune but also a major obstacle to the development of world culture. However, the relocation of various schools has been settled in the 27th year, and the situation is better. The current academic year has just ended, and student statistics have not yet been compiled. Now, we can only compare the number of students in the 25th and 26th years.

### New Buildings for Refugee Children's Nurseries and Orphanages Approaching Completion; Fundraising via Radio Broadcast by Board Members

Since its establishment in September of last year, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Nursery and Orphanage initially only accommodated 16 refugee children. Subsequently, with the enthusiasm of all sectors of society for sponsorship and adoption, and through the efforts of Chen Jicheng, the director of the orphanage, the number was continuously increased to 300. The orphanage's affairs are developing day by day, and the management is extremely effective.

The educational philosophy emphasizes both education and vocational skills training. The results of the implementation over the past year have been excellent, and all sectors of society have continued to provide assistance. Everything is being implemented step by step. Due to the small size of the orphanage's site, only simple and easy-to-implement vocational training can be carried out. Other major subjects cannot be offered. Therefore, the orphanage has found a site in Lane 258, Wuding Road, at the intersection of Mett Hess Road, in the Public Concession, to build 28 new orphanage buildings. Construction began in April of this year and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The orphanage is now increasing the number of refugee children to the full quota of 500 and expanding vocational training. It will also attach a daycare center and a maternity hospital for refugee women, specifically for refugee women who cannot afford to raise their children, and provide care for their infants. However, the cost of various equipment is very high. With the increase in the number of children, the educational expenses have increased sharply. Even with the adoption of refugee children at six yuan per month for food and clothing, and the donation of educational expenses at two yuan per month per child, and the adoption of infants in daycare centers at ten yuan per month per child, monthly expenses will inevitably increase. Therefore, starting yesterday (the 14th), Yuan Ludeng, Xu Guanqun, Chen Jicheng, Tao Leqin, and others will broadcast fundraising appeals for the expansion of educational expenses on Tianchan Radio and Mingyuan Radio. Today (the 15th), Zhou Bangjun, Lin Kanghou, Lu Wenshao, and Yu Qiaqing will broadcast fundraising appeals on Sino-Western Radio and Friends Radio.

### Examination for the Seventh Session of Government-Funded Students Studying in the UK Extended to Three Days; Examination Site in Shanghai at Sino-Western Girls' High School

The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee has decided to select 26 government-funded students to study in the UK for the seventh session this year. This year's academic focus is on industrial specialties. The examination date was originally scheduled for the 23rd and 24th of this month. However, because the number of applicants in Chongqing and Shanghai is much higher than in previous years, the examination date has been changed to the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, to be held separately. The examination venues in Chongqing, Kunming, Hong Kong, and Shanghai have been separately decided by the committee. The examination venue in Chongqing is Chongqing University, the examination venue in Kunming is Yunnan University, the examination venue in Hong Kong is Hong Kong University, and the examination venue in Shanghai is Sino-Western Girls' High School. The persons in charge in various places have begun active preparations. The committee has already internally decided on the invigilators and will formally announce them in the coming days.

### Four Universities in Chengdu Complete Enrollment in Shanghai; Examination Papers to be Graded in Shanghai

Chengdu's Jinling University, Jinling Women's University, Qilu University, and West China University jointly enrolled new students in Shanghai this summer and completed the examinations on the 13th. The number of applicants was considered quite large, and there were eight or nine female students, indicating a good trend of Shanghai youth going to the interior. Initially, it was planned to seal the examination papers and send them to Chengdu for grading and announcement. However, because there were too many examination papers, it was inconvenient to send them by airmail and there was fear of loss, leaving no basis for grading. After a resolution in Chengdu, it was decided to hire Professors Bates, Liu Chongben, Huang Mingli, Tian Guansheng, Zhao Chuanjia, and others in Shanghai to grade the papers and determine the selection. At the same time, the admitted students can start their journey early. It is said that the results will be announced in Shanghai next week.

### Summer Classes at Refugee Relief Association's Free Primary Schools Suspended

The summer remedial classes for refugee children's primary schools and various free primary schools affiliated with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Department were scheduled to start on the 20th of this month. It is now learned that the refugee schools in the various reception centers of the association will still start classes on the original date, but the various free primary schools have been decided to be suspended due to various problems. Notifications have been sent separately. However, the establishment of free primary schools in the next semester is currently being planned for expansion.

### Job Opportunities for Specialized Talents from Schools

Since the outbreak of the war, various levels of schools in the interior have moved to Shanghai to continue classes. However, they feel considerable difficulty in finding jobs for graduating students, making it difficult to recommend positions. This is a common concern for educators. It is learned that a certain large factory intends to expand due to business development and is specifically seeking: (1) engineers or technical instructors (capable of manufacturing motors, glass, nitric acid, sodium silicate, durable materials, candles, soap, etc.); (2) technicians (manufacturing machine tools, tools, and certain types of machinery, such as pipe making, brewing, textile machinery, etc.). The qualified technical talents must have received specialized education, have practical experience, and be able to work hard. Specialized school students who meet the above conditions and are interested in applying can bring two 2.5-inch headshots and supporting documents to Room 208, 2nd Floor, 80 Hualong Road, between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM and between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day for preliminary registration. Those who meet the requirements will be contacted for an interview. The future treatment is generous. This is truly good news for specialized talents seeking employment.

### School News

### Depositing in Foreign Banks - Economists Vigorously Refute the Fallacy - Buying Foreign Exchange is Especially Unwise - Investing in the Mainland is a Proper Method

Chongqing, 13th. Since the Tianjin Concession incident, the Japanese puppets, in order to achieve their expected sinister goals, have spared no effort in creating various rumors to shake the minds of the Chinese people. The general public is inevitably deceived, resulting in a rush to withdraw deposits and buy foreign exchange in Shanghai. In order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the financial authorities have specially stipulated restrictions on withdrawals and deposits. Since the implementation of this method, the Shanghai financial market has stabilized. However, it is heard that a small number of depositors have not yet truly understood the interests of the country and themselves, and are still withdrawing money to deposit in foreign banks. A reporter met an economic expert yesterday and asked for his opinion. He made the following remarks:

Speculators Fabricate Rumors

Shanghai has long been established as the financial and commercial center of the country. Chinese and foreign merchants gather, and trade in various industries is prosperous. Speculators lurk among them, and they often fabricate rumors to seek profit, not only in speculating on foreign exchange. Considering the history of Shanghai for decades, the harm caused by capitalists and speculators manipulating rumors is countless. Moreover, recently, Japanese and puppet elements have been rampant in Shanghai, and their tricks of spreading rumors have been used to the extreme. Their intention is not only to disrupt China's finances but to destroy legitimate Chinese and foreign businesses. It is regrettable that the Chinese people are deceived by them.

Legal Tender is Solid, Foreign Exchange is Stable

However, China's legal tender is stable and will never be destroyed by rumor-mongers. Even if it is slightly affected for a while, it is like clouds obscuring the sun and moon. In an instant, the wind dissipates, the clouds scatter, and the sun and moon shine brightly. Similarly, managing foreign exchange is a necessary measure for a country during wartime. The Chinese government, for legitimate needs, still sells it at the statutory price of one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter once approved, and does not change due to the decline in speculative market prices. The fixed value of China's legal tender can be seen here. Furthermore, according to China's issuance system, 60% is cash reserve and 40% is security reserve. The high percentage of cash reserve is the highest in the world.

Actual Reserve Exceeds Japan

Although the foreign exchange position under the cash reserve is inevitably slightly in deficit due to the purchase of essential supplies for the war of resistance and the maintenance of the market, the foreign exchange reserves such as government purchases, foreign exchange settlements by exporters, collection of gold and silver, absorption of overseas remittances, and repeated loans from the United Kingdom and the United States have been enriched and increased one after another. According to various aspects of research, the current reserve situation is definitely not below the currency reserve of general countries, and it far exceeds Japan's reserve. Therefore, the credibility of the currency and the thickness of its strength compared with the legal tender of other countries are already obvious. Therefore, the general public who doubt the legal tender and compete to buy foreign exchange must be ignorant of the general trend of the world economy and have gone astray to reduce their own security, which is truly regrettable.

Foreign Banks are Not Entirely Reliable

A part of the Chinese people, due to their low level of education, often neglect to examine the general economic situation of the world. Therefore, they lack judgment and self-confidence. They believe that foreign banks must be reliable. In fact, judging from the international situation and past history, depositing in foreign banks is definitely more harmful than beneficial. First of all, in terms of interest, foreign banks have meager interest rates, and sometimes even require handling fees. As for the safety issue, during the European War, the economies of various countries were extremely panic-stricken, and banks went bankrupt every day. Even the richest country in the world, the United States, has also suffered from the collapse of many banks due to economic panic. Now, the world situation is tense, and war is imminent. In the event of an unfortunate outbreak, the countries may have various management methods for bank funds. At that time, how can you withdraw money? Seeking perfection will only lead to damage, and there will be no time for regret. Moreover, citing past examples, the bankruptcy and suspension of foreign banks in China are also common. The victimized Chinese people want to get everything, but end up with nothing. We hope that people will seriously examine this point.

Domestic Banks Have Outstanding Credit

And to briefly talk about the benefits of depositing in domestic banks, based on the principle of safeguarding personal interests and increasing the strength of the war of resistance, it is most appropriate for Chinese people to deposit their funds in domestic banks. Although China's banking industry started relatively late, the government authorities' strict examination, the stability of the currency system, and the proper maintenance of national banks, the banks themselves, due to the layers of supervision in business, have to be extra cautious in their operations. In terms of interest rates, the spirit of mutual assistance among the Chinese people is also more generous than that of foreign banks. Moreover, the public can always pay attention to and understand the actual situation, and deposits are easily safe. In the two years of the war of resistance, thanks to the financial authorities' effective deployment, China's monetary system is strong, not only is the social finance stable as usual, and the national economy is unshakable, but it has not affected the interests of the people in the slightest, and it can do its best to protect depositors.

Buying Foreign Exchange is the Most Unwise

At present, some ignorant people are buying foreign exchange with legal tender that has consolidated credit, which is a pity because they are suffering losses for no reason. They do not know that the government still supplies foreign exchange at the statutory price for legitimate needs, and it can be purchased at any time as long as the reason is legitimate. Now, some people are exchanging foreign exchange at a market price of more than six pence with legal tender worth one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter. They are not only wrongfully reducing their financial resources by eight pence, but also losing their generous interest. There is nothing more unwise than this. Moreover, the market price of foreign exchange is volatile and changes at any time. Recalling the past 20 years, one pound sterling once converted into more than seven Chinese dollars, and one US dollar once converted into more than nine Chinese cents. Now that the world situation is critical, such past events may reappear. All my compatriots should learn from the past and know the future, why should they suffer this loss? I have to offer this advice based on what I have seen.

Investing in the Mainland Can Yield High Profits

Furthermore, now that the Japanese are blockading the ports, the production and construction enterprises in the rear are suddenly booming, and there are excellent opportunities for the use of national capital. If they can invest in the mainland's production enterprises, not only can they obtain high profits for themselves, but also make the entire financial system active, and their contribution to the country and the nation is no less than that of the soldiers at the front. Now that the war of resistance has reached the final stage, and the path to national survival and final victory has been taken for the most part, how should our compatriots complete this great task and lay the foundation for this peaceful and prosperous life? It is extremely important. From the perspective of economics, I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to the loss and danger of transferring deposits to foreign banks and buying foreign exchange. I dare not remain silent, and I will not be bothered by trivial matters. I will briefly offer a word of advice to my compatriots.

### Zhoujiazui Island - Foreigners' Property Completely Destroyed - The Japanese Side Only Agrees to Compensate for a Portion of the Loss - Only 13% of the Original Property Value

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, foreigners who formerly resided on Zhoujiazui Island, are still hoping for compensation from the Japanese side for the seizure and destruction of their property on the island. Recent meetings have continued to consider the Japanese side's offer to compensate for a portion of the loss. It is reported that some Germans residing on the island have accepted only a portion of the compensation for their losses, but others are unlikely to do so. The Japanese side's offer does not include movable property, and the value of movable property is the largest in various compensation claims. Several foreigners have seen military trucks transport movable property. All items in the bungalows of foreigners residing on the island, including refrigerators and automobiles, were seized by Japanese soldiers. Those that were not taken away were destroyed. The Japanese side's offer also does not include ships. One of them, formerly the fire boat of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, has recently been seen being used by the Japanese military as a scrap ship. When the war broke out, there were quite a few foreigners residing on the island, and there were beautiful bungalows and cottages sufficient for living. Relatively speaking, the cost of building these houses was not high. The valuable part of the property was decorations, furniture, and personal items. Many of them had electricity, refrigerators, and radios. And personal items were all placed in bungalows. It is reported that the current offer from the Japanese side is only for "immovable property" that was confiscated and used, not for the items that were seized in October of the previous year. The compensation price requested by the foreigners is calculated in gold pounds. According to the current exchange rate, the Japanese side's offer is only 13% of the property value. It is found that the foreigners withdrew from the island around August 17 and 18 of the previous year. Later, some of them managed to return to the island to retrieve a few items and found that their property was still intact. However, since the beginning of October, foreigners saw three Japanese military trucks, under the command of (military officers), carrying furniture and personal items. They confirmed that their property was also being transported. When they questioned the Japanese military officers about this, they replied that they were very sorry for the slight misconduct of their subordinates and would strictly restrain them in the future. Later, Major General Simalett, commander of the British army stationed in Shanghai, arranged for foreigners to visit the island. He had obtained a pass signed by the Japanese army and navy authorities here. However, the foreigner's party, with a total of 50 cars, was blocked by a Japanese acting sergeant at the Dinghai Road Bridge. A certain foreigner's car arrived there earlier and managed to drive past the Japanese sentry and arrived at his bungalow. He saw two Japanese soldiers using bayonets to pierce his boxes and take all the items in the boxes in front of the foreigner. Then, they politely bowed to the foreigner and left. Soon, a Japanese patrol soldier arrested the foreigner, escorted him to the mainland, and detained him for one and a half hours. After deciding that he was not a dangerous person, they sent him back to the bungalow. When he returned, the foreigner found that his car had been stolen when he was detained. In the middle of this year, the Japanese side allowed a group of foreigners on the island to inspect their property. They saw a tragic scene on the island. The bungalows were dilapidated and there was nothing complete. All that was left were pieces of paper and personal photos. A certain foreigner's wartime command power and medals were also lost. It is heard that the Japanese side once claimed that the foreigner's movable property was taken away by the Chinese, but the foreigners knew that everything was done by the Japanese army. However, the foreigners decided to leave the island at that time. The newspaper office submitted a request for full compensation for all property according to the exchange rate of 14 pence per pound.

### Unified Discount Payment - Securities Rebound Sharply - Shanghai's Six Installment Payments Changed to Remittance - Date Set for Eighth Principal Repayment Lottery - Government Maintains Creditworthiness and All Sectors Admire

Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15 regarding the method of repayment of various customs-guaranteed debts, in order to maintain creditworthiness, it transferred to the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, to discount the principal and interest due on the seventh installment of the unified public debt due at the end of July and pay it in Chongqing. Shanghai and other ports will handle it in six installments. The details are as follows:

Cash Payment in Chongqing

The four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, are willing to handle the principal and interest of the five types of bonds, A, B, C, D, and E, of the "Unified" Public Debt due at the end of July. After the discount payment is made, all payment methods have been formulated. From July 31, the Central Bank of China's Chongqing head office and its entrusted China and Communications banks will make payments. Shanghai and other places will be paid in six installments, each installment lasting one month. It is heard that Chongqing will pay in full, and in cash. In Shanghai, because it has fallen, in order to prevent the inflow of huge amounts of legal tender, it is heard that it will be changed to remittance. This remittance is the Shanghai universal remittance note.

Payment Method

When the bondholder applies for the principal and interest payment, he should fill in the application form for the discount voucher. The number of bonds to be received in each period should be calculated to the nearest cent. If the number of bonds is less than one cent, it should be included in the sixth period for calculation. For example, a ten-dollar interest coupon of the unified public debt should be paid two jiao, eight fen, and five li. Averaging it by six, the value of each period is four fen and seven and a half li. The five seven and a half li from the first to the fifth period are included in the sixth period for calculation. Then the first five periods should be paid four fen, and the last period should be paid eight fen and five li. It is also stipulated that one form should be filled out for each household, with the household name as the unit.

Handled by Three Banks

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the banking sector yesterday and learned that after the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, discounted the seventh installment of the unified public debt due for payment, regarding the payment agency, according to Article 8 of the regulations, "The repayment of principal and interest of this public debt is designated to be managed by the Central Bank of China and its entrusted Bank of China and Communications Bank." The public debt ticket is divided into four types: five thousand yuan, one thousand yuan, one hundred yuan, and ten yuan. The interest rate is set at 6% per year. The repayment period is 12 years for type A, 15 years for type B, 18 years for type C, 21 years for type D, and 24 years for type E.

Eight Lotteries

The National Debt Fund Management Committee has stipulated the dates for the eighth lottery for the repayment of principal of the five types of unified public debt, A, B, C, D, and E. (1) Type A, August 10, 25 draws, principal repayment of 3.75 million yuan. (2) Type B, September 10, 10 draws, principal repayment of 1.5 million yuan. (3) Type C, October 9, 8 draws, principal repayment of 1.75 million yuan. (4) Type D, November 10, 8 draws, principal repayment of 4.4 million yuan. (5) Type E, December 10, 8 draws, principal repayment of 2.08 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year. The interest payment for the eighth installment of the five types totals 41.90016 million yuan.

Price Soars

In the Shanghai securities gray market, due to the Ministry of Finance's maintenance of creditworthiness, the unified debt due at the end of July was discounted and paid by the four banks, and the various unified debt rebounded sharply. The price has stabilized since yesterday. At the close, unified type A was 50 yuan, eight jiao, and five fen, up six jiao and five fen; type B was 50 yuan, three jiao, and five fen, up five jiao and five fen; type C was 48 yuan and eight jiao, up five jiao; type D was 48 yuan and five fen, up four jiao and five fen; type E was 48 yuan and five jiao, up six jiao and five fen. It is also heard that the unified debt is the most circulating in the Chinese domestic debt market.

Order Arrives Soon

Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the unified public debt, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired again with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China yesterday. Although it has not received a formal order from the Ministry of Finance, the method reported yesterday is confirmed to be reliable. Also, the discount payment method of the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, was formulated by the Central Bank of China in Shanghai. However, private parties have received telegrams from Chongqing and Hong Kong to confirm it. It is heard that the official order from the Ministry of Finance will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Also, the payment of the Restoration Public Debt due on August 31 will be announced by the ministry at that time.

### Collateral for Foreign Exchange Transfer and Withdrawal: Hiring Experts for Evaluation; Dividing into Three Groups: Real Estate, Securities, and Goods; Establishing an Inspection Committee for Implementation

The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Association will begin handling foreign exchange transfer and withdrawal matters for fellow banks from July 4th. Various banks and firms have successively provided collateral, which will be reviewed and evaluated by the association. Based on 70% of the evaluated value, they can withdraw foreign exchange transfers from the association. This collateral is divided into (1) major goods, (2) marketable securities and stocks, and (3) profitable real estate within the concessions. Experts are hired for the evaluation of each type of collateral. The association originally had an evaluation committee consisting of three groups: real estate, securities and stocks, and goods. Recently, due to the expansion of affairs, more evaluation committee members have been hired for each group, making the organization more complete. A Foreign Exchange Transfer Reserve Inspection Committee has also been established, holding at least one inspection meeting per month and publicly announcing the inspection reports at any time to show credibility. The details are as follows:

Three Groups of Committee Members

List of Evaluation Committee Members: (1) Real Estate Group: Chairman Qian Xin Zhi, Committee Members C.F. Wolsiffer (Director of China Trading Company), A.W. Buck (Manager of Yekuang Real Estate Company), R.D.K. Silby (Chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Appraisers and Surveyors Association), Li Shuming (Manager of the Central Savings Society), Li Shuxiong (Director of Fangsheng Industrial Company); Evaluation Advisors: W.A. Adams, Hugosandor of China Trading Company, former General Manager of Puyi Real Estate Company. (2) Securities and Stocks: Chairman Bei Songsun, Committee Members Ye Fuxiao (Manager of Continental Bank), C.D. Culbertson (Sinfeng Trading Company), Ellis Hayim (Lian Trading Company), Yuan Qiuchu (Hesheng Trading Company). (3) Goods Group: Chairman Tang Shoumin, Committee Members Wu Shenbo (Manager of Ruilun Silk Factory), Sun Zhongli (Manager of Fufeng Flour Company), Tang Xinghai (Manager of Qingfeng Textile Factory), Cao Xingeng (Manager of Xinfeng Grain Store), Tong Runfu (Manager of Xinyu Yarn Factory), Shen Jinzhou (Manager of Yitaixing Coal Yard), Zhou Desun (Deputy Manager of Four Banks Savings Society); Evaluation and Inspection Advisors: Ruihe Trading Company, Yizhong Notary Public.

Establishing Inspection Committee

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China), the Foreign Banks Association, the Banking Association, and the Money Exchange Association, and other five groups, each nominate one representative to form the Foreign Exchange Transfer Reserve Inspection Committee. The committee members are Xu Jiyin, Hu Meian, H.C. Hopkins, Qin Runqing, and Wu Yunzhai. They have already implemented inspections according to the inspection rules. The committee stipulates that it will conduct at least one inspection per month on the collateral received by the Reserve Association from various banks and firms for foreign exchange transfer withdrawals, and will publicly announce the withdrawal amount and the types and amounts of collateral separately. The committee has hired accountant Pan Xulun as accounting consultant.

### Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank: Auxiliary Currency Notes Issued Under Ministry Order; One-Fen and Five-Fen Notes Being Printed; One-Jiao and Two-Jiao New Notes Already in Circulation; Collective Purchase of Stamps by Exchange Businesses Maintains Status Quo

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the disappearance of copper auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, and the inconvenience caused by the temporary use of postal stamps as substitutes in various industries, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly devise remedial measures. The Ministry responded with a telegram instructing the Central Bank to investigate the needs of the Shanghai market, approve and print one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes. According to yesterday's investigation by the Xin Sheng News Agency from banking circles, the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank's head office has received an order from the Ministry to issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes. It is reported that these auxiliary currency notes are currently being printed. At the same time, a large batch of new one-jiao and two-jiao auxiliary currency notes, printed by the Hong Kong China Bookstore, have recently been shipped to Shanghai and are already circulating in the market for adjustment.

The two exchange industries in the city, banknotes and tobacco, are continuing to work hard to maintain the situation regarding the auxiliary currency panic issue, and deeply hope that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance will ship the newly issued auxiliary currency notes to Shanghai as soon as possible to supply the needs of the market. A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency reports the situation as follows:

Both Industries Determined to Continue Maintaining

Shanghai merchants, previously instigated by a certain group, bought and hoarded a large quantity of copper-nickel auxiliary currency circulating in the market by all means, which affected the market, preventing the auxiliary currency from circulating. Various parties have since taken measures to generally switch to using stamps. The exchange issue can still maintain a normal state. The authorities of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believe that the lack of auxiliary currency has a significant impact on the livelihood of the common people, and have notified the banknote and tobacco exchange associations in writing to carefully handle the matter and switch to using stamps. It is now learned that the member firms of the two industries have implemented a collective purchase of stamps for substitution, and are determined to continue supplying the market's needs with the greatest effort.

Hoping Auxiliary Currency Notes Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

According to a spokesperson from the two industries who spoke to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency yesterday, it is impossible to statistically determine the amount of auxiliary currency circulating throughout the city in the past. Now, since the lack has had an impact, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) and the tram and bus companies, on the one hand, do not release auxiliary currency for use, and on the other hand, the source has been cut off, so there is no special exchange opportunity. According to a notification from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce a few days ago, the National Government has decided on a remedial measure to issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes to address the lack of auxiliary currency in Shanghai, which will likely be shipped to Shanghai for circulation at any time in the near future. Therefore, in addition to unanimously complying with the order, all member firms deeply hope that the auxiliary currency notes will be shipped to Shanghai as soon as possible to meet the needs of the market.

### Situation of Datuan After Japanese Invasion

The defection of the puppet troops in Pudong and the bombing of Datuan and Nanhui by Japanese aircraft have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to those who fled from the two places to Shanghai, when the Japanese army attacked Nanhui on the 5th, four Japanese aircraft flew in early in the morning and dropped 27 small bombs, destroying dozens of civilian houses and killing seven or eight elderly and weak people who did not have time to escape. On the evening of the 6th, when the Japanese army attacked Datuan from Nanhui again, they entered the town on the morning of the 7th and fired more than 100 small steel cannons, aiming at the guerrillas who had withdrawn from the town, but none of them hit. The Japanese army then stationed themselves at the Sheng Yuanfa's new residence and completely destroyed Ni Liangguan's garden with explosives. The Japanese initially intended to burn down the places where the guerrillas had been stationed, but later found it troublesome and had people tear down the houses. The third floor of the Zhuangyuan Tower and the Ma Family Ancestral Hall, among others, have been demolished. Several villagers who fled temporarily were killed, but the remaining houses were unharmed.

### Disaster Relief Work in Gaoyou

The Sino-Foreign Cooperation of the North Jiangsu International Relief Committee and the American Advisory Committee felt deeply about the severity of the disaster in northern Jiangsu, and the overall planning of relief methods has been effective. The committee recently felt that the order in Gaoyou was roughly established, and hurriedly sent personnel to investigate and distribute more relief. According to a report from Mr. Lu Tingzhao, the head of the Gaoyou disaster relief investigation, the details of the relief distribution are as follows: (abridged above) In addition to the original distribution of 10,000 yuan, the postal relief added another 2,000 yuan, which saved many disaster victims. Xinpíng, Lingtang, Tianshan, and other villages in the seventh district suffered successive incidents, and two embankments were burned, affecting more than 200 disaster-stricken households, which was extremely tragic. Tingzhao accompanied relief friends to investigate on site. The disaster victims were moved to tears. However, during the incidents at the two embankments, the survey members were scattered in various villages to investigate households, and could not gather at that time. They have now been entrusted to return to the city one after another, and are fortunate to be safe. The relief work in the seventh district was transferred three times before it could be completed on a specific day. The eighth district was surveyed in a few days, and the first district is currently being surveyed. The entire Gaoyou relief project is expected to be completed within a week, summoning refugees and distributing relief funds.

### Smooth Navigation Between Shanghai and Zhejiang; Strict Inspection of Passengers and Goods; Tianbao Wheel Specifically Transfers Passengers and Goods from Shanghai Vessels; Haifu, Kangsha Yi Requesting Permission

The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters has permitted foreign vessels to dock outside Zhenhai Port, with passengers and goods being transferred by smaller vessels. Vessels such as the Moufu, Fude, Pingha Na have successively set sail, making passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang increasingly convenient. However, the garrison troops at the fortress conduct extremely strict inspections of imported goods. As for passengers, those who do not have proper guarantees are all detained. In addition, able-bodied men from the interior are still prohibited from leaving the port. Only the elderly, weak, women, and children who have permits from military and police agencies are allowed to take ships to Shanghai. The Tianbao transport, owned by the German company Schier & Rickmers in Ningbo, has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to specifically travel between Ningbo and Zhenhai, with all passengers and goods from Shanghai vessels being transferred by this vessel. The Jing Sheng small transport vessels, etc., continue to operate as usual.

Ha Na Sails to Ningbo, Moufu Arrives in Shanghai

The Ha Na vessel of the German Far East Company, having been approved by the Garrison Headquarters of Ningbo, has joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. It was originally scheduled to set sail for the first time on the morning of the 13th, but was unable to leave the port due to a hurricane hitting the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, so it set anchor at 4 am yesterday. It is reported that it arrived safely outside Zhenhai Port that evening. The Moufu vessel of Reiss & Co. has completed unloading its cargo and sailed from Zhenhai to Shanghai yesterday morning, arriving at the port around 4 pm, berthing at Jinliyuan Wharf, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Ningbo the day after tomorrow.

Haifu and Other Vessels Also Request to Join

A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the German Reiss & Co. also has a Haifu vessel that used to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As the line is blocked and has been suspended for a long time, it has also requested permission from the Ningbo side to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. In addition, the Kangsha Yi vessel of the Sino-Italian Company is also requesting permission. Once approved, it can be opened to navigation.

Resuming Shanghai-Dinghai Route, Old Hopes Rekindled

Since the fall of Dinghai, all vessels have been suspended. Subsequently, a Swedish company, Edlund, applied to have the new Anli vessel resume the Dinghai route, and also to stop at Wanzai Mountain. Prior negotiations were held with the Japanese side and the "Maintenance Committee" of Daishan, but it was temporarily blocked by a Japanese warship and returned. It is now learned that some people believe that the disappearance of foreign vessels from Shanghai-Dinghai is profitable, so they have contacted the Japanese side for cooperation and formed the "Daxing Company," deciding to send vessels to resume navigation, including Wanzai Mountain and Shenjiamen. There is also talk of sailing on the 18th, but Shanghai customers are unwilling to load cargo because the area is entirely occupied.

### Shanghai Museum Exhibits Rare Items: Deformed Pig Fetus and Chicks

The Shanghai Museum has recently received a special donation of a deformed pig fetus from a certain gentleman. The pig has one head, eight legs, two ears, and two tails. At the same time, there are also two deformed chicks, both with four legs, which is very rare. They have now been put on display in cabinet number 125 on the third floor of the museum. Readers are welcome to visit and view them. No admission ticket is required. It is also learned that the museum has now printed a kind of postcard, a complete set of 18 cards, which are well printed and sold at a low price, suitable for gifting to relatives and friends, and can also be kept as a souvenir of the visit to the museum. The place where the cards are sold is the Shanghai Museum store, or they can be purchased from the museum staff.

### Charitable Sale of Goods Continues for Two Days; Opening Yesterday; Good Results

The Chinese Professional Women's Club, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, is holding a charitable sale of goods to raise summer sanitation funds for refugees. It opened yesterday, and many Chinese and Western people went to visit and purchase items enthusiastically. In order to expand fundraising, it will continue the charitable sale at its headquarters, Room 203, 3rd Floor, No. 120 Nanjing Road, today and tomorrow (15th and 16th). It is hoped that ladies from all walks of life will visit enthusiastically. Shanghai is not short of enthusiastic people, and it is expected that there will be even better results then.

### Another New Hurricane About 400 Nautical Miles from Shanghai; Suddenly Stalled After Reaching Taiwan; If Direction Does Not Change, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Will Be Affected

The hurricane that originated in the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean swept over Shanghai on the 12th of this month and then dissipated. However, on the 11th of this month, a new hurricane originated near Luzon Island in the Philippines and suddenly stalled after reaching Taiwan. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 2 pm yesterday, the hurricane has now reached 24.5 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, heading due north or northwest, all in the northern part of Taiwan. The center of the storm reaches an area of ​​60 nautical miles, which is more than twice as strong as the previous hurricane. It is currently about 400 nautical miles from Shanghai. If the direction does not change, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be affected. The sudden strong winds and showers in the city yesterday afternoon were due to climate change and had nothing to do with the new hurricane.

### Japanese Side Detains Western Police Inspector for Over an Hour; Japanese Military Police Seize Boat and Beat Coolies; Police Inspector Detained Illegally While Investigating

The Zi Lin News reports that at around 11:30 am yesterday (the 13th), a wounded Chinese coolie was lying on one of the many wooden boats tied to the No. 5 pontoon on the Bund. Mr. Lees, a Western Police Inspector from the Public Concession Police Department, went to investigate and was intimidated by the Japanese military police and detained for more than an hour. It turns out that some Japanese and Italian soldiers were trying to tow away two Chinese wooden boats. The coolie refused and was severely beaten on the head with a wooden stick by a Japanese military policeman. A few minutes later, Lees saw the situation and went to the boat to investigate the injury. At the same time, the Japanese military police had tied the boat and another wooden boat to a tugboat, preparing to sail away. Lees learned of this and intended to jump onto the pontoon, but a military policeman prevented him from jumping out and threatened to hit him with the wooden stick that had injured the coolie. The boats then sped towards the Water Hotel near the Bund Park, opposite Beijing Road. The hotel was confiscated and is now used by the Japanese military police. Mr. Sampson, Assistant Chief Inspector of the Police Department, witnessed the incident on the Bund and immediately went to the Water Hotel, where he had a long discussion with the officers of the Japanese military police. At 12:40 pm, he accompanied Lees to the Bund. It is reported that the wooden boats have been "confiscated" and not returned to the original Chinese owners, and the fate of the injured Chinese is unknown. At yesterday's reception for journalists by the Japanese side, someone asked about this matter. The naval spokesman said that he knew nothing about it. According to the Japanese side, Lees boarded the ship tied to the No. 5 buoy on the Bund, which exceeded his authority. Therefore, Lees' actions have raised the issue of the respective jurisdictions of the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese maritime military police. The Japanese side also claimed that at around 11:30 am yesterday, the Japanese maritime military police were inspecting a sailboat, and Lees boarded the boat to "obstruct the Japanese military police from performing their duties." The Japanese maritime military police insisted that the Public Concession Police Department had no right to exercise its powers at the pontoon. It is reported that Lees was taken to the headquarters of the Japanese maritime military police to discuss the matter. It is now confirmed that Lees' actions were due to differing views on police powers between the two sides.

### The Millard's Review Exposes the Evils of Western Shanghai; Gambling and Opium Rampant Under Japanese Protection; Gambling Dens on Gordon Road Thriving

The Continental Daily reports that the Millard's Review, to be published tomorrow (the 15th), will carry an article exposing the evils of opium and gambling in Shanghai's notorious "badlands." The "badlands" include three key areas within the jurisdiction of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." These three areas are directly under the jurisdiction of three groups: the Opium Den, the Earthwork Firm, and the Opium Den Owners Association. The most important and thriving area is Caojiadu, where the supply of narcotics to opium smokers in the Public Concession and the French Concession comes from. The daily turnover is 2 million yuan. Its general sales office is jointly operated by the Earthwork Industry Association and the puppet "Renovation Government's" "Opium Suppression Bureau." The "Opium Suppression Bureau" recently set up its headquarters in the Broadway Mansions. The Earthwork Firm obtains opium from the general sales office of the Japanese Army and enjoys a certain degree of independence without interference because the "Dadao" police are merely auxiliary figures of the "bodyguards" and hooligans hired by the earthwork dealers to protect their drug trade. Earth prices have soared compared to the past, the reason being that the Japanese side levies heavy taxes. In some occupied areas, salaries are paid with opium, such as in Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai. The gambling dens in Caojiadu are all "second-class," but they are very profitable. Wealthier gamblers often go to the gambling dens on Yuyuan Road, Daxilu, Jing'an Temple Road, and outside Haig Road. The most famous is Hollywood Amusement Park. A gambling den called Asia Club at No. 65 Gordon Road is entirely within the Public Concession. Its nightly turnover once exceeded Hollywood Amusement Park. The spread of gambling evils into the Public Concession is inevitable. It is now rumored that there are also several small roulette wheels in various public houses on Jing'an Temple Road and other main roads. It is doubtful why the Public Concession authorities do not take action to suppress them. Are they afraid of the Japanese, or is there another reason? The white pigeon lottery, which has long been banned by the Chinese government, has now been revived under the protection of the Japanese side. Its headquarters is located near the corner of Jessfield Road and Yuyuan Road, behind the Paramount Ballroom. The Japanese authorities prohibit all Japanese from going to the "badlands." The area is exclusively for Chinese to "seek pleasure" (occasionally a few foreigners set foot), and the Japanese are precisely establishing the so-called "new order" for the Chinese.

### Extorting Tang Shuqian, the Perpetrators are Punished

Tang Shuqian (real estate businessman), a local resident of No. 2, Lane 1124, Xinzha Road, received three anonymous threatening letters in March of this year, demanding 850 yuan. Tang ignored them, and the bandits did not take any action later. Until between June 24 and 28, suddenly letters bearing the name of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army were received again,

demanding 60,000 yuan. Two bullets were attached to the letters, threatening Tang to "eat hygiene pills," and the language was fierce. He secretly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. On the afternoon of the 28th, the bandits were instructed to send representatives to Tang's house to negotiate, saying that giving money could be discussed. At that time, Chinese Detective Wang Chengying and Detective Xu Decheng of the police station were nearby Tang's house,

observing the situation for a while. As expected, Zhuang Meichu from Pudong and Zhang Guoying from Suzhou arrived slowly and were arrested. They were interrogated and it was learned that the accomplices were in the Continental Hotel at No. 402, Lane 431, Pushi Road, French Concession. They rushed to the address and arrested Zhang Zhenqiu, Xu Yunbao, Cai Quansheng, and others, and found a seal of the absconding leader Ma Pengfei and a seal of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army. They were all taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was completed,

they awaited sentencing on record. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Yuanzi presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhuang Meichu to ten months imprisonment, and Zhang Zhenqiu, Xu Yunbao, Zhang Guoying, and Cai Quansheng to four months each. One bullet and one seal of Ma Pengfei of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army were confiscated. Zhang Guoying and Cai Quansheng were given a three-year suspended sentence each. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan waived the appeal and released them immediately.

### Extortion by Transporting Corpse in Coffin, Principal Culprit Arrested

At 3 pm on the 11th, at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at No. 176 Aierkekaolu Road, Song Xigen (local gangster), a regular customer who often went to the restaurant for meals, of No. 910 Zhoujiazui Road, asked for a bowl of fried sliced pork to be sent to his home. Wang Jiusheng, the Ningbo owner of Zhuangyuanlou, refused to send it because Song already owed several yuan for meals, which angered Song. In the evening, he colluded with his apprentice, Wang Jinfeng, a 17-year-old Ningbo native, and obtained a small coffin containing a child's corpse from somewhere. They placed it at the entrance of the restaurant, using it as an excuse to extort 50 yuan in legal tender. The case occurred, and they were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. At 2 pm on the 13th, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station arrested Wang in Yuezhou Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court, requesting detention. Judge Huang ruled to postpone the trial together with the previous one.

### Two Perpetrators Sentenced for Kidnapping and Raping Women

Mrs. Yuan Zhang from Ningbo, while holding her three-year-old daughter Lin Di, went to the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company on March 1st two years ago. She was seduced by Wang Shilin, a tourist from Suzhou, with sweet words and went to a hotel with him. Later, Wang colluded with accomplices to trick Yuan Zhang to Dalian, intending to force her into prostitution. Fortunately, she was alert and took the opportunity to escape and report to the police station. A telegram was sent to Shanghai, and her husband Yuan Ade went to collect her. Recently, she encountered them on the road and reported them to the police, who arrested and interrogated Wang Shilin and his accomplice Chen Shunhe at the Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Yigao ruled that Wang Shilin and Chen Shunhe were jointly guilty of repeated crimes of kidnapping with intent to rape women, and sentenced them each to three years imprisonment to serve as a warning.

### Young Man Seduces Young Girl, Secret Meeting in Room, Zhang Yinzhang Accused of Endangering Family

Wu Rubin, a 48-year-old Changshu native residing at No. 16, Lane 317, Xixianaisi Road, French Concession, makes a living selling rice cakes. His daughter, Wu Gendi, 18 years old, is somewhat attractive. She used to live in the countryside and came to Shanghai in May of last year to escape the war and lived with her father. She often played with her younger brother at the entrance of the alley. Zhang Yinzhang, a young man of the same age as the girl from Haining, who lives at No. 19 in the same alley and sells coal, also often stayed at the entrance of the alley with his nephew (the son of his sister), so the man and woman met, and from teasing words, they developed a romance. At 3 pm on May 12 of this year, Zhang led the girl to a hotel for illicit sex. At 8 pm that night, they went home separately. On the night of June 22, Yinzhang again enticed Gendi to the 37th room of the Shanghai Hotel on Carter Road to continue their affair. The next day, they returned home. The girl's parents learned about it and believed that Zhang Yinzhang had committed a criminal act by seducing a girl under the age of 20 for illicit sex. They hired lawyer Liu Yan to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Zhang Yinzhang of endangering the family. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, Judge Sun Penghui presided over the Second Criminal Court for the trial. Both parties accompanied by lawyers appeared in court to await interrogation. In court, because the case concerned morality, it was announced that the public should be prohibited from attending. After deliberation, it was announced that the trial was concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 21st. The defendant was ordered to provide bail, and if no bail was provided, they would be taken into custody.

### Second Landlord Evicts Third Tenant

The shikumen at No. 7 Ruian Lane, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meiboge Road, Public Concession, has a second landlord named Mr. Xu, who practices traditional Chinese medicine. Xu lives behind the living room downstairs, while the living room is used as a clinic. The upstairs is rented out to others. The front and rear buildings were rented to Bi Wanshi from Pudong for a monthly rent of 35 yuan, with 20 yuan for the front building and 15 yuan for the rear building. In July of last year, Bi subleased the rear building to a relative named Pan Zhishan, 45 years old, from Nanhui County, Pudong, who is currently an employee in the seasoning department of the Far East Industrial Company at No. 175 Guangdong Road, Jiangxi Road. Three days ago, Bi Wanshi moved back to his hometown in Pudong because the expenses in this city were too high, but Pan still lives in the rear building. Unexpectedly, after Bi moved out, Mr. Xu did not recognize Pan as a third tenant and issued an eviction order, and moved all of Pan's clothes and utensils into the lane the day before yesterday evening, causing a dispute between the two parties. Now, after mediation, Pan Zhishan is required to move out within one month, but the second landlord refuses, so Pan reported to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and await handling.

### Chinese Detective Strangles Mistress, Police Station Files Appeal, Further Interrogation Postponed Due to Injury, Detective Refuses to Reveal Name of Deceased Woman

At around 10 am on the 13th, in room 10 of the Tongli Public Inn at No. 6, Lane 195, Fujian Road, a man strangled a woman to death, and then jumped out of the building to commit suicide, injuring his head. The case was investigated by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Detective He Renrui of the Old Zha Police Station, and it was learned that the murderer was Wu Yuguang, 28 years old, from Shandong, a Chinese detective No. 2478 of the General Police Station. It was further learned that the deceased woman was the detective's mistress. The detective first strangled the woman to death with cotton yarn, and then stabbed her several times with a knife. Then he committed suicide by jumping out of the building. The detectives found a bottle of Lysol, two glass cups, and a handkerchief stained with saliva in the room. As for the name of the deceased woman and the reason why the detective committed the murder, it is still difficult to ascertain because the detective refuses to reveal anything. Yesterday morning, Police Station lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit against the detective in the First Special District Court according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law. However, because he was injured and receiving treatment in the hospital, he could not appear in court, so he requested that the trial be postponed. Judge Xiao Xiefei approved the case to be postponed for one week for further interrogation.

### Rice Shop Owner Denies Biological Daughter: Court Orders Blood Test for Identification; Debate to Resume After Testing

Zhang Huiming, the 45-year-old owner of Dongcheng Rice Shop at No. 120 Ganshi East Road and a native of Baoshan, was recently sued in the Second Special Court's Civil Division by Chen Qinbao, a young Suzhou woman residing at No. 15 Qingfu Road, Pushi Road, in her capacity as the legal representative of her four-year-old daughter, Zhang Gendi. The suit seeks confirmation that Zhang Gendi is Zhang Huiming's biological daughter. After receiving the complaint, the court yesterday, with Judge Li Liang presiding in the Seventh Tribunal, summoned the defendant Zhang Huiming, who appeared with his legal representative for questioning. First, the plaintiff Chen Qinbao, holding her daughter Zhang Gendi, testified that she and the defendant Zhang Huiming had lived together in Shanghai due to their romantic relationship, and that they had a daughter named Gendi (pointing to the girl in her arms), who is now four years old. Initially, the defendant said that his wife at home was too jealous and asked the plaintiff to take their daughter back to Suzhou, promising to cover their living expenses. The plaintiff, understanding the defendant's situation, temporarily separated from him. In the beginning, the defendant kept his promise and sent a small amount of living expenses monthly. However, in recent years, the defendant's heart has changed, and he has neglected the living expenses of the plaintiff and her daughter. Therefore, she has been forced to file a lawsuit. Then, the defendant Zhang Huiming testified that he had long broken off relations with the plaintiff, and that the girl Zhang Gendi she was holding was not his daughter, so he was unwilling to bear the responsibility of raising her. The court questioned both parties at length, but each stuck to their own story. The plaintiff requested a blood test for identification. The court then ordered Chen Qinbao to take her daughter Zhang Gendi, along with Zhang Huiming, to the forensic doctor to undergo a blood test. The case was adjourned, and the debate will resume after the test results are available.

### On Avenue Petain: Man Abducted; Fortunately, Police Arrive in Time to Take Him to the Station; Thugs Parked Car in Advance, Indicating a Plan

Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, on the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, a man in his thirties, dressed in a gray long gown and well-groomed, was walking slowly with his head down, alone, from north to south. When he reached Avenue Petain, a black-plated car suddenly sped out of Avenue Edward VII, following him. Seeing the man, it screeched to a halt. Four men, including some in Western suits and some in Chinese attire, jumped out of the car, stopped the man, and began dragging him into the vehicle. The man struggled, and the car window was kicked and broken in the process. At that moment, nearby patrol officers, having received information, arrived and, fearing the car would drive away, drew their guns and ordered them to stop. All were taken to the Avenue Petain police station. It is understood that the single man was on his way to find a friend, surnamed Li, who had just arrived in Shanghai from another port and was staying at a friend's house in the French Concession. Other details are still under investigation by the police.

The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that at 10:15 AM today (the 14th), four plainclothes Japanese men attempted to kidnap a Chinese person near the intersection of Avenue Petain and Avenue Edward VII. The French Concession police are currently investigating. According to the French Concession Intelligence Department, the Japanese men apparently drove up to the Chinese person's location in a car and stopped. However, due to the arrival of a patrol officer, they sped away. The Intelligence Department also denied earlier reports that a Chinese person had been kidnapped and was crying for help from inside the car.

### German-Italian Firm Charters Ship to Resume Shipping to Northern Jiangsu; The "Livorno" to Test Run to Funing Today

The Shanghai-Funing shipping route was previously served by several foreign vessels, including Yongzhen, Hafa, Haida, Kailin, and Huifeng. However, after the town of Hexing in Funing was bombed by Japanese aircraft in early February of this year, the Yongzhen, Hafa, and Haida happened to be there. While attempting to avoid the bombing, they sailed to the Sheyang River and were seized by Japanese warships and taken to Qingdao. They were later released after negotiations by the consuls of various related countries. The Japanese side then blockaded the mouth of the Sheyang River, prohibiting navigation, causing the Shanghai-Funing line to be suspended for nearly half a year. However, Hexing Town is a transportation hub in northern Jiangsu. The German-Italian firm at No. 53 Fuzhou Road, in order to resume shipping to northern Jiangsu, has recently chartered the Norwegian ship "Livorno" from Hualun Shipping Company to sail to Hexing Town in Funing. All procedures have been properly negotiated with all parties. It is approved to set sail from Shanghai at 3:00 PM today for a test run to Funing.

### Two Customs Brokers Jointly Organize Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming; Only Six Days from Shanghai to Saigon; Second Voyage of Taikoo's Shanghai-Siam Route to Commence

Since the fall of Shantou, freight transport from Haiphong has become even more important, as it is the only port through which inland transport can occur. However, the goods transported in the past have piled up like mountains, making it difficult to disperse them in a short time. Moreover, goods are still being transported there in a steady stream, making transport inland particularly difficult. Seeing this, Mautung at No. 12 Yong'an Fang in the French Concession and Tsin Yuan at No. 34, two customs brokerages, have jointly organized through transport between Shanghai and Kunming, opening a new shipping route. Goods are transported from Shanghai to Saigon, and from Saigon, they are loaded onto trains and transported directly to Kunming for delivery. It is said that it only takes six days from Shanghai to Saigon. The two companies have personnel stationed along the route from Saigon to Kunming to take care of everything. All procedures are simple, reliable, and efficient. As for Taikoo's newly opened Shanghai-Siam route, the first voyage was made by the Suzhou ship on the morning of Tuesday (the 11th) of this week. Now, the Zhangjiakou ship, which previously sailed the Shantou-Siam route, has been transferred to Shanghai to join the Shanghai-Siam route. It is scheduled to depart Shanghai for its second voyage on Saturday (the 22nd) of next week. The ship is currently en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port on the 18th.

### Dance Hostess Zhang Xiaofeng Loses Love, Takes Poison and Dies

Zhang Xiaofeng, an 18-year-old Shandong woman residing at No. 5 Min Cun, Minti Yin Road, South Chu Chia Bridge, French Concession, worked as a dance hostess at the Jue Lu Dance Hall on Chu Chia Ching Road. Recently, due to a failed love affair, she became despondent. Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, after returning home from the dance hall, she committed suicide by swallowing poisonous liquid. Her roommate, Fang Aizhen, discovered her, reported it to the police, and she was taken by ambulance to Guangci Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and she died not long after being admitted.

Zhang Xiaomei, a 21-year-old Suzhou native and young blind woman residing at No. 23 Duofu Lane, Caishi Road, Kangti Road, French Concession, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing her father, Zhang Genda (52 years old, also from Suzhou, a night soil collector, residing at No. 3 Pingjiang Lane, Lan Weiai Road), and her husband, Zhang Huojin (28 years old, with a scabby head), of obstructing her freedom. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial, and both parties arrived on time. According to the plaintiff, Zhang Xiaomei, she was taken in as a child from an orphanage in Suzhou by the first defendant. After raising her for a year, she lost her sight. The defendant intended to return her to the orphanage, but they refused to accept her. Three years later, he sent her to a fortune-telling house to learn fortune-telling. She now sets up a fortune-telling stall at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road to make a living. At the age of 18, the first defendant insisted on marrying her to the second defendant, his son Zhang Huojin. After the marriage, she discovered that her husband had bad habits, including gambling and whoring, and did not care about the family's livelihood. Instead, he asked her for money to squander. Recently, Zhang Liansheng, a member of her clan, told her that her husband wanted to break her legs to prevent her from doing business. Fearing future trouble, she filed the lawsuit, requesting an investigation. The defendants, Zhang Genda and Zhang Huojin, father and son, testified together that they treated her very well. They had taken her in and raised her since she was a child, and they had paid for her to learn fortune-telling, spending three or four hundred yuan. Recently, she had listened to the instigation of her lover, Zhang Liansheng, and filed a false accusation. They requested that the court investigate the matter. After reviewing the testimonies, the court declared the trial concluded, as the case was clear, and scheduled the verdict for the 21st. Both parties were dismissed.

### Essential Knowledge for Going to Southeast Asia

Singapore is located at the southern tip of the British Malaya Peninsula. Those who initially decide to go there are commonly called "newcomers." Due to environmental concerns, the local government has repeatedly changed the order restricting Chinese newcomers from entering the country. Therefore, newcomers are also known as "restricted visitors." Currently, 500 people are allowed to enter each month. According to the recent ticket prices stipulated by various shipping companies, the fare from Hong Kong is 75 Hong Kong dollars, and the fare from Xiamen is 180 yuan in national currency. However, since many Chinese people go there to seek a living, the number of tickets is often insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, the price of these tickets depends on market supply and demand and fluctuates accordingly, reaching a high of 280-290 Hong Kong dollars and still being unavailable. The lowest price is also 110-120 Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, those who wish to go there should book early to avoid unexpected losses. Regarding passports, they are not strictly necessary. Because most overseas Chinese travel in steerage, they only need to pay a landing fee of "5 Singapore dollars" (also known as an entry tax, which is used to register for residence) upon arrival. Oldcomers must hold a residence permit issued by the local British government. When returning to their home country, they must apply for an extension of their return period to Singapore. Failure to return by the deadline will invalidate the permit. If they wish to return again, the same procedures as for newcomers apply. The fare for oldcomers from Hong Kong is 45 Hong Kong dollars. If they entrust a reliable travel agency to make the booking in advance, they can save 10 or 15 dollars. Those who wish to go to Penang have the same procedures as Singapore. Whether they are newcomers or oldcomers, they must add 5 Hong Kong dollars to the Singapore fare. Those traveling from Xiamen must add 20 national currency. For other details, please inquire at the Shanghai branch of the Nanyang Travel Agency, No. 29 Rue du Consulat, French Concession, Shanghai.

### Ji Detang Cough and Asthma Balm

"Ji Detang Cough and Asthma Balm," secretly prepared by the owner of Ji Detang at No. 3 Wang De Li, Gordon Road, corner of Avenue Edward VII, has always been given away free of charge to the poor and sick. Because one person's resources are limited, it was publicly sold last year for two yuan per pack of two plasters. The poor and sick are not charged. Those who are extremely poor are still given it away as usual to fulfill the wish. (Please send letters directly to the hall to request it. If readers can inform the poor and sick, the merit is immeasurable.) Therefore, those who purchase it also gain merit indirectly. This balm specializes in treating coughs and asthma in men, women, the elderly, and children, both new and old. Even asthma that has lasted for decades can be cured. Many patients have sent letters to thank them. For convenience, it has been specially entrusted to Ye Ruixin Zhai Fragrance Shop (telephone 46137) at the north end of Laozha Bridge and Hefac Company at the eastern end of Jingde Road in Suzhou for retail.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern,
According to the entrustment of Mr. Feng Kaitang, the owner of Feng Changhe sailboat, I have read the news column of today's Shen Bao wooden pier, which contains a news item that all four coal cinder boats were sunk by a hurricane. The content roughly states that the Xiehe Yongji sailboat recently hired the Feng Changhe barge to transport coal to Shaoxing. Unexpectedly, the Feng Changhe crew and the boat owner had a dispute over liquor money, which was suspended for three days. Yesterday, the four barges suddenly encountered a hurricane in Shanghai and were all overturned. The lives of the crew members are unknown, so the barge owner reported it to the water police for record. This does not conform to the facts. The day before yesterday, Chen Aliang hired me to ship goods, stating that they were going to Daishan, Zhejiang. Yesterday evening on the twelfth of this month, a line of coal barges were moored together. After investigation, it was found that they were all going to Shaoxing. I refused because the stated location did not match the place mentioned when the boat was hired. Moreover, all the coal barges were still moored beside our boat during yesterday's hurricane, and they were not damaged at all. There is also no fact that the four barges overturned. Furthermore, the Xiehe Yongji boat was not directly hired. Therefore, I have specially entrusted you to send a letter to the newspaper to correct this statement. Based on this, I am sending you a letter with the facts, hoping that your newspaper will include it in the letter column to clarify the truth. Thank you sincerely. To the News Column of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer Tao Ran, July 12.

### Forward Exchange Rates Tightening Again

— By Zhongyong

Regardless of applications for import exchange or the settlement of export exchange, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is not affected. Therefore, recent reports that import exchange is not being supplied and export exchange is allowed to proceed freely are inaccurate. However, it cannot be denied that the buying and selling of forward exchange in the black market, whether directly or indirectly, will still affect the foreign exchange fund. This newspaper has repeatedly stated this. Recently, there has been an increase in forward exchange activity. Even if the foreign exchange holdings are exceptionally strong, a small leak can sink a great ship, and there will inevitably be a day of depletion. However, the British representatives in Parliament have repeatedly stated that they will maintain the Chinese legal currency, without considering the leakage of Chinese foreign exchange, which flows out from the hands of British and American banks. If there is no way to protect Chinese foreign exchange, there is no point in maintaining Chinese legal currency; this is a matter of cause and effect. Now, the absorption of Chinese foreign exchange is being accelerated, and the Chinese side seems to be strengthening its defenses. Yesterday, forward exchange rates tightened again. Whether this is temporary or permanent, or due to the Chinese government not supplying it, cannot be determined until the facts are clear. However, if British and American merchants are determined to consolidate Chinese finance and maintain Chinese legal currency, it is indeed necessary to thoroughly curtail or reform the free trading and unrestricted supply in the Shanghai black market. The forward exchange market should be tightened and eventually stopped, and the scope of spot trading should be gradually reduced, step by step. This will certainly help to recover some of the loss of Chinese foreign exchange. Some may think that this method will hinder foreign merchants' trade, but they do not know that it is precisely for the sake of preserving the long-term interests of foreign merchants' trade with China. Preserving the foreign exchange that China does not need to spend now is the foundation for the future development of foreign trade. Rather than allowing valuable foreign exchange to flow into the hands of one person, it is better to preserve it and allow it to grow for future use by all parties. Therefore, not only should forward exchange be stopped, but also acting as an intermediary for buying and selling foreign exchange should be stopped. Do not act as a wedding dress for others and cause trouble for yourself. British and American merchants should not be so foolish. However, British and American merchants are still hesitant and unwilling to make a decision.

### Finance Slight Weakening of Foreign Bank Supply; Foreign Exchange Forward Rates Hit New Lows; Spot Rates Diverge Further from August Rates; Arbitrage Monthly Interest Reaches Around Six Percent

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial exchange market for British and American currencies initially saw extremely flat spot rates. Later, due to heavier settlement demands from foreign firms and slightly weaker willingness to sell U.S. dollars among foreign banks, there was a slight softening. However, the British pound was fortunate to have HSBC's ongoing supply, which allowed it to maintain and stabilize at its original price. Futures for July and August saw continued strong buying from Sassoon, coupled with a very weak willingness to sell from foreign banks and strong buying interest, resulting in a tightening market. Later, market rumors of a change in leadership at a certain domestic public institution further agitated sentiment. Consequently, both Chinese and Western speculators, unable to distinguish clearly, competed to buy aggressively. Furthermore, telegrams from Hong Kong also urged aggressive buying, exacerbating the tightening trend, with little sign of retreat. August rates hit an unprecedented high for far-month contracts, initially driving the spread to the edge of six pence, at 6.0625 pence. The U.S. dollar broke into the 12-yuan range, reaching 11.78125, further widening the swap spreads. The difference between July and August for the British pound was 0.28125, and for the U.S. dollar, 0.5625. The combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) reached a strong 4.5%. The spread between spot and August rates was half a penny for the British pound and one yuan for the U.S. dollar, increasing the monthly interest to around six percent. However, banks did not post firm quotes, and Chinese merchants dared not participate, resulting in very little arbitrage activity. As for the Hong Kong dollar, due to strong buying interest from foreign firms, it broke into the 44-yuan range again, ultimately tightening by 0.25.

Sassoon and Hong Kong interests both settling purchases.

Early morning saw London rates at a recent high of 0.0025, with forwards up 0.03125. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices also remained unchanged. Exchange rates were unchanged for British pounds against U.S. dollars, Shanghai currency, and French francs. U.S. dollars were also unchanged against British pounds, Shanghai currency, and French francs. Central bank listed rates for various currencies remained as before (application stopped). Banks' morning opening spot selling prices were 6.0625 pence for the British pound and 12.78125 yuan for the U.S. dollar, showing no change from the previous close. After opening, foreign firms successively bought British pounds at spot rates of 6.0625 pence and U.S. dollars at spot rates of 12.78125 yuan from HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain American bank, stabilizing the market. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, they remained unchanged. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt from a small fee. Foreign firms showed strong interest in buying futures but were unwilling to sell unless at high prices, leading to a softening trend. It was estimated that a certain bank absorbed U.S. dollars for this month at 12.625 yuan from foreign merchants. Subsequently, Sassoon aggressively bought U.S. dollars for this month from American banks at only 12.5625 yuan, and U.S. dollars for August at only 12.15625 and 12.125 yuan. Simultaneously, the British pound for this month tightened to 6.04375 pence, and for August softened to 6.012875 pence. However, British banks like HSBC showed no willingness to supply at these prices. By noon, foreign firms absorbed Hong Kong dollars at 44.125 yuan from Anda, a foreign bank, with little change. At the noon close, banks' spot selling prices remained unchanged from the morning opening for both British and American currencies.

U.S. Dollar August Rates Enter 12 Yuan Range

Later in the day, due to heavier settlement demands from foreign firms, HSBC continued to support the British pound, resulting in a market situation where the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar slightly soft. It was estimated that foreign firms settled purchases of British pounds from HSBC at a spot rate of 6.0625 pence and also bought U.S. dollars at a spot rate of 12.75 yuan from American banks. At that time, the market was agitated due to rampant rumors in China, causing a surge in sentiment. Both Chinese and Western speculators leaned towards buying futures, coupled with sudden aggressive buying via telegram from Hong Kong and difficulty for foreign banks to sell, tightening the situation. It was estimated that telegrams from Hong Kong and Sassoon, along with Chinese speculators, successively bought British pounds for this month from foreign banks, driving the rate from 6.040625 pence to 6.034375 pence, and U.S. dollars for this month from 12.4375 yuan to 12.375 yuan. Subsequently, they also settled purchases of British pounds for August from British banks at 6.0125 pence, and U.S. dollars for August broke into the 12-yuan range, with the lowest price quoted at 11.78125 yuan, an unprecedented tightening. Later, the Hong Kong dollar also tightened significantly due to aggressive buying from foreign firms and money exchanges, breaking into the 44-yuan range. It was reported that foreign banks' selling price softened to 43.875 yuan. At the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were 6.0625 pence for the British pound and 12.75 yuan for the U.S. dollar, 6.034375 pence for the British pound for this month and 12.375 yuan for the U.S. dollar, and 6.00625 pence for the British pound for August and 11.8125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Ultimately, compared to the previous day, spot rates were flat for the British pound and softened by 0.03125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. This month's rates tightened by 0.0125 for the British pound and softened by 0.025 yuan for the U.S. dollar, while August rates shrank by 0.01875 for the British pound and rose by 0.0375 yuan for the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong dollar also tightened by 0.0025 based on the final price. The day's trading record is listed below.

### Baseless Rumors Drive Cash Prices Higher; Breaking Through the 2,630 Yuan Barrier; Trading Activity Increases to Around 900 Taels

Yesterday's situation for raw cash silver in the unofficial market: Initially, the market was extremely flat. Although a certain bank (acting on behalf of a foreign bank) and Hong Kong interests successively absorbed supply, and silver shops also showed buying interest, the strong willingness to supply from cash shops kept prices from rising, hovering around 2,600 yuan. Later, unexpectedly, rumors of a change in personnel in a certain department surfaced, and at the same time, foreign exchange futures tightened sharply, igniting buying sentiment. General speculators competed to buy aggressively, and the willingness to sell from sellers suddenly diminished, leading to a rapid surge. Prices broke through three major barriers, from 2,610 yuan to 2,630 yuan, reaching a peak of 2,631 yuan at one point. However, the final result was a sharp increase of 30 yuan. Trading activity was brisk throughout the day, reaching around 900 taels. Silver jewelry prices rose by 3 yuan, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Raw Silver Rises Sharply by 30 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened strong due to a certain foreign firm entrusting a certain bank to absorb supply and money exchanges acting on behalf of retail investors also starting to buy. The market was firm, opening 2 yuan higher. When money exchanges bought 50 taels from cash shops at 2,602 yuan, buying sentiment was strong, but the strong willingness to sell from cash shops caused a slight dip. The rate briefly rebounded by one yuan. A certain cash shop forcefully sold 100 taels to a certain bank at 2,601 yuan. Subsequently, the rate dipped again by one yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop (acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests) and Xian Yuhao sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange, all at 2,600 yuan. Following that, gold shops again bought 50 taels from securities interests at 2,601 yuan. Later, at the same price, a certain silver shop again absorbed a total of 50 taels from cash shops on behalf of Hong Kong interests. At that time, a certain bank also absorbed 50 taels from money exchanges on behalf of a foreign firm, all at 2,600 yuan. Later, silver shops successively absorbed a total of 60 taels from cash shops and money exchanges 30 taels, all at the same price. At noon, the price was pressed down by 2 yuan, with cash shops selling 50 taels to silver shops at 2,598 yuan, serving as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. Initially, money exchanges sold 50 taels to gold shops at 2,598 yuan. Following that, gold shops again bought 50 taels from money exchanges at 2,600 yuan. At that time, a certain bank and money exchanges aggressively bought, and the upward momentum gradually intensified. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchanges at 2,604 yuan. Suddenly, at 2:25 pm, unfavorable rumors surfaced, and it was further heard that foreign exchange was flat for the British pound but tight for the U.S. dollar, with futures uniformly shrinking significantly. Sentiment surged, and there was a shortage of sellers. Good Samaritans in the market suddenly engaged in reckless buying and dragging, causing a rapid surge. Under the enveloping buying sentiment, the price surged by 21 yuan before silver shops sold 50 taels to gold shops at 2,615 yuan. Soon after, the price jumped up by 3 yuan, with money exchanges buying 30 taels from gold shops at 2,628 yuan. Later, the price was raised again by 4 yuan, breaking through the 30-yuan barrier, with money exchanges mutually trading 30 taels at 2,632 yuan, marking the day's peak. The price then retreated slightly by 2 yuan, with money exchanges mutually trading 50 taels. 2,630 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rose sharply by 30 yuan. It was found that the price had risen for five consecutive days, totaling 53 yuan. The full-day fluctuation was 34 yuan. Cash shops' listed selling price for silver was 2,640 yuan, and the buying price was 2,620 yuan. Currently, the listed price for silver is approximately 50 yuan lower than the listed price for gold. It was inquired that transactions were rare.

Silver Jewelry's Listed Price Reduced

The initial selling price for silver jewelry per tael remained unchanged. However, at 9:40 am, the listed price was raised by one yuan (while Datonghang's listed price for silver was reduced by 0.3 yuan, changed to 2.5 yuan). At 2:45 pm in the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in raw silver prices, the listed price was raised again by 2 yuan. It was estimated that Datonghang's price was changed to 266 yuan, and Xintonghang's price was 264 yuan, with a buying price of 258 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

A telegram from London on the 13th stated that the price of pure British gold per ounce remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d, resulting in all market prices at the Central Bank also remaining unchanged. The buying price for Chinese pure gold remained at 1,212.3 yuan, the listed price for customs gold was 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard listed price for gold also remained at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Discount Rates Continue to Rise; Call Loan Rates Unchanged

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange draft bills continued to rise slightly. The discount rate per thousand yuan in the morning was 93.4 yuan, rising to 94.25 yuan in the afternoon, an additional increase of 0.75 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate from the Money Trade Association remained unchanged, listed at 0.18 yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Foreign Currencies Remain High; Mostly Rising

Yesterday's prices for pure British gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were settling purchases heavily, and foreign merchants were absorbing supply actively. Foreign banks' supply was relatively smooth, with the market price showing British pounds flat and U.S. dollars tight. Supply of British and American gold pounds was not smooth, and the high raw silver prices kept the market price firm. Demand for British and American gold notes was strong, and forward exchange rates were extremely tight, with market prices rising even more sharply. Demand for Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Singapore notes was all strong, and all were rare and valuable. The market situation was firm and rising, with most currencies rising. The supply of Japanese gold notes was relatively smooth, with the evening market at 0.995 yuan. Demand for Korean notes was weak, and the market situation was sluggish, with the evening market at 0.865 yuan. Trading at the association was rare. Zhenxing offered and Longchang bought U.S. dollar notes for 500 yuan. Xintai offered and Longchang bought U.S. dollar notes for 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each rise by 0.5 yuan, British gold notes rise by 0.15 yuan, U.S. dollar notes rise by 0.08 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.0008 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.0001 yuan, Singapore notes and Canadian notes each rise by 0.03 yuan, Dutch notes and Philippine notes each rise by 0.01 yuan, rupee notes rise by 0.02 yuan, and Australian gold notes rise by 0.1 yuan. Prices for Annam notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Securities; Foreign Debt Continues to Fall; Domestic Debt Slightly Rebounds

In the unofficial securities market, the market situation continued to rise by several angles yesterday, but the situation was already firming. It was reported that the Ministry of Finance announced that the interest would be paid in Chongqing, and that the payment would be made in six months in Shanghai and other ports, either in cash or by remittance. The official order from the Ministry of Finance has not yet arrived in Shanghai. This kind of incorrect news was published earlier in this newspaper based on the principle of reporting everything we hear. It was heard that many parties wanted to find a way out, so they used propaganda to stir up the market. Unexpectedly, the market sentiment became suspicious because of this. Many parties believed that the price had already risen by two yuan in the past two days, but that Class A at 60 yuan and Class C at 50 yuan could not break through. Therefore, they gradually wanted to get out, so they came up with this method. In short, the decision to issue interest is a mystery because the statement is ambiguous, so they want people to fish in troubled waters. For example, at the beginning, Xieda, Zhenkang, and Fukang bought Class C, which once reached 9.1 yuan, and Class A once reached the edge of 60 yuan. However, Dafeng, Lianhe, and other numbers sold heavily on the 5th and 10th, and the market price fell by half a yuan. Later, there was still demand from retail investors, but Songmao, Tongkang, Tiansheng, Hengfu, and other numbers also spit out, and the trend became the end of a strong crossbow. Therefore, the result was only a continued increase of 0.45 to 0.75 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock market situation: Nanyang Yincao stock traded 50 shares at a price of 8.2 yuan. There were some inquiries about the stock market of the public industry association. Jardine stock traded a total of 4,600 shares, with a closing bid price of 18.2 yuan and an ask price of 18.3 yuan. Reclamation stock traded a total of 3,000 shares, with a closing bid price of 5.95 yuan. Telephone stock continued to be strong, with a closing bid price of 12.3 yuan and an ask price of 12.5 yuan. A total of 15,000 shares of various rubber stocks were traded, with prices all at market. In the corporate bond market, 32,000 yuan of the Electricity 5.5% public bond was traded, with prices between 81.5 yuan and 82 yuan. 12,000 yuan of the Public Works Bureau 6% public bond was traded, with a price of 94 yuan. Small amounts of the Telephone 6% public bond and the Citibank 7% public bond were also traded.

London British Merchant Far East Companies' stock market prices for this month on the 13th (Thursday): Except for the Mercantile Bank stock rising by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of £7 5 shillings, the rest remained unchanged.

London Chinese Foreign Debt market prices for this month on the 13th (Thursday): The British-German continued loan British-issued bonds fell sharply by £4, with a price of £42. The good-looking loan British-issued bonds also fell by half a pound, with a price of £32. The rest remained unchanged. Actual goods were offered for sale in London, including 3,000 pounds of good-looking loan British-issued bonds, with a selling price of 31.5 pounds, half a pound lower than the market price. Another 3,000 pounds of French-issued bonds with stamps were offered for sale, with a selling price of 29.5 pounds, 2.5 pounds lower than the British-issued listed price.

### Grain; Rice Prices Continue to Fall; No Longer a Small Amount; But Price Limits Remain

Du Geng; The domestic rice market has been in a slump this week. After falling straight down, the high-quality goods have plummeted by more than two yuan, and the old grains have fallen even more miserably, reaching about three yuan. This rice situation is only a tragedy for hoarders. Generally, hoarders mainly aim at profit, and they are not concerned about the people's food problem. Now that the rice price has been strictly limited, there is no profit to be made, so they all stand idly by. At the same time, they are all eager to sell the grains that they hoarded before to avoid losses. Once the morale is lost, they will all follow the trend, and the goods that have been damaged by water or moisture will be sold to each other. Therefore, the chips in the market have suddenly increased by three times compared to the past, while the sales market is wooden, resulting in the market falling day by day, and the more it falls, the more fierce it becomes, thus creating this one-thousand-mile-fall situation. Yesterday, the sales market was dull, and the sellers poured out their inventory in order to get rid of it, so the market situation was even more頹. As a result, the selling price of thick and thin japonica rice fell by another 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and there were no transactions. It was found that the incoming goods from the river included two ships of car wheel buns of more than 2,000 bags to the Songjiang gang. The total turnover of the city was only more than 4,000 stones.

Ke Xian; Yesterday, the sales of local guest rice were dull, and the inventory was full, and the sources were continuous. Under the forced sale of travel stock traders and traffickers, the market immediately saw a tragic fall. High-quality goods can still hold at 16 yuan, 0.3 to 0.4 yuan lower than the previous market, while the goods below the middle grade and the old goods are not inquired, and the decline is huge from 0.5 to 0.6 yuan to 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. However, after the price fell, the sales in this street were slightly active, and the inland rural villages also made up slightly. More than 2,000 bags were opened throughout the day. The Municipal Bureau's price limit has been set to reduce by one yuan next Monday, and the highest price for Xianjian is 16 yuan.

Yang Rice; In the days of adhering to the trend, and with the Xian rice already seeing a tragic fall again, yesterday, Saigon sold more than 100 bags of guest rice in the current market, with a price of only 21.5 yuan, a huge difference of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous opening price of 23 yuan. It is said that the current guest rice is already full of, and the pre-set Yang rice has also been opened, and it is now difficult for Yang rice to stand again.

### Grain; Flour Returned Goods; Selling Price Still Secretly Loose; Local Wheat Weary and Unable to Revive

The current flour factory disk is standing as before. It is found that, except for the sporadic embellishments, there is still no whole batch of way out for customer road transactions. Because the current silver money is quite tight, and the exchange discount is high, some customers are paying attention to the returned goods of exchange selling price. It is heard that the returned goods in the market are still secretly loose, and the price is within 5 yuan, but it is not a formal market, because the factory is now reducing production after stopping the machine and reducing the car, and it is unwilling to compromise too much in this rare production and sales situation.

The wheat market trend is gradually loosening. Recently, new arrivals of various goods are endless, and the way out only relies on the Japanese factory to make slight purchases. It is heard that the Japanese merchants who previously loaded and exported have also stopped doing so, and the Chinese factories ignore the local wheat because the foreign wheat raw materials are still sufficient, so the market is in this environment, and it is tired and unable to revive for a while. Yesterday, there was not much supply in the market, and most of the people holding the goods went to the warehouse to wait for the opportunity and were unwilling to show samples. Only Shanri Factory added more than 300 bags of Nanjing wheat, and the price was loosened from 6.5 yuan to 6.3 yuan, and it has fallen by 0.15 yuan in two days.

### Yarn/Cotton; Hong Kong-Yunnan Buyers' Appetite Not Fading; Yarn Prices Have Risen for Three Consecutive Days; Increasing Numbers of Weavers Reducing Production; Some Profiteers Disgorging Profits

Although the yarn market’s rise is slow, it has nonetheless risen for three consecutive days. In truth, the Hong Kong and Yunnan buyers’ procurement of coarse and fine yarn continues unabated. The Hong Kong buyers bought another 660 bales, and the Yunnan buyers bought 230 bales, for a total of 890 bales. Other regions have been affected by transportation blockages and are unable to transport goods, thus bringing their activities to a halt. As for peers, due to restrictions on loans and overdrafts by the banking and money industry, their activity has been greatly impacted. As such, most recent transactions are actual business, marking a source of stability for the market’s foundation. However, opinions are divided on the extent to which future market price changes will remain within a range of 20 yuan. The recent cotton cloth trade is highly lethargic, with the prices of white plain fabric unstable. Smaller weaving factories are reducing production or shutting down, which is clearly closely related to the yarn market.

The yarn market situation: The market’s discussions upon opening this morning were uniformly optimistic, as demand from Guangxi and Yunnan continued to materialize. The market sentiment elevated, and initial offers rose by two or three yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse was 486.5 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 481 yuan. Because the market momentum was tight and customer sales were also strong, market prices steadily rose. Double Horse for outside godowns reached 491 yuan, and godown receipts once reached 484 yuan. Approaching the close, profiteers disgorged profits, resulting in a slight drop of two or three yuan. The price for Double Horse for outside godowns fell to 488 yuan. The half-day turnover was 1,480 bales. The asking prices for 20-count Double Horse rose by 4 yuan, Shepherd flat, Te Jin Cheng rose by 4 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 4 yuan. The British Jardine factory offered 2,000 bales of 20-count Sheep, priced at 391 yuan, 500 bales of Wufu, priced at 385 yuan, for clearing in one month. The Yong An factory offered 50 bales of 20-count Te Jin Cheng, priced at 505 yuan. Today’s exports of cotton yarn included 1,000 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 2,750 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 310 pieces shipped to Beihai, and 585 pieces shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each region are listed below.

The Japanese yarn market continued to rise, but actual demand remained ordinary. Weaving factories are reducing production due to the impact of poor sales, and demand for cotton yarn is reportedly clearing. The listed price for 20-count Yueqin is reportedly around 389 to 390 yuan.

### Unable to Redeem Mortgaged Cotton; Can Only Use Yarn as Collateral

The New York cotton market was quiet again yesterday. Industries were adopting a wait-and-see attitude to await developments on the Agriculture Ministry’s discussions with major cotton merchants regarding subsidies. The completion of the July term triggered a decline in market prices. Yesterday, Indian figures including forecasts remained unchanged, and Egyptian figures fell by 10 pound coins.

In the Shanghai cotton trade, tight foreign exchange rates once again caused difficulties for the trade. Banks continued to refuse to provide loans for raw cotton. Some factories that had mortgaged cotton in bank warehouses were unable to redeem their goods and could only ship their yarn to trade for raw cotton. This shows the factories’ difficult circumstances.

The local cotton trade has come to a complete halt. As for peer-to-peer transactions, some Indian cotton was traded, but the volume was small, and all were settled using remittance prices, indicating a lack of ready cash. The cotton trade is extremely difficult to conduct. Shipments from Northern Jiangsu have not yet resumed, and thus have still not arrived in Shanghai. Current cotton prices are listed below. Durella; 98.50; peers buy in 300 pieces; remittance, godown trade. Pingguo Er; 81.50; Gao’s company buys in; 200 pieces; remittance, godown trade.

### Piece Goods; Successful Trial Run of Southwest Transport Line; Hope for Activity in Cloth Sales; New Wenzhou Shipping Line Also Under Trial Run

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday’s sales remained poor, and the asking prices continued to drop. However, recent developments in Southwest transport were good. In the past, goods loaded in Sichuan and Yunnan were concentrated in Haiphong, but it has been difficult to ship out of Haiphong, with goods being stored for too long, bearing huge risks and costs, and struggling with a difficult turnover. Recently, British shipping companies expanded their South China shipping route plan, transshipping from Saigon to Kunming. After the trial run, there were no delays along the route. As such, goods from Sichuan and Yunnan have a new shortcut, and there is hope for activity in trading. After the discontinuation of the Wenzhou shipping line, goods are now being imported through Shacheng, south of Wenzhou, and transported through Ruian to Wenzhou, allowing goods transport. A trial run was conducted yesterday, trading 30 to 40 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, serge, and other goods. The aforementioned shipping will develop if unobstructed. Southwest buyers have gradually increased the amount of goods, including Yue and Hong Kong buyers buying in 50 pieces of Ai Zi Fu Gui and other fine twill, fine cloth, Earth coarse cloth, and other goods, as well as 1,000 bolts of color cloth and color twill. Sichuan and Yunnan buyers bought in 3000 bolts of color cloth, color twill, serge, line woolen cloth, printed cloth, satin, plush, and other goods. Overseas buyers from Singapore and other locations bought in over 1,000 bolts of color cloth and color twill. Sales in the current market and the Soviet-controlled areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are declining due to the cheap prices of East piece goods.

East Piece Goods

Because sales of fine cloth and fine twill were lethargic, they were repeatedly discounted. Yesterday’s market price for Longtou fine cloth was 13.25 yuan, and the East Cotton Foreign Firm’s ask price was very low, with the current ask price only 13.2 yuan and the price for this month’s futures 13.3 yuan. Although only dozens of bales were traded, industry members were more and more apprehensive, and the willingness to buy in the current market grew weaker, with the market remaining soft.

Exports

On the 15th, 260 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, 92 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 10 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 180 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### Autumn and Winter Woolen Fabrics Already Rising

Autumn and winter woolen fabrics such as plain thick woolen cloth, melton, wide and tight camel hair, thick and thin serge, shammy Han Limeng, yuan zhi tribute wool, colored zi tribute wool, twill cashmere breeches fabric, British and Polish-made overcoat fabric, horse palm-sleeved black light lining, Western-style Chinese clothing flannel, Chongshi Pao Tieke Si, single-sided high-striped flannel, and other fabrics that are used for autumn and winter clothing are rising dramatically. Shoe flannel, as well as 4026 single-sided open water rice, is also being offered at expensive prices. Yesterday, 707 and 1080 Polish plain thick woolen cloth were offered at 4.75 yuan per case (the closing price in February was 4.1 yuan). Single-sided high-striped flannel of British manufacture was offered at 13.5 yuan (previously only sold for 12 yuan), and Japanese goods with artificial cotton were offered at 6 yuan.

### Silk/Tea; Muki Paralyzed in Europe; Cheaply Dumped Chinese Silk

Overseas silk markets are firm in both Japan and the U.S., with Lyon also following the rise. Yokohama spot goods were not traded yesterday, with the price for July at 1,190 yuan, up by 7 yuan, and the far term at 1,143 yuan, up by 8 yuan. New York spot goods were sold at the original price, with the near term up by 1 point and the far term up by 1.5 points. Japanese silk in Lyon rose by 2 shirangs. Shanghai silk (grade A) rose by 2 francs; the rest was sold at the prior price. Silk sales overseas, such as in the two most important markets of New York and Lyon, have been dulled by the dumping of cheap, large amounts of “controlled” silk from the occupied areas of China by the Japanese. Reportedly, the Chinese silk dumped by the Japanese in Lyon is a huge 40 francs lower per kilo compared to that sold in Shanghai. As such, Shanghai’s sales in France have been unable to develop.

The local silk market has seen little new development in recent days. Silk prices have shown little fluctuation, and trading is limited to Tin silk and Eri silk. Yesterday, Da Chang and others bought nearly 20 loads from the Bai factory; the price was the same as in the previous market. Eri silk prices were slightly tired, with frying and selling at 1,200 yuan. Yesterday, an electric telegram was requested to discuss the price.

### Hardware; Large Tinplate Scarce in Current Market

Large tinplate is currently the rarest of all hardware goods circulating in the market, resulting in high standards. This is because of the thin current volume, as well as a lack of shipments of spot goods from overseas. In addition, merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yantai, Fuzhou, and inland have been aggressively collecting, and factories and peers in this market (such as yarn bobbin factories, lock factories, and toy factories) are also actively buying. Reportedly, only one hardware company on North Suzhou Road has some inventory of this good. Those holding goods are thinking of asking high prices, with 20-gauge currently offered at 200 yuan and 26-gauge at 180 yuan.

### Materia Medica: Gold and Silver Flower Gradually Increases

Gold and silver flower is produced in Shanxi, also known as Ji Gold and Silver Flower. Since the new goods entered the market, although the source is not continuous, various businesses have frequent needs, and there is a feeling of demand exceeding supply, so the selling price has been increasing day by day. It was found that after the previous market opened at 73.5 yuan, it immediately rose to 80 yuan. At present, the market has already called for 85 yuan, and is in negotiations with customers.

### Seafood: Jinshan Shrimp Tails Both Arriving and Selling are Scarce

Jinshan shrimp tails have had very few buyers recently, and the source is also scarce. The inventory here is already affected by mold, and all are stored in refrigerated warehouses. It was found that eastern goods such as Chaozhou flat tails are only selling for 115 or 116 yuan. Western goods are still bland and unremarkable, currently the market price is only 185 yuan for large ones and 180 yuan for small ones.

Traffic and Transportation Weekly

### Taikoo Adds a Route to Siam

— Su

There was no direct route from Shanghai to Siam. Anyone wishing to go to Siam had to take a boat from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then transfer to a Taikoo company ship. Recently, the company has seen a daily increase in passenger and freight traffic to Siam, so it has decided to add a Shanghai-Siam route. The company's Suzhou ship sailed on the 11th of this month, stopping at Hong Kong, Tourane in Annam, Saigon, and reaching Bangkok in Siam. The entire journey takes 16 days. Afterwards, the company will send a ship to Siam every week. The ticket price for the large cabin from Shanghai to Tourane and Saigon is HK$135, the official cabin is 140 yuan in national currency, the room cabin is 108 yuan, the bunk is 79 yuan, and the steerage is 56 yuan. The ticket price for the large cabin to Bangkok is HK$150, the official cabin is 182 yuan in national currency, the room cabin is 141 yuan, the bunk is 104 yuan, and the steerage is 73 yuan.

Saigon is the Nanjing of Annam, and even more so the important port for foreign trade in Annam. The Vietnam National Railway starts here, 1,750 kilometers away from Hanoi, Beijing. Tourane is located between Saigon and Hanoi, also on the railway line. Passengers and goods who wish to transfer from the above two ports to the interior of our country can take the railway directly from the above two ports to Dong Dang on the border of Vietnam, and then they will be in Guangxi Province of our country, which is also quite convenient. All Chinese people entering or passing through must have a passport, which can only be processed after being signed by the French consulate.

Bangkok is the capital of Siam, the center of the railway, and has convenient water and land transportation. The business community is prosperous. There are 300,000 Chinese expatriates living in the city, controlling the city's commerce. Therefore, many Chinese people travel to and from this port. Anyone going to Siam must have a passport issued by a Chinese government agency, which can only be processed after being approved by the Siamese consulate (it is found that there is no Siamese consulate in Shanghai, but there is one in Hong Kong). At the same time, a landing deposit of 250 baht (equivalent to more than 870 yuan in national currency) must be paid upon arrival in Siam. If you have a certificate from the Siamese authorities allowing re-entry, you can be exempt from paying. The deposit will be refunded after a considerable period of time. In addition to submitting a smallpox and epidemic prevention certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department upon landing, you must also undergo an eye examination by a medical officer sent by the authorities. Anyone with trachoma will not be allowed to land.

### The Vietnamese Government Will Change the Entry Method for Foreigners

— Xun

All Chinese people entering Vietnam must have a passport to leave the country, which will only be allowed to enter after being signed by the French consulate. According to the regulations of the French consulate, a signing fee of 75 francs should be paid for requesting an entry signature, and a residence tax should be paid after arriving in Vietnam. (16 Vietnamese yuan per year, 12 yuan for half a year, 8 yuan for three months).

According to previous reports, from July 1 of this year, the French-Vietnamese government will restrict the entry of foreigners, and each person should pay 100 Vietnamese yuan upon entry, and increase the residence permit fee. According to an inquiry from our consulate general in Hanoi, Vietnam, the French-Vietnamese government does have this intention, but the amount of the increase will not be as much as rumored. The consulate is currently negotiating with the French-Vietnamese authorities, and it has not yet been decided when it will be implemented and how much it will be increased. As for those who pass through Vietnam to go to the interior of our country, this is not the case. They only need to submit a financial guarantee when requesting the French consulate to affix a transit signature. If the consulate considers the guarantee to be unqualified, the applicant must pay a deposit of 100 Vietnamese yuan, which can be refunded when leaving Vietnam in the future.

### Procedures for Studying in the United States (II)

— Xing

Preparation Problems

1. Clothing: Clothing is quite important for anyone going to the United States to study or travel. Being abroad, one person represents not only the individual, but is often seen as a representative of a country and a nation. People who do not know each other often use appearance as the standard. Therefore, for clothing, although it is not necessary to be very particular, the word "cleanliness" cannot be ignored. American students are sometimes very casual about their clothes, depending on the habits of different places and schools. Of course, Chinese students can follow the customs, but they must always be above the waterline to avoid being ridiculed by people from other countries. Now, the preparation of clothing before going to the United States is briefly described for men and women:

Men: Male classmates going to the United States, although they all wear suits, it is okay to bring a set of Chinese clothes made of domestic silk. You can wear them at banquets and use them as formal wear. It is best to make ordinary suits at home and bring them with you. It is best to make two pairs of trousers for each suit for convenience. As for the color, thickness, number of sets, etc.: it depends on how long each person stays in the United States, the climate of the region, and each person's choice. There cannot be a fixed standard. The material should be strong, durable, and not easy to change. The suits made of domestic woolen fabrics in our country are similar in quality to those in Europe and the United States, and they can be worn with pride. The climate in the northern United States is cold, so warmer clothes must be prepared. Summer clothes are necessary in the United States, whether it is north or south. Shirts can be made and brought from home. The style should be with a collar and single cuffs to avoid the trouble of washing the neck and changing the cufflinks. White is the most suitable color. It is best to bring fewer silk shirts, because the washing fee is too high and it is easy to damage. In addition, ties, shoes, hats, socks, raincoats, pajamas, underwear, etc., can be brought as needed.

Women: It is best for female classmates going abroad to adopt a "self-sufficient policy." Most of the Chinese female classmates in the United States wear domestic clothes, one is because of habit, and the other is that Chinese clothes are not particularly different from Western clothes. At the same time, the styles of Western clothes often change, and there are also different requirements for dresses for various banquets, which students who are just going to the United States cannot be familiar with. The only way to avoid this is to wear Chinese clothes. Anyway, Americans cannot find fault with this. The clothes are mainly lined single clothes, and at most a few pieces of thin velvet are made, because the temperature indoors in the United States is always very high, no matter where it is. The material is mainly absolute "domestic goods," which not only promotes domestic goods, but also implies the meaning of promoting national quintessence. The clothes worn to banquets should be more exquisite, such as some embroidery, which is even better. You should prepare a few pieces of them. Silk is the best for ordinary clothes, because silk is considered a luxury item in the United States, but it is not considered expensive in our country. It is much cheaper to make Western clothes at home and bring them with you, and the craftsmanship of domestic Western tailors is not bad. It is best to use domestic woolen fabrics for the material. As for coats, they are indispensable in the United States. Leather coats are regarded as very luxurious items in the United States, but they are not considered anything in our country. It is best to use reverse leather for the clothes. It is very useful to prepare one or two pieces to bring with you. Spring and autumn coats can be purchased in the United States, and the price will not be very expensive. It is best to buy silk stockings in the United States, because the weaving method and the fineness of the silk are not comparable to domestic goods. A good pair of silk stockings can be bought for about one US dollar, and ordinary ones are not bad for a few cents.

2. Other Supplies: Hotels and houses in the United States are fully equipped with bedding, so you don't need to bring them. Blankets are also unnecessary. Towels and bath towels are usually available, and they are not expensive to buy. Other things such as the national flag, maps, dictionaries, and stationery are of course indispensable. In addition, it is best to bring some Chinese cultural materials and works of art, such as paintings, photos, embroidery, sculptures, and other small display items, which can not only be given as gifts, but also used to promote Chinese culture. Publications related to general information and various records are also very useful. Tea leaves can be duty-free if they are not more than five pounds. It is best to use green tea for gifts. Americans like floral fragrance and do not care much about the quality of the tea. In places where there are fewer Chinese students, there is more social interaction and more opportunities to give lectures. All kinds of things are useful. On the other hand, in places where there are many Chinese students, there is less social interaction, and everyone does not think that Chinese people are rare, and there is less communication. Those who are good at Chinese music may wish to bring some musical instruments and scores with them, which can be played sometimes. You can bring a "Steamer Trunk" and a suitcase for the suitcase. All kinds of domestic goods can be purchased, but you must not be greedy for cheap. It is not worth it if it is damaged halfway. If you plan to travel a lot in the United States, you can buy a suitcase for hanging clothes, otherwise it is not necessary.

### The Frenchman Teaches Chinese to the Stove

In ancient China, there was Zhu Daosheng, who entered Tiger Hill and gathered stones as disciples to lecture on the Nirvana Sutra. Unexpectedly, there is a celebrity in France named Julien, who teaches Chinese to the stove. It can be said that it is a rare occurrence. Julien is quite proficient in Chinese characters, and the books he translated are too numerous to mention. Later, he was elected as a teacher of Chinese in a university. According to the rules of each teacher, he must often be in the college, reciting the essence of Chinese before receiving guests. When he first took office, he scheduled to give a lecture on Chinese literature every Thursday. After more than a month, no one came to listen. Only the stove facing each other in the empty hall was his companion every day. Julien still talked incessantly, as if the audience in the hall was crowded and overwhelming. How can the stove be expected to benefit from listening to the lecture? One day, suddenly many well-dressed men and women sat in rows and watched. Julien was overjoyed, thinking that from now on, Chinese literature would have the hope of revitalization. So Julien saw the women surrounding him, and simply talked generously to please them. He translated and began to lecture on a poem by Lin Hejing, which compared women to plum blossoms in Hangzhou. His posture was lively, and his words were eloquent, which was more vivid than when he was facing the stove in the empty hall. The listeners were delighted to see his expression, and they were all very happy. They were still laughing and jumping when they left! By the next lecture period, more guests came, including a scholar who had just arrived. Julien was very happy to see him, secretly thinking that he would get a faithful disciple here. He continued to teach for a quarter, and this scholar came with men and women every time, without missing a class, which was undoubtedly the most loyal disciple. When the quarter was over, someone told Julien: "This person is a guide in the French capital. Tourists visiting Paris want to appreciate the famous and strange sights. Your lecture to the stove is also listed among the strange sights, so he leads tourists to listen. And your lecture expression, Loswai spirited, tourists think it is indeed one of the strange sights, so they are quite satisfied."

Spring and Autumn

### If Ah Q Were Born Today

— Xu Xingzhi

This has become a monument to Chinese cultural studies, and Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," which has caused a sensation in the world of literature, is not only a biography of a marginalized person, but also a picture of the declining Chinese rural life. It not only reflects the historical background of the Xinhai Revolution, but also writes about the decline of the feudal system, the collapse of the rural economy, and the social symptoms of capitalism invading the countryside.

Mr. Lu Xun used his chisel-like, vivid pen and woodcut-like carved words to portray Ah Q and the "ghosts" around him in a vivid way. Although it is a rough-line prose, as a painter, I think it is a vivid "sketch" that is rare in ancient and modern times.

Unfortunately, I am not a sculptor and cannot carve out a three-dimensional Ah Q group portrait; nor am I an archaeologist to deeply explore Ah Q's family history. Because I am a theater worker who loves drama, I want to turn the "flat" Ah Q into a three-dimensional Ah Q, and turn the written Ah Q into a living Ah Q dressed up by actors. Therefore, my fiery passion for bringing "The True Story of Ah Q" to the stage has encountered many obstacles, but no one can stop me and cool my passion.

Although some people say that the time of Ah Q has passed, Ah Q and the "ghosts" around him have not completely disappeared in the Chinese countryside. The dregs of the sins of the feudal landlords, the rebellious traces of the comprador class's exploitation, and the ugly remnants of corrupt officials and bureaucrats are still rampant in the cities and villages of present-day China, and they are obstructing the war of resistance and the revolution in many ways. Wherever a certain force reaches, they often put on the clothes of puppets and take the stage.

If someone asks: What should Ah Q do if he were born today? This question has been considered in my mind for a long time. Finally, I believe that Ah Q would not be used as a "traitor" if he were born today. Because to be a "traitor," you must have the conditions of a "traitor," and Ah Q cannot be competent.

Furthermore, although he is unclear, he has a deep hatred and resentment towards local tyrants and evil gentry, corrupt officials and bureaucrats, compradores and their masters. Even though he did not explicitly express his determination to fight them, he never expressed his intention to surrender to their dark forces.

Moreover, in his low-energy mind, there often floats a yearning for "revolution," "Revolution, revolution, revolutionize the life of this bunch of mothers, too hateful! Too hateful!" This is precisely the voice of justice shouted from his heart. I think this kind of cry is stronger than his "son beating father" spirit of victory.

If Ah Q were born today, I believe that he might follow the hooligans and rascals to rob things after being drunk. He might listen to rumors and be terrified, and run away with a group of old and weak refugees. Maybe he would shout "Rebel! Rebel!" in the Tugu Temple and help the guerrillas do odd jobs. It depends on how the local anti-Japanese sentiment is and how it is reflected in his subconscious.

If the local guerrilla leadership is excellent, Ah Q will undoubtedly stand in the anti-Japanese camp. Otherwise, will he either escape or continue his wandering life as a marginalized person?

I believe that Ah Q will never volunteer to be a "traitor." I also believe that when a certain party or a traitor walks past him, he will at least spit on the ground in deep hatred and resentment to express his hatred for these heretics?

However, are such people the fighters we need now? Of course not, because Ah Q is simply not qualified to be a fighter for the anti-Japanese national salvation. However, on the other hand, should such people be shot? This is too much of an overdone work that buries humanity, right? Let's not forget that people will develop. If Ah Q were born today, would he be worse or better? At least he would be somewhat different from Ah Q during the Xinhai Revolution?

Everyone thought that Mr. Lu Xun shot Ah Q, but this is just a superficial explanation. You must know that it was not Mr. Lu Xun who shot Ah Q, but the dark forces of the local tyrants and evil gentry and corrupt officials and bureaucrats during the Xinhai Revolution. It was not the author of "The True Story of Ah Q" who sentenced Ah Q to death, but the chaotic era of the collapse of feudal society and the bankruptcy of the rural economy.

### Saving the Buds of the Nation

— Starfire

Equal Emphasis on Education and Nurturing, Developing Life Skills

Reforming Habits, Enhancing Preparation for Life

Some children grow up in greenhouse-like families, while others are born to suffer the ravages of wind, frost, rain, and snow. Is there a difference in their nature? No, this is merely a symptom of the current societal illness and, at the same time, a disgrace to us adults.

In Shanghai, the large number of homeless children has already become a serious social problem. Especially after the outbreak of war, refugees from various places flocked to the isolated island, further increasing the number of homeless children. They have not yet reached the age of self-reliance, and in extremely harsh environments, except for a very small number who become vendors or child laborers, most beg on the streets all day. When forced to, some even become petty thieves. Therefore, the issue of rescuing homeless children is becoming increasingly serious and urgent today.

In mid-February of this year, I saw the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's plan to establish a beggars' education and nurturing home, and I knew that advanced people enthusiastic about social causes had already noticed the importance of educating and nurturing beggars and were carrying out this very meaningful work. At that time, in addition to feeling inspired, I also sincerely hoped that this plan would be realized soon. Recently, I received a report on the progress of the Beggars' Education and Nurturing Home (now named Shanghai Children's Home), and I learned that the home has appointed responsible personnel to begin raising funds for beggars' clothing and supplies. This news made the author feel infinitely happy—happy for the bright future filled with hope for the countless suffering children in Shanghai.

Here are a few personal opinions I would like to contribute to the gentlemen in charge of the Shanghai Children's Home, to express my sincere support:

Earnestly strive for equal emphasis on education and nurturing. In addition to imparting general knowledge, attention should be paid to developing life skills, reforming the behavior and character of beggars, so that they can support themselves after leaving the home and become good and promising citizens.

Cultivate the habit of perseverance and hard work, understand the current world and national trends, and enhance preparation for life.

Most of the suffering children who receive education and nurturing at the Children's Home have struggled and fought for a long time on the brink of starvation and cold. They possess the vitality to overcome their environment and are also eager to learn and progress. As long as we can teach according to their aptitude and enable them to develop their individual strengths, we will surely be able to cultivate many brilliant geniuses from the group of suffering children.

Children are the lifeblood of the nation, the buds of the nation. Child welfare has long been listed as an important policy in advanced countries. In an ideal society, homeless children would not exist. If someone attributes the tendency of suffering children to become thieves or loafers to their own unwillingness to learn or their inherently bad nature, then please read the fairy tale "The Watch" translated by Mr. Lu Xun. It will tell you how a homeless child repents in a new environment and becomes a child of the new era.

### (3) The Benefits of Closeness to God (Continued from Yesterday)

— Xie

(1) Closeness to God is most beneficial to prayer and can foster a sense of awe and devotion in people. (2) Closeness to God gives us a firm belief in God and fearlessness towards enemies. Fearlessness towards enemies. We can endure all hardships because we know that God is near and will surely deliver us from our troubles. (3) Closeness to God can make people always happy. (4) Closeness to God will generate humility because the closer we are to God, the more we realize the difference between ourselves and God, and the more we realize God's infinite grace in giving us clothing, food, and shelter, so that we lack nothing. --Prayer-- Lord, help me not to forget my position because of wealth, not to forget God because of poverty, not to leave the Lord's path because of happiness, and not to disobey the Lord's command because of fear. Lord, may your spirit always be with me, giving me a loving heart, uprightness and impartiality, honesty and loyalty, filling me with the spirit of religion, hating evil as if it were an enemy, and following good as if it were flowing water. Also, Lord, make me humble and obedient, zealous and devout, not jealous of the good deeds of others, and at the same time, extremely self-respecting, not to be looked down upon by others. If I do wrong, Lord, teach me and correct me.

The above prayer can be read once a day to draw closer to God. --Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Society, P.O. Box 1227

### The Sky Clears After the Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes in the Countryside Cooperate in Fireworks, Myriad Miles of Waves Flying on the Ocean

In the Free Village, the most diligent efforts are put into two things: collectivism and cooperation. In terms of collectivism, they have collective farms, collective pig farms, collective chicken farms, and so on. They are also preparing to establish collective factories in the future. In terms of cooperation, they have consumer cooperatives, production cooperatives, and other cooperative enterprises that are also underway. In their village, there is a cooperative store, which initially had very little capital, only three hundred yuan when it was first opened. This was initiated by a nephew of the Village Chief Zhu. When it was launched, each share was five yuan, raising sixty shares. At that time, it was stipulated that each person could only have one share, so sixty people were gathered, which was also considered a trial run. The cooperative store sells daily necessities. When they first started, it was all a kind of game. Who knew that it would become an important consumer institution in the Free Village today? China has always had a so-called small grocery store, which exists in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas, it can be expanded into a department store, but large department stores are gradually becoming monopolies. In rural areas, however, it takes a convenience-oriented approach. When the Free New Village was first organized, there were some things they had to go to other towns to buy, which was inconvenient, wasn't it? Therefore, they organized this cooperative store, with sixty villagers as shareholders, stipulating the sale of sixty kinds of goods. The manager of this cooperative store is a cousin of Zhu Ai'ren, named Zhu Aili. He had not studied the essence of any cooperative law, nor had he graduated from any business school. They just said they were happy, so they did it. The Free Village also has a main street, with several more elaborate buildings on that street. There is also a postal agency, a bus station, a village assembly hall, a small vegetable market, and a newly established public education center, a village library, and so on. Zhu Aili borrowed a room next to the postal agency and set up this cooperative store. The first goods sold were all those light and handy daily necessities, such as soap, towels, envelopes, stationery, school supplies, household sundries, matches, candles, and the like. But later it expanded to include flashlights, rubber shoes, thermos bottles, as well as undershirts, socks, straw hats, yarn, children's toys, and so on. Initially, it was stipulated that there would be sixty kinds of goods, but now there are more than sixty kinds. Moreover, the capital of three hundred yuan was not enough, so it was expanded to a capital of one thousand yuan, with each share changed to ten yuan, still stipulating that each person could only buy one share, but if a family has eight people, regardless of age, perhaps they can have eight shares.

### Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme

— Sihua

Three Lovers Hao Naucy

This is a "delicacy" specially cooked by an American playwright for young masters. When the young masters are tired of playing with fashionable girls in the city, it tells you to taste the flavor of rural girls, the so-called "After eating delicacies, you feel that green vegetables and radishes are beautiful." What the playwright of "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme" has brought out are "green vegetables and radishes," but "fragrant herbs" and "humor" have been added to the "green vegetables and radishes," so that the young masters are satisfied and smile when they see them. These are things that poor boys cannot imagine and have no time to think about. Only the "hunting for the unusual" minds of the young masters growing up in the golden country can create such an ideal "delicacy."

However, the American director's "fancy cake" is made brilliantly. It looks like a fictional story, but it is handled very compactly, lively, and humorously. Leaving aside the ideology, just talking about the technique, those vulgar Chinese directors should learn from it. For example: (1) When Lanxi was getting on the train, she dropped something. Nairishi went to get it for her, but when he turned around, the train had already started. Lanxi shouted on the train, and Nairishi chased after it on the station. The shot showed Nairishi's close-up of his eyes wide open (the lens zoomed out rapidly). (2) Nairishi took Lanxi to a dance. Lanxi casually nodded to a man sitting next to her. The man came over to greet her, but she said she didn't know him. Later, when she saw the burning dish, Lanxi thought it was an accident and rushed over to put it out with water, causing everyone to laugh. These scenes can make the audience laugh. But remember, it's not its boring content, it's its lively technique.

Among the three protagonists here, Meng Gaomao Lai's performance is the most humorous. His sleepwalking as he learns Fulanqi's dreamwalking, his godly smile after entering the quilt, and his facial expressions are also commendable. Lanxi and Luoba's family members meet, and his smug attitude is also vivid. Fulanqi plays Luoba, and his scenes are fewer than Meng Gaomao Lai's, with more ordinary scenes, but his personality is quite obvious. His drunken and confused look is very consistently maintained. Zhenni Gairuo, who plays Lanxi, works very hard, but her age shows that she is not very suitable for this character. At least, she doesn't bring out the youthful and lively taste of a rural girl in the first half of the play. Her appearance and movements are very urban.

### Mr. Feng Chaoran's Revised Poetry

— Buddha

Mr. Feng Chaoran is the Wang Shi Gu [a famous painter] of today. His small paintings are treasures sought after throughout the country. I have discussed painting with him at length, and he knows the origins and schools as if counting family treasures. In addition to painting and calligraphy, he also enjoys writing poetry. He once said that painting and calligraphy have no fixed value. If painting and calligraphy are regarded as merchandise, then the quality is inferior. But if painting and calligraphy are not the same as merchandise, I don't know what the world will regard them as. He also said: I have now revised the remuneration rates, slightly increasing them. People may be surprised by the high value, but today's things have all doubled in value, or even several times. Why can't painting and calligraphy be increased? Moreover, bustling people all seek their livelihood. I am also a human being, and I also depend on this for my porridge, clothing, and food. An ancient poem says: "I paint green mountains for you to buy, which is better than making evil money in the world." Therefore, those who are addicted to my paintings in the world will appreciate them and enjoy them all their lives, and I will take their value to feed my mouth, isn't it clear that I am not ashamed of my heart? I was deeply moved by his words, so I read Mr. Feng's recent poem on increasing the remuneration rates and wrote it down in a rambling way. Mr. Feng's poem is as follows:

In youth I did not learn swordsmanship, I rely on the writing brush for my livelihood, the world is difficult, it is still difficult to remove habits.

Du Fu suffered when writing poetry, Lu Gong had difficulty begging for rice, plowing the clouds and cultivating inkstones, relying on remuneration at the tip of the brush.

Entertainment World

### Xun Huisheng is Coming South

— Master of the Aiping Studio

Recently, it has been rumored in the local theater world that Xun Huisheng, one of the four famous Dan actresses, has been hired by a major theater in the city and will be coming south at the end of August. Is this news accurate? We will know later. Now, I will briefly describe Xun Huisheng's life as a prelude to his coming south, which I believe readers will be happy to hear!

Xun Huisheng, originally named Ci, styled Xuansheng, is from Dongguang, Zhili. He first entered the school of Pang Qihua to learn Qinqiang Huadan, and attended Zhengleshe as a supplementary student. He and Qingyi Shang Xiaoyun were known together. His initial stage name was "White Peony," because his supporters founded the White Society to promote him. His Erhuang Qingyi was taught by Xue Fen. His performance skills are truly excellent. Once he appears on stage, he can identify with the character in the play, lively and vivid, with drama all over his body. Now, I will briefly describe his singing, dialogue, and acting to introduce him:

(1) Singing: Xun Huisheng's singing is as gentle as a woman, without the vigor of Mei (Lanfang) and Shang (Xiaoyun), but purely wins with gentleness. It is moist and tactful, rising and falling freely, without showing any dryness. This can be demonstrated by the play "Yu Tang Chun." Almost all Qingyi actresses can perform the play "Yu Tang Chun," but it is rare for one person to perform the entire play. The three of the four famous Dan actresses, Mei, Shang, and Cheng, have never sung the entire play, only performing "Qijie" and "Huishen." At most, they sing to "Tuanyuan." Only Xun Huisheng starts from "Piaoyuan," including "Shuzhuang," "Miaohui," "Beipian," "Qijie," "Huishen," "Tanjian," and ending with "Datianyuan." One person plays Yu Tang Chun. The singing and acting are heavy, but he never tires, making people amazed.

(2) Dialogue: Xun Huisheng's dialogue interacts with his acting. His facial expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy also follow. He is very able to understand the psychology and temperament.

(3) Acting: Xun Huisheng's acting is the best among the four famous Dan actresses. He really puts himself in the shoes of the character in the play. Whether he plays a daughter of a noble family or a girl from a small family, he can vividly and wonderfully convey the heart of a girl, and he is considerate and meticulous, but he does not cross the line of love and reason, and does not involve frivolity. This is even more difficult.

(4) Martial Arts: Xun Huisheng has had a foundation in martial arts since he was a child. Because he had also learned Qinqiang, he also worked hard on the stilt work. Therefore, the beauty of his stilt work is unparalleled except for Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua). For example, in the second book of "Hong Ni Guan," Dongfang Shi's climbing the tent (Huisheng plays "Hong Ni Guan," always playing Dongfang Shi by himself, unlike other troupes where the first part of Dongfang Shi and the second part play the maid.), and Zou Shi's falling in "Zhan Wan Cheng," the stability and beauty of his skills show that his martial arts are beyond the reach of others.

(5) Appearance: Xun Huisheng's appearance is beautiful, charming, and gentle, giving people a sense of beauty. Especially the expression in the corners of his eyes and eyebrows almost makes people suspect that he is not a man. It can also be seen that his appearance has reached perfection!

The above five items are only a brief description, and they are not enough to describe even one percent of his art. What is even more surprising is the large number of new plays, which can be called "second to none." These new plays are all very elegant in compilation and do not involve any roughness. There are dozens of them, such as "Xi Hu Zhu," "Hong Li Ji," "Qintou Feng," "Dan Qing Yin," "Yuanxiao Mi," "Xiu Xiao Ji," "Huan Zhu Yin," "Xiang Luo Dai," "Jing Chai Ji," "Liu Rushi," "Yizhang Qing," and "Hong Lou Eryou." The playwrights, such as Chen Moxian and Chen Jianxi, are all famous playwrights. Therefore, the value of these new plays is also extraordinary!

Huisheng's fame is mostly due to his acting skills, but he has also benefited from the constant emergence of new plays. He has not been to Shanghai for seven or eight years! If the news of his coming south is true, then these wonderful plays will be presented to the theater-loving gentlemen of Shanghai to satisfy their thirst!

### Actors, Amateurs, and Movie Stars at the New New Radio Station

— Haisheng

Participating in a Broadcast Charity Sale for the Epidemic Hospital

From 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, figures from the acting, amateur, and movie star worlds gathered at the New New Radio Station to hold another broadcast charity sale for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Because there were movie stars participating, the situation seemed to be more lively. He and she called on many movie fans, who all donated money to the radio station to visit. There was also an honorary seat, which was specially given to the most generous donors.

This new New New Radio Station is located in a tea room. The broadcast room is completely made of glass, so people sitting outside can both hear and see. On this day, the comrades from the acting, amateur, and movie star worlds all showed their true faces clearly in front of the audience. From the perspective of the visitors, the people broadcasting in the glass room looked like tropical fish.

This time, the amateur group was responsible for the organization. People like Bao Xiaodie, Yuan Senqi, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wu Benshan, and Wang Qijun were all busy with reception and reporting work. There were also many famous amateurs who came to participate in the broadcast.

The movie stars' broadcasting time started at 5:00 p.m. Zhang Shichuan and Liu Jiqun were the first to report to the radio station. Then Zhang Shankun and Tong Yuejuan, Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, Wang Xianzhai, Han Lan'yao, Yin Xiucen, Gong Jianong, Wang Jiting, Hong Jingling, etc. were also successively picked up by cars sent by the hospital. The most notable for movie fans were Yin Xiucen, Han Langen, and Liu Jiqun, three treasures. When they sang "Wang Laowu" together, their strange appearances made the visitors laugh non-stop. Among the influence there are many who sing Peking opera, Wang Xianzhai, whom we consider to be a "bad guy," also sang a section of Qingyi.

From 8:15 p.m., the amateur actors continued to broadcast and sing. Qilin Tong and Gao Baisui both came with their wives. Yan Jupeng sat for a while and left without singing. His daughter, Miss Huizhu, sang a piece of "June Snow," with her brother Shaopeng playing the zither in cooperation. Until 3:00 a.m., the person in charge thanked the audience and reported the results. This charity sale was a complete success.

### Star Six Star Chronicle Four - Jin Lili

The other day, Master Ti telegraphed me, saying that he usually does not like to dance and does not read dance articles, but he enjoys your works because they are well-observed and full of fun. I didn't expect Master Ti to be so intelligent, but he was deceived by me. My dancing skills are clumsy, and I am restricted by the curfew at home, so I dare not comment on dance skills, nor do I have time to explore all the secrets in the dance floor. Like a butcher cooking meat, I feel a lack of main raw materials, and I have to piece them together and add some spices. Ha ha.

Last year, when I first came to the metropolis, a senior friend said to me, "If you want to know which dancer here is the lightest, I said, "It's easy to know, the short and exquisite ones are light." It got to the point where he asked him to introduce me, saying "Jin Lili." Try to dance with her. It's as if there is no one in front of you, but in reality, there is someone. It was magical. After being amazed for a long time, I heard the reason. He said, "Just study hard." I remember that a musician, for every piece of music, cannot show it to others unless he has played it more than a thousand times. Therefore, Lili's words are not careless.

Lili's figure is moderate, not one of the skinny and weak ones. Her appearance is only average, but her words are gentle, and her demeanor is generous, not arrogant or mean, a top choice. In the spring, the Paramount held an election for the top ten dancers, and Lili was one of them. She is not good at reading, and she is said to be willing to engage in science. She has no special love for Peking opera, she can already hum some tunes. Her voice is sweet, with a wide range, unlike a woman. Later, I don't know from where she heard my name and asked to study with me. I praised her ambition and agreed, but I was actually ashamed. Many of the small details were not corrected.

The other day, Lili asked someone to invite me to drink at her residence. When I arrived, her manager came out to greet me, and he seemed familiar. Lili showed me a photo, with twelve people in it. The person in the middle was my father, with me and Xiaocun sitting on either side. The Jin's manager was standing behind my father. It was about ten years ago, so the Jin's manager was once a student of mine. Now Lili is my student again, there must be a reason. When Jin's mother heard that I had arrived, she also came out to greet me, speaking with a Pudong accent. Mother and son both muttered that they never thought that they would have a livelihood, relying on Lili's efforts. They couldn't help but sob! Jin also sighed with emotion! Then I comforted her, saying that the dance floor is a good place to choose a good husband. With Lili's steadiness, wisdom, and resourcefulness, there is no need to worry about her falling into the lower reaches. At that time, Lili turned her face away, as if she were sobbing. I couldn't bear to talk about it anymore, so I turned to ask about her family. According to her, her father has been unemployed for almost thirty years. The person who supports the family after her father is her manager. He has served in the military in Fujian for many years. When the war started, he engaged in various businesses, taking on the burden alone, and now it is all on Lili's shoulders, and Lili is suffering. Her mother also knows that Lili is suffering, so she has her niece and younger brother help her, and she is also eager to choose a husband for her. I said, "Do you know how difficult it is to choose a husband?" She said, "I know, but what should I do?" I said, "Do you mean that once Lili finds a good husband, the family's livelihood will be guaranteed by the husband, and Lili's heavy burden can be relieved?" Jin's mother nodded happily and said, "Sir, your words are what I think." I said, "Wait a minute. Do you know that your husband must bear the burden of your Jin family's life, and also bear the burden of his own family's life? One person lives, and dozens of people eat. How can your husband's suffering be described? If your husband suffers, can Lili not suffer? If you become a concubine for a rich man, buying a concubine is like a merchant buying goods. Once her beauty fades, she will be discarded like worn-out shoes. Will your family be guaranteed what it depends on? Therefore, your family should plan to be frugal. Those who have worked before should not refuse low salaries to find a way out. Lili should choose a husband who can support her all the time as the main thing, and who can support the family to a certain extent as the second thing." At this point, Lili suddenly smiled and asked, "Can reading more books help you know people's hearts?" I recited Su Dongpo's sentence in reply, "If you believe that ten thousand differences return to one principle, you now know me, and I know the fish," and chose the meaning for her.

### Prelude to the Performance of "The True Story of Ah Q"

— Gao Feng

After the May Fourth Movement, it became even more sensational. The word was praised by world-famous writers and the world's literary circles and translated into English and Russian numbers. The "True Story of Ah Q", which is praised as the representative work of Chinese literature, will be performed by the Sino-French Drama Society at the Lafayette Road Lafayette Garden Theater today (15th).

"The True Story of Ah Q" is the most successful work in Lu Xun's early writing career. The success of "The True Story of Ah Q" lies in its profound depiction and sharp pen. Ah Q is the most common typical character in Chinese folk. This kind of character still exists today. Lu Xun wrote this novel twenty years ago, but this novel has not lost its dynasty nature until now.

Ah Q is a "winner" in the spiritual victory method. For example, several times, he was grabbed by his enemies (the writing object and era of the book were still in the late Qing Dynasty.) and beaten severely. Ah Q was unable to resist and let them beat him severely. After being beaten, he saw that the enemy had gone far away, and he dared to stand up and mutter, "Damn it, after all, I was beaten by my son. This world is getting more and more out of shape,"...to comfort himself.

The content of "The True Story of Ah Q" includes his whole life experience and career, from working as a long-term worker to being shot, all of which is very vivid and hilarious. The subject matter is of course serious, but the description is very relaxed. Now this novel has been adapted into a play by Xu Xingzhi, and the Sino-French Drama Society will perform it at the Lafayette Theater. It is unknown how well it will be received, but it will undoubtedly attract the attention of the isolated island people!

Announcement: Today, due to space limitations, "Notes on the Pear Garden" will be suspended for one day. (Editor)

### The Words of a Villain (Part 2)

— Wang Xianzai

"A Villain's" Original Intention and Expectations

My original profession was as a Western-style ophthalmologist. I practiced in Shanghai for several years—my medical name was Wang Youting. At that time, there were few practitioners of Western medicine, and Western ophthalmology was especially rare. Although being a doctor is also a kind of work that benefits the masses, I thought it was ultimately one-sided. It did not have the broad reach to the public that theater and film do as tools for educating society. I had a deep love for theater work from my early days as a student. Later, coinciding with the budding and nascent opportunity for domestic films, I resolutely abandoned my original profession and wholeheartedly began to devote myself to this new career.

I determined from the start that filmmaking would be my lifelong career. Therefore, no matter how bad the environment, like the entire domestic film industry falling into difficulties in the past, often panicking over unpaid salaries to the point where living became a problem, I still bore it gladly and never had the slightest thought of seeking a better plan. Because my entire life had long been entrusted to this career. If it were merely for the sake of making a living, or for the sake of enjoying pleasure, then as a doctor until now, I should have long had a car to ride in and a foreign house to live in. I fundamentally would not have given up my original profession.

Now, under the extraordinary circumstances of this extraordinary period, everyone feels deeply distressed. Generally, people curse me as a "villain" with heinous crimes, but the actual villains are actually ten or a hundred times worse than my performances on screen. At present, there are many realistic dramas, but regrettably the environment does not allow me to give a thorough and delightful performance. Otherwise, if I could vent my pent-up sorrow and indignation from this, I think it would definitely be more brilliant than the many villains I have played before. However, this is purely due to the plot. Speaking of which, it really feels too heartbreaking!

Finally, my feeling is that I hope the entire environment, as well as the social situation, can soon improve. So that this "villain" on the screen can also reform his behavior as soon as possible and no longer have any opportunities to do evil.
