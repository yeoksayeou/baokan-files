### Heavy Troops Advance to Counterattack Xiangri; Chinese Troops Still Defend Shantou City Area; Japanese Side Demands Third-Country Warships Withdraw by a Deadline; Britain and America Have Refused; All Overseas Chinese Also Leave Shantou; Zhang Fakui Orders His Troops to Block and Attack Advancing Japanese Troops

Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - As of 11:00 AM today, Chinese troops are still firmly defending the Shantou city area.

(Hong Kong) External News - After fierce street fighting in Shantou yesterday afternoon, a unit of Japanese soldiers attacked the Qiluo Battery in eastern Shantou, while another unit planned to advance towards Anbu in northern Shantou. The British authorities prepared two transports, and this afternoon loaded British overseas Chinese women and children to leave Shantou. The British move is due to the Chinese army deploying heavy troops around Shantou, preparing to counterattack the Japanese army. The British warship HMS Dainty is temporarily not withdrawing from Shantou, and HMS Scott has arrived at the mouth of the Han River. (Special telegram of the 22nd)

Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese side, considering Anbu, 40 li north of Shantou, indefensible, voluntarily retreated to the predetermined defense line in the northwest.

Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - According to a phone call from the front, as of 6:00 AM on the 22nd, fierce fighting was still ongoing in Shantou. Chinese troops were entrenched in buildings in the northeastern part of the city, using machine guns to strafe Japanese soldiers, killing many. More than 40 Japanese aircraft, in 12 batches, took turns bombing. Until 9:00 PM, they were still circling and dropping bombs in the city area, fully proving that the Japanese side's claim that it had completely occupied Shantou at 2:00 PM was propaganda to deceive the Japanese people.

Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese troops attacking Shantou were severely attacked by the Chinese army and repeatedly requested reinforcements, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese. As of this morning, the Japanese and Chinese were still fiercely fighting in the area of the airfield in the eastern suburbs. The telephone lines between Chao'an and Shantou were still open on the evening of the 21st.

(Hong Kong) Xingning News - From yesterday morning to noon, the Chinese troops in Shantou repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the invading Japanese troops, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. Currently, the Chinese military and political authorities are gathered in a certain place, commanding the troops to continue fighting. A large fire in Shantou yesterday burned all day without being extinguished. Japanese troops landing in Beigang attempted to attack Chao'an. Zhang Fakui has ordered that the Japanese troops not be given the opportunity to advance deep inland. (Special telegram of the 22nd)

(Hong Kong) (Telegram of the 22nd) - According to reliable information, the United States has rejected Japan's unreasonable demands, decided not to withdraw its warship stationed in Shantou, and sent the USS Augusta to Shantou to protect overseas Chinese. Currently, there are more than 40 American overseas Chinese in Shantou. The government has not yet made a decision on the evacuation of overseas Chinese.

(London) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - According to news from here today, the Japanese side's ultimatum ordering British warships to leave Shantou has been rejected by the British fleet stationed in China. The government is prepared to immediately support this move by the British Far East Navy. It is heard that the British government has discussed with Washington a joint approach to the developments in Tianjin and Shantou. The British Naval Minister, Stanley, believes that the Japanese ultimatum is extremely serious in nature and has great political significance, so he asked the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to discuss countermeasures as soon as possible. In addition, the straightforward rejection of the Japanese ultimatum by Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, has greatly strengthened the U.S. stance. The British naval circles believe that Japan has absolutely no right to order ships of other countries to leave the Chinese sea, so they are extremely indignant at Japan's attitude.

(Washington) (Havas telegram of the 21st) - It is rumored that the Japanese naval authorities have issued ultimatums to the authorities of various countries, demanding that warships of those countries, including the U.S. destroyer USS Pillsbury, must leave the port of Shantou, China, before 1:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. Officials from the State Department and the Navy Department all said they knew nothing about it.

(Shantou) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Currently, there are seven Japanese destroyers anchored in Shantou Port. Ma Yu fell yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM. Several Japanese aircraft flew over the city and dropped bombs, and opened machine guns to strafe. The city is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Overseas Chinese in Shantou are all safe. (Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - A Hong Kong telegram received here today stated that Chinese troops are currently moving from the interior towards Shantou in an attempt to contain the Japanese advance.

(London) (Havas telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of the port of Shantou, China, it is rumored that the Japanese naval authorities have requested that ships of various countries leave the area. The details are not yet known, but if that country does make such a request, Britain will definitely reject it. Reports from various newspapers that British warships there have already rejected this request are definitely reliable.

(London) (Haitong News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese request that British and American warships leave Shantou at 1:00 PM today, people here believe that the British and American authorities may not accept it. London newspapers regard Japan's request as an ultimatum, and predict that the result may cause an amazing change in the Far East situation. The British Admiralty has not yet received an official report from Hong Kong, but judging from the situation in all directions, British and American warships have no intention of withdrawing. According to the impression gained by neutral observers, London clearly believes that the Japanese ultimatum is an act of challenge, and at the same time an action to undermine the Sino-British treaty, because the Shantou Customs is a commercial port, which is stipulated in the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858.

(Washington) (Haitong News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - According to people close to the Navy Department, Admiral Yarnell, commander-in-chief of the U.S. East Asia Fleet in Tianjin, has refused the Japanese request to withdraw the U.S. destroyer USS Pillsbury from Shantou, and has also refused the Japanese request to withdraw American overseas Chinese from Shantou.

### Japanese Troops Bomb Airfield; Both Sides Fight for Control

Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese troops attacking Shantou first landed several hundred marines at 5:00 AM on the 21st in Donghu and Siji Aotou in Daho, which belongs to Chaoyang, and advanced west in different directions. The Chinese defenders rose up to meet them, and fierce battles broke out in the coastal villages. At the same time, more than 30 Japanese warships, equipped with dozens of speedboats, spied on the Mapingkou, and opened fire indiscriminately at both sides of the coast. The Chinese defenders also responded. At around 10:00 AM, Japanese speedboats, under the cover of warship artillery and aircraft, broke through the blockade line. Immediately, two warships covered dozens of speedboats and approached the coast of Shantou City. The Chinese defenders fired fiercely, sinking more than a dozen Japanese speedboats on the spot and killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army, unable to land, sent more than 300 plainclothes soldiers wearing black clothes, detouring to land at the airfield, and sent aircraft to bomb and strafe, and then transferred from the airfield to street fighting. The Chinese troops defended the city streets and resisted valiantly, and reinforcements were continuously added. As of 6:00 PM, the Chinese troops were still firmly defending and had not retreated. The Japanese troops who first attacked the Chaoyang coast were severely attacked by the Chinese side and once retreated at around 5:00 PM.

### Population Evacuation of Shantou Was Handled Several Months Ago

(Chongqing) (American United Press telegram of the 12th) - According to a Chinese spokesperson today, the evacuation and retreat of Shantou civilians and materials was ordered and launched by the military authorities several months ago, so the Japanese army's invasion was expected. It also stated that the Chinese army had already deployed defensive works in the mountainous area behind Shantou and along the Han River to prepare for the Japanese army's invasion. It also stated that previously, the British, American and French churches in Shantou had volunteered to take on the task of establishing refugee camps. The Chinese side did not allow them to be established because the Japanese did not abide by their oaths regarding the safety of refugee camps. The facts in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou and other places could serve as a warning, so they focused on the evacuation of the population. Finally, the spokesperson said that the loss of Shantou was at most the Chinese side losing a commercial port. As for the Japanese army wanting to go deep inland, in fact, due to the terrain and the early deployment of defensive works, it was absolutely impossible.

### Arita Notifies Various Countries of Japanese Military Actions in Shantou

(Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Japanese Foreign Minister Arita notified foreign diplomatic representatives yesterday of the start of new military actions in Shantou. According to Japanese sources, Arita's note claimed that this decisive action "has no other intention than to expand purely military activities, with the aim of destroying important bases used by the Chinese government for combat." It is heard that Arita has assured foreign diplomatic representatives that the Japanese government's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries in China remains unchanged. It will do its best to prevent any damage to the rights and interests of third countries in the current war, and hopes that foreign governments and foreign authorities in China will fully understand the Japanese government's policy and pay special attention to the possibility of preventing all unfortunate incidents. It is hoped that foreign authorities will cooperate with the Japanese army to prevent damage to foreign interests, or at least reduce this kind of damage. It is hoped that foreign governments will take all possible precautions against the "conspiracy" of the Chinese government to involve them in the Sino-Japanese war. At the end of the note, foreign diplomatic representatives are asked to recall the note sent to them by former Prime Minister Konoe on October 12 of last year regarding the prevention of unfortunate incidents in the current war.

(Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Japanese Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa told foreign reporters today that the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou would not cause international disputes, because the locations of third-country properties were known in advance, and the Japanese army had taken special care of them. A reporter asked why the Japanese side had only occupied Shantou today. Kanazawa replied that this was purely due to military strategy, and pointed out that when the Japanese army began military operations on the mainland, it was necessary to mobilize a large number of troops.

### Japanese Seizure of Shantou Is to Aid the Tianjin Incident

(Chongqing) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Newspapers here criticized the Japanese army's landing in Shantou, saying that one of the Japanese army's motives for seizing Shantou was to hope to aid its actions in Tianjin. After the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou, due to its geographical location, could be attacked by the Japanese army at any time. This decisive landing was obviously to take advantage of the opportunity to aid Japan's anti-British movement in Tianjin. Shantou is 188 nautical miles from Hong Kong, so the Japanese army's occupation of it gives it a very important naval and air force base, threatening Hong Kong and the transportation between Hong Kong and Manila.

Editorial

### Restrictions of the Current Financial System

Since the restriction on cash payments after the August 13th Incident, there was another second restriction yesterday. The difference between this measure and the first is that the former allowed 5% of the deposit amount to be withdrawn in cash each week, while this measure limits cash payments to 500 yuan per week. The former was calculated as a percentage, so the more deposits there were, the more cash could be withdrawn, which was still insufficient to effectively restrict the circulation of cash, and at most, after 20 weeks, all cash could still be withdrawn. However, those with savings accounts of thousands of yuan were inevitably affected for a while. (Later, it was approved that depositors with accounts under 300 yuan would not be subject to this restriction). Now, most small depositors can avoid this pain. Even for large depositors, 500 yuan per week, or 2,000 yuan per month, can meet their living expenses. As for salaried classes, they can be paid in full without restriction. The most difficult are industrial and commercial enterprises. To analyze it: although industrial and commercial transactions also accept checks and drafts, they have their limitations. One is that checks and drafts account for a certain percentage, and cash accounts for a certain percentage. Two is that the price varies between paying with checks and drafts and paying with cash. Even these two have already severely hit industrial and commercial enterprises. What's worse is that if various industries need to purchase foreign raw materials due to legitimate needs, they will be unable to maintain their production with the 500 yuan limit. As for foreign merchants, even for small expenses such as rent, water, electricity, and miscellaneous fees, cash is required, so checks and drafts cannot be used. However, once discounted, cash worth thousands or tens of thousands can be obtained immediately. In short, restricting cash payments and promoting checks and drafts only creates a path for money changers or speculators to profit from the difference between checks and drafts and cash. Moreover, because there are restrictions on cash withdrawals, the financial sector, which owns large deposits, has no use for its huge reserves, and will inevitably be driven to buy foreign exchange and hoard commodities. Furthermore, because large amounts of cash can still be obtained through discounting, they can easily become foreign exchange. As a result, unnecessary foreign goods flow in endlessly, and large amounts of money flow out. Even if they are absorbed by others, there is no way to prevent them. Following this line of reasoning, the result will be the loss of foreign exchange, rampant speculation, soaring prices, and difficult living conditions, which is something that should be paid great attention to.

The intention of restricting cash withdrawals must be to prevent the leakage of foreign exchange and the escape of funds. That is, cash can be used to buy foreign exchange, and restricting the circulation of cash is to restrict the buying and selling of foreign exchange. However, since checks and drafts can be discounted, foreign exchange can still be purchased. This is one. Restricting cash withdrawals only restricts deposits in banks within the Shanghai Concession. If the legal tender circulating in the occupied areas is not affected by the restriction on cash withdrawals in any way, it is even more likely to promote its absorption. This is two. Foreign merchants do not accept checks and drafts. Not only can goods not be paid for, but also general living expenses such as water, electricity, rent, and taxes related to foreign merchants all require cash, so the legal tender is gradually transferred to foreign merchants, and checks and drafts weaken their effectiveness. This is three. Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises have recently seen a gradual decrease in the use of checks and drafts, and a gradual increase in the need for cash. However, deposits in banks that use cash are also restricted from withdrawing the legal tender in full. If they need to pay foreign merchants for goods, where can they find foreign exchange? Therefore, the measures to restrict cash withdrawals cannot achieve the desired effect, but have already caused inconvenience to the industrial and commercial sectors. This is four.

Therefore, if the Chinese government is determined to improve the financial system, it should provide an appropriate amount of foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate for the legitimate needs of industrial and commercial enterprises. After the supply has been approved, the exchange rate for payment should be the same, whether it is a check, a draft, or cash, and should not be limited to providing cash. Then, the practice of discounting will be eliminated without being prohibited. The free buying and selling of foreign exchange in the market should not be supplied. However, this is related to the exercise of power, and only with a fair mind, taking the interests of the entire Chinese industrial, commercial, and financial enterprises as the premise, and without any personal gains or losses in mind, can the success be seen immediately.

If the Chinese government's measures to restrict cash withdrawals stop here without any remedies, then the inevitable result will be that industrial and commercial enterprises, eager to turn over frozen funds, will try their best to obtain legal tender, no matter how high the discount rate is, and purchase foreign exchange in the black market to ensure their safety and meet their debts. The result is that cash will not be easily obtained, and they will have to specialize in accepting cash and refuse to use checks and drafts. Then, the use of checks and drafts will become narrower, and the market will become more chaotic. Some say that this is exactly what is desired, but they do not know that the nature of the business should be distinguished and appropriate maintenance should be provided. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong and all perish together, the failure of industrial and commercial enterprises is not worth regretting, but what about China's vitality? Moreover, the escape of funds may not be completely prevented by the current restriction on cash withdrawals, because those who own large amounts of assets have already made plans to escape. However, we cannot but say that the Chinese government's decision is made with painstaking effort. At least, it may curb the wind of speculation, tighten the effect, and restrain the endless rise in prices. However, it should also take into account the difficulties of general industrial and commercial enterprises and strive to improve the situation.

### British and French Warships Remain in Shantou to Protect Foreign Interests

(Hong Kong) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese naval authorities have requested that all ships of third countries, including warships, withdraw from Shantou Port by 1:00 PM today. Currently, the British transports Yingzhou and Prominent are engaged in the evacuation. British overseas Chinese women and children and other foreigners who wish to leave Shantou are scheduled to depart this afternoon on two transports, because of the Chinese counterattack, there may be fierce battles in the city. Currently, foreign warships stationed in Shantou include the British warship HMS Dainty and the US destroyer USS Pillsbury. It is heard that HMS Dainty has decided to remain stationed in Shantou, because the British naval authorities have announced that the ship will remain in Shantou to take care of the interests of British overseas Chinese. It is heard that USS Pillsbury will also remain stationed in Shantou. According to reliable sources, the US destroyer USS Asheville is planning to sail to Shantou tomorrow. The British destroyer HMS Scott is currently anchored outside Shantou Port and is prepared to jointly protect British interests with HMS Dainty if necessary.

### French Newspapers Comment that Japan's Actions Have a Warning Nature

(Paris) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - The news of the Japanese army landing in Shantou Port has been published on the front page of newspapers here with large headlines. They all say that the port is one of the last remaining ports for China to communicate with foreign countries. Right-wing newspapers say that Japan's attempt to control Chinese ports to prevent the Chinese government from obtaining supplies is justifiable. However, the Japanese military authorities have landed in Shantou Port after the tension of the Tianjin Incident and when the country's military force should be concentrated rather than dispersed, and after the United States made a strong protest against Japan's actions in Gulangyu. This is unavoidable. "Even if this matter can be said to be unrelated to foreign concessions, what the Japanese army occupies is purely a Chinese port. In fact, international interests are still directly harmed. The Japanese side is the best way to resist countries' cooperation," or it is said that this decisive action is to satisfy the Japanese military so that it will not obstruct the establishment of a compromise plan for the Tianjin Incident. What is more, the Japanese army occupied Shantou Port on the eve of the meeting between the military authorities of Britain and France in Singapore Port, "this matter has a warning nature, which is obvious." A small newspaper said that Japan is taking advantage of the discord among European countries to erode China. It is not surprising that it landed in the last port for China to communicate with foreign countries.

### Protecting the Interests of Overseas Chinese in Tianjin; Britain Will Take Necessary Measures; Foreign Minister Sends Telegram to British Consul General in Tianjin; Britain's Attitude Turns Stronger; The Japanese Side May Accept the Suggestion

(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese army's blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, Foreign Minister Halifax sent a telegram to the British Consul General in Tianjin, Jamieson, yesterday, stating that the government is determined to take necessary measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and resolve this dispute as soon as possible, and asked him to convey this intention to all overseas Chinese, etc. Consul General Jamieson immediately replied by telegram, expressing his gratitude and saying that all overseas Chinese were very excited after hearing the news.

(London) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - This morning, official sources here declared that although Britain is very willing to regard the current situation in Tianjin as a local dispute, it believes that if the methods currently adopted by the Japanese side continue, the result will inevitably lead to Britain's counter-measures to protect its rights and interests. This kind of situation must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. It is expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a statement on the Tianjin situation in the House of Commons this afternoon. At the same time, according to official news, the traffic restrictions on the border of the Tianjin Concession have not been relaxed in the slightest. British people who attempt to cross the Concession often have to wait for a long time and undergo severe inspections, and some even have to take off some of their clothes. The French Concession authorities seem to have obtained the daily supplies they need by transporting goods in military trucks.

(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the situation in Tianjin City, official sources here declared this morning that if the Japanese army's blockade continues, Britain will definitely take retaliatory measures. Although Britain hopes that this matter can be resolved locally, if this hope turns out to be empty, then Britain's attitude will become stronger and deal with the current situation in an appropriate manner. This is what the Japanese side should understand. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon, which all parties are eagerly awaiting.

(Singapore) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - It is reported here that a large British army unit has now been assembled and is ready to depart for the Shanghai area. This has been recognized by the British military authorities here, but when the situation in North China deteriorates, the troops stationed here are prepared to go to China at any time. The British side does not deny this.

(Tokyo) (American United Press telegram of the 21st) - According to reports here, Britain has taken informal economic retaliatory measures against Japan because Japan has blockaded the Tianjin Concession. For example, British ships have now stopped loading Japanese seedlings to foreign countries.

(London) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - According to informal news from diplomatic circles here, Tokyo may accept the British suggestion that the Tianjin Incident is a local incident in its reply to Britain and begin negotiations. At that time, the British side will exchange the handover of four suspects accused of assassinating Cheng for the Japanese side's lifting of the blockade. The Japanese side's request may only be limited to cooperating in cracking down on terrorists. As for other issues, the British and Japanese governments will resolve them through direct negotiations.

(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 21st) - When the cabinet held its weekly meeting this morning, it discussed the Tianjin Incident. Regarding this matter, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Foreign Minister Halifax has also met with Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Mamoru Shigemitsu, informing him of the British government's views and awaiting a reply from the Japanese side. Therefore, the cabinet has not yet made any decision on the issue of imposing economic sanctions on Japan. The Japanese army's attack on Shantou at this time has caused a bad impression and considerable anxiety here.

(London) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Reuters learned today from a key source that the British government has not received a reply from the Japanese government after inquiring about its attitude towards the Tianjin blockade. It is heard that the authorities are now working to move the blockade negotiations from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, Reuters learned that the British government has compiled a list of various methods of applying economic pressure on Japan, which will be implemented according to this list if the Tianjin blockade case cannot be resolved satisfactorily. The Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting within days. It is expected that Conservative Party MP Mooreham will initiate a discussion on the Tianjin case at the meeting, and then consider appointing a delegation to meet with the Prime Minister. There is no doubt that the emotions of MPs from all parties in the House of Commons are becoming stronger. They all feel that the British government's delay in taking decisive action is only increasing the arrogance of the radical faction of the Japanese military, even if it does not lead to worse aggression elsewhere, it will also make it more difficult for the Tianjin case to be resolved satisfactorily. All newspapers are now publishing the news of the Tianjin and Shantou incidents and the preparations for the return of the King and Queen to England in prominent positions, and the two have a tendency to compete with each other. It is rumored that the Japanese side has sent an ultimatum to foreign shipping companies, setting a deadline for their ships to leave Shantou. London has not yet received official information. The issue of the evacuation of overseas Chinese from Shantou will be handled by the local consuls, but those responsible in all circles say that, based on past experience, once overseas Chinese evacuate, they will never be able to "return".

### British Prime Minister's Report in the House of Commons

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, today in the House of Commons reported on the recent developments of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, saying that the restrictions on entering and exiting the concession have not changed. Some British citizens, when passing through obstacles, must undergo long waits and strict searches. Adequate fresh food, after much delay, has been imported into the British concession. In the past, during this sweltering summer, most foreign women and children in the British concession would leave Tianjin for the seaside to escape the heat, and efforts are now being made to enable them to leave as soon as possible. It is reported that the first batch has already departed. The British warship HMS Sandwich arrived in Tianjin on June 20th. The British warship HMS Lowestoft, which was originally scheduled for a transfer, is also temporarily stationed in Tianjin. In South China, Japanese naval and land forces landed near Shantou at dawn on June 21st, and efforts are now being made to evacuate women and children from the area. The necessary transport ships have already set sail for the area. The Japanese naval authorities have agreed to facilitate this evacuation and will respect British property. The British ship SS Sanatt has now arrived in Shantou, and the SS Cotter is expected to arrive today. The food situation on Gulangyu Island is deteriorating, and supplies from Xiamen and the mainland have been cut off. However, there should be no difficulty in transporting food in by ships from third countries. The acting leader of the opposition party, Greenwood, rose to ask that, in view of the repeated acts of aggression that have occurred, even if they are not necessarily directed at Britain, whether the Prime Minister intends to take a stronger action to express the British government's deep displeasure with the Japanese government's tolerance of these acts of aggression. The Prime Minister, in response, assured that the government has paid great attention to the various acts mentioned by Mr. Greenwood, and said that the situation of the blockade of Tianjin is very serious. We naturally still hope that there may be a possibility of resolving this local incident through negotiations, but if these negotiations fail, we will consider the steps to be taken next. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Milner asked whether the Prime Minister was aware of the news that Sir Craigie had "begged" Arida a few days ago, and whether the Prime Minister would be willing to state unequivocally that not a word of this absurd statement is credible. The Prime Minister replied that, on the face of it, he would certainly be willing to say so, as it can be seen at a glance that this statement is absurd and unfounded, and in fact it never happened. Labour Party Member of Parliament Noel-Baker rose to say that what the Prime Minister said was a local issue of the Tianjin incident, but in fact, it has become increasingly clear that it is an act of aggression against the rights of foreigners in China, and may even become an attempt to dominate the Far East. The Prime Minister replied, "I hope not. If it unfortunately comes true, it will be extremely serious." At this point, the Speaker spoke to prevent further questions from being raised. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)

### Japan is Testing Britain's Capabilities

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources familiar with current affairs here, if the Japanese side obtains some victory in this blockade of Tianjin, it will inevitably make the warlord forces in the Japanese government even more rampant and weaken the power of the liberals who are trying to obtain assistance from Britain, France, and the United States. It is also said that the purpose of the Japanese warlords in launching the Tianjin incident is purely to test Britain's determination to defend its interests in the Far East. If the Japanese warlords can prove that Britain does not have the courage to take retaliatory action and does not have the determination to fight for its interests in the Far East, then they will be able to gain victory domestically. At that point, the Japanese warlords will be able to proceed with their plan to drive the British out of the Far East, or even occupy the concessions regardless of their neutral status. The Shanghai concessions may also be difficult to escape at that time. A second possible outcome is that Japan may directly join the military alliance of Germany and Italy. This is the possible result of the loss of power by the Japanese moderates (these moderates are firmly opposed to Japan's joining the military alliance of Germany and Italy, because Japan's joining the military alliance of Germany and Italy will cut off the opportunity for third countries to mediate the Sino-Japanese war). But if the British show weakness on the Tianjin issue, the Japanese warlords will believe that Britain has no determination to retaliate against Japan and go to war with Japan, so they will inevitably proceed to drive out the interests of third countries in China, or at least force Britain to give up its support for Chinese currency and other aspects. We will then implement the overall interests of driving the British out of the Far East. It is also said that the lack of agreement on the current British-Soviet negotiations has made the Japanese warlords deeply believe that the peace front will not extend to the Far East. This is what the Japanese warlords are extremely pleased with. Moreover, from the perspective of the Japanese warlords, not only will the peace front not extend to the Far East, but at the same time, there is very little hope of success in Europe. Therefore, they believe that the British-Soviet relationship will inevitably be estranged, the Berlin-Rome axis will inevitably be strengthened, and the European war may break out in September of this year. At that time, Japan can use force to compel Britain to abandon its assistance to China and recognize Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." Finally, the person familiar with current affairs said that Britain must not adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan, because adopting such a policy will inevitably make the Japanese warlords deeply believe that Britain has no intention of safeguarding its interests. For the sake of Britain, it must adopt a tough and resolute attitude towards Japan, and at the same time, it must extend the peace front to the Far East in order to be effective.

### US Submission of Negotiations is of Great Significance

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with reporters today, disclosed that the US Consul General in Tianjin had recently submitted a protest to the Japanese Consul General, opposing the blockade restrictions and the inconveniences suffered by American businesses in the area, as stated by the American Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Hull also said that the food supply in Tianjin is still short, but it is slightly more plentiful than before. According to a statement issued today by the Washington American Chamber of Commerce, the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce has expressed its dissatisfaction, saying that the blockade is destroying American trade in important areas, and that the situation is tense and action is urgently needed to avoid serious damage. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)

(Washington) Last night, diplomatic circles here regarded the United States' participation in the Tianjin crisis yesterday as having profound significance. Diplomatic circles predict that the Tianjin incident will soon be resolved peacefully. Secretary of State Hull, when confirming that the United States had participated in the Tianjin dispute, declared that the US Consul General in Tianjin, Gotwals, had lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities yesterday. Gotwals submitted a list to the Japanese side, listing the various grievances and inconveniences caused by the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions to American businessmen in Tianjin. The protest also mentioned the previous negotiations that the United States had made with the Japanese side regarding the damage to the property of the American people in China caused by Japanese military actions. This decision of the United States to negotiate with Japan on the Tianjin incident is generally considered to be of great significance, because what the United States had previously proposed was limited to the bombing of American property by Japanese aircraft and the Japanese military blockade of the Gulangyu public concession. It was announced here that the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce had submitted a document to the US State Department before the Japanese military implemented the blockade of the British and French concessions, solemnly stating that the Japanese military blockade of the concessions would inevitably damage American business in Tianjin. Hull also told reporters yesterday that American citizens in Xiamen are all safe. (Associated Press telegram on the 22nd)

### After Britain and France Submit New Proposals, the Three Countries Continue to Confer; Molotov Meets with the British and French Ambassadors; The British Cabinet Approves the Policy Towards the Soviet Union

(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to continue talks with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Sir Seeds, and Director of the Central European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stran at 5:00 PM today. At that time, he will also personally deliver the Soviet Union's response to the recent proposals of Britain and France to the representatives of the respective countries. (Havas telegram on the 22nd)

(Moscow) British Ambassador Seeds and Stran representing Britain, and French Ambassador Naggiar representing France, held another meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov tonight, which lasted for two hours. Talks will be held again in one or two days. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)

(Moscow) Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Minister Potemkin, at 5:00 PM today, continued to discuss the issue of the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the three countries with British Ambassador Sir Seeds, Director of the Central European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stran, and French Ambassador Naggiar, which lasted for two hours. The content of the talks has not been released. According to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, he recently declared to the House of Commons that in addition to the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries, there are other difficulties. This probably refers to how the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be defined. Regarding this, the Soviet Communist Party organ "Pravda" reprinted an article from the German newspaper "Vorwärts News" (Socialist faction) in Paris, which has attracted much attention from observers here. The gist of this article is that the crux of the stagnation of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not in the refinement of the wording of the terms, but the prerequisite is that the three countries must first have a common determination to resist aggression, and then use this as a basis, based on the spirit of mutual assistance, evolve into terms, and create a charter. In addition, regarding the promotion of the mutual assistance agreement to the Far East, a reporter from Havas learned from reliable sources that the three countries' negotiations have never discussed it. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

(London) The cabinet held its weekly meeting this morning and immediately approved the decision made by the cabinet's foreign affairs committee, that is, it does not intend to force the Baltic coastal countries to accept guarantees, but on other points, it will make as many concessions as possible to the Soviet Union. Generally speaking, the new British proposal advocates that if the independence of any country in Europe is threatened, the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can freely decide when their vital interests are harmed. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

British and French New Proposals Have No Progress

(Moscow) Yesterday, British Ambassador Sir Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and Mr. Stran called on Molotov and personally delivered the "new" proposals of Britain and France to Mr. Molotov. According to the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, these "new" proposals are actually a restatement of the original proposals of Britain and France and have no progress compared to the past. (TASS telegram on the 22nd)

Issue of Expanding the Content of the Agreement

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons today, a certain member spoke, saying that expanding the content of the planned anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to include the Far East will benefit the interests of the three countries. Whether the government agrees with this and will consider it, Butler replied, no, and said that the current negotiations are only about the situation in Europe. As far as he knows, the issue of expanding the scope of the agreement has not been discussed, nor has it been raised by the Soviet Union. Mr. Bai said at the end that there is no proposal to send cabinet members to Moscow to engage in negotiations on the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)

Chamberlain Answers Questions from Members of Parliament

(London) Several members of parliament raised questions about the progress of the talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union at the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon. Opposition Labour Party member Baker asked the Prime Minister, "Has the British government explained to the Soviet government that it is willing to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union on an equal footing?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Of course, the proposals we have put forward have recognized the principle of complete equality from the beginning." The Prime Minister also said in response to a question from Liberal Party member Mond that the government does not intend to send another cabinet member as a special envoy to Moscow to assist Ambassador Seeds in conducting negotiations. Finally, Mr. Butler of the Foreign Office made some explanations regarding the Baltic countries, saying, "The Soviet government has stated to the governments of Estonia and Latvia that if each country concludes an agreement with another country that would deprive each country of its sovereignty, the Soviet Union would regard it as a serious matter. Halifax is also well aware of this. The governments of Estonia and Latvia have also stated their position, determined to maintain the independence and neutrality of their country."

### French House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee; Foreign Minister Bonnet; Reports on the International Situation; The Three-Country Negotiations Are Proceeding Smoothly; The Results of the French-Turkish Negotiations Are Satisfactory; Hoping for Reconciliation with Spain

(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives held a meeting today, attended by Foreign Minister Bonnet to report on the international situation, including the Far East issue, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of an agreement between France and Turkey, and the Spanish issue. Regarding the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow, it was said that "the three countries have reached an agreement on some issues, but because some countries are in a special position and are unwilling to accept guarantees, difficult problems have not yet been resolved. These negotiations are currently proceeding smoothly, and it is hoped that a solution can be found for various difficulties. The French government is determined to devote great efforts to this, and strive to establish a broad agreement as soon as possible, and prescribe mutual guarantees and mutual assistance methods for the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the current negotiations between France and Turkey have been completed, and agreements will be signed separately for the Sanjak region issue and the mutual assistance issue. As for the Spanish issue, France and Spain have adjacent territories, and it is hoped that the Spanish government can, in the spirit of the French-Spanish agreement, reconcile with our country and cooperate closely. At present, the French government, based on this agreement, is seeking a solution to various outstanding issues between France and Spain. It is hoped that the Spanish government will recognize this sincerity. The number of Spanish refugees in France once reached 500,000. In recent months, they have returned to their country one after another. There are still 275,000 people remaining in France." Finally, it was concluded that France is determined to take all diplomatic and military measures to deal with any attempt to resort to force. This is the best way to maintain peace.

It is said that the Soviet Ambassador to China, Orisky, has now been summoned back to his country to report on the recent situation. At the same time, the Far East Division of the Foreign Affairs Committee is now concurrently headed by the newly appointed Deputy Minister Lufanansky. Mr. Lu, who served as a diplomat in China from 1926 to 1928, was very prominent and was extraordinarily familiar with the situation in China. Recently, he was appointed as Deputy Foreign Minister and Director of the Far East Division, which indicates that the Soviet Union will adopt an active Far East policy. According to the newspaper, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Yang Jie visited Mr. Lu a few days ago for a long talk. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)

Estonian Capital. The Estonian House of Representatives convened a special meeting yesterday and approved the German-Estonian Non-Aggression Pact signed in Berlin on June 7 by a majority vote. The number of votes was not officially announced. Of the 60 members of parliament who attended the meeting yesterday, the majority voted in favor, of which 8 left-wing members voted against, and 3 opposition Democratic Party members abstained.

Latvian Capital. The Latvian cabinet met yesterday and approved the German-Latvian Non-Aggression Pact. Since Latvia dissolved the parliament in 1936 and established an omnipotent government, all administrative and legislative powers have been exclusively controlled by the cabinet. Therefore, the agreement was approved by the cabinet meeting. It is said that Germany and Latvia will exchange approved documents in Berlin in the near future. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)

### 100,000 German Troops Head to the Western Border, Approaching the French Border

(Paris) According to news received here today, it is reported that 100,000 German troops are now moving to the defense line near the French border. In addition, the elite troops of the Nazi Party's High Command, which participated in the Spanish Civil War, will also be stationed in the Saarbrücken area of the border region. At the same time, there is also a large-scale military operation in the eastern region, allowing it to be launched from the Slovak territory that can attack Polish Silesia. As for the movement of German troops in the western region, it can be completed by the end of this month. Among them, the Siegfried Line will also have some troops stationed. It is reported that part of the German infantry, tanks, motorized vehicles, machine guns, and squadrons have already arrived at the border defense line. (Associated Press telegram on the 21st)

### The New French-Japanese Commercial Treaty Will Be Signed Today to Balance Trade Between the Two Sides

(Paris) Regarding the negotiation of a new commercial treaty between France and Japan, responsible persons here recently declared that this treaty will be signed in Tokyo on the 23rd of this month. It is found that France's trade with Japan is currently in deficit. Among the goods imported from Japan to France, raw silk and camphor account for 90%. These two items are necessary for certain industries in France. If the import volume is reduced in order to restore the balance of trade between the two sides, this industry in France will inevitably be affected, which is not advisable. Previously, the foreign exchange obtained by Japan from selling raw silk and camphor to France could be disposed of at will. Now, it has been agreed to use it to purchase coal, phosphates, salt, and other various goods from French colonies. The overall trade between the two countries can be restored to balance, which is gratifying. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

### The French-Turkish Agreement is Established and Will Be Signed Today in the Turkish Capital, Stipulating that the Sanjak Region Will Be Ceded to Turkey

(Paris) Regarding the issue of the integration of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic (French mandate territory) into the territory of Turkey, the representatives of France and Turkey have already reached an agreement through negotiations. The agreement between the two sides will be signed by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Massigli in the Turkish capital on the 23rd of this month. The main points of the agreement are: France will cede the Sanjak region to Turkey. Turkey guarantees to respect France's spiritual and material interests in the region and agrees to protect the various ethnic minorities in the region. Turkey abandons various territorial claims against Syria and agrees not to conduct propaganda in the country. Demarcation of the border between Turkey and Syria, and the Djebel Akra highland is assigned to Syria. In addition, the French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is also scheduled to be signed in Paris on the same day by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Turkish Ambassador Suad. Its main purpose is to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean. Its terms are the same as the recently concluded British-Turkish agreement. In addition, after the French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is signed, the French government will issue a declaration promising not to make any concessions to third countries during the French mandate period, so as not to hinder Syria's independence. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

(Rome) After the news of the French-Turkish agreement on the integration of the Sanjak region into Turkey was transmitted here, the Italian newspapers wrote articles commenting on it. The general view is that "the result of the Turkish-French agreement will change the original state of the Mediterranean. France's concession of the Sanjak region to Turkey is far from the principle of the mandate system and sets a precedent for the distribution of mandate territories, and it contradicts France's repeated sacred declaration, 'France will never give up an inch of territory.'" (Haitong telegram on the 21st)

### American Aviators Break the Endurance Flight Record

Springfield, Illinois, USA. Two well-known American aviators, Moody and Ballew, took off from here today in a small plane, attempting to break the world endurance flight record.

The required gasoline will be transported in advance to the various airfields crossed by the aircraft, so that it can be added on time. (Havas telegram on the 22nd)

According to Turkish government officials, the results of the discussions between the two sides were extremely satisfactory, but it is not convenient to release them. What is known is that the two countries have decided to increase trade and strengthen cultural relations. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

### Spain Assures France that it Will Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Berlin Denies Inviting Franco to Join the Alliance

(Paris) French Foreign Ministry officials have recently expressed optimism about the future of French-Spanish relations. According to British newspapers, Foreign Minister Bonnet recently met with the Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica. It is said that the Spanish Ambassador provided Foreign Minister Bonnet with assurances that if a war breaks out in Europe, Spain will always strictly adhere to neutrality. However, this statement has not been confirmed by Parisian officials. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)

(Berlin) Regarding the news that was transmitted by the British side, saying that the Spanish Franco regime has just rejected the request from Germany and Italy to invite Spain to join the German-Italian military alliance, authorized individuals here deny it, saying that Berlin has not heard that Germany and Italy have a request to invite Spain to join the German-Italian alliance. The British Broadcasting Corporation's spread of this rumor is intended to focus international attention on this in order to cover up the difficulties encountered in the Moscow talks. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)

(Paris) The French Court of Rochechil yesterday ruled on the case of 9,000 boxes of gold, silver, and securities, etc., that were transferred to France by the government army during the Spanish Civil War. The court complied with the request of Spanish public and private banks and ruled that the property should be returned to Spain. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)

### British Government Plans to Loan to Poland

The detailed methods are being discussed by both parties. (Havas telegram on the 22nd)

### The German Government Compels the British Consul in Vienna to Withdraw

(Berlin) According to official news, the German government has requested the British government to recall the British Consul General in Vienna, Gaynor, because he was involved in a leak of classified information. As is generally known, the British government recently accused the German Consul General in Liverpool, Lenhard, of being involved in a spy case and demanded his recall. Therefore, the German government is using this as retaliation. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

(Berlin) An official statement said that the German government found it had no choice but to ask the British government to recall the Consul General in Vienna, because in a criminal lawsuit, it was discovered that the country's Consul General in Vienna was involved in the event of a communications agency that had been banned. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)

(London) According to people close to the government, the German government's sudden request today that the British government recall the Consul General in Vienna, Gaynor, is actually just a retaliatory measure. Although Germany alleges that Consul Gaynor has aided illegal organizations and disseminated anti-German messages in Austria, it has not presented facts sufficient to prove it. The British government is studying retaliatory measures based on the entire course of the case. (Havas telegram on the 21st)

### Singapore Conference: Extraordinary Security Measures, Admiral Noble Presides, Army, Navy, and Air Force Groups Convene Separately

(Singapore) What Britain and France are calling "International Defense Conference" has its representatives already assembled here. Major General McLelland, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in Burma, arrived last night by plane with Colonel Huntly-Davidson, Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence, Indian Army. The plenary session will be held in the gymnasium of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment at Mengcuster Barracks. However, for most of the conference, the army, navy, and air force subcommittees will meet separately, reconvening the full conference every few days to reach a resolution, summarizing the conclusions of each subcommittee. The conference chairman will be Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Fleet. The content of the conference will be kept strictly confidential, and stringent measures will be taken to guard the venue. All countries in the world, including Germany and Japan, are paying attention to this conference. The French representatives are Vice Admiral D'Arcos, Commander of the Far East Fleet, Lieutenant General Martin, Commander of the French Army in Annam, and Colonel Tivey, of the French Air Force Staff. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

(Singapore) According to today's Singapore Times, Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, has today been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in preparation for any eventuality in the Far East. The Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference opened today in the gymnasium of Tanglin Barracks, with over fifty British and French army, navy, and air force officers and generals in attendance. Security is extremely tight. It is reported that after the conference is divided into specialized subcommittees, discussions on various issues will proceed in a highly confidential manner. Also, today's opening of the conference was frequently interrupted by telegrams from the Chinese side. For example, the Japanese request for the British Navy to withdraw from Shantou was one such interruption. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

French Newspaper Reports on Conference Items

(Paris) According to "L'Intransigeant," the main contents of the Anglo-French Far East military talks currently being held in Singapore are as follows: 1. Establish a central command for the Anglo-French Far East forces, with its headquarters in Singapore; 2. Stockpile munitions needed by the forces of both countries; 3. Draft a plan to strengthen naval power to surpass the Japanese Navy, in order to be prepared for war with that country; 4.

Protect waterways between Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Glimpses of French Naval Commentary

(Paris) British and French army and navy generals stationed in the Far East are scheduled to hold a conference in Singapore today, with British Far East Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Noble as chairman. Naval figures here recently commented that this conference was decided upon long ago and was not convened because of the Tianjin Incident. However, its importance has increased due to the situation in Tianjin. "The Tianjin Incident has already raised the issue of the balance of power between the British and French navies stationed in the Far East and the Japanese Navy. The fleets of Britain and France in the Far East are not strong enough to cope with the Japanese Navy and must rely on the United States to confront it. Although the United States has no representative participating in the Singapore conference, there is no doubt that the military port of Singapore will be open to the United States fleet in the event of war. At this time, Japan is making every effort to avoid offending the United States, but recent incidents have proven that Japan does not want a local resolution to the Tianjin case. Its intention is actually directed at foreigners in general, which is inconsistent with the guarantees provided by the Tokyo government. If this view is given time, the United States will also agree. The recent remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull have already given a glimpse of this. Furthermore, the rejection by Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, of the Japanese naval authorities' request for ships of all countries to leave Shantou Harbor in China is sufficient to show that the United States has now taken decisive steps to accommodate the wishes of Britain and France. In short, once Britain, France, and the United States fully possess a linked relationship, the current situation will change. What is being discussed at the Singapore conference is precisely how this linked relationship should be technically developed." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

"Il Popolo d'Italia" Speaks Up for Japan

Milan "Il Popolo d'Italia" published an article today discussing the strengths of the Japanese Navy and the British and French navies in the Far East, going to great lengths to support Japan. It declared that the Japanese Navy has control of the entire Chinese sea, and that Britain and France are too far away and face difficulties in transportation, making it too risky. The newspaper pointed out that Hong Kong is no longer a base for the British Navy because it has no direct transportation and is isolated. As for French Vietnam, because Japan and Siam have probably signed a secret agreement, its defense will certainly become more difficult. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

Amsterdam Various organizations in Batavia, Java, recently jointly sent a telegram to the Dutch government, requesting the strengthening of the defense of the Dutch East Indies. According to reports, the Batavia City National Club also convened a political conference, passing a resolution to strengthen the island's maritime defenses and organizing a committee to engage in propaganda. Political figures, trade union representatives, and Chinese figures on the island are all members of the committee. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Oil Merchants Negotiate with the Siamese Government

Will Withdraw from Business in Siam If New Gasoline Law Is Not Revised

(London) The Standard Oil Company of New York and the Asiatic Petroleum Company have recently decided in principle that if the Siamese government refuses to revise the new gasoline law to be implemented in mid-July, the two companies will withdraw from business in Siam. According to the new gasoline law, gasoline companies must store large quantities of gasoline, sufficient to meet Siam's needs for six months. The gasoline companies believe that this provision not only requires increased company expenses and the construction of gasoline storage facilities, but also, from an economic standpoint, makes the stored gasoline unusable, resulting in a financial loss for the company. Currently, Standard Oil and Asiatic Petroleum are in consultation with representatives of the Siamese government, requesting a revision of the provision or a subsidy. If negotiations fail, the two companies will withdraw from business in Siam. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### Rumors of Japanese Plan for a Sudden Attack, Tianjin British Concession Strengthens Security, Anti-British Propaganda Intensifies, Newspapers Sing From the Same Hymn Sheet, Food Situation Deteriorates, Meat Almost Non-Existent, Arrested Smith Not Yet Released

(Tianjin) Due to rampant rumors that the Japanese are planning to launch a sudden attack on the British concession, the authorities in the British concession are continuing to tighten security measures. The Merchant Volunteer Corps is still being mobilized. The patrols at traffic posts have all been withdrawn to strengthen the street patrols. The garrison has been reinforced with a company of Punjabis, some from Beiping and some from Shanhaiguan. British nationals are still being discriminated against at the search points. It is reported that many people were deliberately delayed and subjected to strict searches, including being partially undressed. Foreigners in the concession are increasingly resentful. They feel trapped in a corner, treated like prisoners in a concentration camp, and believe that they are being punished simply for exercising their right to seek a livelihood, a right guaranteed by carefully observed treaties, which were achieved through free negotiation. They also feel that the obstruction of food entering the concession has missed its target, and that women and children are the ones who suffer most. The food situation remains unchanged. Although perishable goods are smuggled into the concession every day, the quantity is less than 20% of the usual supply. The supply of rice and flour is now unlimited, but using flour or rice and water to fill one's stomach all day is better than nothing. A special food committee has now been established in the concession to thoroughly investigate everything. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau is also considering ways to alleviate the food problem. The food situation for the Punjab Light Infantry is satisfactory. This is entirely due to Lieutenant Simmons, an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps, who, on Sunday, accompanied by a soldier, drove a truck across the Wan Guqiao Bridge and purchased several days' worth of vegetables from a Chinese store near the East Station, and returned. Yesterday, he went to the No. 1 Special District and purchased a week's worth of mutton for the army. On both trips, he did not carry weapons. When passing through the Japanese obstacles, he was allowed to pass without being detained. The French concession has a normal supply of food. The French authorities have reached an agreement with the Japanese to use military trucks to transport perishable food into the French concession. The British national Smith, who was arrested on Saturday, is still being detained by the Japanese military police and refused to be handed over to the British authorities. The reason for his arrest is still unclear. British Consul General Jamieson told those who inquired about the matter yesterday that he had lodged another protest with the Japanese Consul General and stated that if Smith was not released immediately, the matter would no longer be a local issue. As of late, there has been no response from the Japanese. Foreigners are paying more attention to this matter. Yesterday, a dog died after touching the electrified barbed wire fence around the concession. There were no other incidents. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

(Tianjin) Anti-British propaganda has now intensified, to the point of attacking prominent British nationals personally. This is not only the case with Chinese newspapers, but now there is also a Russian-language newspaper expressing the same views. This propaganda is now prevalent in the Japanese-occupied areas and is being promoted by the Japanese and their Chinese puppets. Chinese newspapers under Japanese protection publish lengthy anti-British articles every day, urging the Chinese people to resist British aggression, demanding the return of the British concession, and ceasing trade with Britain. Articles attacking British leaders are also commonly published. The most obvious example is "Shun Pao" (transliteration), a well-known Chinese newspaper in the Japanese-controlled area, which recently published an article stating that Mr. Tebbutt, the Australian Chairman of the British concession, had convened an internal secret meeting and claimed that Mr. Tebbutt had made extremely improper suggestions to the Chinese people at the meeting. The newspaper provided detailed information about the location, date, and time of the meeting, making it seem as if it had actually happened. However, in fact, Mr. Tebbutt was unwell on that day and stayed home without going out or meeting with anyone. Reuters has also been subjected to attacks from Japanese newspapers. "East Asia Renaissance," the official mouthpiece of the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee under Japanese protection, published a lengthy article today condemning Reuters for spreading alarming, provocative, and false news about the Tianjin Incident, and stated that Reuters' news about the current crisis contained special indications of anger, leading to erroneous impressions around the world. Even foreign journalists in nearby Beiping have been deceived by it, and as a result, a large number of foreign journalists, including correspondents from European, American, and South American news agencies, have come to Tianjin to investigate. After seeing that everything in Tianjin was peaceful and orderly, and that although there were some restrictions on passing through the concession, there was no inconvenience, they realized that they had been deceived by Reuters. Today, a prominent Chinese national told a Reuters reporter in person that it took him two days to enter the British concession, demonstrating the difficulty for Chinese people to enter the concession. When the Reuters reporter asked about the situation in the Chinese area, it was said that the residents there were on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to various rumors about the concession. These residents, whose entire lives depend on the concession and foreign businesses, have been severely affected by the blockade of the concession. The Chinese national also said that anti-British propaganda has little impact on the residents of the Chinese area, but is more effective in the Chinese areas of the No. 1 Special District. Therefore, shipping industry sources say that the traffic of ships to and from Tanggu is now quite congested, and ships may not be able to sail on schedule. However, fortunately there are tugboats and other convenient facilities, so there are no major difficulties. This morning, the food situation in the concession was even worse. Milk and meat have virtually disappeared completely, and vegetables are also very limited and of the poorest quality. The Englishman Smith, who was arrested by the Japanese on Saturday and Sunday due to a conflict with the Chinese police, has still not been released, even though British Consul General Jamieson informed the Japanese that if he was not released yesterday, the matter would no longer be a local issue. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### No Food Problems in Chongqing

(Chongqing) Since the repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft in May, rice prices here have soared. In order to protect the people's food supply, the Agricultural Affairs Bureau has used its grain reserves accumulated since March to sell grain at fixed prices in large quantities, so rice prices have returned to normal levels. At the same time, new rice from various places is also arriving one after another, and Chongqing's rice reserves can support long-term consumption, so there are no food problems. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Former Director of the Sichuan Education Department, Yang Lian, Executed

(Chongqing) Yang Lian, former Director of the Sichuan Education Department, was arrested by the Military Law Enforcement Headquarters for corruption and illegal activities during his tenure as Director of the Education Department in Anhui. After the trial, it was found that the Director, as a member of the party and in charge of education, had committed such shameless acts of corruption and violations of law. Without severe punishment, it would be impossible to rectify officialdom. With the approval of Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, he was executed by shooting on the 22nd. (Dispatch of 22nd)

### Genghis Khan's Mausoleum Moved Southward, Darhad Issues Telegram

Yulin Genghis Khan's mausoleum has been moved through Yulin southward. The Darhad guarding the mausoleum issued a telegram, stating that our supreme leader moved our great ancestor's spirit coffin to a safe area. Not only were we 500 Darhad households who are dedicated to guarding the tomb not caused any unrest due to the move, but each household and person was also given a subsidy. It is clear that our central government is deeply concerned about our Mongolian compatriots. Not only are the living deeply grateful, but also our great ancestor's sacred remains receive national grace, which is also enough to comfort his spirit in heaven. Now, we respectfully lead all the Darhad who guard the tomb, and swear to uphold the legacy of our great ancestor, and sincerely support the supreme leader. (Dispatch of 20th)

(Hong Kong) A Shaanxi telegram states that the entire situation in southern Shanxi is under the control of the Chinese army. There have been local fierce battles in recent days. The fighting in Chahar and Suiyuan has slightly increased. The strength of the Chinese guerrillas is increasing daily. The puppet troops are contacting the Chinese army one after another to surrender. The area near the Daqingshan Mountains is still within the scope of the Chinese army's influence. (Special dispatch of 22nd)

(Luoyang) The number of Japanese troops in Jiang County increased to more than 3,000 on the 20th morning, and they invaded Maojiawan. Continuing their eastward attack, a certain unit of the Chinese army is now in the area south of Xiangjiashan, fighting fiercely with the Japanese army. (Dispatch of 22nd)

### Father Lebbe Discusses the Battle Situation in the Zhongtiao Mountains

(Kunming) Father Lebbe, head of the Military Commission's North China Battlefield People's Service Guidance Group, recently flew here from Chongqing to treat his old illness and collect supplies needed for the front line. Today, in response to requests from all walks of life, he decided to give a lecture titled "The True Situation of the Resistance War in the Zhongtiao Mountains," stating that "In the repeated battles in the Zhongtiao Mountains, more than 40,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated. The Japanese suffered heavy losses." Discussing the morale of both sides, he said that "Currently, Japanese officers and soldiers are almost universally tired of war, and suicides are common. Chinese troops often find Japanese officers hanging themselves collectively in the forests. Every time they hear about going to war, they all frown and sigh. In peacetime, they often cry and miss their homes. Chinese troops, on the other hand, are eager to fight a hundred times more when they hear the order to attack. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, there has never been a case of anyone being tired of war or committing suicide. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the rifles we used were far inferior to those of the Japanese. Recently, the Japanese soldiers' rifles are not as good as ours. All this proves that the date of our final victory is not far away." (Dispatch of 21st)

### Japanese Cavalry Moves West in Wen County

(Luoyang) On the morning of the 21st, more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalrymen from Wen County invaded Xianji (west of Wen County) and engaged in a fierce battle with a certain unit of the Chinese army between Zhaoxianji and Anjiazai.

### Comparison of Health Between Chinese and Japanese Armies

(Chongqing) According to Chinese medical authorities today, although the food and living conditions of the Chinese army are inferior to those of the Japanese, the spirit and health of the Chinese army are better than those of the Japanese army fighting in China. According to Chinese investigations, only 2.25% of the soldiers in the Chinese army are sick. In other words, among the two million troops, only 45,000 are sick. However, on the Japanese side, 10% of the soldiers are sick. In other words, among its 33 divisions, 80,000 soldiers are sick. Furthermore, if the Japanese continue to penetrate deeper, their living environment will become increasingly harsh, and the health of the Japanese army will continue to deteriorate. According to Chinese medical circles, there should be no more epidemics in the Chinese army this summer because all Chinese soldiers have been vaccinated in advance. However, last summer, the Chinese army often suffered from epidemics such as malaria, dysentery, and typhoid fever. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Gulangyu Public Works Bureau Protests Japanese Blockade, Food Situation Rapidly Deteriorating, Consular Corps Also Files Separate Protest

Gulangyu Since the Japanese blockade has been tightened, the food situation in the public concession here has deteriorated rapidly. Residents of the concession are now prohibited from buying food in Xiamen and bringing it back to the concession. The Public Works Bureau here has protested the blockade to the Japanese authorities, and the consular corps has also filed a separate protest to support it. Currently, there is no difficulty in sending food by ship from abroad, so there is no fear of shortage in using this method to supply rice and beans. The blockade of the Gulangyu concession began a week ago, with the Japanese preventing all supplies from being imported from the mainland to the island. The public concession currently has 50,000 residents, and is crowded. (Dispatch of 22nd)

### Ministry of Finance Prevents Capital Flight, Restricts Deposit Withdrawals, 500 Yuan in Legal Tender Paid Weekly, Over 500 Yuan Paid by Remittance, Banking Industry Resolves on Seven Measures

To prevent capital flight and stabilize the financial situation, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated measures to restrict deposit withdrawals. Yesterday, the banking industry held a general meeting and resolved on seven important measures, ordering all banks to comply. Public sentiment has calmed, rumors have subsided, and the financial market is trending toward stability. Although various industries temporarily suspended trading yesterday, they are expected to resume normal operations starting today. The details are as follows:

Ministry of Finance Telegram on Restrictions

The Banking Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that due to the recent rush to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai, causing concerns about capital flight, it is imperative to prevent this in order to stabilize the financial situation. It is hereby stipulated that starting from June 22nd, Shanghai banks, when paying out deposits, except for salary disbursements, the amount withdrawn each week shall be limited to 500 yuan in legal tender. Amounts exceeding 500 yuan shall be paid by remittance, specifically for interbank transfers. Other cities outside of Shanghai shall continue to operate as before. Transfers of deposits to the interior are not subject to this restriction. These measures are intended to maintain the current financial situation in Shanghai. All sectors in Shanghai possess a patriotic spirit and are urged to understand this intention and implement it immediately.

Banking Industry Announcement to Comply

The Banking Association received a joint telegram from Song Ziwen, Qian Xinzhi, and Ye Zhuotang at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Finance was considering measures to prevent the rush to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai and to avoid capital flight, and urging them to await instructions from the Ministry. It was not until 12:00 PM that afternoon that the telegram from the Ministry of Finance arrived. An emergency meeting was convened at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to resolving to comply, a general meeting of the banking industry was convened, gathering all parties. The announcement is as follows: "To all members, we have received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance (see the Ministry's telegram above). All member banks and firms of this association must comply with these regulations. Except for deposits made before August 13th, which will continue to be handled according to the Financial Stability Act, this is a special notice, and compliance is required immediately."

Previously Established Measures Remain Effective

A reporter from the "New Voice" newspaper spoke with Tan Xi of the Banking Association. The Financial Stability Act promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on August 16, 1937, and the supplementary measures approved by the Ministry on August 17, 1937, remain effective. This means that for all current account deposits made since August 16th, and fixed deposits that have matured, if withdrawals are made from the original bank, each household can only withdraw 5% of the remaining balance each week, but each depositor is limited to a maximum withdrawal of 150 yuan in legal tender per week. All bank drafts issued by the banking industry must be stamped with an interbank transfer chop. These instruments are only allowed for interbank transfers within Shanghai and cannot be used to obtain legal tender or purchase foreign exchange.

Two Associations Convened a General Meeting Yesterday

The Banking and Money Exchange Associations convened a general meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Banking Association on Hong Kong Road, inviting member banks and non-member banks to attend. Over a hundred people attended, including Pan Jiufen, Ye Fu, Qin Runqing, Li Fuxun, Xu Jibin, Jin Zongcheng, and Wu Yunzhai. The Secretary-General of the Banking Association, Lin Kanghou, and Secretary Gu Chengan were present. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai, who reported on the telegram from the Ministry of Finance. Discussions then began on the procedures for implementing the restrictions on deposits. The opinions put forward by various banks and money exchanges were compiled into seven items, which were resolved to be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Association for review. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM.

Seven Implementation Measures Specified

The Banking and Money Exchange Associations convened a meeting of the Executive Committee at the Banking Club at 11:30 AM yesterday, attended by Wu Yunqi, Xu Jiqing, Li Fuxun, Pan Jiufen, Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong (representing Mao Zhendai), Wu Weiru (representing Wang Zihou), and Ye Fuxiao. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai, with Gu Chengan as the recorder. The various proposals from the general meeting were reviewed, and the meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. According to a reporter from "New Voice," the seven measures are: (1) Bank drafts and transfer orders issued by banks before June 22nd, as well as remittances that have already been notified, can still be withdrawn upon maturity. (2) Checks that matured before June 22nd but have not been cashed will be handled in accordance with the Ministry's order. (3) Legal tender deposited after June 22nd is not subject to the restriction when withdrawn. (4) Interbank deposits will be handled as usual. (5) Fixed deposits made after August 13th can still be used as collateral, and the amounts will be handled according to the previous Financial Stability Act. (6) If depositors are disbursing wages and the amount exceeds 500 yuan, they can also be handled in accordance with the previous Financial Stability Act. (7) [Omitted]

Rumors Subside, Public Sentiment Calms

A financial leader told a reporter from "New Voice" yesterday that the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting deposit withdrawals aims to prevent capital flight and is part of the government's overall wartime financial policy. All citizens should comply with it. Now that all banks and money exchanges in Shanghai have been ordered to comply with the restrictions on deposits, withdrawals have actually decreased compared to before, and the financial market is becoming more stable. Due to the lack of legal tender among speculators, the black market for foreign exchange has ceased to be actively traded, causing prices to rise. Although remittance discounts have disappeared, this is temporary. Citizens are urged to remain calm and not worry. Market rumors have completely subsided since yesterday afternoon, and public sentiment has calmed.

Black Market for Foreign Exchange Slightly Loosens Yesterday

Since the HSBC Bank continued to supply the black market for foreign exchange as much as possible, the market price has become stable. The British pound is at 6.5 pence, and the US dollar is at 12.625 yuan, seemingly reaching a new equilibrium. The black market exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank yesterday remained unchanged. However, due to the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals, the cash position on the market has become increasingly tight, and the general public's ability to purchase foreign exchange has suddenly weakened, causing the exchange rate to loosen. The British pound rose to 6.875 pence, and the US dollar rose to 12.875 yuan. The market suddenly contracted in the afternoon, but it was still looser than the market on Tuesday. The official foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank remains stable as always.

Securities Plunge, Trading Temporarily Suspended

The unofficial securities market previously fell due to various types of bonds stopping interest payments. Trading resumed as usual yesterday morning after the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. Market rumors persisted, public sentiment was agitated, and the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals caused prices to continue to fall. At the morning close, Category A bonds closed at 54.2 yuan, down 2.9 yuan; Category B bonds closed at 47 yuan, down 2.4 yuan; Category C bonds closed at 46.3 yuan, down 2.2 yuan; Category D bonds closed at 45.7 yuan, down 1.1 yuan; and Category E bonds closed at 45.5 yuan, down 2.4 yuan. Trading was temporarily suspended in the afternoon due to unsettled trades. It was also decided to suspend trading tomorrow (23rd) and the day after (24th), and to decide on a reopening date after a meeting of brokers next Monday (26th).

Gold Market Approaching a State of Stagnation

Due to the sudden shortage of cash on the unofficial cash market, speculators have no legal tender to purchase cash, and those holding cash have no way to sell it, so there is no trading and it has approached a state of stagnation. However, there were informal transactions at a price of 2,500 yuan, an increase of 169 yuan compared to Tuesday of last week. The price quoted by gold shops yesterday remained unchanged. Datong Bank's selling price was 270 yuan, and Xintong Bank's selling price was 268 yuan, but the buying price was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

Remittance Discounts Absent Yesterday

Since the implementation of the remittance system in Shanghai, a discount for exchanging legal tender for remittances has been created, which is handled by small money exchanges. All formal banks and remittance firms refuse to offer this discount. Previously, due to the manipulation of speculators, the discount rate soared. The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, entrusted by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank, intervened to stabilize the remittance discount rate, which stabilized at around 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Since the Ministry of Finance restricted deposit withdrawals yesterday, the cash market has been extremely tight, so money exchanges and the Reserve Committee have no market. However, one money exchange was buying at a discount of 75 yuan.

Various Industries Meet to Discuss Reopening Measures

(1) The unofficial yarn and cloth market announced yesterday that it would temporarily suspend trading and reopen after the banking industry decides on remedial measures. (2) The unofficial grain trading market also temporarily suspended trading yesterday. The Grain and Oilseed Industry Association met at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss remedial measures. (3) Yesterday, the cash price for standard number two flour was 4.65 yuan, and remittance transactions were suspended. (4) The Rice Industry also held a meeting yesterday to discuss research. The Qinglian Pavilion market will open as usual today. According to a reporter from "New Voice," the grain, flour, yarn, and cloth markets have resolved the seven measures, and all payment methods have been resolved. It is reported that they can resume normal operations starting today.

Huaxing Bank Suffers a Blow

The pseudo "Reformed Government" established the "Huaxing Bank" in Shanghai on May 15th to disrupt Chinese finance and issued 20 million yuan in counterfeit currency. The capital was prepared with legal tender, but since its establishment, it has not developed much due to a lack of trust. All counterfeit currency is only forcibly used in the Japanese-occupied areas of Hongkou and Zhabei. Since the Ministry of Finance's new deposit restriction measures, it has been unable to obtain a large amount of legal tender. The reserve fund of the pseudo "Huaxing Bank" has been shaken, and the bank's future will suffer a major blow.

Japanese Merchants Unable to Engage in Foreign Exchange Arbitrage

A reporter from "Daguang News" interviewed leaders of industry and commerce yesterday morning to inquire about the consequences of the Ministry of Finance's new measures. They stated that since the Ministry of Finance implemented these emergency measures, various industries have been unable to obtain large amounts of legal tender and thus unable to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Shanghai are unable to sell a large amount of Japanese goods to obtain legal tender for foreign exchange arbitrage. As a result, Japanese goods in China will be greatly reduced in the future. As for domestic products, merchants will mostly switch to domestic goods because they cannot purchase foreign goods, so sales will inevitably be more prosperous. This will greatly benefit the entire national industry and commerce. However, merchants may feel slightly inconvenienced at the beginning of the new order, but after the widespread use of remittances, they will be the same as legal tender, and various industries have no need to worry.

Financial Situation Stabilizes, Prices Will Fall

According to an economic expert, the Ministry of Finance's telegram is a necessary measure to stabilize the wartime economy. All Chinese people should comply with it without any suspicion. This move will prevent capital flight and make the financial situation more stable. After this new order is implemented, the soaring prices in Shanghai will also likely fall back, which will further benefit the lives of ordinary people.

### Foreigners Arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin Speak of the Suffering of the British, Insulting Situations Abound, Future Prospects are Difficult to See

The Continental Daily reports that the first batch of foreigners arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, who were blockaded in the British and French concessions of Tianjin by the Japanese authorities on the 14th of this month, arrived in port yesterday. When they spoke with reporters, they confirmed that the Tianjin Japanese authorities are imposing the most severe discrimination against British nationals, while Tokyo officials are making contradictory statements. These "refugees" departed on the German "Desheng" ship of the Jardine Matheson Company. Due to turbulent waves at sea, they arrived six hours late, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Although they left Tianjin only two days after the blockade began, they witnessed many "insulting situations" that they could report. They recounted the disrespect shown by Japanese sentries to the British in detail.

British Forced to Remove Their Trousers

Mr. White, a well-known American lace merchant in Tianjin, arrived in Tianjin by train from Peiping three days before the "Desheng" ship set sail. He recounted an extremely unpleasant incident: The first scene that caught his eye when he stepped onto the platform was Japanese sentries removing the clothes of some British people. One British person had already been stripped to the waist and asked the sentry, "Do you want me to take off my trousers?" The sentry replied, "Of course." The British person had no choice but to take off all his clothes.

No Difficulties for Americans

A Japanese soldier asked Mr. White what his nationality was. Mr. White replied that he was American and showed his passport as proof. The sentry did not make things difficult and allowed him to pass. However, Mr. White had to pay five yuan for a taxi ride that only took five minutes to reach his hotel.

Separate Entrances for Chinese and Foreigners in Cinemas

According to passengers arriving in Shanghai, when they boarded the ship to leave Tianjin last Friday, the city was in a state of extreme tension. Even before the actual blockade began, the situation was far from normal. For example, since the shooting incident at the Great Light Cinema, Chinese and foreigners going to the cinema had to enter through separate doors. Chinese people were thoroughly searched before being allowed to enter. Although the situation in Tianjin was quite difficult, foreign authorities had advised residents not to attempt to leave the country, fearing that they would encounter unfortunate incidents with Japanese sentries on their journey.

Difficulties Encountered When Leaving Tianjin by Ferry

The passengers left the British concession waterfront by ferry at 12:30 PM last Friday and sailed down the river to Tanggu, where they transferred to the "Desheng" ship. Japanese soldiers once stopped the ferry, but after inspecting several passports and questioning them briefly, they allowed the ferry to continue its journey. The delay lasted a total of one hour. They arrived at the coast at 6:30 PM and boarded the "Desheng" ship, which departed for Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the next day.

Difficulties for Tianjin Prospects

The "Desheng" ship did not encounter any incidents with Japanese soldiers but encountered a storm on Tuesday, causing a delay of six hours before arriving in Shanghai. According to the opinions of most of the arrivals interviewed by reporters, the situation in Tianjin is unlikely to improve in the near future. One woman said that she could not bear to stay in Tianjin. She expressed her dissatisfaction with the actions of the Japanese army.

### International Moral Re-Armament Meeting in America

Shanghai Delegation to Depart This Week

Last June, when international tensions were extremely high and countries were urgently rearming, Christian figure Frank Buchman broadcast in London, launching the Moral Re-Armament movement, advocating sincerity, purity, unselfishness, and love as the basis for resolving various disputes. Many members of the British House of Lords and House of Commons, as well as former Prime Minister Baldwin, sent letters to

The Times

endorsing Buchman's ideas. Subsequently, leaders from various circles in Europe and America responded, and it has now become a global Moral Re-Armament movement. This month marks the one-year anniversary of the movement, and US President Roosevelt also sent a letter of support. As reported previously, an International Moral Re-Armament Conference will be held in Los Angeles, California, in July.

They will depart from Shanghai on the Russian Empress this Sunday and are expected to return to China after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Last night at 8:30 PM, the delegation gave an English broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station, reporting on their trip to the conference.

### Authorities in Both Concessions Set New Price Limits for Rice, White Rice at 21 Yuan, Xiangke Rice at 17 Yuan, Medium and Lower Grades Are Reduced Accordingly, Those Exceeding the Price Limit Will Be Dealt With

According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, regarding the rice price issue, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, after discussions with representatives of various rice industry groups in the city, have stipulated that from today, the maximum market price for the highest grade white rice, whether wholesale or retail, shall not exceed 21 yuan per picul (石) in national currency, and the highest grade xiangke rice shall not exceed 17 yuan per picul. Medium and lower grades shall be reduced accordingly. Any transactions exceeding these price limits will not be recognized as valid, and the police should be informed truthfully for investigation and handling. The above provisions will be posted on a notice at the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association market this morning (Friday) to inform all rice merchants to comply. In addition, the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, at which time there will be discussions on further reducing rice prices and smoothing the source of national rice.

Invite Rice Merchants, Instruct to Comply

Mr. H.E. Haulter Vice Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited representatives of the rice industry groups Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, and Fu Qiangeng to discuss the rice price issue in the Shanghai rice market at 2:00 PM yesterday. He also informed the rice industry representatives that the Concession authorities have established measures to limit rice prices, hoping to instruct all rice industry firms to comply with the measures. Those who violate the price limits set by the authorities should be reported truthfully for investigation and handling. The Concession authorities have sent personnel to conduct strict investigations and suppress those who speculate and manipulate the rice market. Measures have been established to maintain the people's food supply within the Concessions. The representatives left at about 3:00 PM.

Emergency Meeting of the Bean and Rice Industry

The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Grain Industry Association held a joint emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at the Association's office on Avenue Edward VII at 5:00 PM yesterday, attended by Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, Yu Bingwen, Zhu Xiangsheng, and Xing Zhigang. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. Members of the Market Management Committee Wang Tianqiu, Zhang Lizhong, Zhou Zhizhen, Yin Fuxiang, and Gu Yisheng were present as observers. First, Chen Ziyi reported on his negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council, and then discussions began on the case of limiting rice prices to maintain the people's food supply, as instructed by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council. It was resolved to comply with the intentions of the authorities of the two concessions. Sales made before June 28, 1939, will still be calculated at the original transaction prices. Starting from June 23rd, the maximum rice price will be limited to 21 yuan per picul for the highest grade glutinous rice and 17 yuan per picul for the highest grade xiangke rice, with medium and lower grades reduced accordingly. A notice will be posted at the market for all to comply with.

Notice Posted at the Market for All to Comply

The Bean and Rice Trade Association posted a notice at the Qinglian Pavilion market this morning stating, "In recent days, rice prices have soared, exceeding normal levels and greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, in order to maintain the people's food supply, have convened representatives of this association to discuss the matter and have decided to limit rice prices. From today (sales made before June 28, 1939, will be calculated at the original transaction prices), the maximum glutinous rice price, whether wholesale or retail, shall not exceed 21 yuan per picul, and the maximum xiangke rice price shall not exceed 17 yuan per picul, with medium and lower grades reduced accordingly.

This notice is issued to all members to comply with in order to maintain the people's food supply."

Market Opens at 9:00 AM This Morning

A reporter from "New Voice" met with Fu Qiangeng, director of the Market Management Committee, yesterday. According to him, the Market Management Committee originally planned to convene a meeting of all firms at 3:00 PM on the 22nd to advise them to maintain the people's food supply and lower rice prices. Because the Bean and Rice Industry Association had already convened an emergency meeting to decide on price limits and issued a notice for all to comply with, the meeting to convene all firms was temporarily cancelled. As for the Bean and Rice Market, it will open at 9:00 AM this morning (22nd), and all transactions must be conducted in accordance with the new price limits of the Concession authorities. Those who exceed the price limits will be strictly dealt with by the Concession authorities, so the rice price in Shanghai can be stabilized thereafter.

### Jardine Matheson Ship Attempts to Sail to Shantou, Itinerary Determined Temporarily, If Not Allowed to Enter, It Will Change Course to Hong Kong, Transportation Between Hong Kong and Shantou Has Been Announced to Be Interrupted

After the Japanese army landed near Shantou on the morning of the 21st, transportation between Shanghai and Shantou is still maintained by foreign ships as usual. Jardine Matheson's "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships both departed yesterday afternoon, but whether they can reach their destination is still difficult to predict. A reporter from "Daguang News" has investigated and reported the following:

Jardine Matheson Ships Sail to Shantou as Usual

After the Japanese army landed in Shantou, telecommunications were disrupted, and all parties in the city have not yet received official news from the area. The details are unknown. In order to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Shantou, Jardine Matheson still had its "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships sail as usual. The "Zesheng" departed first at 2:30 PM yesterday, and the "Desheng" departed at 6:00 PM. Both ships were fully loaded with cotton cloth, groceries, etc., but there were few passengers.

Whether They Can Arrive Is Difficult to Predict

Although the "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships have departed, whether they can reach Shantou is still a question and difficult to predict. According to a staff member of Jardine Matheson, if the situation in Shantou is bad and prevents the "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships from entering the port, they will change course to Hong Kong to unload their cargo. Taikoo's Nanhua class has stopped calling at Shantou from today onwards. However, Jardine Matheson's shipping schedule issued yesterday still had the words "Nanhua class also calls at Shantou."

Transportation Between Hong Kong and Shantou Temporarily Interrupted

According to shipping industry sources, the "Hesheng" ship of Jardine Matheson, which travels between Hong Kong and Shantou, sailed directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 21st and is expected to arrive in port on the morning of the 25th. There were also many temporary ticket refunds in Shantou. Transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has been temporarily interrupted. When navigation will be restored depends on the situation.

Ships Blocked in Hong Kong Port

The Taikoo company's "Suiyang" and "Manly Maller" and other ships, which were blocked from entering the port in Shantou, have sailed to Hong Kong and unloaded passengers and cargo in Hong Kong warehouses. The ships telegraphed their companies in the city to report the details. Jardine Matheson's "New Yisheng" ship received a telegram from the Hong Kong office the day before yesterday, ordering it to withdraw from Shantou, so the ship left Shantou for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 21st, and the goods in Shantou were not unloaded.

Southwest Mail to Be Rerouted

Due to the outbreak of the war in Shantou, the Shanghai Postal Administration telegraphed the Shantou Postal Bureau yesterday to inquire about the truth of the local situation. As of 5:00 PM yesterday, no reply had been received. According to a reporter from "New Voice," regarding Shantou's transit and exchange business, the Postal Remittance Bureau stated that although it is still issuing drafts as usual before receiving a reply from the other side, all responsibility must be borne by the remitter, and the Bureau is not responsible. However, the Bureau is ultimately cautious and will return the remittance to the original place if it cannot be delivered. As for parcels, they were still being accepted and sent as usual yesterday, but they will be stopped within a few days. All kinds of mail will be maintained in their original state as much as possible, and the Bureau will definitely not stop receiving and sending them. In addition, mail to the southwestern provinces and cities, which was previously routed through Shantou because there is a highway connecting Shantou to Qujiang, is being considered by the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Postal Bureau due to the Shantou incident. It will be rerouted through Haiphong and Hong Kong. It is reported that various merchants have automatically stopped sending parcels transiting through Shantou.

### Managing Director of Taikoo Trading Company in Britain Donates 5,000 Pounds, Approximately 185,000 Chinese Yuan, to the Relief Fund for the Suffering of China

Reuters, London, 21st - The resident Director of John Swire and Sons Limited (China Navigation Co. Ltd.) of Shanghai, has donated Five Thousand Pounds towards the “United Aid to China Fund”. In addition donations of general commodities purchased through a gift by the British Co-Operative Associations valued at One Thousand Pounds were also recently donated.

### Japanese Inspectors Confiscate Mail, Foreigners Highly Indignant, Loss of Mail Containing Funds, American Resident Suggests US Retaliation via Postal Service

The "Millard's Review" reports that in Tianjin, Beijing, and Fuzhou, only the pro-Japanese "Shanghai Times" is able to receive Shanghai newspapers through the mail. All other publications are being confiscated by Japanese inspectors in the Shanghai Post Office. The Chinese Post Office has been prohibiting the mailing of the British-owned "Tianjin Times" for months now. Only one copy, addressed to the British Embassy in Beijing, is not confiscated because inspecting mail to embassies or consulates would violate diplomatic immunity.

All

civilized nations

respect diplomatic immunity, except for a certain Eastern country whose name need not be mentioned. Furthermore, mail from foreign countries is also being intercepted. Hundreds of copies of the August issue of the "Reader's Digest" were confiscated because it reprinted Pearl S. Buck's article claiming that China would ultimately triumph. A book titled "History of the U.S. Marine Corps," ordered by the Shanghai-based U.S. Marine Corps, was also stolen by a Japanese inspector. Books by Professor Rice Weir of Chicago about

propaganda techniques

have also been confiscated. Some suspect that the inspectors' motives go beyond simply preventing foreigners from gaining perspectives that contradict Japan's. This suspicion has been confirmed after it was proven that mail containing funds has also been lost. Discerning individuals have decided not to entrust mail to the Shanghai Post Office, instead opting to send it directly via shipping vessels or have it carried to Hong Kong for mailing to avoid Japanese inspection. Foreign consular officials have lodged strong protests against this abuse of authority, but with little effect. Therefore, some American residents have recently suggested retaliating against Japan through the American postal service.

### Admiral Yarnell Travels to Qinhuangdao

Travels in Special Train, Accompanied by Officers' Families

The "Continental Daily News" reports from this port city that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, traveled to Qinhuangdao yesterday (the 21st) from Tianjin on a specially prepared train. He boarded the flagship USS Augusta. Ten wives and twelve children of U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers stationed in Tianjin also traveled on Yarnell's special train, departing from the Tianjin concession to Qinhuangdao. From there, with Yarnell's assistance, they will travel to Shanghai by merchant or military vessel. The USS Augusta is scheduled to arrive in Qingdao on the 26th of this month.

### German Ambassador on Jewish Refugee

Resettlement Question

Had No Prior Knowledge, Nor Participated in Planning

The German Ambassador to China claims that he had no prior knowledge of the discussions between the German banker and industrialist, Mr. Porglas, and high-ranking Chinese government officials regarding the resettlement of 100,000 Jewish refugees. These discussions concern opening a "New Promised Land" in Yunnan, permitting immigrants to come to China with rights of residence, work, and protection from the Chinese government, according to a plan drafted by Mr. Porglas. The Ambassador stated he had only heard of this plan for the first time after it was publicly announced.

### Japanese Notify Third-Country Vessels of Yangtze River Estuary Blockade, Claim Guerrilla Activity, Sino-Japanese Troops Have Clashed at the Mouth of the River

The "North China Daily News" reports that a Japanese naval spokesman stated last night (the 21st) that the Japanese naval authorities requested on Sunday that third-country vessels refrain from navigating the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island due to impending combat operations against guerrillas. This warning was issued in light of the guerrilla activity in Lingdian, where an estimated 100 regular Chinese soldiers were entrenched in fortifications. On the 2nd of this month, a Japanese patrol vessel

briefly shelled

these positions. Shortly thereafter, the British gunboat HMS Gnat and another vessel stopped in the area. On the 5th of this month, a Japanese patrol vessel returned to Lingdian and, upon observing over a hundred guerrillas there, signaled its intention to open fire. The Japanese vessel escorted HMS Gnat and other vessels away before engaging in a clash lasting one hour. The guerrillas were levying taxes on goods being loaded onto foreign vessels to fund their operations, and because they seemed to be

receiving supplies

from these vessels, the Japanese military found it necessary to blockade the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island until these elements were driven out. It is also dangerous for third-country vessels to enter the crossfire. The spokesman continued, stating that on Tuesday, a unit of the Japanese naval landing force clashed with strong regular Chinese forces near a river port along the Yangtze River, resulting in "slight casualties" for the Japanese military.

### Export Volume Increased Compared to Before the War, National Tea Sales Flourishing, New Tea Regions Opened in Southwest Provinces, Machine-Made Tea Production Successful

Since the government began promoting the export of domestic goods, national tea sales have been flourishing. The export volume has even increased compared to before the war. New tea regions have been opened in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, etc., to increase production. Machine-made tea production has been successful. Details are as follows:

Exports Increased

After the War

The Foreign Trade Commission, upon receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance, controls all tea leaves nationwide, and cooperates with the Fuhua Company to be responsible for purchasing and exporting matters in local markets throughout the country. For the entire past year, a total of 800,000 boxes of tea leaves were purchased, of which it is estimated that half were sold in various countries' markets. Another 264,000 boxes were transported abroad to exchange for war and construction materials. In addition, a large number of red brick tea and green brick tea were sold to the Soviet Union. According to the export volume of Chinese tea leaves, it was 30,787,274 yuan in national currency in 1937, but last year it increased to 33,094,085 yuan in national currency.

New Tea Regions

Opened in Southwest Provinces

Recently, in order to increase the production of tea leaves for export and to replenish foreign exchange reserves, the government has opened up new tea regions in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Xikang, and Guizhou, and has dispatched technical personnel to conduct surveys and proceed with the work. New tea from the provinces that have not been occupied have already begun to enter the market, and the Fuhua Company is still responsible for unified purchases. Due to favorable weather conditions and advances in cultivation techniques, it is expected that exports will increase even more than last year.

Machine-Made Tea

Production is Good

In order to develop the tea industry, banks are actively providing loans to tea farmers and tea merchants. The Farmers Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have cooperated with provincial banks and local banks, and have tentatively set the total loan amount at 20 million yuan in national currency to help support development. Currently, many inland tea factories are also experimenting with machine-made tea, and are equipped with new-style machinery, such as engines, kneading machines, loosening machines, and screening machines. The results are quite good.

### Houjiazhai on Route Haig Forms a Light Industrial Area, Light Industrial Manufacturers Are Concentrated Here, but Worsening Vicious Business Practices Are Rampant

Houjiazhai on Route Haig, located behind the Chinese Funeral Home, is only a stone's throw from Dongfahua Town. Originally a small village in the Fahua district, it had fewer than a hundred households. The surrounding fields were extremely desolate. After the "August 13th" Incident, the village, being next to the road built beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement, was enclosed within a wire netting, and gradually gained attention. Following the westward retreat of the Chinese army and the fall of the suburbs, the provinces, cities, and counties that were occupied were ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese army, and beset by bandits, making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. They fled to the isolated island, causing Shanghai's population to increase from three million to five million. This remote village was also sought after. In the past year, Houjiazhai has transformed from a village into a town. Currently, there are more businesses than houses, and stores are lined up one after another. The desolate suburbs of the past have become bustling city streets. Housing prices are increasing day by day, and the market is developing rapidly. Various light industries, such as towel factories, bakelite factories, leather factories, cotton batting factories, eyeglass lens workshops, eyeglass frame workshops, wicker and wooden comb manufacturing workshops, and electrical engineering workshops, are concentrated here, forming a light industrial production area. The leaders of the village pay attention to the construction of municipal facilities. The roads, which used to be rugged and muddy, are now paved with stones, like wide and level avenues. Other facilities, such as street lights, have also been gradually installed. Unfortunately, because the village is located in the area where roads are built beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement, it is under the jurisdiction of the puppet regime, and all kinds of vicious business practices are allowed to run rampant unchecked.

### Area West of Shanghai Becomes Tense Again

North Xinjing Ferry Suspended, Gunfire Heard in the Southwest Corner

The situation in the area west of Shanghai has been quite chaotic since the 18th. The Japanese army is on high alert. Villagers in the area west of Shanghai who usually travel to the International Settlement via the North Xinjing ferry as the only convenient route, were unable to cross the ferry on the morning of the 19th, causing many passengers to be stranded. A large number of ships sailing from inland areas to Shanghai were also blocked in the Yejidun area west of North Xinjing. According to a rice vendor who managed to bypass North Xinjing and travel to Shanghai (this rice vendor usually traveled between Shanghai and the northwest of Xinjing to sell rice in small quantities, and was blocked in North Xinjing this time due to the ferry suspension), from the evening of the 18th, small cannon and dense machine gun fire was heard every day and night in the area west of Shanghai. The gunfire seemed to be coming from the Hongqiao Airport and Sijing and Qibao areas in the southwest. It is rumored that there are guerrilla battles in those areas, and the Japanese army is on high alert, announcing temporary martial law and searching households very strictly. Pedestrians on the road are all subjected to strict searches and interrogations. Residents are frightened several times a night, and almost all dare not go out. Customers in tea houses have disappeared, and business in restaurants and dim sum shops is also very quiet. Because vegetable vendors cannot transport vegetables into the International Settlement, they have to sell them at low prices, so vegetable prices in the town of North Xinjing have been unusually low in recent days.

### Twenty-Seven Japanese Police Officers Begin Training

Twenty-seven Japanese police officers, who arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the 8th of this month, have joined the police department for six months of training. Upon completion, they will be formally promoted to police officers. It is reported that the ages of these Japanese police officers are between 21 and 30 years old.

### New British River Gunboat Sails to Shanghai from Hong Kong

The "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that the second new British river gunboat HMS Dragonfly is quietly sailing along the coast from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The HMS Dragonfly was built in England and arrived in Hong Kong several weeks ago. It has already undergone trials. HMS Grasshopper, of the same class, followed HMS Dragonfly to Hong Kong and is currently undergoing trials. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai after mid-next month. In addition, HMS Scorpion, the first new British river gunboat, took over as flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet several months ago and, after patrolling the lower Yangtze River, is scheduled to return to this port tomorrow (the 23rd).

### Two Tea Drinkers Kidnapped from Jinhua Teahouse on Hualong Road, Forced into Car and Driven Away, Identities of Those Kidnapped Not Yet Ascertained

The Jinhua Teahouse at 80 Hualong Road in the French Concession is a branch of the Jinhua Sichuan Restaurant on Rue Wagner. It mainly sells tea and dim sum, and also offers meals, making it an economical restaurant. The interior is elegantly decorated, and the space is spacious, making it popular among middle and upper class people. In the afternoons, after school, the teahouse is very busy, as students often stop by for a snack on their way home. Therefore, the teahouse has gained a great reputation shortly after its opening. Moreover, because it is located near the French Park, business is even better in the summer.

Two Customers, One Fat, One Thin

At around 7 PM yesterday, two customers, one fat and one thin, both in their thirties, speaking Cantonese and wearing Western-style suits, came to the teahouse for dinner. They were served by waiter Fei Baosheng, number 45, and seated at table number 22. The two customers first ordered two bottles of soda and selected several dishes.

Four More Arrive, Take Two

Just as the two men were drinking water and chatting, before ten minutes had passed, four more men in Western suits walked in. They went straight to the two customers' table, said a few words, and the two customers were taken out by the four men. At the time, everyone in the teahouse thought that the men were friends and had gone out to talk, so they did not pay attention.

Forced into Car, Speed Away

Unexpectedly, after the six men went out, the four who had arrived later forced the two customers into a car that was parked by the side of the road. At this time, the two men tried to resist, but it was too late, and they were forced into the car together, which sped north and disappeared in an instant.

Police Assistance Too Late

At the time, a police officer directing traffic at the entrance of the French Park noticed a crowd gathering on the road, and went forward to inquire and offer assistance, but the car had already driven away without a trace. After inquiring at the teahouse, he finally understood what had happened. However, neither the nearby pedestrians nor the police officer noticed the car's license plate number.

Names of Two Customers Not Yet Ascertained

According to eyewitnesses, there were a total of two ordinary sedan cars and one motorcycle with a sidecar parked by the side of the road at the time. When the car carrying the kidnapped men drove away, the other two cars also followed. However, it is difficult to determine whether there was a connection between the three cars. The police officer immediately reported the incident to the police station by telephone, and the police chief immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene for a detailed investigation. However, the names of the two customers had not yet been ascertained as of the time of this newspaper's publication.

### Capture of Robbery Gang, Stolen Goods Recovered

Detectives Shang Wu and Shen Dehui of the Huishi Police Station arrested three robbers from Ningbo, Wang Shengrong, Wu Hongmao, and Feng Shanqing, at a garret at 24 Tiantong Road, 34 Xinzha Road, and the Dazhong Hotel on Avenue Edward VII on the morning of the day before yesterday. They confiscated stolen goods such as gold rings, diamond rings, and gold bracelets, worth several thousand yuan, and took them all into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the robbery case at the home of Zhong Liu, a resident of Lane 24, No. 830 Tiantong Road, was the result of inside information provided by the defendant Wang Shengrong, and requested an extension of the investigation. After Judge Jiang questioned the three defendants, he ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.

### Gang Rape of Friend's Wife, Then Forced into Prostitution

Re-scheduling of Interrogation After Arrest

Chen Jigen and Liu Muhai (peddlers) from Danyang, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at No. 27 Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, lured Liu Sun (age 21), wife of their fellow townsman Liu Yaocai (age 23, carpenter) to Aido Hotel and Xincheng Hotel on Rue Brenier, and gang-raped her for three days and nights. On the 17th, they took Liu Sun to a brothel operated by a woman from Yangzhou, Zhao Guannian, at No. 40, Lane 161 Xiamen Road and forced her to receive clients. After Liu Sun went missing, Liu Yaocai reported the case to the Huishi Police Station, requesting the investigation of abduction. Before noon the other day, Chen and Liu suddenly went to Liu Yaocai's house and claimed that they saw Sun being hidden in a certain place and that 70 yuan was needed to redeem her. Liu, hearing this, knew that they were heavily involved and pretended to agree to the 70 yuan, promising to pay it after seeing Sun. Chen and Liu believed him and immediately led Liu Yaocai to Xiamen Road to meet Sun. Liu excused himself to go back and get the money, but instead notified the police station to send detectives to the scene to arrest the two defendants, Chen and Liu. They also arrested suspects Chen Haijin, Shi Yingen, Zhao Guannian, Sun Yuemei, Yang Yuanyuan (members of a guide company), Lu Cuibao, and Zhang Lanying (prostitutes). This morning, they were all escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for interrogation. Judge Jiang, after a brief interrogation, ordered Sun Yuemei, Yang Yuanyuan, Lu Cuibao, and Zhang Lanying to be released on bail pending further investigation, and the remaining defendants to be detained.

### Fighting at a Birthday Party, Guests Get Drunk and Become Violent

Hao Jinkui (age 37) from Rugao, residing at No. 41 Fahua Town West of Shanghai, held a birthday party at home at noon yesterday for his mother's 60th birthday. Many relatives and friends attended. At around 2 PM, Hao's good friends Gao Jinsheng (age 27) and Tong Mingyang (age 31) drank too much and got into a dispute. Both sides used vegetable basins to strike each other, resulting in head injuries and bloodshed. Hao stepped forward to mediate, but was also injured in the head and face. Afterwards, the family took the three injured parties to the hospital for treatment.

### Collecting Scrap Metal in Zhabei

The waste copper and scrap metal in the ruins of Zhabei, except for the parts that were relatively complete and had already been removed, still have some old lead sheets and other scrap metal piled up everywhere. A large number of workers are dispatched every day to collect them, tie them with lead wire, and load them to the large open space in Yangshupu. It is said that tens of millions of tons of scrap metal have been collected. The more complete iron parts are piled up in various buildings, waiting to be transported out one after another. Therefore, residents living in Hongkou and Zhabei are not allowed to carry copper or iron to the International Settlement, otherwise it will be very dangerous if discovered.

### Shanghai Suffers Intense Heat Yesterday, High of 95.5 Degrees, Horse Collapses from Heatstroke, Epidemic Hospital Overcrowded

The weather in this port city was scorching hot yesterday, with no relief in sight. The blazing sun scorched all day, causing extreme irritability. According to the records of the Xujiahui Observatory, the highest temperature in Shanghai reached 95.5 degrees before 3 PM yesterday. The heat wave was intense, and the entire city felt like it was boiling. The temperature the day before yesterday was only 90.01 degrees, so yesterday's increase was a staggering 5.4 degrees. The highest temperature on the same day last year was only 75.2 degrees, which is even more different. On the 9th of this month, the heat in this port city also reached 95.5 degrees, but the duration of the high heat was not as long as yesterday's. Yesterday, a horse-drawn carriage collapsed on Route Connaught West of Shanghai due to the horse suffering from heatstroke, and was unable to carry passengers to their destination. The horse lay on the ground for a long time before recovering, and the owner hired a truck to carry it back. The asphalt on the road melted, making it difficult to walk, and this was seen everywhere. The epidemic hospital was also overflowing with patients.

### Fraud of U.S. Dollars, Lawyer Yao Ruilian, Forged Checks, Yong'an Bank Employee Testifies, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentence Scheduled

In addition to practicing law, lawyer Yao Ruilian also established the Yong'an Bank in the Harding Building on Nanjing Road. In November of last year, the bank experienced financial difficulties and colluded with a certain bank employee, Chen Lingmei, to design a scheme to defraud the Bao Tai Bank on Sichuan Road of 1,500 U.S. dollars. The case was discovered, and Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Detective Zhou Kaiwen of the General Police Department arrested Yao and Chen, along with Chen's mistress, former Mainland Dance Hall dancer Shen Lili, as well as Zhang Zhaohan and Liu Gengsun, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. The case has been

interrogated twice,

as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Meng took the bench in the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing of this case. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that there were two checks. During the previous hearing, the defendant Yao Ruilian denied that they were issued by her. During the adjournment, the police sent detectives to the Yong'an Bank to investigate. According to the bank accountant, Jin Muzhou, the check No. 122034 was indeed issued by Yao on his instructions. It has

two seals

on it, one is "Huikang" and one is "Jiang Wen..." It was found that Jiang works at the Victoria Food Company on Jing'an Temple Road and has dealings with Yong'an Bank. Because Jiang pledged his passbook and account registration seal to Yao Ruilian for 50 yuan, Yao had to keep Jiang's seal as a security measure, so the seal was privately stamped by Yao. However, Huikang is a fictitious number and does not exist. Another check for 600 yuan could not be verified because Yao refused to acknowledge it. Subsequently, witnesses Jin Muzhou and Jiang Wensheng, etc.,

reported to the authorities

and provided evidence. With the case's facts clarified on court, it was ordered to begin the final arguments. After the final arguments between police lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendant's lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, the court agent, student Xuehai, requested the court rule and order the defendants to jointly compensate 1,500 U.S. dollars. Judge Meng then ordered the conclusion of the final arguments and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody separately.

### Rampant Issuance of Bad Checks, Deceptive Tactics Employed, "Slick Operators" Inflict Harm, Legitimate Merchants Should Be Vigilant

Recently, there are many "slick operator" business fronts in the market, specializing in defrauding people of goods using deceptive tactics. Legitimate merchants are easily deceived if they are not careful. These swindlers often order goods from various colleagues, giving them bad checks from certain banks (because it is extremely easy to open accounts at these banks, no guarantee is required, you can open a check account with 50 yuan, and there are also gifts). When the due date arrives, the checks cannot be

cashed due to insufficient funds.

If the creditor negotiates with the company, they find that it has closed its doors. Chen Yaoxiang is one of these types of individuals. On March 4 of this year, he colluded with his accomplices Qiu Zixin and Cao Yicheng to set up a "slick operator" business front, the Housheng Cotton Cloth Company, at No. 12 Yingchunfang, Lane 203, Hubei Road. However, in the span of two months, due to poor business, they experienced financial difficulties. By the beginning of June, these individuals began to

employ deceptive tactics

to target various cotton cloth merchants. It is estimated that 17 people were deceived, all of whom were fellow villagers from Tongzhou. These fellow villagers bring cloth from their hometown to Shanghai to sell for small profits. Now they sell the cloth to Housheng Cloth Company, and what they get in return are bad checks from certain banks. On the afternoon of June 6, this company

used tactics

to deceive the Tongtai Cloth Company on Ningbo Road out of 40 bolts of cloth. On the same afternoon at 5 PM, they took it to the Guanglifeng Pawnshop on Caishi Street in the French Concession to pawn it. At the same time, they hired lawyer Zhou Liangfu to publish a declaration in the newspaper on June 7 announcing their impending liquidation. When the Tongtai Company found out about this, they reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Zhang Bingying conducted an investigation.

The Prosecution

Sued According to Law

Meanwhile, they requested that the First Special Court issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai presided over a collective hearing. The defendants Qiu Zixin and others were absent. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the details of the case and requested a postponement. The court ordered that the defendants be arrested and brought to court for further review.

### Gang of Thieves Caught

Two Detained by Japanese Army, Hand Grenade Seized

Huatamu Feng Qishan of the General Inspectorate, having learned that a gang of thieves was hiding at No. 14 Shanjia Garden Lane, Rue de Klein, and were in possession of dangerous articles, informed Huatamu Fan Defu and Huatamu Jiang Shangpei, Yang Peisheng, Zhu Wanjun, Tian Changyuan, Peng Bingsheng, and others. The assembled police rushed to the address fully armed yesterday, and successfully apprehended Ningbo natives Zhao Ayou, Zhao Hongqing, Jin Yunquan, Cao Sufa, Mao Yuxing, Zhang Baogen, Wang A Yao, Yu Wenchang, Wang Ruxing, and female Zhao Aizhen. A hand grenade was confiscated from their possession. After questioning, it was discovered that another Jiangbei native, Wu Jinsheng, had been apprehended at Avenue Haig. From Wu, it was learned that more accomplices were hiding at No. 7 Rue Robert, and that they had a large amount of military supplies hidden there. In response, the assembled police officers rushed to the address with members of the Japanese military police, and captured two Jiangbei natives, Wang Yongzhen and Liu Tong (nicknamed "Little Cobbler"). They were immediately detained by the Japanese military police. Yesterday morning, except for Wang and Liu, the remaining suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baozhen stated that the defendants had confessed to committing numerous theft cases at the police station, and that there were still two suspects at large, and that the case had not yet been filed. He requested that the suspects be temporarily detained for further investigation. After questioning the defendants, Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered all defendants to be detained and re-interrogated at a later date.

### A Female Refugee Reduced to Beggary, Kidnapped into a Brothel, and a Thug Attempting Extortion: All Detained and Scheduled for Sentencing

Liu Jindi, an 18-year-old woman from Yixing, came to Shanghai from her hometown this spring and lived a hard life at a refugee camp on Jessfield Road. Recently, the camp was closed down, leaving Liu homeless and forced to beg. She spent her days begging in the Xiaoshaba Road area and sleeping in the alleys at night. On the 12th of this month, Liu was led by two elderly female companions to the Zhiji Lane, No. 8, Zhabei Road brothel run by Hu Peizhen, a native of Zhenjiang in the Public Concession, and her concubine, Wang Guibao, to begin a life as a prostitute.

Forced to Receive Customers

Later, because Liu developed a urinary incontinence, in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 8 PM, the madam Wang Guibao instructed the thug Jin Linbao and Jin Asan, both from Shaoxing, to take her to the Zhenji Teahouse on Xiaoshadu Road, opened by her fellow townsman Shi Jinquan, and falsely accuse him of kidnapping and selling Liu to the Zhabei Road No. 8 brothel to work as a prostitute, demanding 200 yuan. Unable to get the money, they started arguing, and were caught by the Chinese detective Tan Jinhai,

Who Investigated the Matter

The two Jins were arrested, and Hu Peizhen and Wang Guibao were also apprehended from the Zhabei Road No. 8 brothel, along with Wang Fengxian, a 21-year-old woman from Yangzhou. (It was discovered that this woman had been working as a factory worker at the Shenxin Mill, No. 140 on Macau Road, and was abducted into the brothel by a man named Shen Xiaowangzi, who is still at large, after having received one customer.) All were taken to the Putuo Road police station.

Detained Separately

The two women were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute (rescue home for women), and were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case and requested investigation. After interrogating the defendants, Judge Jiang Shuzi found the facts to be clear and ordered the four male and female defendants to be detained pending sentencing at a later date. Liu Jindi was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care.

### Four Robbers Sentenced Separately

Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Hanbo and Detective Cui Jinchuan of the Gordon Road Police Station previously apprehended the gang of robbers Du Longxing, Chen Chenglong, Jin Asan, and Li Xiaolaohan. Two pistols were confiscated. It was discovered that Du and the others had committed crimes such as armed gang extortion, murder, and robbery in the concession. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, and lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station filed a lawsuit according to the law. The trial was held multiple times. In addition to admitting to the charges, the defendants also confessed that Rang San was the mastermind behind the case. The court trial concluded, and Judge Liu Yugui pronounced the sentences in the Second Criminal Tribunal yesterday morning. Du Longxing was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for continuous extortion and kidnapping. Chen Chenglong was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for associating with others and carrying weapons to commit robbery. He was found not guilty of murder. Jin Asan was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for continuously associating with others, carrying weapons, and breaking into residences at night to commit robbery. He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for continuous attempted murder. The combined sentence was twelve years of imprisonment. He was found not guilty on other charges. Li Xiaolaohan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for associating with others, carrying weapons, and breaking into residences at night to commit robbery. All pistols and bullets were confiscated.

### Middle-Aged Woman Not Content at Home: Xia Maofu Kills His Wife, a Single Knife Wound to the Abdomen Causes Intestines to Spill Out

Xia Maofu, a 44-year-old man from the Touzhen of Dachang Temple, married Qian, who is now 37 years old. They came to Shanghai to take refuge after the "August 13th" incident and lived together in a bungalow in Putuo Fang. After the National Army retreated westward, Xia often traveled between Shanghai and his hometown. His wife, Qian, despite being middle-aged, was promiscuous. She recently became involved with Ge Yuzhen, who worked as a carpenter. Seeing that Xia was away, Ge took his place and had an affair with her. Recently, Xia discovered the affair, so he remained calm and returned home on the Dragon Boat Festival on the 21st of the lunar month, visited his wife, and then left, claiming to return to his hometown. Unexpectedly, at 7 AM yesterday morning, Xia suddenly returned and saw his wife in the room. Without asking any questions, he took out a sharp knife and stabbed her abdomen. She was caught off guard and was stabbed, causing her intestines to spill out and blood to splatter all over the floor. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, Xia quickly fled the scene. Someone reported it to the police, and she was rushed to the hospital. Her life is said to be in critical condition.

### Zhai Changshun, Owner of a Fish Business, Continued Hearing on a Boat Rental Dispute, Both Sides Stick to their Positions, Sentencing Scheduled

Han Funan, a 49-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 44 Tongfu Lane, Min Tini Yin Road in the French Concession, owned a small steamboat before the August 13th incident, which traveled along the inland rivers. Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident and the retreat of the National Army westward, the steamboat could not operate and was moored within the blockade line at Tiansheng Port in Nantong. In March of last year, Qu Changshun, the owner of the Qu Changshun Fish Business, and his nephew, Qu Jiugao, rented the steamboat from Han to transport fish. A three-month lease was agreed upon at the time, and after the term expired,

The rental was terminated. Han claimed that Qu Mingqing continued to rent the boat individually after the lease expired, and Liu Wuzhai from Wuxi came forward to sign the lease renewal contract, with Qu Mingqing acting as the guarantor. However, Qu and the others, without obtaining the consent of the boat owner, added the steamboat to the Japanese-owned "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" and renamed it "Yixing Maru" to navigate the waters. They hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Tribunal of the Second Special District Court against Qu Mingqing, Liu Wuzhai, and others to return the steamboat.

The initial trial resulted in a loss for the plaintiff, Han Funan. Han, dissatisfied with the verdict, again commissioned lawyer Wu Peng to appeal to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The appellees, Qu Mingqing and Liu Wuzhai, hired lawyer Tang Ying. The case was heard once and then postponed. Witnesses were summoned and investigated, and the parties were ordered to mediate outside the court. As the two parties failed to reach a settlement outside the court, the acting presiding judge of the Third Branch of the Higher Court, Tong Jishi, along with judges Wu Xiangzu and He Jingcen, convened a collegial panel yesterday afternoon at 3 PM to continue

The trial. Both parties were represented by their lawyers. Wu Peng, the lawyer for the appellant, stated that no settlement had been reached, and that he was dissatisfied with the original judgment and requested that it be overturned and that the appellees be ordered to jointly return the Yongfu steamboat, and explained the grounds for the appeal. Tang Ying, the lawyer for the appellees, argued that the appellant's Yongfu steamboat was parked at the Shanghai dock when it was rented out, so the appellees parked it at the old garbage bridge dock in Shanghai when the lease expired on July 17, fulfilling their obligation to return the vessel.

The testimony of the witness Cai Juming, who was hired by the appellant, was naturally unfavorable to the appellees, and the testimony was also contradictory. Why would the appellees park the boat and incur rent and losses themselves? Furthermore, how the Yongfu steamboat was towed away by the "Shanghai Shipping Company" had nothing to do with the appellees. The accusation that the appellees added the boat to the "Shanghai Shipping Company" was false. The appellant himself had also contacted the "Shanghai Shipping Company" several times. The boat boss, Cai Juming, also admitted that after the steamboat was towed away, his wages were also paid by the "Shanghai Shipping Company."

Moreover, the appellant's boat was originally berthed in Tiansheng Port after the August 13th incident, and he entrusted the "Shanghai Shipping Company" to tow it out, which was evidenced by the documents. As for the witness Wang Zhiliang, he was completely instigated by the appellant to make false accusations. The suggestion that the appellees persuaded Wang to negotiate compensation was laughable. The original judgment was fair and appropriate and should be upheld and the appeal dismissed. After reviewing the facts, the court declared the arguments closed and scheduled the sentencing for the 27th.

### Raping his Concubine's Daughter

Wang Xiuzhen, a 37-year-old woman from Jiading, and her 14-year-old daughter, Huiying, became acquainted with Zhang Qiwen from Pudong. Zhang is currently unemployed and living with them in the Andong Inn, No. 7, East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. Wang Xiuzhen suddenly reported to the French Police the day before yesterday that Zhang Qiwen had forcibly raped Huiying, causing her to contract syphilis and copious amounts of vaginal discharge. She requested an investigation. The police chief immediately sent a detective to arrest Zhang. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Bureau, requested that the investigation be postponed. Wang Xiuzhen and her daughter testified about the rape. The defendant confessed that he had raped her. He stated that because he was unemployed, the mother and daughter worked part-time, and the income was not enough for the concubine to smoke opium. He accused the mother and daughter of having affairs outside and hating him, so they falsely accused him out of spite. After reviewing the confession, Judge Miao Qingbang ordered the case to be postponed to July 1 for further hearing. The defendant was detained, and the woman was sent to the forensic doctor for examination pending verification.

### Six Preparatory Meetings of the Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory

The Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory held its sixth preparatory meeting yesterday. The following resolutions were made: (1) Trademark: The slogan on the factory's lifesaver trademark, which was originally "Safety First," should remain the original slogan and should be registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs first.

### Letter

To the Editor,

According to the statement of the party concerned, Anbu Enterprise Company, it was recently read in the news column of today's Shen Xin newspapers that there was a news item about a lawsuit involving the company and Ye Huating for land rental. The description of the process is mostly inconsistent with the facts. The Yichang Road Seymour Road base was rented by Ye Huating to this company for the use of building houses, not rented to Yin Zhiling personally. The statement in Shen Xin newspapers that Yin Zhiling, in the name of Yin Chulan of Anbu Enterprise Company, rented one mu and two fen of land on Huji Yichang Road Seymour Road from Ye Huating last winter is obviously untrue. Furthermore, it was also found that during the court hearing the day before yesterday, Ye Huating and his lawyer applied to summon the two people, Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao, from the original China, but the court rejected them in court and ordered the arguments to be concluded and the judgment to be announced on the 24th of this month. However, Xin Shen newspapers reported that Lawyer Pan requested in court to summon Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao from the original China to the court to prove the negotiation process at that time. After questioning both parties, the court ordered the hearing to be postponed, which is even more inconsistent with the facts. In addition, the previous process of this case and the court hearing on that day are mostly inaccurate. It is believed that Ye Huating intends to discredit the reputation of this company by deliberately sending false information to the news agency for publication in Xin Shen newspapers. Please ask your lawyer to send separate letters to the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao to make corrections, as requested by the parties. We have sent separate letters to each newspaper as requested, and hope that your newspaper will publish this letter in the letter column as a correction. Sincerely, Lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan, June 22nd.

### From the Realgar Wine of the Dragon Boat Festival to the Summer Hygiene of Marital Life

Eating zongzi should indeed remind you of raising sons; raising sons should raise sons with life-giving spiritual power!

In Chinese social customs, in addition to eating zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival, men and women, young and old, all drink some realgar wine. Children's faces, hands, and even their entire bodies are smeared with realgar wine, like a clown with painted faces. In addition, the houses are filled with calamus and wormwood, or even burned with Cangzhu and Baizhi. Although it is said to ward off evil spirits, it is actually an old-fashioned hygiene movement. The significance is to awaken people to the fact that summer has arrived, that the five poisonous creatures are breeding, and that everything must be paid attention to for prevention. That's right, once summer arrives, the weather is hot and humid, the human body tissues are relaxed, and various viruses and bacteria breed. The spread of epidemics is something that cannot be ignored! However, in the summer, due to the hot weather, men and women wear only the lightest and thinnest clothes on their bodies. The flesh is exposed, and humans are emotional animals, so how can they not be moved? Therefore, it is said that summer is the most sensual and erotic season between men and women. In Paris, even a semi-nude goddess statue will cause people to stop and admire it. How much more so a real and lively model? Imagine after a fragrant bath, strolling with a lover in the moonlight before flowers, mutually exchanging the source of love, and murmuring sweet words. What a wonderful realm this is! However, both men and women must have considerable restraint in this realm. Then the life of love can be forever beautiful.

Physical deficiency and strong desire, this is an immortal saying. If a man suffers from nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc., then lust is most likely to be impulsive. However, in the real marital life, it is only a fleeting moment, and his heart is full of guilt! At the same time, the wife's enthusiasm is aroused, but she cannot be satisfied. How painful and remorseful this is! Therefore, in this fragrant and sensual summer, there must be full control over lust, and then happiness can be ensured and health can be secured. Otherwise, it is not only painful but also extremely dangerous! To cure the above-mentioned symptoms and have the ability to control desires, according to the world's famous doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Gonadin" (for both men and women) is the most effective treatment. After men take it, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, nourish the nerves, promote development, and regulate metabolism. After women take it, it can regulate menstruation and seed, make the breasts erect, make the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty. If taken for a long time, it can prolong life, rejuvenate, and become younger. However, men with nocturnal emission must also take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" (available at Zhengwei, Dalu, Huaying, Sino-French, Sino-Western and other major pharmacies) to stop nocturnal emission for faster results. The above-mentioned good medicines, because of their high quality and effective power, are regarded as holy medicines by Chinese and Western people and are happy to use them.

Beauty

### Breasts Can Determine a Woman's Lifelong Destiny

— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

There's no need to shy away from it. No matter how mature and prudent a man is, if he sees a graceful and sensual beauty, everyone will stare and feel an inexplicable affection. The reason why a beauty is so precious and worthy of admiration cannot but be attributed to the pair of breasts on her chest. Because a woman's breasts are like the spire of a glass pagoda. Without it, no matter how exquisite the pagoda is, it will always feel incomplete. A woman without towering breasts rising and swaying gracefully on her chest, even if she has the beauty of Wang Zhaojun and Zhao Feiyan, and wears the most fashionable clothes, will only be called "Sick Xishi" and will not be valued by the men of the times. This can be asserted. Therefore, young women in Europe and America today, when it comes to beauty, are unwilling to waste unnecessary powder fees, but focus on the development of the breasts. They regard the breasts as a second life. If there is a withered state, they will immediately use the German famous medicine "Gonadin" for women to compensate, because the main reason for breast atrophy is that the reproductive gland ovaries are destroyed by chest binding, self-pollution, irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, anemia, etc., which affects the metabolism. Therefore, the most fundamental way is to take the ovarian endocrine preparation "Gonadin" for women, which is the most effective. This agent has been confirmed by the president of the Royal Hospital of England, Harvard Locke Ellis, and Dr. Luxing of the American Baxter Hospital to be well-prepared and highly effective. It can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If you take it in the yellow and humid season, it can not only gradually erect the atrophied breasts, but also regulate menstruation, enhance the various tissues of the body, strengthen the metabolic function, produce a large number of new cells, so that all germs dare not invade, beautify the face and strengthen the body. Its efficacy is truly indescribable.

### Nocturnal Emission is the Precursor to Kidney Deficiency

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Kidney deficiency in married men is common in today's society. The symptoms are that during the spring boudoir comedy between husband and wife, there is premature ejaculation and impotence, and energy is scattered, turning a good thing into a bad thing. In addition, in daily work, there is a feeling of soreness in the waist and back, and fatigue in the limbs. As for the symptoms of mental weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, and blurred vision, they are commonly associated with kidney deficiency.

The body of a young man should be as lush and strong as a spring bamboo shoot. Why does he suffer from kidney deficiency and brain weakness? This is mostly due to self-pollution or nocturnal emission. Because the semen in a young man's body is his most precious source of life, it functions to regulate metabolism and strengthen development, and its effect on nerves is especially great. If self-pollution and nocturnal emission cause excessive consumption of semen, the body will inevitably suffer, and the first to suffer will be the brain and kidneys. Therefore, those who have not been treated for nocturnal emission, symptoms of brain weakness and kidney deficiency are almost inevitable. In addition, incomplete development of the whole body, local smallness like fingers, yellow face, thin muscles, premature aging, and shortened life are also often combined with kidney deficiency and brain failure. Indeed, such a man, showing incompetence everywhere, not only has no hope of success in learning, but also in the marital life of passing on the family line, often makes seeking pleasure turn into displeasure, and there is no marital love, or no children are born, leaving a lifelong regret!

The only cure for nocturnal emission is to purify the heart and reduce desires, abstain from self-pollution, and take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop nocturnal emission, which is the most effective treatment. If nocturnal emission has caused symptoms such as brain weakness, kidney deficiency, incomplete development, and premature aging, then the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Gonadin" must also be taken to cultivate and nourish the brain and kidneys, increase semen and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote the function of development. If continued, it will definitely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time and make the body exceptionally healthy. If the afflicted can come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment, and at the same time use electrotherapy and injection methods, the results will be faster.

### The New Value of Electrotherapy in Treating Gonorrhea

In the past decade, there has been significant progress in the treatment of gonorrhea, especially in physical therapy. Considering electrotherapy within physical therapy, it initially used wavelengths, then discovered that long-wave electrotherapy could not fully exhibit its sterilizing capabilities in certain environments. Thus, further research and improvements led to the invention of short-wave electrotherapy, which proved to be more efficient in application and sterilization compared to long-wave. However, short-wave also has its shortcomings in certain situations, while long-wave retains its advantages. Therefore, both long-wave and short-wave electrotherapy should be used in conjunction for gonorrhea treatment, but they both have numerous limitations that are difficult to enumerate. Consequently, scholars have tirelessly researched and improved electrical equipment, leading to advancements. The electrotherapy commonly used by physicians today is mostly outdated and does not provide the desired sterilizing effect. Dismissing electrotherapy altogether because of this is an oversimplification by those with superficial knowledge. There is now a newly invented electrotherapy that best meets our ideal – the Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy.

Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy is the latest invention in the German electrotherapy field. Its penetration and sterilizing power are just right, avoiding both excess and deficiency. It can thoroughly eliminate gonococci in the lymph nodes of both acute and chronic gonorrhea patients. As a result, major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and America are equipped with Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy machines. Since the invention of Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy, electrotherapy in the treatment of gonorrhea has been re-evaluated. Based on my experience over the past decade, Filtered Lymph Therapy is the best among electrotherapies. If the condition is carefully assessed and supplemented with appropriate treatments, such as prostate massage for prostatitis and He氏 serum for arthritis, a complete cure can be achieved within a limited time. This is because Filtered Lymph Therapy can sterilize and filter out lymph toxins, while the serum can eliminate gonococci in the blood.

### Overview of China's Broadcasting Education in the Past Three Years (Part 1): Modifying Programs to Meet Needs, Purchasing and Distributing Radios to Various Provinces

(Chongqing Aviation News) Xu Langqiu, an official in charge of broadcasting education at the Ministry of Education's Department of Social Education, recently submitted a document to his superior department for reporting to the Ministry of Education for review, outlining the state of China's broadcasting education over the past three years. The original report is quite lengthy, and the following is an excerpt:

Starting from October 10, 1935, the Ministry of Education added educational programs to the Central Broadcasting Station, hiring staff to broadcast daily. However, due to the lack of a confirmed budget, the Ministry could not afford to handle matters such as purchasing and distributing equipment and printing lecture notes. Starting in 1936, special funds were allocated from the public education construction fund, and a six-year plan was established. After approval, the plan was gradually implemented. Despite the outbreak of the war of resistance, efforts continued unabated, but transportation, equipment manufacturing, editing, printing, and inspection were all affected. The following is a summary of the implementation situation over the past three years:

Improving Programs

The original educational segments were scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with lectures aimed at the general public, focusing on various common-sense materials. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays were reserved for lectures to middle school students, focusing on basic knowledge of various subjects. The writing and broadcasting were all handled by scholars and experts in various fields hired by the Ministry of Education. Starting in 1936, to further promote public literacy education, a textbook teaching program for public schools was added. The Ministry of Education sent staff to teach the Ministry's-compiled textbooks for public schools daily. In addition to free distribution by provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus, over 800 people requested textbooks directly from the Ministry of Education, demonstrating the program's effectiveness. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, all educational broadcasts focused on resistance propaganda. The Ministry of Education hired experts with expertise in military affairs and politics to write scripts, which were broadcast by Ministry staff. When the government relocated, and the Central Broadcasting Station ceased broadcasting, the Ministry of Education was also ordered to temporarily move to Changsha, where it broadcast resistance education through the Changsha Broadcasting Station. Later, the Ministry of Education moved again to Chongqing, establishing an office in Hankou. In addition to maintaining the resistance education program at the Central Broadcasting Station in Chongqing three times a week, the Ministry of Education also added a youth self-study program at the Hankou Municipal Broadcasting Station, providing an opportunity for out-of-school youth to supplement their basic scientific knowledge. The subjects were biology, physics and chemistry, and civics. Later, the Wuhan office of the Ministry of Education was abolished, and staff moved to Sichuan. All broadcasting matters in Hankou were handled by the Ministry of Education providing materials and distributing them to local radio stations for broadcast. The educational program broadcasts at the Changsha Broadcasting Station were also handled by a Ministry staff member stationed at the station to write and broadcast scripts. At the Chongqing office, in addition to the staff assigned by the Ministry of Education to conduct resistance education broadcasts, a public wartime knowledge program was added, airing twice a week. Future improvements may be made as needed.

Purchasing and Manufacturing Radios

The radio receivers distributed by the Ministry of Education to various provinces and cities were all ordered from the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the National Construction Commission and the China Electrical Engineering Corporation. A total of 1,000 units were purchased in 1935 and 1,370 in 1936. However, due to the war, 200 units from the Electrical Machinery Plant and 275 units from the China Electrical Engineering Corporation were delivered in Hankou only in 1938 and distributed for use in the southwestern provinces. In 1938, the radios were issued based on cash disbursements, with each provincial education department purchasing and distributing them. The following is a statistical record of the radio receivers purchased and distributed by the Ministry of Education over the years: (1) In 1935, subsidies were provided for 1,000 radio receivers to various provinces and cities: 149 to Shandong, 129 to Fujian, 126 to Hunan, 88 to Zhejiang, 62 to Anhui, 55 to Guangxi, 8 to Shaanxi, 43 each to Hubei and Gansu, 40 to Shanxi, 38 to Jiangxi, 37 to Sichuan, 25 to Chahar, 20 to Yunnan, 19 to Beiping, 18 to Guangdong, 16 to Guizhou, 9 each to Hebei and Suiyuan, 8 to Xinjiang, 7 to Ningxia, 3 each to Shanghai, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei, and 2 to Jiangsu.

(3) In 1937, a total of 410 units were distributed: 125 to Guangdong, 108 to Guangxi, 75 to Yunnan, 50 each to Guizhou and Sichuan, 1 to Gansu, and 1 to an affiliated organization of the Ministry of Education. (4) In 1938, a total of 222 units were distributed: 29 to affiliated organizations of the Ministry of Education, 24 to Gansu, 20 to Sichuan, 15 each to Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Xikang, 10 each to Zhejiang, Henan, and Yunnan, 5 each to Ningxia, Xinjiang, Anhui, and Fujian, 4 to Central government organizations, and 3 to Chongqing Municipality, and 2 to Mongolia and Tibet. In total, subsidies were provided for 2,513 radio receivers to various provinces and cities over the four years.

### Wimbledon Tennis Tournament to Open Next Monday; Xu, Cai, and He Will Participate; Draw Completed

(Reuters, London, 21st) The Wimbledon Tennis Tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday. The draw was completed today, and Chinese Davis Cup players Xu Chengji, Cai Huiquan, and He Renxuan have excellent chances of winning in the first week. In the first week, He Renxuan will face Czechoslovakia's Bohemia's Troloni, and British main player Austin is also in this first section. Cai Huiquan will face Ireland's Egan in the second section, and French international tennis champion McNeil and Henkel are in this second section. Xu Chengji will first face Britain's Gan in the third section, and Sudeten player Menzel is in the third section.

Chinese young female player He Aiying will face a strong opponent in the first week, last year's finalist, Danish master Sperling. Miss Marble, who is the most vocal champion in this year's women's singles, is also placed in the same section.

In the first week of men's doubles, Xu Chengji will be paired with Irish Davis Cup player Rogers and will face McNeil (USA) and Smith (UK). He Renxuan and Pei Lai (UK) will face Edward and Moton (UK).

In mixed doubles, Hogen (Netherlands) and He Aiying (China) will play against Olive and Miss Niguel (UK). Xu Chengji (China) and Miss Hut (UK) will play against Davis and Mrs. Na'ait (UK). Xu and Miss He have a bye in the first week, so both matches will be played in the second week.

Seeded Players: Xu Not Selected

(Haitong News Agency, London, 22nd) The Wimbledon tennis seeded players were announced here yesterday as follows:

(A) Men's Singles (1) Austin (UK) (2) Riggs (USA) (3) McNeil (USA) (4) Ponsak (South) (5) Henkel (Germany) (6) Kirk (USA) (7) Menzel (Germany) (8) Roacheski (Poland)

(B) Women's Singles (1) Marble (USA) (2) Jacobs (USA) (3) Sperling (Denmark) (4) Mrs. Mathieu (France) (5) Kidritsichosky (Poland) (6) Stanmer (UK) Hardwick (UK) (7) Faping (USA)

(C) Men's Doubles (1) Henkel Midaksasa (Germany) (2) Kirk Riggs (USA) (3) Baurotra Brunen (France) (4) Hale Wilder (UK)

(D) Women's Doubles (1) Faping Marble (USA) (2) York (UK) Jacobs (USA) (3) Mrs. Mathieu (France) Kidritsichosky (Poland) (4) Nicole Nasser (UK)

(E) Mixed Doubles (1) Kirk Miss Faping (USA) (2) Riggs Miss Marble (USA) (3) Malfoy (New Zealand) Miss Nasser (UK) (4) Gujevick (South) Mrs. Mathieu (France)

Sports figures here are surprised by the above decision, in which Polish representative Roacheski was elected and Chinese representative Xu Chengji was not selected. Another noteworthy point is that Miss Nicole of the UK, in women's doubles, is only sixteen years old and is participating in Wimbledon for the first time. Finally, the status of the United States in the international tennis world can be seen from the fact that the United States accounts for as many as eleven of the twenty-eight players.

Free Talk

### My Thoughts on "The Patriot"

— Sima Sheng

I read the original book of "The Patriot" a long time ago and had many feelings to express. If at that time many people were mobilizing to translate it, and there was a grand and bustling situation, it seemed inappropriate to join in with my superfluous words. Recently, after seeing several translated versions on the market and reading Mr. Lin Ying's article "Having Read 'The Patriot'" in Free Talk, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions, and I had to express myself.

My feelings about "The Patriot" are generally the same as Mr. Lin Ying's; the only difference is that I was not as "moved to anger" as he was. Speaking frankly, Pearl Buck's novels are nothing special, especially her descriptions of Chinese people and affairs, which are simply ridiculously superficial. Although her descriptions of Chinese peasant life in "The Good Earth" could "sell savage heads to the West," when our own people read it, we can see many flaws. However, because she is a Westerner, this understanding seems to be enough to make readers admire her (I wonder how many works in the Chinese literary scene are even more superficial than hers!). The reason why she was able to "cause a sensation in the American publishing industry," "make a fortune," and even receive the Nobel Prize was probably for this reason. It is certain that a writer with such insufficient understanding would not be able to write well about such a great scene, such a turbulent era, and such complicated subject matter. Therefore, the failure of "The Patriot" was expected and "not worth mentioning" in the first place. However, it is a bit unexpected that such an unremarkable work has not only "caused a sensation in the American publishing industry" again, but has also "mobilized a large number of cultural figures to translate and promote" it. This is largely why Mr. Lin Ying was "moved to anger."

I think the shortcomings of "The Patriot" lie in its avoidance of difficulties, its avoidance of importance, and its simplification of complexity. Since the scene of this story includes the major changes in China over the past decade, the emphasis should be on depicting the Chinese people reflected in these changes. Since it extends to the War of Resistance Against Japan and even after the evacuation of Hankou, it should have described the Chinese people's world-shaking heroic resistance attitude. However, due to insufficient experience, the author has slipped over these important factors. Therefore, when we examine the original book, we find that almost more than half of it is devoted to describing a love story; and even in that small half, there is no effort to depict or render it, but rather an attempt to avoid all actual scenes. This is the biggest shortcoming I have found.

In addition, the author writes the characters in the book very vaguely; this vagueness is also due to her insufficient understanding and experience. Wu Yifan and Liu Enlai should be two progressive archetypes, but she has written them into two legendary figures, with little to recommend them. However, I think it is a bit excessive for Mr. Lin Ying to think that there are insults to China. Although the excerpts he selected "declared" that they were "not out of context," I think they misunderstood the original meaning. "The author's portrayal of the Tongzhou Incident" is a description of the shameless propaganda in Japanese newspapers. "The author...selected this unfortunate event and satirized it," as well as satirizing the Chinese Air Force and Army, is a description of Yi Ke's traitorous intentions and traitorous theories. This seems necessary in a novel, because not every character in a novel can be a hero, and not every character is a good person. There are always bad people and opposing opinions.

I am not favoring the original author, but I think Pearl Buck may be quite sympathetic to China, but because she lacks understanding and experience, her descriptions are very vague and somewhat counterproductive. If you don't believe me, I can also excerpt a passage below:

"I saw, I saw with my own eyes—he told them to bring a woman into his tent. She was crying and struggling, but he walked towards her without hesitation—I was mad. I went to the street—I—I saw the first woman—a child—who must have been twelve years old—although maybe she was only ten years old, maybe fifteen years old—maybe she was saying her age was younger (suspected translation error)—I dragged her into the alley too..."

To do what? I don't think I need to excerpt any further. What is written here is the inhumane atrocities of a certain country! And such depictions are "readily available" throughout "the whole book."

### To the Nameless Heroes

— Time Light

Friends: I am the person who fears loneliness and calmness the most. To me, loneliness and calmness are like a night of utter darkness, with no lights, no stars, no moon, being in an abyss of ten thousand feet, having to climb through tens of thousands of tunnels, which frightens me so much.

Before the war, I had many friends who understood and sympathized with each other. They often gathered together, and most of what they talked about was the current world situation and the international situation. Generally, friends were also generous, forthright, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible, even more so than ordinary men. But shortly after the war, two disappeared, and have been missing for nearly two years; one sacrificed herself, and she sacrificed herself exactly today last year!

Only I am still living alone on this devil island, living the life of a weak woman, and everything has become my memory. But I am not depressed; you, martyrs, have died gloriously, but you have achieved your own aspirations, and your great spirit will exist forever.

Ah, friend, now another message comes, and I almost don't believe my ears, you have sacrificed yourself for the country! Really, you died, I laugh, I laugh at your getting benevolence by seeking it. An overseas Chinese who grew up overseas, would sacrifice himself and come to the embrace of the motherland, which is full of flames of war. He went from America to China, his blood staining the battlefield, how great that is!

You are a young man full of vigor. In the team, you worked even harder to shoulder your responsibilities. In less than two months after joining the army, you took on four positions by yourself. You took the lead in charging on the front lines, you taught the brothers in the army, you taught the people to sing popular songs, and you ran the wall newspaper.

I still remember: "The environment is like this, but I have to transform the environment and fight against the environment!" you said.

"Friend, I hope you go forward bravely. That's right, the environment is for us to create!" I always advised you like this when I heard you talk about some special circumstances in that place. We were so impressed with each other when we first met, and that's how we got to know each other, but there weren't many opportunities for us to have long talks all day long, because everyone was busy. You were resolute and mature, extremely alert, and your eyes would often turn dark black when you encountered a difficult thing. You sympathized with all the oppressed people in the world, and even went to work as a dockworker yourself, and also worked as a handyman in a factory. There are very few children like you who are born into bourgeois families!

From now on, may you rest peacefully in the warm soil of the motherland. Your phosphorescent bones and bright red flesh and blood are all making fertilizer for the growing new China. In the near future, more beautiful buds will grow on this land.

Ah! Great and glorious dead, nameless heroes who will always live in our hearts, when will I be able to bring a bouquet of flowers, lift the grass in front of your tomb, and solemnly offer it to you?

### Voices from the Inland

— Lun Ting

Come on, friends! If you don't plan to come, you must come; if you plan to come but still want to come later, come sooner!

I know you are dissatisfied on the isolated island. Some of you are studying, but you are not settled, because Shanghai is not a place to study at all, especially now. Some of you are doing small things, barely able to make a living, but you feel bored, thinking that working like this is too meaningless. Some of you are venturing out, or are even more oppressed by life, and are bored beyond compare. You all want to live more satisfied and happier lives.

Then, strangely, why don't you come to the inland? The inland has freedom, you can do whatever you want. The inland has vigor, which can make a decadent person rise up. The inland is full of meaningful work, those who are strong can carry guns, those who are eloquent can propagandize, and those who have specialized skills can be used appropriately. The inland not only has no worries about life, but is also richer in the reality of life. Why don't you come?

You must come, and come sooner! You know, our pain is gradually passing; our light is just ahead; all our great goals are about to be achieved. Are you unwilling to welcome such an era? Are you unwilling to participate in the realization of this era? If you rely on the isolated island, if you are not intending to wait to be slaves of a fallen country, are you intending to stand by now and enjoy the fruits of your labor in the future? Don't you have ambition? Don't you have ambition?

Of course, you also have various difficulties that prevent you from getting away. But have you forgotten the timeless motto "Where there is a will, there is a way"? As long as you have the will, I believe your family's burdens can be resolved; as long as you are willing to ask others, you will definitely be able to find a suitable path.

Please temporarily close your physical ears and eyes, and listen with the ears of your heart, we are calling you, please come and participate in the joyous banquet that will be held soon; look with the eyes of your heart, we are waving to you, please join us in repelling the invaders, and then together build our new China!

Come on, friends on the isolated island!

### (7) The Experience of Victory

Victory is welcomed by people, and failure is hated by people; however, how many people can live a victorious life? The Christian Paul said: "I discipline my body and make it my slave." Paul knew that the greatest enemy of man is himself. A man can conquer cities and lands, but he may not be able to conquer himself. I can frankly tell the reader that it is yourself, you know that you can still whitewash on the outside, but on the inside you are absolutely cursed! Man's ego has no goodness! Trapped in the pit of sin, unable to extricate himself! Throughout his life, from childhood to the present, the sins he has committed are countless! Even Paul once repented and said: "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?" But according to the Apostle Paul, his experience of victory was this: "Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! I can be rescued, I can be victorious." It can be seen that the secret of Paul's victorious life is not relying on his own works, but relying on his submission to the Lord Jesus. Throughout the ages, countless Christian saints have confirmed in their life experiences that Paul's words are absolutely true. —Shanghai Christian Literature Society, P.O. Box 1227

### The Soviet Union: "I'll have to leave you for a while."

### Impressions of a Journey (Continued)

— Li Jinming

"But the more people with lazy cultural psychology, the more pitiful they are, the more they will be regarded as 'elegant and leisurely', and the more they can live comfortably. If this psychology becomes the current trend, it will be terrible, and literature will definitely become something like licorice and mint, which can clear the mind and cool the lungs when eaten, but cannot cure any real diseases. Literature should be more effective than licorice and mint, at least it should be able to cure the common cold.

'If one function is lazy, the second function will also become lazy. Because to fob off the viewing public with lazy thoughts and art, the second writer thinks that this must be an easier path to take, thinking that four or five packs of Beautiful brand cigarettes bought for a dime must not have come from a little bit of luck. So everyone rushed to make cheap goods, I think this is very sad, because people are forcing us to walk this path of decline!...'

'...You may as well try to do some great works, leaving aside those undue hopes.'

I cut off this paragraph of thinking and inserted it here. I think this technique has already added a lot to the small value of this article, and it is enough for you to get some good impressions from the lightly sketched paragraphs. I myself, in the name of the author, appeal, how can I guide others, but I have said so.

Nine

Early morning, early morning, the little monk came to knock on the door, saying that breakfast was prepared, so that we could go and see the sun rise out of the mountains. I got up and distinguished the road in front of me from the darkness, while waking up the two Pengs, and came to the lit living room.

### Flying

— Jinxi

Not content with mediocrity,

I have the ambition to fly,

On the boundless wilderness,

In front of countless masses,

Bravely giving speeches non-stop,

Making the masses moved,

Their faces excited as if mad.

So, regardless of day and night,

When I speak,

Like the sound of sea waves,

It will inevitably fluctuate;

Swords clashing,

Clanging non-stop,

Truth is victorious,

The groaning robbers are destroyed.

I further declare to the masses;

We are reborn,

In a beautiful society;

Let us raise the torch for the victory of light;

Our swords are held high above our heads.

We are not content with mediocrity,

We want to fly!

### Afterthoughts

— Editor

Since "Having Read 'The Patriot'" was published, many readers have expressed their opinions. Now we have published Mr. Sima Sheng's article, and we have to cut off the others. Because we feel that with these two articles on this book, that's enough. If there are no outstanding insights, we don't plan to talk about it anymore, so as not to waste space.

However, Mr. Sima Sheng thinks that the negative articles in the book are not insults to China, which I cannot agree with, because we love China, so we are not willing to say these things publicly. Pearl Buck claims to love China too, so why is she willing to say it publicly? Moreover, these words are not facts, but some gimmicks she made up to deceive Westerners. It's not too much to say that she insulted China.

Commercial News

### Foreign Merchants Do Not Use Drafts

— Bingzhong

There are two reasons why foreign merchants do not use drafts: first, drafts cannot directly purchase foreign exchange; to buy foreign exchange, they must go through a discounting procedure, which costs several tenths of a percent in discounting fees, so foreign merchants refuse to use them because they are afraid of trouble and want to save money.

However, this should not be the case, because turning the deposits of various banks into drafts is an order from the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and foreigners stationed in China should circulate them as usual and should not discriminate against them. However, it is said that foreigners are justified in not using drafts because of a judicial ruling.

At the beginning of the change to drafts, Chinese people paid foreign merchants with drafts, such as rent, etc., but the foreign merchants refused, and then there was litigation. As a result, the Chinese lost the lawsuit. It is said that drafts were limited to use between the same industries. This was the situation before the August 13th incident, which was indeed the case; but the actual nature of drafts after the August 13th incident was somewhat different. The foreign merchants got this verdict and felt even more confident, and resolutely refused to use drafts.

Therefore, the circulation of drafts has been greatly affected.

However, according to the recent reply from the Ministry of Finance to the Knitwear Industry Association regarding the interpretation of the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currency, the matter can be understood. That is, "If there is any dispute in the legal provisions, it shall be interpreted by the judicial authorities." But "If there are doubts about the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currency, they should all follow the Ministry's instructions and be uniformly implemented, and all levels of courts should also apply uniformly," then the circulation of drafts will naturally not be restricted by any party, and foreign merchants have no reason to refuse to use them.

### Financial News: Cash Restricted, Gold Unable to be Traded, Informal Off-Exchange Prices First Down, Then Up

Yesterday's black market situation for spot gold was caused by the news that the Hong Kong Chinese banks suddenly closed for three days during the Dragon Boat Festival, and that the Shanghai Bankers Association suddenly received an order from the Chongqing National Government that withdrawals were limited to 500 yuan in cash per week, and that amounts above 500 yuan would be paid by draft. This measure was to prevent speculation and manipulation and to prevent capital flight. With the recent tightening of money, the further restriction of cash withdrawals has made the cash market feel even more scarce. Therefore, buyers were immediately at a loss, and the sellers had no way to sell, so the market was at a standstill. As a result, there were no transactions all day long, and off-exchange, it was heard in the morning that some weak bulls were forced to close their positions due to pressure from the collateral lenders. The price was reduced by 249 yuan compared to the pre-holiday price, to 2,420 yuan, but the amount was only dozens of taels. This was purchased by a certain retail outlet. In the morning, it was also heard that Xianghe Gold Shop purchased 10 taels from customers and transferred 10 taels to customers. The prices were both 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, after the foreign exchange market rose sharply during the day, it suddenly tightened, causing the black market gold price to rebound upwards. The final buying price was around 2,600 yuan, a drop of 70 yuan compared to the pre-holiday price.

Confused Inflow and Outflow of Ornaments

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at the large gold shops still opened at 270 yuan, but the buying price was affected by the restrictions on cash withdrawals, and although there was no official market price, the black market price fell sharply. Therefore, the buying price had to be reduced by 15 yuan compared to the selling price. At noon, the buying price had to be reduced by 20 yuan due to the continued weakness of spot gold. At about 2 PM, because the off-exchange buying price of spot gold had risen back to near the 2,600 yuan mark, the buying price went up by 10 yuan. By the evening, the selling price at the large gold shops was still 270 yuan, the new gold shops were 268 yuan, and the buying prices were all reduced by about 10 yuan, usually reduced by 7-8 yuan.

British Standard Gold Unchanged

According to a London telegram on the 21st, the price of British standard gold per ounce remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5.5 pence, so the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remained fixed at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold price remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Impact: British Gold Once Loosened to Seven "Ban" (a unit of currency) / American Dollars Also Reached 13.625 Yuan Early / Japanese Banks Absorbed in the Afternoon, Then Gradually Tightened Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the HSBC exchange rate, remained unchanged. However, the unofficial market conditions were unpredictable, with extreme confusion in the middle. Generally, it first loosened sharply and then tightened drastically. This was because, in the early morning, news of the Hong Kong China Merchants Bank's three-day closure spread. In response, the Ministry of Finance, to prevent capital outflow, re-implemented restrictions on cash withdrawals by Shanghai's banking and money industries. Starting from the 22nd, all deposits were limited to withdrawals of 500 yuan per week. The already depleted cash became even scarcer, and remittance and discount rates soared to unprecedented levels, reaching over 15%. This caused widespread panic among operators. Hua Merchants Bank and Sino-Western speculators with foreign exchange positions rushed to sell them off. Several smaller banks, which had previously hoarded foreign exchange, faced urgent demands from banks and had no cash, so they had to liquidate and sell. Furthermore, Sassoon, a Western firm, showed an increasingly strong desire to sell British gold. Foreign banks also had weak appetites for buying. With import firms temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude and exporters slightly selling, the foreign exchange market, which had been tight since the outbreak on the 7th of this month, finally loosened dramatically yesterday. At noon, British gold reached a low of seven "ban," and the American dollar reached a low of 13.625 yuan. Supply even exceeded demand several times over. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese bank took advantage of the low prices to absorb large quantities, and import firms also showed buying interest. The supply from sellers also weakened, causing the market to tighten again sharply. British gold once tightened back to six and a half "ban," and the American dollar also softened to 12.615 yuan. Eventually, the market ended with a slightly firmer tone as sellers offered supply again. Spot transactions were quite active, mainly for settling positions, while futures transactions were rare. The Hong Kong dollar also followed the trend of first loosening and then tightening, ultimately depreciating by 0.25.

Many rushed to settle positions.

In the early morning, the recent London silver price continued to drop by 0.125, with the forward price remaining flat. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold price also did not change. The exchange rate between the British pound and the American dollar narrowed by 0.013. The exchange rate with Shanghai remained flat, and the rate with France was slightly higher by 0.003. The American dollar fell against the British pound by 0.0125, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell against France by 0.000625. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning at 6.5 "ban" for British gold and 12.65625 yuan for the American dollar. Compared to the day before the holiday (i.e., Tuesday of this week), the British and American dollars had no change. After the market opened, news of the Ministry of Finance re-implementing restrictions on cash withdrawals by Shanghai's banking and money industries spread. With the current cash shortage, those with foreign exchange positions rushed to sell to exchange for legal tender. Foreign firms temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and foreign banks showed weak appetites for buying, causing the market to suddenly loosen. Sassoon, a Western firm, sold spot British gold to Mais Cargal and Wah Beet Lee and others, pushing the price sharply down to 6.625 "ban". Subsequently, a Hua Merchant Bank sold spot American dollars to Chase Bank, softening the price to 12.875 yuan. When the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged and the silver balance tax was announced to be abolished, (the base price for imposing the tax on the recent silver price was 19.1875 "ban"), Sassoon, a Western firm, began to sell off again. Export trading firms also slightly sold, and Hua Merchant Bank and Sino-Western speculators also competed to sell, causing the situation to become quite chaotic. The loosening trend became more severe. Sassoon, a Western firm, sold spot British gold to Wah Beet Lee and Mais Cargal and others, pushing the price from 6.6875 "ban" to 7 "ban". Later, a Hua Merchant Bank and Sino-Western speculators also sold spot American dollars to Chase Bank and others, pushing the price from 12.90625 yuan to 13.625 yuan. By noon, the selling price of the Hong Kong dollar had also risen to over 46 yuan. At the afternoon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 7 "ban" for British gold and 13.625 yuan for the American dollar.

The extent of the subsequent increase is limited.

Later, a certain Japanese bank took advantage of the low prices to continuously absorb large quantities, and foreign firms also competed to slightly buy back to settle positions. The supply from sellers gradually decreased, causing the underlying trend to suddenly tighten. The Japanese bank bought spot British gold from foreign banks, pushing the price from 6.9375 "ban" to 6.5 "ban". It also bought spot American dollars, pushing the price from 13.5 yuan to 12.625 yuan. Later, Andar sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm, tightening the price back to 44 yuan. When the Japanese bank stopped absorbing, the market trend slightly loosened again. At the late closing, banks' spot selling prices were 6.53125 "ban" for British gold and 12.75 yuan for the American dollar. Compared to the day before the holiday (i.e., Tuesday of this week), British gold was 0.03125 "ban" looser, and the American dollar was 0.09375 yuan firmer. (However, the fluctuations of the British and American dollars throughout the day were quite large, with a difference of 0.375 "ban" for British gold and 1 yuan for the American dollar). The Hong Kong dollar, based on the last transaction price, also increased by 0.25.

### Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Also Fell Back

Hong Kong, 22nd - This morning, the exchange market opened with calm sentiment. Only the forward rate for the British pound increased by 0.03125. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate also rose by 1 yuan for the one-term rate. The rest remained unchanged. At 10:05, the forward rate for the British pound softened, returning to the closing price from yesterday, at 1 shilling and 2.75 pence. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate, influenced by the Ministry of Finance's new restrictions on cash withdrawals, fell back by 1 yuan, also to the closing price from yesterday, at 227 yuan. At 10:15, the Shanghai dollar exchange rate continued to shrink by 2 yuan, to 225 yuan. At 10:30, it further shrank by 2 yuan, to 203 yuan. At 11:30, it drastically shrank by 5 yuan, to 218 yuan. The market opened at 2:30 PM, with a firmer tone. Both the spot and forward rates for the British pound increased by 0.03125, with the spot rate at 1 shilling and 2.8125 pence and the forward rate at 1 shilling and 2.78125 pence. The American dollar also increased by 0.0625, with the spot rate at 28.875 yuan and the forward rate at 28.8125 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rebounded by 4 yuan, to 222 yuan. The Japanese yen also increased by 0.25, to 105.75 yuan. At the close of the afternoon market, the exchange rates for the British pound, American dollar, and Japanese yen all shrank back to the opening prices from the morning. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate also continued to rise by 2 yuan, to 225 yuan.

### Due to Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals, Discount Rates Were Nominal

The highest rate once called out was 200 yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rates for remittance drafts and bills soared to an unprecedented and alarming level, becoming a nominal market. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once called out as high as 200 yuan in the morning. Generally, it was 160 yuan, which was 80-90 yuan higher than the day before the holiday (Tuesday). This was mainly because, after the banking and money industries followed the Ministry's order to restrict cash withdrawals for deposits, legal tender in the market became extremely scarce, and those in need became even more desperate. The interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 2.5%, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies Decline

Yesterday, the price of pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies decreased by 0.0125. Due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram ordering the banking and money industries to restrict deposit withdrawals to prevent capital flight, there was a sudden decrease in the number of people buying foreign exchange in the local market. In the early morning, Western merchants provided a smooth supply, and the market conditions were very firm. The British currency weakened to 7 "ban," and the American currency to 13.625 yuan. Market conditions tightened in the afternoon. As a result, the British currency was 6.53125 "ban," and the American currency was 12.75 yuan. In the black market, due to the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals, the problem of legal tender was difficult to solve, and transactions could not be opened. The speculative atmosphere in the market was very strong. Although transactions were settled on the spot, those with strong financial resources had made considerable profits during the war, and those who acted as accomplices transported money abroad. The economic loss to the country was profound and significant. Now that deposit withdrawals are restricted, even a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice. The unofficial market once called out 2,420 yuan, then 2,630-40 yuan. These were not formal transactions and were difficult to complete. If the black market changes to the exchange rate market price, transactions will become scarce. Due to the chaotic exchange market and the impact of the black market closure, foreign currency market conditions first fell and then rebounded, and transactions were quite scarce. Customer demand for British and American gold sovereigns was sluggish, and there were few inquiries about British and American gold notes. Market prices fell, capital flight gradually subsided, and the financial situation improved. The price of Japanese gold notes was first weak and then firm, ultimately being the same as the market price of legal tender. Korean notes were 8.6%, and public association transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market prices for British and American gold sovereigns all decreased by 1 yuan, British gold notes decreased by 0.7 yuan, American gold notes decreased by 0.06 yuan, Hong Kong notes decreased by 0.05 yuan, Singapore notes decreased by 0.04 yuan, Dutch notes decreased by 0.05 yuan, Annam notes decreased by 0.04 yuan, Canadian notes decreased by 0.2 yuan, and Philippine notes decreased by 0.05 yuan. Only Australian gold notes increased by 0.3 yuan. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### The Near-Term Silver Price in the London Market Fell, While the Forward Price Remained Flat / The Silver Market in India Was Weak and Exhausted

London, 21st - Silver market speculators and Eastern sellers traded, and Citibank merchants bought. The market was still flat. After the market closed, the market conditions continued to be flat. American merchants slightly bought at the listed price. The near-term silver price in the London market continued to fall by 0.125, while the forward price did not change. In New York, the American spot price remained unchanged. Also, the silver market in Mumbai, India, continued to be weak. Both spot and futures prices fell by 7 annas. There were a total of 30 transaction orders.

### New Financial Stabilization Measures

— Sheng Mujie

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance, to stabilize the financial situation, implemented temporary financial stabilization measures and supplementary measures. After 22 months of operation, there have been no major obstacles. Recently, after the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance implemented a new financial stabilization measure on June 22nd. The content is very simple: starting from the 22nd, payments for deposits within 500 yuan will be made in legal tender, and payments for amounts over 500 yuan will be made by remittance. Deposits before the August 13th Incident will continue to be handled according to the financial stabilization measures. Funds remitted into the mainland are not subject to these measures, and these measures are limited to implementation in Shanghai.

During the war, the financial situation in Shanghai initially remained relatively stable due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures, although the situation was tense. However, the financial stabilization measures gradually lost their effectiveness over time. At the same time, the emergence of the remittance discount system further weakened the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures in blocking capital. This year, the phenomenon of financial instability in Shanghai has gradually become apparent. I have discussed these two points: First, the results of abundant capital in Shanghai's financial situation cannot be ignored. Due to the abundance of capital in Shanghai, the current deposits of the financial industry have increased significantly. However, Shanghai lacks legitimate avenues for utilization, and the internal transfer of capital to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, a large portion of the capital is diverted to speculative activities, resulting in soaring prices in the concession and the abnormal development of industry. This phenomenon is not only detrimental to the stability of the financial market in Shanghai but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policies. Second, there is pressure on foreign exchange. Shanghai's foreign trade deficit for the first five months of this year totaled approximately 100 million yuan, and the monthly trade situation shows an increase in imports and a decrease in exports. The accumulated trade deficit is increasing, and the amount of foreign exchange required is also increasing. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet regimes' efforts to acquire foreign exchange are also a constant threat. Therefore, the financial stabilization measures are now almost meaningless.

Since the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates on June 7th, the foreign exchange market has been in an obvious state of instability. Although the spot market prices are equal to the HSBC exchange rates, the futures market is extremely depressed. The spread between spot and forward rates is very large, and arbitrage is as high as 5%, causing speculators to flock to arbitrage. Under this situation, Shanghai's financial situation is quite tense. Interbank lending rates, remittance discounts, and discount rates are rising daily. If there is no way to limit the development of this phenomenon, there will still be a very harmful pressure on the adjusted exchange rates. Therefore, to ensure the stability of the exchange market, it is necessary to restrain the use of legal tender - which is the biggest reason for the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures.

The most obvious benefit of the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures is to reduce the need for speculation in foreign exchange and to balance the current speculative commodity prices. The most obvious disadvantage is the temporary difficulty in commercial turnover. At the same time, because the measures are too simple, there are many contradictions in their implementation. For example, if a check for more than 500 yuan is deposited into a bank, some banks accept it, while others do not. If it is said to be a remittance, the former is of course correct, while the latter will inevitably be misunderstood. Because payments could originally be made with checks, the new measures of the Ministry of Finance only state that withdrawals can only be made in increments of 500 yuan per week. It does not say that checks have become remittances. In short, it is best for the Shanghai banking and money industries to formulate a detailed supplementary measure that can flexibly facilitate commercial transactions under the principle of blocking capital.

Finally, after the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures, the remittance discount system should be abolished, otherwise, amounts exceeding 500 yuan will be remitted, and funds cannot be blocked.

(June 12th, noon)

### Securities: Public Sentiment Remains Unstable / Domestic Bonds Fall Again by a Strong 2 Yuan / New Measures for Bank Deposits Revised / Since You Are Issuing Bonds, the Bond Market is Temporarily Suspended for Two Days / Only Two or Three Types of Foreign Stocks Were Traded

Due to the Ministry of Finance not formally announcing information on the principal and interest of public bonds this time, unstable and unsubstantial retail investors still tend to sell due to panic. The market price fluctuates greatly, with a high and low difference of as much as six yuan. Furthermore, the financial sector has revised new measures for deposits according to the Ministry of Finance's order, so various parties cannot utilize banks, which is also a reason for causing public sentiment to become unstable. According to financial sector news, the future is not pessimistic. Yesterday, due to the hot weather, only one market was held in the morning, and transactions were relatively reduced. Most of those with a little strength are watching. Some are reluctantly cutting their losses due to bank loans. Therefore, the Class C bonds rose by one or two yuan when the market opened, with an opening price of 50 yuan. Within five minutes, as selling pressure gradually increased, the market price plummeted. The calling price fluctuated by around one yuan, indicating that buying customers were still controlling the market. Those who were unable to turn over capital had no choice but to sell. It was found that Le Mao Xing Yuan, Tong Kang, and Kang were the most active buyers, while Lian He first sold and then bought, which was the most effective. Tong Shun, Yong Feng, Da Feng, and No. 50 were the most active sellers, and many retail investors also sold off. The market price, which had a little vitality, was hit again. As a result, the market continued to fall by 0.9 to 2.6 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 1 million yuan. Exchange personnel, due to the initial implementation of revised bank measures, decided to temporarily suspend the market for two days starting today due to potential disputes in the collection and settlement aspects.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were transacted at a price of 6.4 yuan.

Also, Shanghai Public Industry Company reported that before the market opened, China Merchants Bank received an order from the Chongqing National Government restricting the withdrawal of current deposits, limiting each household to a maximum withdrawal of 500 yuan per week, resulting in only two or three types of stocks being traded in the market, while the rest had no prices. Only Jardine Matheson stock was active, opening at 19 yuan and quickly falling to 17.8 yuan. But since this price, the market sentiment improved, slowly rising, and the price at closing was 18.7 yuan. Transactions for other stocks were sparse throughout the day, and prices also plummeted drastically, probably due to forced liquidations of speculative positions. The exchange's transactions are mostly invested by Chinese investors. If there is no way to release the restrictions on withdrawals, the exchange's transactions will be restricted, and the market cannot be expanded. If the government's goal is to stop the outflow of capital, it can still adopt other methods instead of hindering people from transferring their capital abroad and only investing in stocks and bonds of companies with legitimate operations in this city.

The stock prices of various Far East companies of London British merchants on the 21st of this month (Wednesday) were stable, and the stock prices of various stocks remained unchanged.

The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds in London on the 21st of this month (Wednesday) showed a slight reduction in the decline. British and German continued to borrow money, and British treasury bills continued to fall by 1 pound, with a price of 53 pounds. Sino-French American dollar 5% public bonds fell by another 2 pounds, with a price of 52 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn: US Agricultural Relief Fund Has Been Passed / Transactions in Both Chinese and Foreign Cotton Have Been Halted

Foreign cotton market prices: In the New York morning cotton market, there was a wait-and-see attitude due to the lack of development in Washington. The incoming news from Liverpool and Mumbai was unfavorable, and prices slightly fell by one or two "pound-sounds". In the afternoon, news came from Washington that the US agricultural relief bill, which was of concern to the world, had made significant progress in discussions. The 225 million yuan relief fund had been passed, and there was still a 11.3 million yuan relief fund specifically for selling excess cotton that needed to undergo further debate before it could be implemented. If the Senate does not make any further changes, according to the observations of various peers, this agricultural bill may receive 36 million yuan for cotton export subsidies. As a result, cotton prices immediately rose. Near-term prices remained unchanged, and long-term prices rose by 14 "pound-sounds". Indian prices, including predictions, fell by 2 rupees, and Egyptian prices fell by more than 10 "pound-sounds".

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: Due to the government's order to the financial sector to restrict withdrawals and prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market, and the detailed measures have not yet been received, the situation in various places is extremely chaotic. Yesterday, there were absolutely no transactions.

Spot cotton business: No transactions were completed for either Chinese or foreign goods. Factories also took no action, probably because the issue of payment for goods was difficult to resolve, resulting in a standstill. However, in addition to the sharp drop of 2-3 rupees in the Indian cotton block corner, the exchange rate has also increased, and the calculated prices have become cheaper. However, in this chaotic state, it is impossible to grasp anything.

### Speculation Is Difficult to Continue / Cash Stagnation

Since the foreign exchange market tightened, the spot yarn market has been experiencing rapid advances and retreats in prices every day, with frequent buying and selling. Due to the very strong new buying trend in the market, new peaks have emerged one after another. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn once reached 510 yuan twice. Yesterday, the banking and money industries followed the Ministry of Finance's order to restrict payments and withdrawals and not exceed the allowed range. As a result, speculators found it difficult to operate, and the market was never able to open, falling into a standstill. In the afternoon, the market was closed and will be reopened after the banking and money industries announce a proper solution, it is said. Also, yesterday, 356 pieces of cotton yarn imported from Tianjin arrived.

### Piece Goods: Financial Impact / Cotton Cloth Transactions Severely Affected / Sudden Interruption of Goods from Shantou

Cotton cloth market conditions: Yesterday, due to the Ministry of Finance's order, Shanghai banks and firms stopped overdrafts and were prohibited from remitting and discounting. Cash deposits could only be withdrawn up to 500 yuan per week. After the news spread, all transactions that used full cash, 30% cash, or 70% remittance as the shipping method came to a standstill due to the lack of cash. The shipping method by remittance was used only by a portion of Chinese factory bleached and dyed cloth and transactions between customers and peers. British and Japanese manufacturers' payments were fully cash, and Chinese factories' unbleached cotton cloth required full cash or a combination of cash and remittance. Some bleached and dyed cloth was also used with cash. As a result, new transactions were mostly halted, and scheduled deliveries could not be fulfilled as usual. Customer transactions for Chinese bleached and dyed cloth were suddenly interrupted due to the Japanese army landing in Shantou and the large-scale transactions in that area coming to an end. Retail business in this city fell sharply by half. Both local and foreign remittances and payments for various orders were still delivered as usual, but only to the extent of existing inventory. New goods, as it was impossible to obtain raw cloth and raw yarn, also had to be delayed. Deliveries of British and Japanese factory orders were not made without payment, and it was also reported that Japanese factories had not cashed some of the cash payments received before the Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday afternoon, all warehouse orders were stopped from payment. British manufacturers, however, returned the above-mentioned uncashed payments to customers and recovered the warehouse orders, but this depended on the customer and was not consistent. It was reported that Japanese factories held a meeting in the afternoon and discussed changing to selling by remittance. Yesterday, 450 pieces of piece goods arrived from Tianjin.

### Food: Cash Is Extremely Tight / Flour Prices Soften Unofficially

Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour factories continued to open at a cash price of 4.65 yuan, but the number of transactions was already small. This was because of the lack of cash in the market in recent days. Yesterday, the bank suddenly restricted cash withdrawals, and remittance and discount rates soared to 150-160 yuan. The people in the market were uneasy, regretting that they had no money to do business, and the business was about to fall into a state of invisible stagnation. Therefore, yesterday's flour sales, except for small retail transactions on the street, customer sales also tended to be cautious. All of this was affected by financial problems. It was said that the foreign flour market had also softened unofficially. It was said that Double Eagle and other brands had opened at a remittance price of 5.05 yuan, and only 2-3,000 bags were transacted. According to the discount rate calculation, they had unofficially fallen by a lot.

Wheat: Yesterday, new wheat sources continued to arrive from Jing, Zhen, Su, Kun, and other places. Factory customers' purchases were still weak. Street brokers also eased up due to the extreme tightness of cash. It was also said that foreign ports continued to come to Shanghai, and another 8,000 tons of Australian wheat arrived in Shanghai. The market outlook was quite severely impacted, resulting in buyers and sellers holding each other back, resulting in lack of transactions. It was said that trading in public bonds was temporarily suspended from today, and it was feared that food transactions would also have to wait for the financial problems to be resolved before returning to normal market conditions.

### Miscellaneous Grain Transactions Severely Affected

Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting cash payments was announced in the financial sector, causing the food market to be the first to be affected. Although the rice market continued to be closed for the Dragon Boat Festival, there would definitely be changes in today's market. The miscellaneous grains market had resumed news broadcasts as usual, but public sentiment was unusually panicked. The hindrance to buying and selling, combined with yesterday's rush to grab hats from the speculators, continued to be confused under double pressure. Market prices were chaotic, and the number of transactions was only a few dozen bags per batch. Yesterday's informal miscellaneous grain market quotations were as follows: Dalian soybeans were priced at 9.775 yuan, Hankou suddenly soybeans were priced at 8.85 yuan, Chongming inner green beans were priced at 11.5 yuan, Chongming Mao Qing beans were priced at 12.5 yuan, Jiading white skin broad beans were priced at 7 yuan, Wujiang Qingpi broad beans were priced at 6.55 yuan, and Maojiashi Beigang Qingpi broad beans were priced at 7.67 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Legal Tender Premium Too High / Sugar Market Chaotic

According to yesterday's sugar market report from London, prices rose again. August rose by 0.03 pounds, to 7 shillings and 0.0225 pence. December rose by 0.0125 pounds, to 6 shillings and 0.0275 pence. Next March rose by 0.0125 pounds, to 6 shillings and 0.025 pence. However, because the Shanghai Association's allotment of foreign sugar was sold for cash, the market price dropped slightly due to the sharp rise in the premium. Spot 24 coarse white fell by 0.02 yuan. The price at this warehouse was 29.2 yuan, with 100 bags traded. The price at the other warehouse was 29 yuan, with a profit margin of 0.015 yuan, but no transactions at the asking price of 21 yuan. This warehouse's Great Golden Coin brand still priced the high coarse at 29.8 yuan, with 30 bags sold. Taikoo brand white fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan. The West Warehouse B brand was 28.8 yuan, with 100 bags. The CW brand was 28.5 yuan, and the East Warehouse was 28.3 yuan, with 175 bags. The West Warehouse CX brand was 28.3 yuan, and the DY brand was 27.8 yuan. The HX brand was 27.65 yuan, with 50 bags traded. The price of spot Dutch red rose by 0.1 yuan, to 19.1 yuan. The rest was unchanged. At the same time, domestic sugar was sold by remittance. Now that the cash premium had soared so much, and news of the Japanese army landing in Shantou had spread, the trend became even more chaotic. The asking price was reduced by 1-3 yuan, and buyers temporarily had no target to grasp, resulting in no transactions. Significant transactions had to wait until the financial situation stabilized slightly before there would be a real price.

Yesterday, 825 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Beihai, and 3,050 bags were transported from Hong Kong, and 2,645 bags came from Shantou.

### Silk and Tea: Fresh Cocoons Difficult to Transport to Shanghai

The problem of transporting fresh cocoons to Shanghai, which has been delayed for nearly a month, is now expected to cause great concern in the future. It was previously reported that nearly 50,000 dan of cocoons from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang lines were expected to be released, but now a certain party is imposing even harsher conditions. It is said that the Chinese side insists on forcibly purchasing half of the cocoons with China Prosperity notes, which has made cocoon transportation even more difficult. According to recent news, 150,000 yuan worth of dried cocoons came to Shanghai from Jiangyin through a third country, but the second batch is unlikely to arrive. Also, 250 dan of dried cocoons were transported by train from the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, but they have now been impounded. It is also reported that the authorities in the guerrilla areas are now making every effort to persuade the people to transport all silk cocoons to eastern Zhejiang, and they do not sympathize with the issue of transporting cocoons to Shanghai. Therefore, based on this speculation, it will inevitably be more difficult to transport dried cocoons to Shanghai.

### Seafood: Yantai Shrimp Tails Continue to Rise

Yantai shrimp tails continue to arrive. Due to lively sales, the arrival and opening of new shipments is immediate, and there is no accumulation. Yesterday, the opening price for Longxu Island tails was 129.5 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous price. Also, Yangjiaogou shrimp tails were traded at a price of 111 yuan.

### Coal: Opened Coke Ash Arrives / More Than 6,000 Tons

White coal ash, which has been sluggish in sales for a long time, has seen its calculated price rise daily since the foreign exchange was revised. The asking price has risen by 3 yuan, and public sentiment is expected to strengthen, appearing to be in a state of preparing for famine. A few days ago, Tongcheng Foreign Company on Jiangxi Road had 6,000 tons of coke ash opened at the port. The coke was lined up on Yangjingbang and sold to a certain company. Therefore, the market situation has stabilized, and the market is moving steadily. It is said that the price of opened coke ash is 22 yuan per ton. For those who pick up their own coke, an additional handling fee will be charged, it is said.

### Welcoming the Tablet into the Shrine

Lord Qin Subo, the City God of Shanghai County, was a Jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) in the Yuan Dynasty. After the dynasty changed, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty thrice sought his services, making him a virtuous minister of his era. His tomb is located at Yubo Bridge in Pudong. Now, due to the construction of a new shrine, his spirit tablet was respectfully invited to be enshrined. On the 18th of the previous month, it was escorted from the County Temple with great pomp. All the clerks and staff involved were respectfully sent along. The procession went to the pier where they boarded a boat. Only the leaders of the Red Banner Society and other associations accompanied the tablet; the rest were dismissed. It is decided that the City God should be honored for the previous sea transport, which was free of any incidents. High officials memorialized the emperor, who bestowed the title "Ling You" (efficacious protector) to express divine favor. The conferral of this honor also extended to the Heavenly Palace, the Wind God, and the Sea God. Last year's sea transport not only avoided storms but also witnessed no moisture damage or theft by shipmen and sailors, which was unprecedented. This is attributed to the Emperor's great fortune and the blessings of the hundred spirits of the sacred crown prince.

### Surveying and Repairing the Yangjing Bridge Project

The Yangjing Bridge on Sichuan Road in the International Settlement is a vital thoroughfare for vehicles and pedestrians. The bridge, constructed of wood, has deteriorated over time. The Public Works Department of the Western merchants estimated the cost of repairs to be 1,322 taels of silver for materials and labor. They sent a letter to the Daotai (local official), requesting that one-third of the bridge cost be subsidized. Following precedent, the Circuit Intendant Shen ordered the Sub-Prefect Chen Sima of the Mixed Court to convene with the Western Consul-General, who appointed Interpreter Yan to accompany Su Pai of the Public Works Department to inspect the site. The bridge is located near the mouth of the Yangjing Creek, with heavy traffic. The bridge deck is decayed, and during summer and autumn, it has been blocked for carts and horses, allowing only pedestrian traffic. The current repairs require replacing the bridge pillars, essentially rebuilding it. The original bridge pillars were six inches square, but now they will be twelve inches square, with twelve feet embedded in the soil and six feet above water. The bridge deck will be forty-eight feet long and twenty-two feet wide, making the project larger and more difficult than before. The estimated cost is unlikely to be reduced. The survey has been completed, and craftsmen will be hired soon. As the summer saying goes, "Girders are completed in the tenth month," which is the right time.

### The Awakening of Dancing Girls - Dance Industry Women's Association

— Si

Yesterday, the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Natives Association. Mr. Yuan Ludeng was appointed as the Chairman of the Board. On Sunday, "Tears of a Dancing Girl" will be performed at the Carlton Theater, with ticket sales used to fund the association.

For so many years, those dancing girls who were seen as soulless and treated as toys have been allowing boundless pain to strip away their lives in the dark abyss.

However, pain is a kind of strength! Over these years, they have suffered from deception, oppression, humiliation, and trampling, causing a determination to resist to grow in their hearts. But this is not revenge, but their self-help after awakening.

"Liberate yourselves from suffering! Enjoy the freedom of being human like everyone else, and fulfill the obligations of being human!" They are crying out as they stand up in a difficult environment.

They understand the power of organization:

Their organization did not start today. In secret, several forward-thinking dancing girls have been promoting and enlightening their sisters who live in tears for one or two years.

With the help of people of social justice and their own efforts, the "Dance Industry Women's Association" was finally officially established yesterday.

In order to make this group a group of every dancing girl themselves, and to make every backward dancing girl participate, the organization of this group will not be as boring as other groups at the beginning. Although they will have literacy classes, the main thing is to use interesting, lively and proper entertainment (such as singing classes, table tennis teams, etc.) to attract them to participate. The purpose is to attract them from a decadent life to a normal life.

After they have developed the habit of collective living, they will be given some simple and vivid education that matches their lives, such as organizing reading and research societies, knowledge lectures, drama research, and so on.

In addition, there are volunteer legal advisers. When a member is really deceived, the association will send a lawyer to court to defend her. Of course, if it is extortion, the association will not only not send a lawyer, but also have the opportunity to advise her. There are also medical consultants who also volunteer to serve poor and sick dancing girls. In the plan, they also want to have a consumer cooperative and production technology training in the association.

The inaugural meeting of the "Dance Association" was held at the Ningbo Natives Association at 2 pm yesterday. Although the weather was so hot, more than 100 dancing girls from various dance halls participated. Among the sponsors were Yuan Ludeng, Chen Heqin, Chen Xianmo, Li Wenjie, Zhu Libo, Jiang Yixiao and other than a dozen people.

At the beginning of the meeting, the four members of the presidium (Wang Qinzhen, Ni Wenxian, Wei Chuyun, Yin Meifeng) reported separately, and their words were very painful.

At the meeting, twenty-one directors were elected: Wang Qinzhen, Yin Meifeng, Ni Wenxian, Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, Yang Wenxian, Zhou Huaying, Wu Ying, Jiang Yunlan, Zhang Lili, Hou Luomei, Fang Lili, Jin Didi, Chen Luying, Zhou Juju, Xu Huizhen, Shen Aizhen, Lin Yan, Yang Meijuan, Xiao Meifen, Jin Lili.

Honorary directors are social celebrities and women's leaders, and the chairman of the board is Yuan Ludeng.

If there are no accidents, after the performance of "Tears of a Dancing Girl" (directed by Xi Jianong) and "Shanghai Dancing Girl" (directed by Wu Cun) at the Carlton Theater this Sunday morning, their association's funds will be settled, and their association affairs will be launched immediately!

### Peddlers of Summer Medicines

— Zhang Zheng

Pedestrians - Please Be Wary of Low-Quality Medicines Handed Out

In Shanghai, the most active and vigorous things are in summer. Now it is summer, and all commodities that are different from other three seasons will naturally appear successively with the advent of the hot air temperature. Because of the changes in celestial phenomena and the hot climate, summer is also a season with many diseases; therefore, so-called "Dan," "Sha Medicine Water," and "Plague Prevention Pills" have become the most popular medicines. From the standpoint of medicine, these things are originally used to treat diseases, and there is nothing to argue about; however, in Shanghai, it is a bit different. They are also used by ordinary people to sell on the crowded roads in a way of peddling for fraudulent purposes.

As long as we walk on a few busy streets, we will encounter these people. They wear long Western-style trousers, snow-white shirts, and hold many "Dan," "Pills," and a large stack of printed materials, appearing like a sales merchant. Mixed in the crowd, they first send a printed material to people. If people who do not know the inside story naturally accept it, but once you accept the printed material, they will use their eloquence to exaggerate the efficacy of their medicine, how old the brand is, ... with full patience, they will nag you endlessly. At first, they exaggerate and promote; then they beg you to buy; or force you to buy; if you still just say no, they will seriously teach you: Chinese people should promote domestic products. If you still do not promise to buy, then they will unceremoniously question you: Do you love the country or not? The words are quite embarrassing. If you firmly refuse, they will helplessly say indignantly: "China is going to perish! These people don't put the country in their hearts at all." The implication is that buying this kind of Dan, pills, and Sha medicine water is not only fearless of diseases, but also very down-to-earth patriots. This kind of statement, although too tyrannical, people with a little dignity will not bother to argue with them; the timid, seeing them turn their heads and scold away, feel relieved, and dare not argue with them any more.

From this way of peddling, we can know the nature and function of their Dan, pills, and water. Let's try to spend a dime or two to buy a packet to see what it is like. Although it is printed with the words "domestic product" and a description of being able to cure all kinds of summer diseases, the packaging of the crude package shows that it is a poorly made inferior product. It is not necessary to wait for insiders to study it before you can know. At this time of summer, when summer diseases occur frequently, it is really necessary to buy this kind of medicine carefully! However, this is not just about saving a few dimes from general buyers, but if ordinary people rely on this medicine to treat diseases, especially the rapidly changing summer diseases, the impact of the delay is really unimaginable.

For them, as long as they have money to earn, they have achieved their goal, and the quality of the medicine is naturally not considered, because they are a generation of wanderers, without money and without work, and the material on which they depend for survival is taken from the crowd of pedestrians. They peddle things that are easy to arouse the interest of passers-by at any time according to the needs of the season, but it is not limited to summer medicines. However, summer medicines affect people—to expand on that, they also affect society, making people unable to remain silent and making it necessary to expose them.

### Thoughts on "Why So Ill-Fated?"

— Li Zhihua

“Dark Victory”

"Self-sacrifice," shouldn't that be the highest sentiment among human beings? Yes, there should also be a condition reserved here, that is, this "sacrifice" must be for the happiness of mankind. The trick of harming others without benefiting oneself is only done by the ignorant to show off a momentary impulse, or else they are bastards who deliberately sabotage; but what about "self-sacrifice"? To dedicate oneself without wanting the benefit of the individual at all. Yes, this is the supreme virtue of mankind, but if it harms oneself and still does not benefit others, then this cannot be considered a great courage. People should live or die for the happiness of mankind, because each person is a part of mankind. Confucius blamed the wise, if only for "sacrifice," then objectively, it just so happens that it is what pains one's loved ones and pleases one's enemies, and invisibly increases the strength of the other party. The debate between "Mount Tai" and "Goose Feather" has entangled "experts" in endless arguments. I, the "audience," had a sudden feeling after watching "Why So Ill-Fated," and wrote it down to present it to the "experts" who call themselves "experts." To avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, I should solemnly declare that this is just a "post-viewing feeling" of an "audience," and I dare not consider myself among the ranks of experts, let alone pretend to be an expert and enjoy myself.

It seems that I am writing "outside" again, now I will pull it back.

After watching "Why So Ill-Fated," what moves people is precisely this spirit of self-sacrifice that makes others (of course, not enemies) happy. After Judy knew that the end of her physical life had come, if it were for herself, she could very well let her beloved husband stay by her side and then die peacefully, but she did not. She "feared that Smith (her husband, Dr. Steele) would find out and stop her from going, so she forced herself to smile and strictly forbade Anne (her best friend) from speaking... After Smith left, she went into the room and lay sadly on the bed, and from then on, her fragrant soul vanished." There are still some diseases in medicine that have no way to cure, which is one of the great enemies of mankind, and also one of the regrets, and the doctor's keeping secrets has become "justifiable lying." Judy went from being lost to discovering the secret, and from living a licentious life to really enjoying the joy of life, to calmly and covertly lying in bed, waiting for her last moment. This is a tortuous journey, extremely brilliant, returning to ordinary, and countless audiences are moved, sighed, and even suddenly enlightened by such a tragic story. Bao Yu's memorial essay for Qing Wen in "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Under the scarlet gauze window, I have no fate, in the yellow earth mound, why are you so ill-fated" is only enough to write about its misery, but not enough to awaken its theme.

Bette Davis, who plays Judy, is an actress who can act. The play is extremely heavy from beginning to end, and the emotional changes are even more complex, but in her performance, they are all conveyed, regretfully, the director is not strong enough, although careful and meticulous (such as the car and the servant opening the door outside the focus of the scene when Anne visits Smith), but the lack of courage and clarity results in each scene becoming weak, flat, and without atmosphere, therefore, the power of emotion is greatly reduced and weakened. "For any work, skill is secondary, and 'consciousness' is the most important thing," but if there is no skill, then "consciousness" cannot be conveyed, and it is also in vain. This is not necessary for "experts," just like me, a "viewer" with little reading, also knows a little about this monism. As for the high opinions of the "experts," that is what I, the "audience," dare not guess.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 12: Red Makeup Avenges Hatred, Difficult to Eliminate Sins; Green Window Talks of Love, Remaking a Good Match

When Zhao Letian heard that, he also sighed and said: "Yes! At first, I was also puzzled after I received that letter from you. Because I wanted to know why you changed so quickly, a woman's heart is really unpredictable. I also thought that you were influenced by your family, as the saying goes, 'Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black,' so you are hopeless. I was so angry at that time that I wrote a very long letter to you, and naturally this letter scolded you. I thought you might scold me back, which would also be very good. Who knew that you didn't reply a word, perhaps you thought that people like me were not worth replying to?" Pan Peiying wept and said: "Brother! Your words are more painful than stabbing me with a knife. Your last two letters were only discovered after my father was killed and I was sorting out his old documents. I think you also know about my father's assassination. He brought it upon himself, and also implicated his children to clear his name. After my father died, I have been hiding in remote areas, not daring to show my face and stand in front of people. Even if people are kind and do not criticize me, I feel like people are always pointing and talking in front of me, saying: 'This is the daughter of a traitor.' Imagine what time this hidden pain will be able to disappear! I have not dared to live in my hometown recently, because there are many acquaintances in my hometown. I am working as a teacher in a small school somewhere, and I don't dare to use my real name, I only use a fake name, so people don't know my details. This time, I came back to my hometown and accidentally went to Huishan for a walk. Things also happened to coincide, I happened to meet Yuan Shuwen, she asked me about you, she thought we were together. Only then did I know your whereabouts. The reason why I came to see you today is to explain the previous things clearly. If you hate me for not understanding me, I can't help you from hating me, I can't help you from understanding me." As Pan Peiying said this, she tried her best to prevent her tears from flowing out, but unfortunately, the tears did not listen to her inner commands and had to gush out of her eyes. A woman's tears have so much power over men! Pan Peiying's drops of tears hit Zhao Letian's heart, more fierce than the machine gun bullets when he was a machine gunner. What's more, they were originally old lovers who were in love with each other? However, Zhao Letian thought that Pan Peiying was probably married now, and the old love could be brushed off. Pan Peiying also thought that Zhao Letian must have married and had children, and established a family. Her coming here was only to express her heart, and after her heart was expressed, everything would be over. I will still be my elementary school teacher, and he will still handle his rice and grain regulation affairs. It is really the East and West Swallows, each flying away. (143)

The Arts

### Prelude to Skin and Yellow Charity Sale

— Xitong

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Tongxiang Group will hold a Skin and Yellow charity sale at the Golden Grand Theater on the 26th and 27th of this month for four sessions day and night, which has been reported in this newspaper. This disaster relief campaign really started at the gathering of the Dafa Food Company invited by Zhang Xiaocang and others, which was at 7 pm on May 12. I also participated in the event. That night, all the heroes came to the meeting together, which must be recorded. When I went upstairs, I first looked for

Zhang Xiaocang. His "Ju Bu Cong Tan" (?) was published by the Dadong Bookstore more than ten years ago, and he can be said to be a pioneer in the opera review world. With a Changzhou accent, his stature and expression remind people of Cao Juren. Looking back, I saw the shaven-headed and beaming Luohan

Fan Songfeng. He is a famous Kunqu opera artist who has sung the "Chang Sheng Dian" Jingbian several times on stage. I quickly shook hands with him. Next to him, I found the famous young actor of the Xianni Society

Zhou Chuan Ying. He is elegant and completely typical of Suzhou people. Mr. Fan then introduced me to

Xu Heizhen. I quickly praised him for being able to play the cold play "Nine Pieces of Clothing" at the Hu She, his hair is already gray, but his spirit is very good; he talked excitedly about his wit in performing "Yu Bei Ting" and "Qun Ying Hui," and now I want to make it difficult for him, but in the end, he makes it difficult for me. He spoke vividly, full of interest. If it hadn't been for him that night, the table would have been lonely. Then came the "Qin Piao"

Su Shengqing. He used to teach Ping Opera at Jinan University. Because of the separation, I couldn't ask for advice. With him was his female disciple

Chuan Yunling. Soon after, the busy president of the Ju She came

Liu Juchan. The first volume of opera books and opera exams published by him in Taidong were attached with body movements or Gongchi. The later "Complete Collection of Si Lang Tan Mu" was even more complete. I have been at the same table with him twice, but because he came and went in a hurry, I regretted not being able to talk to him. Our table also came to the famous

Wei Xinlv. Tian Han once praised her highly. She is good at Laosheng, and she is natural and unrestrained, and speaks without restraint. She knew that I was from Sichuan, and told me the funny story of a former police chief in Sichuan: The chief loves to play tickets. When he performs, he orders the police to stand on both sides of the audience. If anyone shouts "Dao Hao," the police will stare at him and say, "You can sing, you go up and sing and see." The chief heard this, so he went to shave his beard and performed, saying in a Sichuan accent, "I sing opera just for fun," so he hung up his beard and sang again. With her was a famous female student from a national university.

Xiao Ming. In Beijing, she studied Huashan from Zhang Cailin and Yu Yuqin, and was good at Deyilu Thirteen Sisters, etc. After coming to Shanghai, she got the guidance of Hongdouguan Zhuren, and she was also very good at Kunqu Opera. Hongdouguan Zhuren once performed with her in Li Qi in Fan Ma Ji. I have seen her perform "Xie Zhuang" (Miao Fu Tanghui,) and her singing and acting are excellent, especially commendable is the body movement when she sings "When my father can't stand the five-torture torture, squatting down and embracing his arms with both hands." The latest to come was

Gu Zhicheng. He will perform Fan Ma Ji with Xiao Ming. He was originally at the next table, but later ran over to see me. I pulled him down and said, "You come to fight guerrillas." He nodded and smiled, sat for a while, and went to another table to fight guerrillas. Later, everyone discussed the opera code. Several people at the same table with me decided to perform

Ou Shounan's "Bang Da Bo Qing Lang," he is silent, gentle, and suitable for performing ugly roles. Also

Zeng Xinqi's "Kongcheng Ji." His shrewd and capable appearance, high and pointed nose, and bright eyes all made me misunderstand that he was from Guangdong. After inquiring, he turned out to be an old Jiangxi man. The one who performed with him was probably Fatty (my comrade)

Jin Shaogang. Naturally, he played Sima Yi. Wei Xinlv probably played (Li Ling Bei). Also

Zhu Boping played the Sheng corner of (Fa Men Si). Such a grand event is really rare! I hope all the great philanthropists will donate generously and come to the Golden Husband to watch the opera. I will take this short article as an invitation.

### A Record of the Tan Pai Beardsheng Yan Jupeng

— Haitangxuan Lord

Tan Pai beardsheng Yan Jupeng, hired by the Golden Grand Theater, will come to Shanghai soon, the news has been reported in this newspaper. In today's era when Tan Pai talents are scarce, Jupeng is still a pride of the Tan Pai. He has indeed put a lot of effort into the art of Lao Tan, and his pronunciation is especially unique, which is recognized by insiders and outsiders. According to the background of Jupeng's fame and learning art, he has benefited a lot from Tong Wu. In the second year of the Republic of China, Jupeng worked in the Mongolian and Tibetan Institute. At that time, with the nature of playing tickets, he kowtowed to Tong Wu and asked Meng the first opera was Zhan Puguang. Jupeng played Liu Zhong. At that time, he was obsessed with Tan Opera. Whenever Lao Tan had a play, he would go to watch it no matter the wind or rain. However, because Jupeng's income was limited, the money for listening to the opera was paid by his friend Zhong Yuesen. The two listened to the opera, one memorized the lyrics, and the other memorized the body movements. Whenever there was a gain or a thorough understanding, they would ask Tong Wu for advice. Tong had a wide range of friends, such as Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, and Wang Yaoqing, who all entered and exited his door, so he could ask Qian and others to teach instead; Jupeng benefited a lot from the guidance of these three people. At that time, he also joined the Yan Le She amateur club. Tong Wu thought that Jupeng's voice was very good, and he should sing Gong, so he ordered to string Hong Yang Dong Peng Bei Er Jin Gong Tan Mu several operas. In the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, Chen Yanheng was in Ping, and the two became close friends as soon as they met. Jupeng's Tan accent was further detailed by Chen, and his art was greatly improved. At that time, Cheng Yanqiu was very popular, and he performed in Shanghai. Mei Lanfang was also in Shanghai, and the two sides confronted each other strongly. Mei urgently needed to find an old Laosheng to support him, but it was difficult to find someone. Chen introduced Jupeng to cooperate with Mei, and Yanheng played the piano, which was the best of red flowers and green leaves; as a result, he became popular with one singing. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Jupeng went to sea as an amateur, and went to Jinan, Bengbu, Shenyang, and other places to sing Tanghui many times, avoiding double earnings. Later, he suddenly broke up with Yanheng and did speculation business, bought a large amount of public bonds, and indulged in pleasure. In addition, there were unsatisfactory things in his family, which caused his voice to become hoarse for a while. Fortunately, it gradually recovered soon. Yan's Tan Mu Ma Cao and Ding Junshan's operas do have unique aspects, which are beyond the reach of the current actors. This time he came to Shanghai to meet the ladies in Shanghai, and his satisfactory results can be predicted.

### Theater World Anecdotes

— Xu Muyun

The Fall of Woyun Jushi and the Rise of Li Duokui

One year, when he returned to Beiping, he occasionally performed in "Hua You Shan" (because Du Fen was also a *lao dan*). The temporary accompanist was Master Wu, who had been playing for Lao Kui for many years. Duokui had real potential. After the performance, he advised him, "Your build and eyes are too small. You are really not suitable for the Wang school of *sheng* roles. There is a severe shortage of talent in the *lao dan* field. Once Lao Kui dies, it will be lost. Woyun Jushi has become unbearably arrogant recently. I used to teach him many good tunes, and he treated me with respect as a teacher, insisting that I accompany him every time he performed. In recent years, he has suddenly become arrogant, looking down on everyone. He keeps saying that Lao Kui taught him so many plays, but how could Lao Kui have the time to teach people? Wasn't he just picking up the empty name of a teacher? In reality, it was all me who taught him. Now that he is famous, he doesn't even respect me. I am really angry and want to find someone with the potential (i.e., voice) to whom I can pass on all of Lao Kui's good tunes and his signature plays, so that I can vent my anger. My conditions are not too harsh. The most important thing is that the person I teach must always treat me with respect as a teacher. No matter how famous he becomes in the future, I must always be his accompanist, and he must not dismiss me and replace me with someone else." Duokui thought that Mr. Lu's words made a lot of sense, and besides, his conditions were not only not harsh, but also very beneficial to himself. To be honest, who in Beiping could compare to Lao Lu in playing the *huqin* for *lao dan*? Furthermore, *lao dan* is a specialized field. No matter how well other accompanists play, they may not be able to bring out the style of *lao dan*. Not only would he not dismiss him to find someone else in the future, but even if he wanted to leave and help someone else, he himself would not agree. Moreover, Lao Lu makes a living with his skills. If he teaches me the plays, it is only right that I support him in his old age, especially since he supports himself with his *qin*. After both parties agreed, Duokui wholeheartedly devoted himself to learning *lao dan*. Shortly thereafter, his sister, Liang Huating, took over the Zhonghe Theater and signed a long-term performance contract with Yanqiu. Duokui took this opportunity to join Yanqiu's troupe. (44)

### Obstacles During Filming

— Mu

The losses suffered from sabotage by bad things during filming are significant. They may be minor things that don't interfere in other quiet settings. However, they are always cursed by many film directors—especially Howard Hawks, who recently produced "Only Angels Have Wings" (starring Grant, Carrel, Hayworth) for Columbia Pictures, and found it extremely difficult. He lists these troublemakers as follows:

(1) Song Flies: They can attach themselves to microphones without being noticed until the film and soundtrack are produced and printed. If the film is not discovered before being sent to the screening room, it has to be reshot.

(2) Airplanes: An airplane constantly flying over the filming location will interfere with the work below, wasting a lot of valuable time.

(3) Sneezes: If someone sneezes near the recording equipment, it will ruin the film and have to be reshot.

(4) Bird Chatter: Birds often nest in the rafters of the broadcasting booth. So the producer has to stop and have some employees climb up and drive them away.

(5) Stray Cats: Homeless cats will make the broadcasting booth their home, and their constant meowing during filming will render the work useless.

(6) Shoe Noise: Some insensitive people walk noisily, and these sounds will end up on the film's audio track.

(7) Visitors: Visitors to general film studios often don't understand the golden rule of maintaining silence near the recording equipment, and always whisper during filming, which causes great distress to the actors. (To be continued) (Reward)

### A Grand Performance by the Fongs’ Society

— Ruo

The Fongs’ Society is organized by colleagues from the Fufeng Flour Mill in Shanghai. Although its establishment history is short, its achievements are already amazing. This time, during the Dragon Boat Festival, they held a rehearsal at the Ningbo Fellow Association, which was their first time. The society's rehearsal abolished the troupe system. The first performance that day was the "Jumping Official" by Chairman Ma (Luchu). Mr. Ma is the famous amateur Ma Zhishan, and he has a strong artistic interest and is also amiable and approachable. When Mr. Ma performed the "Jumping Official," the applause from the audience was thunderous, which shows his enthusiasm for association affairs and his popularity. The second performance was "Wan Hua Ting" by Mr. Cao Maoru, playing Yao Qi, with a loud voice, similar to Shao Shan. However, due to the heat and nervousness, he occasionally missed some lines. The "Qi Jie" by Xu Zhaogan and Lu Xizu, the female role singing was accurate, the Beijing dialect was fluent, and each had their own strengths. Others, such as Yu Xucun's "Qiong Lin Yan" and He Qin'an's "Kai Shan Fu," had no good performances. Shen Yongliang's "Kong Cheng Ji" had a very good stage presence. Sun Yixiang's Sima Yi, the two page boys were played by Ma Luchu and Cheng Peifu respectively. Both of them are nearsighted, wearing black-rimmed glasses, standing beside Kongming, which was quite amusing, while the old soldier and the scouts were also played by colleagues. "Gan San Guan" was performed by the famous amateur Rong Ruilin, playing Xue Pinggui, with a graceful and luxurious demeanor. Several *yuan ban* arias were sung smoothly and pleasingly. The Princess Daizhan was played by the famous actress Liu Huiqin, whose gestures and demeanor showed her cultivation. Cao Si's *huqin* accompaniment was seamless and moving. "Si Lang Tan Mu" was the last play of the day. Wang Xiaoshui and Qi Da'an played the Fourth Son separately, Wang first and Qi after. Wang excelled in singing and recitation, while Qi excelled in acting. When he was captured, he did a full "Diao Mao," which won a full house of applause. Miss Yu Yiyun's Princess completely imitated the Mei school in the slow tempo, and sang very steadily. The other pairings were also well-organized. The performance ended at seven o'clock. I write this in a sweat to record this event.
