Moscow. Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop conducted negotiations on the conclusion of the German-Soviet friendship and demarcation treaty on September 27th and 28th. Stalin and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Merekalov participated on the Soviet side, and German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg participated on the German side. As a result, both sides signed the German-Soviet friendship and demarcation treaty. In addition, the two governments jointly issued a declaration. Molotov and Ribbentrop also exchanged letters on economic issues. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

Moscow. The governments of the Soviet Union and Germany issued a declaration today stating, "After the governments of the Soviet Union and Germany signed a treaty today, they have thoroughly resolved the issues arising from the collapse of Poland, thereby establishing a firm foundation for lasting peace in Eastern Europe. The two governments therefore agree to express the opinion that resolving the current war between Germany and Britain and France is in the interests of all countries. Therefore, the two governments will work together in the future, and if necessary, cooperate with other friendly countries to find ways to achieve the above objectives in the shortest possible time. If this effort by the two governments still proves ineffective, this will prove that Britain and France should bear the responsibility for the continuation of the war, and if the war continues, the Soviet and German governments will consult each other on the necessary steps." The Soviet government authorized Molotov and the German government authorized Ribbentrop to sign. (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

Moscow. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop boarded a plane at 12:40 noon today and returned to his country. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

London. According to reliable sources here today, the British government will definitely reject the joint peace proposal of the Soviet Union and Germany, and will reiterate its intention to continue the war until the war's objectives are achieved and Hitlerism collapses. (Associated Press dispatch on the 29th)

London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that although there has been no reaction from officials to the new German-Soviet demarcation agreement, well-informed sources have stated their views as follows: Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a recent speech that the actions of the Soviet Union do not affect the determination of Britain and France to fight until their goals are achieved. Although the German-Soviet agreement takes into account the continuation of the war, it only stipulates consultation between Germany and the Soviet Union, in other words, Germany must continue to make concessions in exchange for Soviet military assistance. The British government will immediately consult with France on the attitude to be adopted towards the German-Soviet agreement. As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Estonia, it is just another sign of Stalin emulating Hitler's tactics. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)

London. Regarding the recent developments in Moscow, although officials here have not made any formal statements, well-informed sources have said that Britain's only answer to Germany's peace offensive is "no." The war objectives of all democratic countries were thoroughly outlined by Prime Minister Chamberlain on the 17th of this month to eradicate the system of violence in Europe. Based on this, although Germany has achieved success in Poland in collusion with the Soviet Union, the issue for which Britain and France are fighting has not been eliminated. On the contrary, the goals of Britain and France have become even clearer, and there is no doubt that they will fight to the end to achieve final victory. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

London. According to sources here, Britain and France are consulting with each other today on the German-Soviet peace proposal, and the British Cabinet is also holding a meeting to discuss it. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)

Vatican City. The Holy See denied today the German claim that the Holy See is currently cooperating with Britain and France in a peace movement. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)

### Soviet Union Tells Britain It Will Remain Neutral and Is Willing to Conduct Business Negotiations

London. Soviet sources here recently announced that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss various business issues with Britain. Ambassador Maisky is now awaiting proposals from the British government and hopes that Britain will treat the Soviet Union with a "friendly" attitude. British political figures commented that the Soviet Union's intention is probably that the British government should send a business delegation, led by a senior official such as Commerce Minister Stanley, to Moscow for negotiations. This matter is currently under consideration by the government. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)

London. Well-informed sources here recently confirmed that Soviet Ambassador Maisky, in a recent meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax, explained two points: (1) The Soviet Union will continue to adhere to the policy of neutrality that it should maintain in the current war. (2) The Soviet government is prepared to conduct business negotiations with Britain. It is generally believed that whether this position will be proven by facts remains to be seen. As for the important developments in Moscow yesterday, there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Ambassador Maisky's statement at this time. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)

London. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union's policy in the Western European war is a "firm neutral policy," which can also be described as an "armed neutral policy." At the same time, it is actively establishing hegemony in the Balkans and the Black Sea, and excluding the influence of Britain, France, and Germany along the Baltic coast, forcing Germany to devote all its efforts to dealing with the situation in Western Europe. If this policy fails, it may adopt a tougher attitude. In short, Soviet foreign policy has five goals: (1) To limit Turkey's power in the Balkans, maintain its neutrality, and defend the Black Sea on behalf of the Soviet Union, while at the same time restraining it from actively assisting Britain and France against Germany, thereby undermining the balance of power in the Balkans. As for the Mediterranean, the Soviet Union has no vested interests, so the clauses of the agreement signed between Turkey and Britain and France regarding the Mediterranean can still be respected by Turkey. In other words, Turkey's actions in the Mediterranean are not subject to any restrictions, but military action should be avoided in the Dardanelles Strait, which is the gateway to the Black Sea. (2) Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia should form a neutral bloc under the joint influence of the Soviet Union and Turkey. Dobruja, Romania, which belonged to Bulgaria before the First World War, should be returned to its original owner. If Romania can accept Soviet control, the issue of Bessarabia Province (which belonged to Russia before the First World War) can be postponed. (3) Germany can obtain economic concessions in the Balkans, but on the condition that they do not constitute a monopoly. (4) A Polish buffer state may be established between Germany and the Soviet Union, but on the condition that Germany accepts the above points. (5) Estonia along the Baltic coast should be included in the Soviet sphere of influence, and Latvia may also be included. As for Lithuania, it can be included in the German sphere of influence. After the realization of these five points, Germany's area for expanding its influence into Eastern and Southeastern Europe will be reduced by itself, but it can devote all its efforts to dealing with the war in Western Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that Germany will definitely accept it. Otherwise, the Soviet Union may have to adopt a tougher attitude. Diplomatic circles here commented that Germany originally wanted to conquer Eastern Europe when it started this war, but due to the threat from the Soviet Union, it had to abandon its original plan. As for Turkey's influence in the Balkans in the future, it will also be reduced, while the influence of other countries in the Balkans will be completely eliminated, and they will have to allow the Soviet Union to establish hegemony. As for Italy's attitude, it is still uncertain, but because the Soviet Union's influence in the Balkans is increasing day by day, it is unlikely to sit idly by and do nothing. Even Germany, whose non-war goal was to develop economic influence in Southeastern Europe, may not be willing to obey the Soviet Union. In addition, British diplomatic circles also used the possibility of Germany adopting a "peace offensive" as a topic of discussion, and all said that if this were to materialize, it would definitely be rejected by Britain and France. The current question lies in whether the Soviet Union will support Germany's offensive. Regarding this point, Soviet sources in London said that although the Soviet Union may support the peace offensive, if Britain and France reject it, the Soviet Union does not intend to assist Germany. In short, the Soviet Union will still strictly adhere to neutrality towards Britain and France, but on the condition that those countries do not exert pressure on the countries of Southeastern Europe. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky informed British Foreign Secretary Halifax of this intention yesterday. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)

Paris. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed various agreements, observers here commented that the policies pursued by those countries can be summarized in four words: "Bluff, Blockade, Baltic, Balkans." (That is, the four words Bluff, Blockade, Baltic, Balkans, also known as the four B policy) As for the various issues caused by these four words, the first three words are included, at least in Moscow. The "peaceful adieu" that Dehe was supposed to propose to Britain and France should be backed by the threat of a military alliance treaty signed with the Soviet Union, but the joint declaration of the various countries did not mention the word alliance treaty, only that if the peace offensive fails, the governments of the various countries should "consult each other." On the contrary, the economic agreement signed between Germany and the Soviet Union is very practical in content. Some of the resources that Germany cannot obtain due to the blockade imposed by Britain and France can be supplied by the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union can only supply "a part." People were originally very worried about Germany's attempt to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. When they examined the various agreements signed by those countries yesterday, and the non-aggression treaty signed on the 23rd of last month, they knew what Germany gave when bargaining with the Soviet Union. But how much the Soviet Union paid is unknown and remains to be proven by facts. This is the same as the situation when Germany previously signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. What is noteworthy is that Germany has abandoned the proposal to establish a buffer state in Poland, and it has no say in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Estonia. Now that Estonia has signed a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, it has virtually become a protectorate of the Soviet Union, and has lost its autonomy in military and political terms. Even its foreign trade will be monopolized by the Soviet Union. Regarding this, well-informed sources here said that when Soviet troops entered Poland, the Estonian government approached Germany and asked it to provide protection when the Soviet Union added pressure. The German government immediately replied that the Soviet Union had no ambitions towards the countries along the Baltic coast. Based on this, Germany has obviously been forced to abandon its position in that area. As for the Balkan issue, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu has been active in Moscow to ensure that Germany and the Soviet Union do not resolve it on their own before Turkey participates, but the Balkans are ultimately a source of supplies for Germany, and when the Soviet Union and Turkey conduct negotiations in the future, they will definitely pay attention to this.

Editorial

### The Soviet Union in the Current Phase of the European War

The European war began with the start of the German-Polish conflict, and it has now been a full month. In this month, the situation has shifted and evolved quite complexly; but the one who has manipulated and consistently influenced the situation is none other than the Soviet Union. The past is irrelevant; as of today, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has once again visited the Soviet Union for negotiations, and the London side is eagerly seeking to follow suit, even sending a high-ranking official, possibly the respected and aged Lloyd George, to use his influence and prestige to make up for the "second-tier role" sent to the Soviet Union for inquiries a month ago. The demarcation of Poland has just been completed, and a dark cloud has suddenly risen in a corner of the Baltic Sea, making the situation in Eastern Europe uncertain; and then, just yesterday, the mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Estonia was suddenly completed, and the Baltic Sea area immediately became calm, and the impact will make half of Eastern Europe peaceful. Therefore, Moscow is indeed the center of gravity of the current situation. Comparing it to history, traveling scholars hurry to it, and envoys of states are constantly en route, so Xianyang and Linzi can be used to describe its prosperity. Yet, although envoys from various countries flock to Moscow, rushing for fear of being late, we have never heard of the Soviet Union sending envoys to other countries to plot anything: therefore, the difference in status between host and guest, and the importance of each, is evident. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Soviet Union holds the key to the situation today.

To say that the development of the European war has reached the current stage and is not far from its end is undoubtedly premature; but to say that it is just beginning and will inevitably develop into a long-term war is also nothing more than a possible assumption. Germany's strength lies in its military force, while its undeniable weakness is its economic poverty, so it benefits from a quick and decisive victory; the military strength of Britain and France is not inferior to Germany, and their economic situation is more than adequate, so they might as well engage in a prolonged campaign. Although Germany wants a quick victory, and Britain and France do not want it, the fact is that it cannot but be prolonged: but if Germany wants to cover up its weaknesses and struggle in the midst of inevitable prolongation, it must make preparations in the economic field. The Soviet Union, with its abundant resources and surplus power to help others, is naturally an object of Germany's aspiration. Moreover, Romania, since the Soviet Union deployed troops on the Polish border, has been encompassed by Soviet influence; and this country is rich in agricultural products and has continuous oil fields, which are also what Germany aspires to. Therefore, Germany's future lies only in courting the Soviet Union to help it; if a military alliance cannot be achieved, then economic support would be enough to satisfy its great desire. The wishes of Britain and France are the opposite of Germany's. Whatever Germany hopes to succeed, Britain and France will do their best to dissolve it. Therefore, the only way to remove the firewood from under the cauldron is to follow the same path and make friends with the Soviet Union before Germany's wooing of the Soviet Union has matured. In short, today's situation of horizontal and vertical alliances is nothing more than a brewing of a new future European situation, and what the outcome of the brewing will be, the Soviet Union can truly control it.

The Soviet Union's ability to influence the current and future European situation is due to its environment, but also due to the fact that it has been conserving its strength and replenishing its energy for more than a decade, which is by no means accidental, but it must not be complacent about it. Because only when it has the power to make a decisive move, it must exercise caution in this one move, and if there is any mistake, the impact will be great. In the past month or so, the Soviet Union has indeed repeatedly made surprising moves, but its adherence to its own position has been consistent. Its treaty with Germany stops at non-aggression; its agreement with Japan on Nomonhan only allows for a temporary cessation of hostilities in the area; and its recent pact with Estonia is for mutual assistance. Because of the difference in targets, it changes the way it uses diplomacy. This is not just what the world calls flexibility, but only in this way can it act autonomously and maintain its own position without being influenced by the environment. Therefore, its future actions will still be cautious and will still maintain its own position, and it will never disrupt its own steps because of complacency. However, what we hope from the Soviet Union is that it will use its current superior position to exert its active role and make the European situation, and even the world situation, clear.

The European war was initially thought by the world to be a war against aggression, but when Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, etc. were divided and conquered, no one heard Britain and France speak out for justice; and the collective security system strongly advocated by the Soviet Union was never sincerely cooperated with by Britain and France from the beginning, so it failed to materialize; when the Danzig issue became imminent, and Britain and France themselves were about to feel threatened, they had to rise up to help, but they still hesitated before the Siegfried Line for nearly a month, and Poland had in fact reached the point of collapse, while the Western Front had not yet played a role in containing it; therefore, it is impossible not to doubt that this war is like the imperialist war of conquest twenty-five years ago, but Britain and France have taken a defensive posture, so it has become an illusion of anti-aggression. A war between strong countries is a chaotic process, and the result, apart from reshaping a part of the map, has little meaning. When the war first started, the Soviet Union expressed its intention to stay out of it, but suddenly it sent troops and swallowed up most of Poland; not only did it not participate in the war of conquest, but it also claimed neutrality without anyone exposing its hypocrisy; not only did it share the spoils while sitting, but it also made both sides of the warring countries rush to please it; human civilization thus regressed by thirty years, but the Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity, seizing and plundering skillfully, and in an instant, achieved this achievement, which has already become a historical miracle, something that the Tsarist era dreamed of but could not obtain. What is commendable is that it bullied the weak, but at the same time restrained the strong; because Britain and France fought each other, and no matter what the outcome, they would no longer be able to dominate because of the Soviet Union's restraint. The world may take Poland as a lesson and suspect that the Soviet Union may use the same method to divide China with Japan (see yesterday's Moscow telegram); if so, it would not only bully the weak, but also help Japan's strength and dominance; the Soviet Union is certainly not so foolish, and China has all the excellent conditions for nation-building, how can it be compared with Poland, which surrendered the city and begged for mercy, allowing others to slaughter it!

### A Page of the Painful History of Poland's Resistance: Warsaw's Military and Civilians Negotiate Surrender; Germany Announces 100,000 Troops Disarmed; Great Fire Unabated, City Reduced to Rubble

Berlin: The German High Command announced today that more than 100,000 Warsaw defenders have been disarmed and will begin leaving Warsaw tonight. German troops are scheduled to enter Warsaw on October 2, according to a Reuters dispatch from the 29th.

The Hague: A correspondent from a newspaper stationed in Warsaw sent a deeply painful dispatch, recounting the surrender of the city's defenders. It stated, "When a delegation of Warsaw residents, carrying a white flag, met with the German commander, a Polish army colonel said with tears, 'Our commander has decided to surrender and has come to negotiate.' The German commander replied, 'It is gratifying that the war has come to an end. I hope that Warsaw has not suffered major damage after days of shelling.' The Polish officer also replied, 'Apart from the rubble, there is nothing else.' All of this is the tragic end of Poland. One point cannot be ignored: the Polish people fought bitterly with a strong enemy to defend freedom, and although defeated, they are honorable and should permanently enjoy the right to independence in history." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Paris: The Polish Embassy in Paris received a report from the senior Polish military authorities at 10:00 AM yesterday, stating that the fighting in Warsaw was still continuing. This was 24 hours after the German announcement that Warsaw had unconditionally surrendered. The Polish Embassy's announcement stated that the Warsaw defenders had requested a 24-hour ceasefire to discuss the surrender with the German commander outside the city. A Polish news agency dispatch from Warsaw stated that the Warsaw defenders were negotiating with the Germans on the terms of the surrender of Polish troops in Warsaw and Modlin. Negotiations are expected to be concluded today. The citizens of Warsaw are in favor of surrender, while the defenders want to continue resisting. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

London: Polish officials in London recently received a telegram from the commander of the Warsaw defenders, reporting on the defense of Warsaw on September 27. It stated that there was fierce fighting west of the Vistula River last night and this morning. German attacks from the southwest were repelled. Polish counterattacks resulted in some captures and the seizure of four tanks and three cannons. The Germans used a large number of incendiary bombs, and the great fire in Warsaw has been burning for several days, with the central area burning the most intensely. The water pipes have been destroyed, making it impossible to extinguish the fire. The streets are now in flames, and water is being transported by vehicles to supply the people. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Berlin: According to a correspondent from the Hutung News Agency traveling with the army, after the Polish troops in Warsaw expressed their unconditional surrender, the commander of the Polish troops in Warsaw sent a major officer with instructions, accompanied by a German colonel, a major, and eight soldiers, to the commander of the Modlin Fortress, ordering him to hand over the fortress to the German army. The fortress commander immediately agreed and promised to surrender at 6:00 PM yesterday. Unexpectedly, after 6:00 PM, the Polish troops did not hoist a white flag, so the German artillery bombarded it fiercely. Then, a Polish officer rushed to the German position and reiterated the unconditional surrender. (Hutung dispatch, 29th)

### Soviet-Hungarian Military Representatives Survey Border

Budapest, Hungary: A Soviet military delegation, together with a Hungarian delegation, surveyed the border between the new Soviet border (i.e., the southern border of Poland) and Hungary this morning. Traffic between the two sides has been restored. (Havas, 28th)

### French Troops Launch Localized Attacks on the East Bank of the Moselle River; German Tank Attacks Repelled; British and French Air Forces Active on the Front Lines

Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 49, stating, "Our troops launched a localized attack on the east bank of the Moselle River today, which was quite successful and resulted in many captures." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Paris: The French High Command announced last night that the German army launched an attack on the French positions southeast of Sarralbe this morning, with the aim of driving out the French artillery positions near the small mountains on the German side, which currently control Sarralbe and the Moselle River basin. As a result, the Germans suffered heavy losses. The Germans spent the entire night attacking the French forts outside the Siegfried Line through the small forests. The French army was on high alert. At dawn, German tanks rushed down from the small mountains, passing through Sarralbe to the highway west of the river. The weather was difficult to endure. The French army remained on the front lines all night. French machine gunners swept the German army, and French artillery fired on the German tanks. After an hour of fierce fighting, the German army was repelled. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

Luxembourg City: Continuous artillery fire has been heard here since 2:00 PM today, coming from the front lines of the French and German armies. Under the cover of artillery fire, the French army advanced towards the area of ​​Berch in the German Saar region, and shelled the town of Boug to the northeast, which was very successful. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Luxembourg: Since 2:00 PM today, the artillery battle on the Western Front has been very intense, and the artillery fire has not stopped. Although the close cooperation of the British and French air forces was only seen in the French war report today, the power of the British and French air forces has now begun to be felt by the enemy on the Western Front. Germany has lost many aircraft in the Polish war, and it is still necessary to leave some aircraft in Poland. The remaining aircraft have been flying non-stop for the past three weeks, and it will take a long time for a large-scale inspection. Apart from air force activities, the German army launched an attack in the territory west of Sarralbe yesterday. The general impression is that the German military authorities want to launch small attacks in rotation at various points along the entire line to test the movements of the French army. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Air Raid Alarm in Paris Yesterday Morning

Paris: An air raid alarm was issued in the city at 11:25 this morning. Immediately, policemen sat in cars and patrolled the streets, shouting with megaphones, "Do not stay on the streets, go to the air raid shelter!" All residents complied and remained calm. However, no enemy aircraft were seen in the city's sky. The alarm was lifted at 12:00. It is reported that only one German aircraft entered French airspace this time. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Soviet Influence Extends to the Baltic and Balkans; Moscow-Sofia Air Route to Be Established

Moscow: The post of Soviet Minister to Bulgaria has been vacant for two years. It is now reported that the Soviet government has appointed the Director of the Eastern European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Levendiev, as Minister to Bulgaria. The Director of the Bulgarian National Civil Aviation, Botev, has also arrived in Moscow at this time. Their purpose is to organize an air route from Moscow to Sofia via Romania. Foreign observers believe that this development is very important because the Soviet Union's influence in the Balkan countries will further expand. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Moscow: Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday separately received the Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, Andonov, and the Iranian Minister to the Soviet Union, Mavo Mei, and will continue to hold talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu within days. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Bucharest, Romania: Romania is deeply disturbed by the German-Soviet military operations in Poland and the negotiations currently underway in Moscow. However, it comforts itself with the belief that the Soviet Union's intention to prevent Germany from advancing eastward will preserve the neutrality of the country. The Romanian army is better equipped than it was a few years ago, and its commanders have improved after learning from the mistakes of others. A blackout is in effect in Bucharest. Reservists from the Romanian fleet have been called up. At the same time, the embassy in London has reportedly notified reservists of the naval air service to register with the embassy's military attaché. According to sources in the London market, Romanian pilots have recently flown 14 B-24 Liberator bombers back from Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Basel, Switzerland: The National Daily recently published a report from Berlin stating that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov plans to visit Germany in early October and intends to hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of Southeast European countries in Berlin to discuss the organization of a new Balkan group. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Basel, Switzerland: The Basel Evening News recently published a report stating that as a result of the mutual assistance agreement between Estonia and the Soviet Union, Estonia is about to lose its independent sovereignty. According to reliable sources, the Soviet government will send 25,000 troops to garrison the military bases along the Baltic Sea in Estonia and the islands of Osel and Dagö. The only concession made by the Soviet government is that the Soviet troops will not penetrate the interior of the country. From now on, the Soviet Union will have a superior strategic position in the Baltic Sea compared to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Washington: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after reviewing the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Chairman Pittman, passed it by a vote of 16 to 7. The Senate is scheduled to meet on October 2 to discuss it. According to informed sources, the discussion in the Foreign Relations Committee today was very intense. It was originally possible to postpone the vote until tomorrow, but it was successfully passed, which is a major victory for the government over the isolationists. Democratic Senators Keyes of Tennessee and Guffey, as well as Republican Senator White, originally opposed the provision in the amendment to repeal the arms embargo clause, but they voted in favor of it today, only stating that they reserved the right to express dissent when it is submitted to the Senate for discussion. Of the seven members who voted against it, five belonged to the Republican Party: Borah, Johnson, Capper, Vandenberg, and Clark. The other two were Progressive Senator La Follette and Farmer-Labor Senator Shipstead. In addition, the Foreign Relations Committee, as a result of today's discussion, amended two points in the original proposal: (1) If a debtor government fails to repay the principal and interest in full within ninety days after the due date after the United States provides credit loans to belligerent countries, it cannot obtain new loans. (2) US merchant ships and civil aircraft may still anchor or land in the ports and airfields of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the aircraft of Pan American Airlines flying the Pacific route can still use the airfields of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere. This amendment is of great importance to the future of US commerce with South America and the Far East. Pittman recently told the press that the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously agreed during today's discussion on allowing domestic merchant ships and aircraft to anchor or land in the territories of Britain and France in the Western Hemisphere, but on the condition that US merchant ships and aircraft do not transport goods to those territories. The focus of future debate will be the issue of repealing the arms embargo clause. Responsible sources said that the situation regarding the transfer of Pittman's proposal to the Senate for discussion is very good, which can be seen from the fact that the proposal received a majority of affirmative votes in the Foreign Relations Committee and that Senators Reynolds, Keyes, and White changed their attitudes. The reason why these senators changed their original intentions was due to the influence of public opinion in their constituencies. The media in the central states is extremely shocked by the fact that German National Socialism is extending its power to Western Europe and even to the Western Hemisphere, and its power is far above the arguments held by the isolationists. In other words, most Americans are not deeply impressed by legal arguments such as upholding international law, but they are very stimulated by the facts that German troops invaded Poland, German troops bombed civilians, and German submarines launched indiscriminate attacks.

Washington: During yesterday's Foreign Relations Committee meeting, the debate focused on the government's proposal regarding the impact on American merchant ships. The proposal aims to prohibit American ships from transporting goods to belligerent countries. A leading isolationist, Borah, claimed that the Foreign Relations Committee spent most of its time discussing the impact of the "cash and carry" method. Shipping companies approached the Foreign Relations Committee because the strict amendments to the bill would cause them huge losses. The Foreign Relations Committee then made technical amendments to the Neutrality Act amendment to suit the opinions of the American transport industry and passed it by a vote of 16 to 7. The voting results were announced by Senator Pepper at 1:20 PM. The bill sent to the Senate stipulates the abolition of the current embargo on weapons, ammunition, and implements of war, and replaces it with transfer and cash and carry clauses. According to the clauses, the United States may sell any items to belligerent countries, but ownership must be transferred in the United States, and they must be transported by ships of other countries. The main amendment to the bill by the Foreign Relations Committee is to exempt American transportation companies from a clause prohibiting American aviation from passing through the territories of belligerent countries in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific Ocean. This exemption is limited to air transport, and American merchant ships are not allowed to sail to the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

### Pan-American Conference Holds Closed-Door Meeting; Neutrality Issues and Economic Cooperation Are the Focus of This Conference

Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a closed-door meeting this morning. Representatives from Bolivia and Paraguay delivered speeches, reiterating their countries' policies of friendship and good neighborliness. Representatives from other countries responded with warm applause. Up to now, the conference has received about 30 proposals. It has been decided that the various subcommittees will review them separately this afternoon. The general impression is that the resolutions to be passed by this conference can be divided into three categories: (1) Resolutions on the declaration of neutrality, the content of which is nothing more than (A) delineating neutral zones around the American continent, (B) taking various measures to defend against submarine attacks, and (C) when the neutrality of one American country is violated, other American countries should consult each other to take joint action. (2) Resolutions on economic cooperation issues, the content of which should be to establish permanent institutions to adjust and promote the economic relations of American countries. (3) Resolutions on reiterating the rights of neutral countries, the content of which focuses on declaring that neutral countries may continue to export various goods that are not directly used for war to belligerent countries as usual. In addition, the conference will also decide to hold the next conference in Havana, Cuba, in 1940, and will urge all belligerent countries to pay attention to the humanization of war. As far as is generally known, the content of the aforementioned first resolution, namely the resolution on the declaration of neutrality, is mainly based on the proposal submitted by the representative of Uruguay, and also adopts two or three points in the proposal submitted by the representative of the United States, Welles, and the full text is about to be completed. In summary, there are two major issues discussed at this conference: one is the issue of trade between American countries and Europe, and the other is the issue of setting up neutral zones around the American continent. The representative of Brazil has also proposed that American countries conclude individual or multilateral agreements to determine the quality air routes between American countries. The representatives of the Central American countries did not make any suggestions, but only decided to support all the claims made by the US government. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Berne, Switzerland: It has come to light that German Führer Hitler, accompanied by Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, unexpectedly visited the northern German port of Wilhelmshaven to inspect the submarine fleet and expressed his appreciation for the activities of the submarines. (Havas, 28th)

London: The Ministry of Information has issued a statement saying, "German radio stations have repeatedly broadcast news that British warships were damaged by German aircraft in the North Sea. The British Admiralty reiterates that no British warships have been damaged by German aircraft, and there have been no casualties among the officers and men. The German side also claims that a British giant cruiser was hit by a German bomb in the Irish Sea off the Isle of Man, which probably refers to a German aircraft's attempt to bomb a British destroyer in that area. In fact, none of the British destroyers were hit at the time, and there were no reports of any British cruisers being attacked in the vicinity." (Havas, 28th)

Berlin: Last night, German radio hinted that the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" had been destroyed by German aircraft in the North Sea on Wednesday of this week. The radio station, due to the British Admiralty's persistent denial, questioned, "Where is the 'Ark Royal'? This is what the British people want to know." Furthermore, the German High Command announced that a squadron of German aircraft flew to the Firth of Forth yesterday morning to bomb the British fleet, resulting in a 550-pound bomb hitting the bow of a certain heavy cruiser. Therefore, this air raid was considered a "success." As for whether the German side suffered any losses, this was not mentioned. (United Press, 29th)

### Soviet Warships Penetrate Polish Territory; Soviet Ship Allegedly Attacked by Submarine in the Baltic Sea

### British Investigation of Wartime Finance; Reduction of Bank Discount Rate; Abandonment of Inflation

London: The British Financial Board's reduction of the bank rate to 3% yesterday is the first step in facilitating borrowing to meet national defense needs. The interest rate cut was announced simultaneously with the emergency budget, seemingly as a coordinated plan to achieve greater efficiency in wartime finance compared to the last Great War. In fact, the last Great War's finances relied entirely on inflation, and the government paid very high interest on war bonds because investors expected the purchasing power of currency to be low when debts were repaid, so they could not lend at low interest rates. However, this time the government seems to aim to abandon inflation and raise the cheapest possible loans to fund national defense. Now, all types of private fundraising are subject to direct control, so the traditional argument for raising interest rates to restrict civil borrowing no longer exists. Moreover, foreign exchange controls now protect the London financial market from external disturbances, so there is no need for bank interest rates to protect the pound. According to London sources, there is a possibility that the interest rate will continue to decrease to 2%. (Reuters, 29th)

### German Foreign Minister's Departure Statement

Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left Moscow by special plane at noon today to return to his country. Before departing, he made the following statement to the press: "I regret that I could not stay longer in Moscow. I hope to stay for several days when I visit again. However, I have made full use of the two days to complete four tasks: (1) The German-Soviet friendly relations have been firmly established; (2) Germany and the Soviet Union will not allow any third party to interfere in Eastern European issues from now on; (3) Germany and the Soviet Union hope to restore peace as soon as possible, and that England and France will stop their meaningless and uncertain war against Germany; (4) If those in England and France who advocate war still prevail, Germany and the Soviet Union will take countermeasures." Ribbentrop then announced the economic plan agreed upon by the German and Soviet governments yesterday, stating that this plan is very far-reaching and of great benefit to both Germany and the Soviet Union. Ribbentrop concluded his speech by saying that his visit to Moscow for negotiations was conducted in a very harmonious atmosphere, with both sides sincere in their attitude. He expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the Soviet government, especially Stalin and Molotov. (Haitong, 29th)

### German Prisoners Receive Excellent Treatment in England

London: Most of the German prisoners captured by Britain are housed in a five-story yarn factory in an industrial area in the north. Some of them are German submarine crew members. Most of them have changed into civilian clothes, but a few are still wearing naval trousers and military boots, looking quite distinctive, but slightly haggard. Their average age is 23. When they entered the reception center today, they met German prisoners who were already there. They never expected to meet here, so they had the feeling of meeting countrymen in a foreign land. According to the intelligence agency, the German prisoners are surprised by the excellent treatment they receive in England, as they had heard stories of British mistreatment of prisoners in their own country. It is said that when the first batch of German prisoners arrived, they intended to perform the Nazi salute to the staff in the center, but the staff quickly stopped them. (Reuters, 28th)

### Statement from the Military Affairs Commission: One Week of Battle Situation

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (September 20th to 26th), the battles on all fronts have been very fierce. The Japanese army on the Xiang-Gan (Hunan-Jiangxi) northern front has been using all its naval, land, and air forces to launch attacks. Our entire army and soldiers have been bravely giving their lives, engaging in fierce battles on the northern and southern battlefields. The intensity of the battles and the number of enemy captured are unprecedented in recent months. The more important operational developments are described as follows:

Xiang-E (Hunan-Hubei) Front: The enemy in northern Hunan has launched a large-scale offensive in three routes this week. The left wing is moving towards the southeast of Tongcheng, the central route is attacking Xinqiang River along the Wu-Chang Road, and the right wing, with a part of the marine corps, is forcibly landing from Lujiaoshi and Yingtan on Dongting Lake. Under the cover of airplanes and poison gas, the offensive is extremely fierce. Our army is intercepting the enemy on separate routes at places like Maishi, Yanglinjie, Lujiaoshi, and Yingtan, with repeated fierce battles. Our army launched a full-scale counterattack, and the Japanese regiment commander, Yamamura Haruo, was killed. On the 24th and 25th, the battle situation became even more intense, with enemy casualties exceeding 7,000. Fifty to sixty speedboats were sunk. Our surprise troops even raided the enemy's rear, once recovering Tongcheng and advancing to capture important strongholds southeast of the city and southeast of Yueyang, capturing countless enemies. We are currently continuing the bloody battle. Their attempt to occupy our territory will surely come at the highest price. In addition, the outlying strongholds of Yangxin and Mushigang, as well as Jinniuzhen and Hujiapu west of Daye, have also been recovered after bloody battles. The county seat of Donghuang'an has been under our fierce siege this week. The enemy is stubbornly resisting in the city. Yangbaifu in the west of the city has been captured. The officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to charge and kill, once breaking into the city and capturing a large number of enemies.

Ganbei (Northern Jiangxi) Front: The enemy in various locations in northern Jiangxi, such as Dachang, Fengxin, and Wuning, has gathered thousands of infantry and artillery troops since last week and launched a large-scale offensive towards Gao'an in separate routes. One route sneaked west to Huibu and Shangfu, spying on Cunqianjie from the south, attempting to attack the rear of Gao'an. Another route, with two to three thousand Japanese troops, fiercely attacked Xiangfuguan and Sigongshan northeast of Gao'an, adopting a strategy of converging attacks. After intercepting and engaging in fierce battles along the routes until the afternoon of the 19th, our troops in the county seat once transferred to the suburbs of the city. However, after reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack, successively recovering the outlying strongholds of Shangfu, Huibu, and Cunqianjie. The enemy's momentum wavered. By the evening of the 21st, our main force launched a full-scale attack again, charging and killing extremely fiercely. By dawn on the 22nd, the enemy could not hold on and broke through and fled in disarray. The county seat was declared recovered. After days of fierce pursuit, we successively captured key points such as Sigongshan, Xiangfuguan, and Wuqiaohe. The enemy retreated towards Nanchang and Fengxin. Our vanguard has already reached the outskirts of Fengxin, intensifying the siege and cutting off the traffic between Fengxin and Wuning, and advancing towards the county seat of Wuning. The enemy suffered heavy casualties after the defeat, with countless firearms, ammunition, and supplies captured by us.

Guangdong Front: The enemy in Chao-Shan (Chaozhou and Shantou) has been under our fierce attack last week. We once charged into Chao'an and approached Shantou, recovering Chitan. We have continued to sweep up the remaining enemies in the surrounding areas for days, completely blockading their transportation lines. Another route of Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Chenghai on the morning of the 21st, attempting to relieve the siege of Chao-Chi. After a day and night of bloody battle, on the morning of the 12th, our army temporarily transferred to the suburbs due to the disparity in numbers and continued the fierce battle. On the same day, at noon, the Japanese troops in Sanshui and Yangmei launched a fierce attack on Nanbianxu. We braved the Japanese army's poison gas and artillery fire and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army. The position was once lost, but the officers and soldiers joined forces to counterattack, charging into the Japanese army's position and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. By 6 pm, the area was declared recovered. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, abandoning many corpses, weapons, and ammunition. Another unit of Japanese troops that attacked Xialegang was also repelled, and the situation is currently at a stalemate.

### U.S. Has No Criticism of Wang Chonghui's Remarks

Washington: State Department officials, including Secretary of State Hull, did not criticize yesterday the remarks made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to the Associated Press reporter, stating that the United States is in a superior position to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. One State Department official explained that the State Department did not criticize because it had not yet received an official report on Wang Chonghui's opinion. The State Department here seems unwilling to be bound by the mediation issue by expressing opinions on only one side of the parties involved in the Far Eastern War. Therefore, it is generally believed that the United States will not make specific criticisms until Japan's attitude is clearly expressed. Wang Chonghui stated to Maurice, the Far East manager of the Associated Press in Chongqing yesterday, that the United States is in a position to mediate the Far Eastern War. He personally believed that the Chinese National Government could agree to order a cessation of hostilities on all fronts to allow the Japanese army to peacefully withdraw from China, but this must be conditional on Japan's adherence to the above-mentioned method as a prerequisite for peace. At that time, Wang also solemnly declared that China's policy has not changed, and China is determined to fight until the final victory. (Special dispatch from James of the Associated Press on the 29th)

Washington: Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui gave a statement to Maurice, the Far East branch manager of the Associated Press, yesterday, saying that the United States could mediate between China and Japan. After receiving the news here, Secretary of State Hull answered questions from reporters, saying that he had not yet studied it. State Department personnel said that the U.S. government must wait for the two countries concerned to make a request before it can consider the matter. In addition, the Chinese Embassy has not received official news from that country. (Dispatch from Havas on the 29th)

### Fujian Province Suffers Repeated Air Raids: Civilian Casualties Total Approximately One Thousand, Property Losses Exceed Five Million

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, Fujian Province has suffered repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft, resulting in huge losses to people's lives and property. According to a report from the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, as of July of this year, more than 1,500 bombs have been dropped by Japanese aircraft in various counties of the province, killing 344 people, injuring 516 people, and displacing more than 2,100 households due to the disaster. Property losses exceeded 5.1 million yuan, with Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Lianjiang, Tongan, and Jian'ou suffering the most severe losses. In Lianjiang County, only on July 2nd and 3rd in Tailu, Zhenhai, Xiaocheng, and other places, more than 400 houses were destroyed, displacing more than 2,100 people and causing property losses of more than 2 million yuan. The remaining counties that have not submitted reports have not yet been included in the statistics. Since its establishment six months ago, the Provincial Disaster Relief Association has issued a total of 128,090 yuan for peacetime disaster relief and 252,087 yuan for temporary and air raid disaster relief. The amount issued by the disaster relief associations in various counties has not yet been included in the statistics.

### The Xi-Cheng Road is Damaged, and the Japanese Army is Imposing Severe Intimidation

Jiangyin Correspondence: The electric wires and bridges along the Xi-Cheng Road are often damaged by Chinese mobile units. Recently, eight electric wires were cut off at Tangtouqiao. The Japanese army was at a loss. The day before yesterday, Zhishengye, the captain of the Japanese guard, convened a meeting of pseudo-township directors along the line, claiming that if such incidents occur again in the future, they will be wiped out regardless of whether they are good or bad, and ordered the township directors to form a road protection association, and those who wander on the highway will be killed without pardon. At the same time, an intimidating announcement was issued, stating that the Japanese army is determined to take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of the Xi-Cheng Road and communication lines. Residents nearby who damage highways, bridges, or cut telephone lines will be treated as guerrillas regardless of the reason and severely punished in accordance with military law. Other nearby residents should also bear the same responsibility. If anyone attempts to sabotage roads and communications, invades villages, or discovers the current state of other sabotage, farmers must quickly report to the Japanese garrison and passing Japanese troops. Those who protect highways, bridges, and telephone lines, report the situation of damage as soon as possible, and repair them voluntarily will be rewarded. This announcement was posted throughout the villages along the Xi-Cheng Road, but the farmers turned a blind eye and remained indifferent.

### The Chinese Army in Southern Shandong Recaptured Tancheng, and the Japanese Army in Linyi is Also Shaken

Xuzhou Correspondence: Tancheng is an important town in southern Shandong and a vital transportation hub between Jiangsu and Shandong. The Japanese side attaches great importance to this place and often dispatches more than a hundred mechanized troops to garrison it. The Chinese army has attacked several times, losing and regaining it in turn. Most of the houses in the city have been reduced to scorched earth. Recently, the Chinese XX Army, in order to cut off the communication between the Japanese troops in southern Shandong, specially deployed elite troops to cooperate with local teams. At dawn on the 11th, they began to attack the Japanese army in three routes, catching the Japanese army by surprise and immediately reaching the outskirts of the city. A select commando team climbed the walls and entered the city. For a time, hand grenades and rifles were fired in unison. The Japanese army woke up from their dreams and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army. However, mechanized weapons were no longer effective. The two armies engaged in close combat, hand-to-hand bloody battles. The Japanese battalion was occupied by the Chinese army, and fires were set everywhere, creating a tense situation. After a night of bloody battle, the Japanese army could not hold on and broke out through the north gate, fleeing in disarray. In addition to sending a team to pursue, the Chinese army searched for the remaining Japanese troops in the city and eliminated them. In this battle, a large number of spoils were obtained. Except for the slightly wounded who retreated with them, the Japanese army left behind more than seventy corpses, mostly not taken away. After the Chinese army officially recaptured Tancheng, the Japanese army in Linyi felt extremely panicked and also showed signs of being forced to flee.

### The Japanese Army's Repeated Invasion of Zhongshan: Japanese Warships Break Through the Hengmen Blockade Line, and Chinese Teams are Fighting a Step-by-Step Resistance

Hong Kong Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Guangzhou launched the first invasion of Shenzhen and Nantou and then retreated, they launched another invasion of the western sea of Guangdong. Because Shiqi in Zhongshan is the only way to enter and exit the western sea, and since the transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong was cut off, Shiqi has become a vital passage for Cantonese officials and people from the occupied areas to go to Macau and transfer to Hong Kong. Merchants and travelers are constantly on the road, so the Japanese army is eager to include Shiqi, Zhongshan in their bag. Several months ago, they once invaded Shiqi with naval, air, and land forces, but after landing at Boliwei and Shiqingwei, they only plundered a large amount of grain and failed to penetrate the urban area of Shiqi. When the Japanese navy attacked the Hengmen blockade line, a shallow-water warship was sunk by Chinese mines. This Japanese invasion of Zhongshan can be said to have not been worth the loss. Not long after, the Japanese army suddenly gathered a large number of troops at the southern end of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and again captured Nantou and Shenzhen, rushing to the Sino-British border, claiming to gather more than 10,000 troops to cut off traffic from Kowloon to the inland areas of the East River. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading Zhongshan were transferred to the Pin'an line, and there were no traces of the Japanese army in Zhongshan. When the Sino-British border incident eased, the Japanese army again dispatched troops from various places to launch the second invasion of Zhongshan on September 9, in cooperation with the navy and air force, using more than 30 motorboats and 3 warships, carrying 500 to 600 marines. First, they destroyed the blockade at Hengmen, Zhongshan, rushed into the Hengmen River, and followed the old road, landing at Qiqingsha and Boliwei. They also divided a part of their troops to disturb Shanzhoukeng along the inner river, but this vanguard had a limited number of people. Once the defense army fought bravely, the Japanese army fled back to the warships in a panic. On the 11th, the Japanese army gathered miscellaneous troops again and invaded on a large scale in two routes. One route attacked Dawangtou from the villages, and the other route attacked Licun along Shanzhou, spying on Xiaoyin, attempting to converge at Shiqi, and bombarded the villages along the coast with warships. Several Japanese planes formed a team, transporting bombs to bomb the defense army's positions. The Japanese army on the left quickly occupied Shanzhou and the villages in the fourth district, setting up a command post in Shanzhou Elementary School. The defense army team firmly defended Xiaoyin to protect the outer line of Shiqi. The Japanese army on the right landed on the north bank of Hengmen and covered more than 20 motorboats carrying hundreds of soldiers with shallow-water warships, occupying Dawangtou on the 12th. The defense army fought bravely, with intense fighting at Dawangtou, Erzhou, and Sanzhou. On the 13th, the fighting was still fierce. On the evening of the 12th, the Shiqi defense army launched a counterattack against the Japanese army in Shanzhou in two routes, once regaining strongholds such as Baimishan and Dajianfeng. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army reinforced its troops and used aircraft to assist in the abuse. The Chinese army retreated to Licun again. After the 13th, the situation in Zhongshan suddenly tightened, and fierce battles had broken out in Xiaoyin and Zhangjiabian, the outer lines of Shiqi. The Japanese army attacked Zhangjiabian fiercely from Dawangtou on the north bank of Henghe. The Chinese army took Zhangjiabian as a shield for Shiqi and intensified its defenses. On the Xiaoyin front, the defense army was still in control before the 13th. However, on the 14th, the Japanese army reinforced its troops from Licun to attack, and the positions in various villages in Xiaoyin were destroyed by Japanese bombs. The defense army had no danger to defend and was forced to withdraw to Zhangjiabian, concentrating its forces. On the 14th, the focus of the battle shifted to Zhangjiabian. In order to defend the central area of Shiqi, the Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army several times. From the evening of the 14th to the morning of the 15th, the Japanese army gradually could not hold on, and the defense army regained the rear mountain position of Zhangjiabian. It was also heard that the Japanese warships had sailed into the Jinzhong River and had been remotely bombarding with heavy artillery for days. Many shells fell near Shiqi, such as Niuxiguan and Baishawan. The river transportation in Shiqi has been blocked. The city is evacuating people, and citizens are fleeing to Macau or the Siyi inland areas, in a state of disarray.

### Finance: Swap Rates Ultimately Deemed Too High, Many Long Positions in Foreign Exchange Closed Out

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. In the informal market for British and American currencies, it was reported that Foreign Minister Wang discussed the Sino-Japanese war, and the United States was likely to mediate, increasing the possibility of success. As the settlement date approached and swap interest became higher, many non-strong September long positions had to be closed out at a loss. Also, Huaxing sold British gold. Although some Chinese merchants tried to buy, the foreign firms' appetite was weak, and the supply remained good, leading to a strengthening market. The closing price for British gold was 4 pence 375, and the US exchange rate was 7.375 yuan. In the afternoon, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank and Chinese merchants tried to buy, but foreign firms such as Youli were strong sellers, making it difficult to escape the loosening trend. As a result, the closing price was the lowest of the day, with British gold at 4 pence 4375 and the US exchange rate at 7.4375 yuan, 125 higher for British and 21875 lower for the US, compared to the previous day. After the close, the situation softened slightly. Due to the upcoming September settlement, some unwilling to delay hands had to swap October futures, and the discounts were still rare, making the loosening less severe than the spot market. According to the evening closing, the difference for British gold was 15625 and for the US exchange rate was 3125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.256%. It was heard that Hua Bi offered Chinese merchants US dollars at 25, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.336%, and Chinese merchants also offered a certain bank US dollars at 375, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.499%. Trading was still active throughout the day.

The US vs. British continued to increase by 125, vs. Shanghai increased by one dime, and vs. France increased by 25. The central exchange rates remained the same as before. Banks' morning spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 3125 and the US exchange rate at 7.25 yuan, slightly firmer by 03125 for the US compared to the previous closing price, due to the slightly longer exchange rate. After opening, Huaxing first offered foreign firms spot British gold at 4 pence 34375 and 375. Then, a certain American bank also offered Chinese merchants spot. The US exchange rate increased from 7.25 yuan to 375. At the same time, Youli sold US dollars for October to Chinese merchants at 7.0625 yuan, resulting in a loose and firm process.

It was heard that Hua Bi offered arbitragers US dollars at 25, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 0.336%. At noon, Chinese merchants offered a certain bank US dollars at 375, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.499%.

Foreign Banks' Selling Interest Was Also Strong

In the afternoon, because foreign firms such as Youli and Datong had strong selling intentions, although Japanese Zhengjin Bank and Chinese merchants slightly absorbed, it was still difficult to escape the loosening trend. It was calculated that Youli sold spot British gold to peers at 4 pence 40625 and 4375. Then, Datong and a certain bank also sold spot US dollars to peers and Chinese merchants at 7.375 yuan and called 375. At that time, Youli offered Japanese Zhengjin Bank US dollars for October at 7.125 yuan. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 4 pence 4375 and the US exchange rate at 7.4375 yuan, the same as the spot for this month. British gold for October was 4 pence 28125, and the US exchange rate was 7.125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, both the spot and this month's British gold were looser by 125, and the US currencies were all firmer by 21875. British gold for July was only looser by 015625, and the US was lower by 09375. It was heard that the prices slightly rebounded after the closing.

### Securities: Government Bonds Soar by 1.2-1.3 Yuan

The informal securities market situation yesterday was suddenly influenced by Minister Wang Chonghui's talk of peace, and the atmosphere was stronger than before. As gold prices declined, government bonds suddenly soared. In these days of plentiful rumors, the speculative market felt severely shaken. Short positions covered, long positions added, all at once like bees swarming. Those taking opportunity to sell at the high price however were not lacking either. Further, due to offering prices being too high, it caused a segment of the long position to exit. Subsequently it was seen pressed by a few dimes, but ultimately with the popularity being excited, it was low and rose again. Yesterday in the morning, at the initial opening the C grade was immediately 6 yuan, a sudden climb of 1 yuan several dimes. Those buying were particularly excited by the 25th series.

The atmosphere has become more relaxed, due to rumors of renewed peace talks and rising securities prices, which have dampened enthusiasm for long positions in cotton yarn. At the same time, demand from South China has decreased significantly. However, ten-count coarse yarn still has sales in the northern Tianjin area and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, the market has detached from the twenty-count yarn market and is advancing independently. As for the situation of ten-count cotton yarn, there is temporarily no hope of rising. If it continues on its current declining trend, a price drop may be possible. It is also unknown whether there will be any price declines.

### Stocks are not Surging, Tonghua Rose by 4 Yuan

However, the atmosphere is especially strong, because the incoming stock everywhere is not surging. Thus, the market's inventory is dry, and therefore, sale prices lowering is hopeless. The material for ten count coarse yarn is even more lacking. Moreover, since the sales of yarn have started to pick up recently, the manufacturers increase what they need. So, the Pinggu flower cotton's price, compared to the day before, rose by 9 yuan. Tongzhou flower also rose by a magnitude of 4 yuan. 989 white-wrapped cotton bags have arrived at the piers.

### Eleven Japanese Military Vehicles Overturned at Henglin Yesterday Morning, Chinese Guerrilla Destruction of Tracks Effective, Intercepted Military Supplies and Killed More Than 30 Japanese Soldiers, New Fourth Army Heavily Wounded Japanese Army on the Zhencheng Highway

Recently, the Chinese guerrillas in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have become increasingly active. The Japanese army, due to frequent deployments, can only deploy troops in important transportation line areas. Therefore, places slightly farther away from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have mostly become gathering places for Chinese guerrillas. In addition, the local people's feelings are激昂 and they cooperate, so that the Japanese army is exhausted and unable to cope. Even the Beijing-Shanghai line, the transportation center, has been destroyed by Chinese guerrillas several times. Yesterday morning, a guerrilla interception of Japanese military vehicles occurred again at Henglin Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Road. The entire vehicle overturned, and nearly 100 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. Therefore, traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Road was suddenly interrupted. It is reported that the situation of the Chinese guerrillas' surprise attack this time was even more rapid than previous times. The details are recorded as follows:

Chinese Guerrillas More and More Active

A month ago, the Beijing-Shanghai Road was damaged by Chinese guerrillas, causing the locomotive to overturn and many passengers were injured. The Japanese army stationed there, seeing the guerrillas' power was vast, did not dare to resist. Later, the tracks were repaired and traffic resumed, but travelers to Beijing were already wary. It is reported that the Chinese guerrillas in the suburbs along the Beijing-Shanghai Road belong to the Jiangnan Volunteer Army and have considerable strength. Usually, in addition to protecting railway traffic, the Japanese army lacks the extra strength to deal with the guerrillas' actions. Recently, because the Chinese guerrillas in the Nanjing and Zhenjiang areas have become more active, the Japanese army is planning to provide military supplies to the Japanese army in that area to meet the needs.

Japanese Military Vehicle Overturned Midway

On the evening of the previous day (28th), a train of Japanese military vehicles, a total of eleven vehicles, loaded with military supplies, and guarded by Japanese soldiers, totaling about 100 people, armed with guns and ammunition, set off from Shanghai North Station under heavy guard, intending to drive to Nanjing. It was expected that at about 12 o'clock in the late night of the previous day, when the vehicle was driving through Shitangwan Luoshe, near Henglin Station, suddenly because dozens of feet of the track there had been destroyed by Chinese guerrillas, and the small number of Japanese troops stationed there had not noticed beforehand due to the guerrillas' agile actions. When the military vehicle sped to that place, with a loud crash, the entire vehicle overturned and fell into the rice fields beside the road.

More Than Thirty Japanese Soldiers Killed

At that time, the Chinese guerrillas bravely advanced, and the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of beads. The Japanese soldiers in the car responded hastily after the car overturned, and suffered heavy casualties. More than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and the rest were injured. It was not until about 1 o'clock in the morning yesterday that the gunfire subsided. The Chinese guerrillas then collected the military supplies in the car and left.

Traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Completely Cut Off

At that time, Henglin Station could not notify the neighboring stations Luoshe and Qishuyan because the traffic had been destroyed by the guerrillas. It was not until the guerrillas withdrew that they were able to find a way to notify the outside. The Japanese army stationed in Wuxi and Changzhou heard the news and could not provide assistance. The road authorities then dispatched craftsmen to Henglin yesterday morning to repair the tracks. It is reported that the express train and ordinary passenger train that departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 8 am yesterday could not proceed after arriving in Wuxi and were waiting for the track to be repaired before continuing. The trains going south to Nanjing did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday, and it is reported that they all stopped in Changzhou. As of last night, it was heard that the damaged tracks in the Henglin section had not been completely repaired.

Good News Also Reported on the Zhencheng Highway

According to people from Changzhou, the New Fourth Army, in commemoration of the 8th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, specially ordered its subordinate units to be the general offensive period from September 15th to 17th. After receiving the order, each unit made meticulous arrangements according to the planned plan and launched attacks separately. A unit of the × regiment of the army, which is famous for its combat reputation, because of its flexible intelligence, immediately went to the Chenjiaqiao area of the Zhencheng Highway at 4:30 on the 16th.

Ambush Everywhere

Soon enough, nine military trucks, loaded with more than 300 Japanese soldiers, came speeding. The Chinese army waited for them to approach the firing range, and then each jumped out of the ambush and treated them with fierce hand grenades and strong firepower. At the same time, they used obstacles to cut off their return route. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and because the vehicles could not be driven, they were killed and injured in a hurry, no less than

More Than Two Hundred People

Later, because the Chinese army's hand grenades were exhausted, two lagging trucks were allowed to escape by the Japanese army. In this battle, a total of seven Japanese military trucks were destroyed, one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, and one water machine gun were captured, as well as more than 50 "Type 38" rifles. Other military flags, command knives, documents, baggage, etc. were also very numerous. After the Chinese army withdrew, the Japanese army went to

Collect the Corpses

It is estimated that they were stacked on three trains (trucks) and left. The Chinese army only sacrificed nine people and injured more than 30 people. The wounded soldiers were immediately taken by local people to a safe area for recuperation. Now people are visiting and expressing their condolences along the way.

After the Fact, It Was Learned

One hour after the start of the decisive battle, the Japanese army in Xixiashu and Benniu, which are adjacent to Chenjiaqiao, heard the news and immediately sent a large number of reinforcements. However, they were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way and collapsed without reaching their destination. It was also heard that the captain of the Japanese army stationed in Xixiashu was killed as a result.

### Fractional Currency Notes Issued Yesterday, Gradually Circulating in the Market, Financial Institutions and Various Agencies Went to Redeem, Not Fully Issued Yesterday, Redemption Continues Today, Temporary Value Certificates Must Be Recalled by Themselves Within a Time Limit

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank announced that it will issue fractional currency notes from yesterday, and after entrusting the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association to forward them, they have begun to circulate in the market from yesterday. The issuance method will be handled in accordance with the auxiliary currency regulations. The Ministry has ordered that all temporary value certificates issued by various industries in the past must be recalled within a time limit, and the problem of difficulty in finding change in various industries has gradually been resolved. The details are recorded as follows:

Issued Yesterday Morning, Circulating in the Market

The Central Bank's fractional currency notes are printed by the American Yongning Company. The first batch is 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes. They were issued and circulated in the market yesterday. They are printed on No. 2 banknote paper, and the cost of paper and printing is quite expensive. The front and back of the one-cent note are red. On the front, there is a nine-story pagoda on the left and the words "One Cent, Republic of China, Year 28" on the right. On the back, there is a number on the upper left, a seal on the lower left, the words "One Cent" in Western characters in the middle, and a round one-cent copper coin reverse model on the right. The front and back of the five-cent note are blue. The front is slightly the same as the one-cent note. On the back, there is a round five-cent nickel coin reverse model in the middle, with the words "Five Cents" in Western characters on both sides.

Used in the Market, Without Discount

After the fractional currency notes are delivered by the printing company Yongning Company to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, they were issued by the bank at 8:00 yesterday morning. The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association sent Zhang Shibin and Shen Yinhe to receive them with funds. At the same time, various banks and money houses directly sent people to the bank to receive them. By 6:00 pm yesterday, a total of 100,000 yuan each of one-cent notes and five-cent notes, totaling 200,000 yuan in national currency, had been issued. The distribution of the fractional currency notes is carried out at full face value, and there is no discount in the market. At the beginning of the issuance, raising prices is strictly prohibited. The Central Bank does not set up another exchange, and it is hoped that all sectors, except banks and money houses, will not directly request an exchange from the bank.

Number of Fractional Currency Notes Accepted

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank and learned that the issuance of fractional currency notes is handled in accordance with the auxiliary currency regulations, and is fully prepared with legal tender. The number of acceptances is in accordance with Article 5 of the auxiliary currency regulations, "The number of nickel coins accepted each time is limited to 20 yuan in legal tender. The receipt and exchange of copper coins and the Central Bank are not subject to this restriction. Anyone who collects 20 five-cent notes or 100 one-cent notes may exchange them for one yuan in legal tender at the Central Bank." The first batch of 500,000 yuan will be issued entirely in Shanghai. As for the second batch of printing, it will be decided according to the needs of the market.

Central Bank Handles Silver and Money Exchange Yesterday

Yesterday, according to the bank's spokesperson's statement to the Daguang News Agency, the new currency procedures issued by the bank are all handled in accordance with the Ministry's orders and the General Bank's instructions. The exchange matters handled by the bank today (that is, yesterday) are all related to the banks and money houses in the city, and the decision is made by the Customs, the Post Office, and the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the two concession public works bureaus. All requests for exchange amounts are supplied according to the bank's need for the bank, etc., and the convenience of exchanging the number requested is not given. The steps for restricting the number of exchanges have been discussed with the staff in charge, and there is no need to stipulate them in writing.

All Value Certificates Ordered to Be Recalled Regarding the value certificates temporarily issued by various companies and firms in Shanghai in the past to cope with the lack of change, the circulation in the market is quite large. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the firms that issued them to recall them within a time limit in order to emphasize the country's entire monetary system. As for the postage stamps that used to replace change, in addition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's submission to the Ministry for remedy, the Postal Administration has notified the postmasters to accept them in a flexible manner. Since yesterday, because fractional currency notes have been issued, all value certificates except those issued by the wood shops have been refused to accept value certificates from other shops. As for the token certificates of the tram company, it is heard that the company has decided to stop issuing them again.

Tobacco Exchange Association Forwards and Uses

After the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received the fractional currency notes from the Central Bank yesterday morning, it forwarded them to the member tobacco exchange shops at No. 487 Ningbo Road at 9:00 am, and announced at the door, "Fractional currency notes are temporarily returned to cooperative shops for exchange today." The exchangers were very crowded. The tobacco exchange market was temporarily closed yesterday. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the tobacco exchange industry received a total of 60,000 yuan of fractional currency notes from the Central Bank, which were completely forwarded to the member tobacco exchange shops. It is scheduled to submit to the Central Bank again today to continue forwarding matters. It is reported that there are more than 3,000 members of the association in the city, more than 200 cooperative members, and more than 100 tobacco companies, totaling more than 3,300. The number exchanged yesterday was not enough for distribution.

Individual Citizens Not Allowed to Exchange

The Central Bank is very cautious about the procedures for distributing new currency notes, as it is sufficient to meet the current legitimate needs of all industries in the city. In addition to the banks, money houses, major companies, foreign companies, tram companies, and automobile companies, all other individual citizens who want to exchange at the bank will be rejected. The reason is that once the new currency notes are circulated in the market, they can be transferred to the public at any time, and it will not be difficult to use them. The bank authorities intend to issue new currency notes in the future, and they must decide based on the needs of the market.

Change Situation in the Market Yesterday

Yesterday, a group of unscrupulous tobacco exchange counterparts took the opportunity to profit, and when exchanging the current fractional currency, they could only exchange 9 points of new fractional currency notes for every 1 jiao of auxiliary currency, or even only 8 points, otherwise they would refuse to exchange. Because of the above situation, it is very difficult for residents to obtain the fractional currency. The value certificates of trams, public buses, and various companies such as Da Sun, Sincere, and Wing On were not rejected by the public yesterday, because they are still suitable for practical needs. As for the various value certificates printed by other stores, they have mostly notified that they will be recalled within a time limit, so these miscellaneous certificates have obviously gradually disappeared in the market.

### Principal and Interest of the Gold Loan Due Today, Payment Begins, Divided into Six Periods, One Month Each, Paid with Shanghai General Exchange

The Customs Guarantee Unified Reconstruction Gold Loan and other domestic debts. After the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the repayment of principal and interest due to the interception of customs duties, the National Debt Fund Committee consulted and obtained the consent of the four banks of Zhong Zhong Jiao Nong. The four banks discounted the payment. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the banking industry and learned that the 12th principal and interest due of the long-term financial public debt of the Republic of China in 1928, totaling 1,125,000 yuan in principal and 400,7812.5 yuan in interest, totaling 1,532,812.5 yuan in principal and interest, will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China Communication Bank on September 30 (that is, today). Shanghai will be divided into six periods, each period is one month to pay it off, and it will be paid with the Shanghai General Exchange.

### Gold and Silver Import and Export Statistics Both Show Surplus

January to August The Customs published the gold and silver import and export statistics announced by the Customs: (1) In August this year, gold imports from the UK to Shanghai were 168 taels, and exports from Fuzhou to Hong Kong were 44,565 taels. Silver exports from Fuzhou to Hong Kong were 10,166 yuan, and there were no imports. (2) From January to August this year, gold imports were 372 taels, and exports were 1,369,452 taels. Silver imports were 824 yuan, and exports were 1,901,589 yuan. It is estimated that the gold surplus was 1,369,116 taels, and the silver surplus was 1,900,765 yuan.

### Gas Surcharge Increased, Public Works Bureau Has Passed, Surcharge Increased to 80 Percent, But the Bureau May Reconsider at Any Time

The Shanghai Gas Company recently requested the Public Works Bureau to approve its request to increase the current gas surcharge (23 percent) in order to increase revenue to offset the increased operating expenses due to the contraction of foreign exchange. The company's petition, along with a revised budget based on 3 pence and 3/4 of a British penny equaling 1 yuan in national currency, was submitted to the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau for consideration on the 18th of this month.

Two Petitions Submitted, Both Rejected

It is noted that the company submitted two petitions to the Public Works Bureau in May and July of this year requesting approval to increase prices, both of which were rejected by the Bureau. The current request was reviewed by the Chief of the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau. The Chief believes that the budget that the gas company had previously set based on an exchange rate of 6 and a half pence must be greatly revised due to the recent sharp drop in the exchange rate. Although there are some places in the revised budget recently submitted by the company that can be changed,

It Is Necessary to Increase to Make up for Losses

But it is still necessary to increase the surcharge in order to make up for the loss of operating expenses. The coal used by the company is paid in foreign currency, and various other expenses are also greatly affected by foreign exchange. Therefore, the Chief intends to request the Bureau to approve the Gas Company to add a surcharge of 80 percent on bills ending on or after November 1 of this year. This surcharge should be reconsidered by the Public Works Bureau at any time before the end of April next year, depending on the company's operating conditions. The above recommendation has been approved by the Public Works Bureau's Board of Directors.

### Central Fire Brigade Award Ceremony

According to the Zi Lin News, the Central Fire Brigade on Henan Road recently held an award ceremony. The Chief of the Public Works Bureau, Fan Keling, presented the long-term service medals of more than ten years issued by the British Fire Brigade Federation to eight foreign personnel of the fire brigade and the medals awarded by the Public Works Bureau for at least twelve years of service to four foreign personnel of the Fire Brigade's Volunteer Reserve Team. Fan Keling first gave a brief speech, praising the service of the fire brigade and the volunteer team in peacetime, and during the war in the previous year. Then the Director of the Fire Brigade, Li Lie, replied, and the award ceremony was completed. The Fire Brigade Club held a reception, and Fan Keling and the key members of the Fire Brigade attended. The French Concession Fire Brigade also sent representatives to attend.

### Chaotic Situation in Western Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal Council Strives for a Solution, Conducting Daily Discussions with the Japanese Puppet Municipal Government, Seeking a Proper Resolution. The Puppet Municipal Government Has Notified Foreign Residents to Collect Property Tax

Yesterday, tax collectors from the puppet "Municipal Finance Bureau" visited foreign residents residing outside the Shanghai International Settlement along the extended roads in western Shanghai, notifying them that starting next month, property taxes should be paid to the puppet "Finance Bureau." It is understood that the puppet "Municipal Government" is taking this action because the "Reformed Government" has cancelled the monthly subsidy of 450,000 yuan. Due to financial constraints, they are vigorously trying to open up this new "tax" source to compensate.

Foreign Residents Feel Threatened

Yesterday (the 29th), the number of puppet police in the extended road area visibly increased. Consequently, foreign residents have also felt extreme tension. A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in a conversation with reporters yesterday afternoon, also admitted that there are extreme difficulties in the tax collection issue on the extended roads. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council is making every effort to find a way to resolve this difficulty as soon as possible.

Negotiations Continue

Furthermore, according to unconfirmed reports obtained by reporters, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet Municipal Government have been conducting daily discussions on the issue of extended roads, hoping to find a viable solution. During the meetings, the following suggestion was made: both parties agree that the Shanghai Municipal Council has complete jurisdiction over Yu Yuan Road and all the alleyways on that road, while other areas in western Shanghai are ceded to the puppet police patrol team.

Residents of Western Shanghai Move Away in Droves

Since the puppet police intruded and set up posts along the extended roads of western Shanghai, residents have been uneasy and are planning to move. In addition, the puppet "Municipal Government" has notified residents in the area that property tax will be collected starting next quarter, causing even more panic. A wave of moving is at its peak. Moving furniture, trunks, and other items all day long, attracting passersby to stop and watch, all of whom are filled with sighs.

Openly Carrying Heavy Machine Guns

As for the actions of the puppet police, they remain rampant. Yesterday morning, a team of puppet police openly carried a machine gun while patrolling the extended roads. Furthermore, since the puppet police seized and arbitrarily managed traffic posts, vehicles traveling on the extended roads have found it difficult. The puppet police are extremely unskilled in traffic management, often neglecting one thing for another, leaving drivers at a loss. Therefore, several key locations, such as the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road, and the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu Road, are equipped with red and green traffic lights, which are still managed by constables, while the puppet police stand idly by.

Gambling Dens and Shops Close One After Another

In the Caojiadu area, violent incidents have been occurring frequently recently, and robbery is rampant. Not only are residents fearful, but even big gamblers are wary. Therefore, some gambling tables and opium dens in the area have closed down one after another due to declining business. As for commercial establishments, there are also many who are willing to transfer ownership at low prices because they are not profitable. The area originally intended to have military patrols, but they have not been seen since the "September 18th Incident."

Japanese Military Vehicle Opens Fire Without Reason

The English-language newspaper, The China Press, reported that the chief of the western district of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Sutter, and trainee chief of the western district of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Eiler, were patrolling from the Jing'an Temple police station on a motorcycle on the morning of today (the 29th) at about one o'clock, near Huaji Road, Jing'an Temple, not far from the Vienna Garden. When a Japanese military vehicle drove past, a loud bang was suddenly heard. At first, the two thought it was a rickshaw tire bursting, but they then found a spent bullet casing on the ground. According to the opinions of several rickshaw pullers and pedestrians, the bullet was fired from the Japanese military vehicle. The matter is currently under investigation. Many believe that the shooter may have been a group of drunken soldiers in the Japanese military vehicle, but the direction of the bullet could not be traced.

### Xiang-Gui Railway Has Been Extended to Liuzhou, Expected to Open to Traffic by the End of This Month, Zhennanguan to Nanning Will Open Soon

The Xiang-Gui Railway has been extended to Yongfu, as reported in this newspaper. Now it is known that the section from Yongfu to Liuzhou has been completed and is expected to open to traffic by the end of this month. In addition, the section from Zhennanguan to Nanning is currently being laid, and is expected to open to traffic in November. Although the earthwork for the section from Liuzhou to Nanning has not yet been completed, it is being actively carried out, and it should not be long before it opens to traffic. Once the entire section is open to traffic, the Xiang-Gui transportation will be smooth and unobstructed, and the transportation of passengers and goods will be greatly facilitated.

### Forced Inoculation of Vaccines, Residents Suffer Abuse, North Henan Road's Defenses Remain Unchanged, Puppet Police Inside the Temple of the Queen of Heaven Are Unarmed

After the Anglo-Japanese defense line changed in the central district north of Suzhou Creek, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, the Japanese immediately forced local residents to be inoculated with vaccines. Because the deadline is imminent, the crowds being inoculated are increasingly crowded. The situation is described in detail below.

Forced Inoculations, Deadline Approaches

At the inoculation site under the canvas awning in front of the Shanghai Electric Power Company on North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, since the Japanese took over defense on the 12th of this month and began forcing residents to be inoculated, the area around the awning has been crowded with people waiting to be inoculated. Because the Japanese have officially announced that the inoculation will end at the end of this month, and those who do not have a vaccination certificate will be refused residence in the area, the number of residents waiting to be inoculated around the awning this morning was even greater, and the order was extremely chaotic. The Japanese soldiers and "Dadou Police" present to maintain order used rattan whips and wooden sticks from time to time.

Quiet Situation in the Changed Defense Area

The former British military station inside the Jiangsu Motor Vehicle Company at Bazi Road and North Jiangxi Road has not been occupied by Japanese soldiers since it was blocked off with barbed wire by the Japanese. Although the Japanese once went to the Cilian Branch Association Refugee Reception Center No. 19, which is attached to the Weaving Road Hospital at the western end of Bazi Road, to investigate the staff, no Japanese soldiers have been stationed there. On North Henan Road, in addition to erecting boundary markers on the eastern side of the horizontal roads, the defenses on the road are still guarded by British defense forces, and the police officers of the Huishi Police Station are still patrolling as usual, with no difference from the past.

Two Puppet Police Officers Unarmed

The puppet police at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the North Suzhou Road Tianhou Palace Bridge were driven away by the British defense forces. On the morning of the day before yesterday, several puppet police officers were replaced. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, these armed puppet police officers re-entered. However, when a reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the area yesterday, there was still one puppet police officer stationed at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and another stationed at the "Permit Issuance Office," for a total of two. However, these puppet police officers were all disarmed and unarmed.

### Puppet Bureau's Enticement of Portuguese Vessels to Register Fails Again

In order to seize the management rights of navigation and control foreign shipping, the puppet "Reformed Government Transportation" established a "Maritime Administration Bureau" in Shanghai in April of this year, located at 55 North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, and formulated navigation registration rules. An announcement was made to all shipping companies that they must register with the "Bureau" before the end of May, and threatened that those who failed to do so would be prohibited from sailing or have their ownership of the ships revoked. Because all shipping companies ignored it, the registration was extended to the end of June. However, no one inquired about it by the deadline. According to a reporter from the Daguan News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the puppet officials of the "Bureau" had nothing to do all day long and were extremely bored. Recently, they have tried every means to entice the detained Portuguese ships, claiming that they could be released by the Japanese and sail as usual after registering. However, the Portuguese merchants were determined and consistently negotiated with the Japanese through diplomatic channels. Therefore, this attempt ultimately failed.

### British Community Association Raises Funds for Wartime Use, Will Be Managed and Hosted by a Committee of British Organizations

According to the North-China Daily News, the General Committee of the British Community Association held a monthly meeting on Tuesday to discuss a proposal to establish a fund for wartime work and relief purposes. The general opinion was that such a fund was more effective than issuing several different appeals. The proposed fund will be managed by a committee representing the British Community Association, the British Women's Association, the British Chamber of Commerce, and other British associations. The meeting also reported that the Rent Adjustment Committee, chaired by the Shanghai Harmonee Association, has now been established. The British Community Association has received various reports of rent disputes, which have been turned over to the Rent Adjustment Committee for handling.

### Sand and Gravel Shipped to Shanghai Detained Again

Since the "Jiangnan Company" monopolized the sand and gravel from Si Jiao, only allowing one-third to be sold by Shanghai commercial firms, disputes have arisen within the industry. Some firms and boatmen, due to the pressure of livelihood, could not delay any longer, so they were willing to painfully sacrifice and allow this one-third sales right, while some of their counterparts opposed this proposal, so they have been at odds for several months without any concrete solutions. Chu Xiaozuo, the chairman of the industry, believing that the situation was extraordinary, and that if it was not resolved, they would all perish together, took on the role of mediator. While negotiating with the "Jiangnan Company," before the contract was signed, a temporary business office was established in Shanghai to distribute the one-third of the sand and gravel obtained to various commercial firms. Unexpectedly, of the eighty-odd ships of sand and gravel shipped from Si Jiao and other places to Shanghai the day before yesterday, only ten-odd ships entered the port, and the remaining nearly seventy ships were detained by the Jiangnan Company outside the Wusong Estuary. The industry association believes that the sand and gravel imported this time is not even one-third, so they all refused to unload the cargo, while negotiating with the "Jiangnan Company" again, asking them to release the sand and gravel ships that should have been obtained.

### Cotton Landing Obstructed, Japan to Continue to Exert Pressure, Cotton in Occupied Areas Is Under Complete Control, Cotton Transported Must Be Loaded on Japanese Ships, Domestic Sales of Cotton Cloth in This City Reach 30,000 to 40,000 Pieces Daily

According to the Continental Times, regarding the recent rumors that the Japanese are prohibiting cotton from landing at various wharves in Shanghai, a reporter recently visited a major cotton merchant in this city. According to him, as a result of the Japanese exerting pressure to monopolize the entire cotton market, the Chinese who plant cotton in the cotton-producing areas are now encountering great difficulties. It is estimated that since the end of last week, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have detained more than 2,000 bales of cotton shipped from the occupied areas.

Shanghai Cotton Prices

Although the price has reached as high as 160 yuan per bale, cotton planters are forced to sell, and each bale only yields less than 60 yuan, it is said. The cotton industry in this city generally expects that the Japanese will continue to exert pressure, because it is heard that the Japanese authorities have telegraphed the handlers in the occupied areas to stop all cotton shipments to Shanghai, at least for the time being. It is said that the Japanese authorities' instructions state that all cotton transported must be loaded on Japanese ships and not stop in Shanghai, but instead go directly to Japan. Chinese sailboats transporting cotton down the Yangtze River estuary are generally prohibited, it is said. One day last week, the German merchant ships Jiangding and Haikang transported cotton, but were unable to unload it at the Shanghai wharves. This is the first sign that the Japanese are currently trying to control cotton shipped from the occupied areas. Also, since the War of Resistance, the government has actively developed the four southern and northwestern regions, and the economic life of the people in general has gradually stabilized, and from stability has gradually moved towards prosperity. The people's need for cotton cloth, which is essential for livelihood, is especially strong. However, because the textile industry in the interior is not easy to establish in a widespread manner for the time being, most of it still needs to be supplied by national goods factories in this city. Since the outbreak of the European War, the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai has fluctuated greatly, causing the Hong Kong merchants to suspend business for a time. Recently, the exchange rate has stabilized, and the Hong Kong merchants supplying the interior have seen that the price of dyes has soared, and many factories in Shanghai have reduced production and closed down, so they have telegraphed Shanghai in large quantities to purchase goods. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency met with a major figure in the industry yesterday, who said that the daily exports of various cotton cloths this week have reached

30,000 to 40,000 pieces. More than half of these are transferred to Sichuan and Yunnan via Hong Kong and Mazhang, and the rest are sold to eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu. As for the cotton used to make cloth, recently, because the Japanese have been inspecting "removal permits" for those coming to Shanghai from southern Pudong, many have been detained, so they are now using wharf boats to unload, and transporting it to the factories by truck, which is particularly expensive to transport, and the price of cotton has taken the opportunity to rise.

### Deceived When Ordering Cigarettes, Four Criminals Arrested and Awaiting Investigation and Interrogation

A man named Liu Yimin, previously entrusted by a customer, ordered ten large boxes of Great Britain brand cigarettes and fifty large rolls of cigarette paper from Yitaisheng Store, No. 14, Lane 140, Shandong Road, worth more than 4,000 yuan. At the time, he paid a deposit of 100 yuan, and then continued to pay 1,100 yuan. On the 24th, because Liu needed to ship the goods, Yitaisheng Store took Liu to see the goods on the 25th in Lane 1, Dongyouheng Road, where the ordered goods were all clearly present. Liu immediately agreed to deliver the goods to the Yushichang Wharf the next day, and pay another 1,000 yuan in payment. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, Yitaisheng did not deliver the goods as agreed. Later, Liu found out that Yitaisheng had already closed down, and the goods stored in Lane 1, Dongyouheng Road, were also gone. Then he knew he had been deceived and reported to the General Inspectorate. After investigation by Chinese detective Zhang Xiaolin, detective Zhu Xinwu, and others, four people, Le Ziliang, Xu Qingfang, Zhang Kanghua, and Xu Shunkang, were arrested in Room 21, 293 Hankou Road, No. 28, Yiyeli, Jialu Road, and Room 3, 395 Minguo Road, while the owner of the store, Fu Chufang, was at large. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The detective lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested permission to postpone the hearing, as the case still required investigation. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, he ruled to postpone the hearing.

### "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" Full of Heinous Crimes, Gun Discharges and Strikes Left Abdomen, Some Say He Was Targeted

Wu Daoyin, from Qidong, 30 years old, was previously the chief accountant at the Kedy Dairy Company. After the August 13th Shanghai War, his position was taken over by his cousin, and he returned to his native Qidong. After Qidong fell, the Japanese army suspected Wu Daoyin of joining the guerrillas and arrested him, escorting him to the Japanese army headquarters in Haimen. After strict investigation, there was no suspicion, so he was introduced to Shi Renxin, the puppet "county chief" of Haimen, to work. Later, Shi assigned him to serve as the "chairman of the Maintenance Association" in a certain place. At about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, Wu Daoyin and three friends took rickshaws to Qinglonggang, Haimen, to play. Wu, as the "chairman of the Maintenance Association," usually oppressed the people, who hated him to the bone. Therefore, he was very wary when he went out. Therefore, when he went out, he carried his own pistol in his hand. Before the rickshaw arrived at its destination, the pistol in his hand suddenly went off, and the bullet hit his left abdomen and exited from his right thigh. At that time, he was seriously injured and bleeding profusely. Later, accompanied by friends, he took the Huaping Wheel to Shanghai, arriving at Pier 13 at 7 p.m. last night. He urgently called Ambulance No. 83 and sent him to Tongren Hospital. Because he was seriously injured, he had lost consciousness upon arrival. His life was in danger. It is said that this person may have been targeted, but the details are unknown.

### Raising Funds to Establish a Business, Funds Embezzled, All Sent to Gambling Dens on Haig Road

A Cantonese man, Jian Daolin, is currently planning to organize an import and export company at 808 Juluida Road in the French Concession. During the preparation, at 1 p.m. on the 28th of this month, Jian ordered his brother-in-law Chen Tian to withdraw 5,400 yuan from the savings department of Wing On Company. Unexpectedly, after Chen withdrew the money, he took the money to the large gambling den at 368 Haig Road to gamble. Within a few hours, he had lost it all. Jian reported it to the Old Country Police Station, and Chinese detectives Guo Ruiquan and Zhou Wenqing arrested Chen, seizing 279 yuan and 10 jiao in cash. He was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a lawsuit for embezzlement. After questioning by Judge Fang, he ordered a postponement for further investigation.

### Russian Constable Commits Suicide with a Gun While on Duty and Dies

A Russian man, Shi Dailao Fu (transliteration), 26 years old this year, is currently a patrolman No. 329 at the General Police Station of the French Police Department, and is assigned to serve at the French police station in the Xujiahui Church area in western Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 28th, he was assigned to duty on Puxi Road, Xujiahui Town, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Unexpectedly, at 7 p.m., in front of the Xuhui Public School on that road, for some unknown reason, he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. He immediately took out the service pistol he was wearing and fired a shot into his left chest to commit suicide. The bullet penetrated his back and exited, and he fell to the ground injured. The police station in charge was informed and immediately called an ambulance to send him to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury was in a vital area, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3 a.m. yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police station and sent the body to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Tairasituo Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the Second Special Court and appointed a prosecutor and forensic doctor to come to the office to examine the body. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge reported the results of the investigation after the incident. The official ordered the body to be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for burial.

### Having a Passionate Affair with a Dancer, Accused of Obscenity, Defendant Admitted to Having Physical Relations

Qian Shaoqing, a tailor from Changshu, lives at 66 Gui'an Lane, Mintini Yin Road, North Chujia Bridge, French Concession. He originally had a store in Hongkou, but after the August 13th war, he moved his family to his current address to take refuge. His daughter, named Xiuying (also known as Huizhen), is 17 years old this year. Because of her beauty and her difficult circumstances, she learned to dance. After becoming proficient, she worked as a dance partner at the Damei Dance Hall and the Jielu Dance Hall

Dancing in Both Places

She used her income from dancing to supplement the family's income. Cao Zheng (also known as Cao Zhen), a 19-year-old youth from Nanxiang, the young owner of Cao Xiangtai Cotton Cloth Store, 276 Fadama Road, went to the Damei Dance Hall to dance with a friend in the early summer of this year. He met Qian Xiuying and was stunned by her beauty. They hated that they had not met sooner and privately agreed to marry. They then had relations. Unexpectedly, after several nights, Cao's daughter was already

Secretly Pregnant

And both sets of parents were unaware. Recently, Qian's daughter's abdomen gradually swelled, which hindered her career, so she withdrew from dancing at home, waiting for Cao to hire a matchmaker to discuss marriage. However, after Cao achieved his goal, he gradually became cold towards her and abandoned her. Recently, Qian's abdomen became increasingly large, which was discovered by her parents, who found Cao to reason with him and urged him to discuss marriage. Cao ignored them. Therefore, Qian Shaoqing, the girl's father, in the name of a legal representative, hired a lawyer with his daughter Xiuying to file a lawsuit against Cao Zheng in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for

Seduction and Abandonment

Obscenity, requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law. According to the lawsuit, the court, yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Minsheng summoned both parties to the Criminal Division of the court for trial. The legal representative of the plaintiff, Qian Shaoqing, was ill, so Qian Xiuyang came to court with her attorney. According to the woman's testimony, she met the defendant around the foreign Winter Solstice last year, and was induced to have relations at the New China Hotel from May 28th to 29th of this year. Later, they moved to the World Hotel. He

Agreed to Marry Me

Now I am pregnant, but he has abandoned me. Because I am pregnant, I cannot dance, so I am suing for investigation and punishment. The defendant Cao Zheng came to court with his defense attorney Wang Hengyi and admitted to having relations with Qian. However, her mother knew about us. After verifying the testimony in court, because the legal representative of the plaintiff, Qian Shaoqing, was ill and did not come to court, it was ruled that the hearing would be postponed to October 9th, pending Qian Shaoqing's arrival. The defendant Cao Zheng was ordered to pay a guarantor who could be summoned at any time and was allowed to be taken out by the defense attorney, with a deadline for supplementing the bail the next day.

### Embezzlement of Insurance Premiums Case Still Under Investigation, Defendant's Testimony Inconsistent

Rice merchant Zhu Qiu Xiong was previously sued by Rice Merchant Yuan Zhong Hou from Luxu at the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for embezzling military insurance compensation from the Central Trust Bureau. The court has already held two hearings. At 11 a.m. yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen took the seat at the Criminal Division and continued the trial. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present in court. According to the plaintiff, the fact that the defendant embezzled the compensation was extremely obvious, and there was a recording that could be listened to. When questioned, the defendant still claimed that the compensation he received was delivered by the Yizhong Notary Office. The remittance was deposited at the Meixin Cardboard Company on Shandong Road in September 1938, and presented a new deposit book. The plaintiff argued that the Central Trust Bureau's reply stated that the payment was in the form of a cash transfer, but the defendant now claimed it was a remittance, which clearly showed that the defendant still intended to embezzle the number of compensations. Furthermore, the defendant had previously testified that the compensation was deposited at the Juxingcheng Bank, but now he suddenly presented a deposit book from the Meixin Cardboard Company, attempting to cover up the embezzlement. Judge Xiao asked why the defendant's testimony about the deposit book was different before and after, the Meixin deposit book was brand new, and whether the compensation was transferred by the Yizhong Notary Office. The defendant's testimony was evasive. The judge said that there was still a need for a thorough investigation, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Destroying a Gambling Den

At about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, 20 to 30 burly men suddenly arrived at the front and rear alleys of Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu, each wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, looking like factory workers. Led by a young man in a suit, they arrived at the entrance of the alley and took out pistols, Mauser pistols, etc., swarming into the Dasheng Club and wantonly destroying it. For a time, the gamblers panicked and fled, and the order was in chaos. Someone reported to the "Local Police Station" on Singapore Road. By the time the puppet police arrived, the rioters had scattered and hid without a trace. Only a few suspects were captured. For a time, the area near Xinkang Lane was like a major enemy, and the residents suffered a false alarm.

### Robbery of Chinese Constable's Pistol, Offender Admits to Being a Lookout, and Admits to Robbing Flower Club Gambling Table

Three Chinese constables, Nos. 1663, 1228, and 2457, from the Gordon Road Police Station, were on duty near Connaught Road and Jessfield Road at 7:15 p.m. on the 15th of this month, when they were suddenly surrounded by more than a dozen rioters, who robbed three pistols and eight bullets worn by the three Chinese constables, and scattered in different directions, making it impossible to arrest them. It was not until 9:15 p.m. the next day that Chinese and Western detectives from the armored vehicle team of the police station, while passing the corner of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, were informed by Zhang Asan, who was a lookout at the Caojiadu Flower Club gambling table, that they had found Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan, three Anhui men who were suspects in the case of robbing the Chinese constables' pistols. They were sent to the First Special District Court, questioned and detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang attended the Criminal Division 3 and continued the trial. The lawyer representing the police station filed a public prosecution based on Article 330 of the Criminal Law on robbery, saying that the three defendants had previously admitted to the police station that because the self-defense group they organized lacked guns, they robbed the Chinese constables' pistols, and that they were all responsible for being lookouts, and admitted to using the guns to steal property from the Flower Club gambling table. Such behavior was improper and should be severely punished. When questioning the defendants, their testimony was evasive. They pleaded guilty and asked for leniency. The court ordered them to be returned to custody and set a date for the official judgment.

### Flower Gambling Rampant Within the Concession; Police Repeatedly Make Arrests

The Yiji Flower Gambling "factory" in the Shanghai West Special District has, since its establishment, initially harmed only a corner, but now its poison has spread throughout the city. All areas north of the Suzhou Creek are controlled by the gambling den leader, Mao Axiang, and Li Xiaobao's henchman, nicknamed Su Cai Gen Bao, who recruits unemployed vagrants to act as "boatmen," luring people into gambling. Each "tube" of gambling money collected is turned over to the head "tube" through Gen Bao, so the

listening device mechanism

set up by Gen Bao is very powerful. However, its news is extremely accurate, and its dens are numerous, so it has not been caught yet. The other day, the Huizi Patrol Station suddenly received an outside phone call saying that a robbery had occurred at No. 94, Lane 75, Tiantong Road. The head detective dispatched detectives Zhao Ziduo and Wang Jinshou, etc., along with Western detectives, to rush to the scene. They entered through the back door of the house and saw many people gathered in the kitchen writing flower gambling slips. Under questioning, Wang Amao, a boatman from Zhenjiang, admitted that he was working for

Su Cai Gen Bao

. The second landlord of the house, Shi Yanqing, also admitted that he should not have rented the house to Mao for gambling and insisted that no robbery had occurred in the house. The detectives then took Wang and Shi, along with four men and women, including Zhou Xiaofu, who were playing the flower gambling game, as well as more than 120 flower gambling slips and gambling money, etc., back to the Patrol Station. They were detained and sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning for investigation. The Patrol Station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case,

submitted evidence

, and Judge Meng, after a clear investigation, sentenced Wang Amao to seven months in prison and Shi Yanxiao to six months in prison. If they chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. The others were each fined thirty yuan, and if they chose to perform labor in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated. In addition, a man named Xiao Chen, also a boatman recruited by Su Cai Gen Bao, had his agency set up at No. 201, Lane 590, Haining Road. He also hired a Ningbo woman, Cao Wangshi,

to go out and lure people into gambling

. The other day, she was arrested while passing through North Jiangxi Road. Flower gambling slips were found on her, and she was taken to the Huizi Patrol Station. The detective, Ma Bingzhang, was sent to arrest Xiao Chen, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Only Yang Jinbao and Tang Tianlin, who were playing the flower gambling game, were caught. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court along with Cao Wangshi. Judge Meng

conducted a detailed interrogation

and sentenced Cao Wangshi to three months in prison. If she chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. The other two were each fined fifty yuan, and if they chose to perform labor in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated. In addition, each patrol station in Xinzha, Chengdu Road, Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc., has several boatmen luring people into gambling every day, and the number of cases of criminals sent to the court for punishment according to the law is too numerous to record.

### Jewish Immigrant Embezzles Luggage

Jewish refugees Hu Gao Naotesikante and Luoteweigan Yili arrived in Shanghai by boat on the 7th of this month along with other refugees. Unexpectedly, Luo embezzled and sold Hu's and other refugees' luggage worth 31,000 yuan and fled to Qingdao. Hu and others reported to the General Patrol Station, and detective Kobayashi tracked him down and arrested Luo in Qingdao. On the 28th, Luo was brought to Shanghai and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The Patrol Station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the case was complicated and requested an adjournment for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he ordered the detention to be continued and the hearing rescheduled.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Regarding the bankruptcy case of Jiande Bank, having read today's report in your newspaper that "the Shanghai First Special District Local Court ruled and announced the bankruptcy of the bank and appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator," and that "the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator colluded with each other, representing untrue debts, hindering the bankruptcy estate, and the rights of bankruptcy creditors, and privately accepting loans and altering accounting books," etc., these words are easily misunderstood. Therefore, I hereby make a clear statement and explain the evolution of the bankruptcy administrator in this case as follows: Jiande Bank was ruled and declared bankrupt on July 24, 1935. At that time, the court appointed lawyer Shen Junru and our accountant as bankruptcy administrators, and the creditors' meeting elected lawyers Lu Shidao and Lu Jia and Yu Yuanxiang as bankruptcy supervisors. Subsequently, the administrators found that the bank's paid-up capital was insufficient, falsely reporting more than 200,000 yuan to the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, from April 1936, they sued the bank's directors to recover the capital, and at the same time applied for the cancellation of the limited company registration. In March 1937, a judgment was made confirming that the bank's directors and supervisors were jointly and severally liable for the capital of 243,300 yuan. On April 27 of the same year, the third creditors' meeting was convened. According to the requirements of the bankruptcy law, the creditors re-elected the bankruptcy administrator. As a result of the voting, Yu Yuanxiang received 453 votes, representing a creditor's amount of 231,851 yuan and 99 cents, and was elected as the bankruptcy administrator. Our accountant immediately reported the meeting to the court. On the other hand, because he had been subjected to various obstacles and attacks when pursuing the capital, he felt that he had barely fulfilled his responsibilities as administrator as a result of obtaining a favorable judgment. Since someone was taking over as administrator, he was eager to be relieved of the heavy burden. Unexpectedly, on June 18 of the same year, he received a court ruling stating that, in addition to lawyer Shen Junru's position as administrator being taken over by Yu Yuanxiang, our accountant's position would continue to be handled. At this point, he had no choice but to continue to serve. This is the evolution of the administrator in this case. As for the various matters reported in your newspaper, our accountant knows nothing about them. We request that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the truth. This is most appreciated.

Sincerely,

Jiande Bank Bankruptcy Administrator Accountant Li Ding, September 29th,

### On Writing and Association

— Ding Di

Confidence is the cornerstone of success. We know this saying, and we all use it to cope with this storm. We see many works full of anger and hatred printed in books and magazines. These are all records of life's scars, with our tears, our cries, our curses, and many further positive meanings. But I always wonder, I feel that it is not enough; the optimistic and strong atmosphere is always a bit lacking.

Optimistic writing is always difficult to write and the hardest to please. The novels of talented scholars and beautiful ladies inevitably become cliché when they end in reunion. It seems that the deeper the sorrow, the more touching it is. To save effort and please people, everyone chooses to write about the gray and dark, about cruelty, about slaughter, about family destruction, about all inhumane things. We have seen a lot of it. If it is a real feeling, there are plenty of readers who are shocked and shed tears. No one denies this effect: it can stimulate readers, make them remember it deeply, remember the hatred, and wash away the humiliation. But let us not forget that great success has two requirements: one is the stimulation before the determination, and the other is the encouragement during the work. Explaining shame and hatred is just a kind of stimulation, increasing one's determination, but after we have made up our minds, and the work has begun, we should not only reflect on the pain, but also encourage, confidence and pleasure. Tasteless pride often makes a person relax and become negligent, but a constant frown also easily erodes energy. We need leisure and bright joy after labor, and we are also suitable for them.

A group of people embark on a difficult road, without turning back, confidence is a fact. After walking for two years, groping in the dark all night. The sky is about to dawn, and whether to go or not is naturally not a problem. Just keep going! There is no need to say anything more about whether you should go. Even if you tell the ignorant, it doesn't matter, but in the dark night and deep valley, when you see the sunlight coming through the cracks in the rocks, why don't you laugh more wildly, sing loudly, and let the happy air dispel the cold of the night.

Confidence, courage, vigor, steadfastness, joy, all of these describe a kind of interest. When tired, it is a stimulant, and it has a tonic function when it penetrates into the human body. This is by no means just exaggeration and shouting. In judgment, it is optimistic, in substance, it is full, in time, it is immortal, and in space, it is vast. Taken together, these are all interests.

Stimulation is certainly needed in the early stages, but at present, stimulation is definitely not enough. In addition to grief and anger, there must also be encouragement. This so-called association goes beyond the revelation of light or the theme of victory. Analytically, it is the atmosphere that the author first has a correct optimistic consciousness, and then a potential and joyful mind spontaneously arises, and is transcribed through imagery. Although this atmosphere is often related to the theme, in reality, it often encourages people even more than the optimistic theme. It is silent, it is the joyful wave of the author's mind, it can make readers happy, comforted, encouraged, and powerful. You cannot find its shadow in a certain chapter or section. This is the author's mood. On the surface, it is often entrusted to the story, but in fact, behind the story, you can clearly see an author who is brave, vigorous, steadfast, and joyful, with

Even without the current encouragement, Chinese new literature in the past ten years, which has always been stuck with nightmares and groans, is in dire need of this kind of promotion. Grasp the interest of creation, unfold a victorious, joyful, and healthy state of mind, and in addition to encouraging readers, it is also good to lead them to a realm of hope. This is not a good omen, it is just your interest. What you should have is the power of life. After grief and anger, this power cannot be missing for a day.

### Price Control (Part 1)

— Mu Chang

He slowly dragged his unique thick-soled leather boots, following five other people wearing the same uniform, to carry out the duty of maintaining order.

The autumn wind swirled quietly in the street. He raised his head: the gray sky that had not yet completely brightened, the 　　clouds. He took a deep breath, but suddenly a rain hit him in the face, shivering and wanting to vomit, and he barely managed to hold it back by forcing himself to walk straight. He thought: No wonder my mother, who is almost seventy years old, eats noodles every day, so she naturally can't stand it. I know that these noodles are hard and stiff when dry, and slippery and sweet when wet. People in the south may like it for two or three meals, but after seven or eight days, it will make their throats feel clogged. It's just that I only make thirty-odd yuan a month, and I have to support two and a half people, old and young. My mother understands; who is hurting us? The current situation is even more difficult, so she has to endure it, but she is getting thinner and thinner every day. If Little Mao dares to pout again, I'll give that little rascal twenty slaps and let him cry his heart out. It's just that the big and small devils keep saying "Grandma can't stand it," and this time they even brought a basket saying they want to buy cheap rice. Damn it, I'll definitely step on these traitors. It's still my fist that's unlucky; if I hadn't beaten him up just now, he would have run away with me in his clothes... He thought as he walked, indifferent even to the raindrops starting to fall on his head. Then, the little Zhangs in front shouted, and he followed nervously.

"Five or six fifteen-year-old devils are squeezing up, aren't they afraid of dying?" he muttered to himself.

"Old Zhou! Did your Da Mao ask you to buy ×× brand and ×× brand flour again?—Cheaper? He still doesn't want to?" the little Zhangs laughed.

He got annoyed and cursed them inwardly: "You are all my last generation, anyway, it's going to be the same old story: This is inferior goods, didn't the bomb from the South Railway Station almost kill you?——My son also says this to me. Humph!" He stared at them blankly, suddenly felt a sense of suspension, and realized that in order to save the five cents for the tram, he had eaten more of the leftover noodles before coming to work. He forced himself to calm down, rubbed the two coats hanging on his arm against his chest, but ignored them and walked on.

After walking for a while, Little Zhang suddenly clapped his hands and stomped his feet, shouting: "Look, that's strange! There are still stars in the sky, and the Shanghai hairy crabs are already lined up in the street. Wow!" They all looked over together, and sure enough, even the walls of the foreign houses on the corner were full of people, some even holding umbrellas.

They instinctively roared over, scaring them to quickly fall down, and several rice bags also fell into people's gardens. They fled screaming towards East Street.

Zhang Qingui was the first to shout: "Pigs!"

"Pigs! Do you want to eat rice, but not life? Look, the guild hall door is still closed!" The iron door was indeed still quietly closed, but more and more people were gathering in front of the door. Six patrolmen quickly squeezed in to maintain order.

They waved their batons, and a pile of people was finally squeezed into a long string of sausages. Little Zhang was quick and stretched the rope to one side, blocking out a narrow path, allowing them to wait in an orderly manner one by one. Three hundred feet of rope was too short, and people 　squeezed to near the X× Road on the south, and lined up along X× Road to X× Road, and then around X× Road. At the end, they were allowed to join in one by one!

The sky had a sad face, and a drizzle began to fall; a cold wind turned the drizzle into large raindrops pouring down. A thin mist floated on the asphalt road, splashing and flowing. A long line was huddled 　close to the iron railing, under the low wall, and even in the open air, with bags over their heads, lying on the sidewalk.

The torrent rushed in the road, and the drains played the music of iron horses clanging. Some children folded the paper wrapping the rice into hats of impermanence and put them on their heads, and the wet paper pasted on their faces formed a terrible mask; but the rain flowed even more ruthlessly from under their jaws to their necks, mixed with sweat and darting through their shirts all the way to the backs of their feet.

### Graduation Issue

— Shu Ni

When I lifted my head from the desk and looked around the room, I saw this thick graduation issue again. Putting down my pen, I was moved; there was a kind of helpless sadness. This was the work I had put my effort into!

How many nights I rushed to write稿子, and proofread stacks of sample稿 with my friends. I didn't stop until my eyelids were as heavy as lead. Then a burst of yawns, we all laughed easily. The pleasure after the work is completed.

Now, there are still so many typos. I have unspeakable embarrassment. Virtue is a difficult and extremely easy to fail learning, and seriousness is the most difficult. I don't know why, these two days I always think of embroidered pillows.

So, I opened the book. I saw the magnificent school gate, the solemn auditorium, the modern sports hall... The past events that drifted away with the long river of time emerged again. However, I don't want to trouble myself in the memory. Accumulate the anger in your heart, the bomb full of gunpowder will always explode in a certain second.

A comfortable life, poetry-like beautiful days, are all destroyed with the red flames. But, how will we rebuild a new paradise on the ruins? Poor people, have you forgotten? What wind and sand have blinded your eyes?

Turning the pages, I froze. Reflected in my eyes were the photos sandwiched in the black lines, which commemorated the two deceased classmates. Before, I was very unfamiliar with them, and even had no conversation with them, but now, I froze. From the cradle to the grave, is it so short? I have no fear of death, but I love life more. "Living is always admirable, because you can work." There are too many things I want to do.

I looked closely at each familiar face and remembered the many divergent roads lying in front of this generation. In the vast journey, young partners, where are we going?

### Funeral

— Written by C. Wolfe, translated by Pin Pin

Without a drumbeat, nor a mournful tune,

We moved his remains to the edge of the city;

Not a soldier, in remembrance,

Fired a gun over the hero's grave we dug.

We buried him in the dimness of the dead night,

We opened the earth with bayonets;

The moon emitted a trembling, ghostly light,

The oil lamp dimly shone.

There was no need to coffin him,

Nor did we bury him with bedding;

But he lay sleeping like a warrior,

We viewed his body in military uniform.

We read a short eulogy,

Not mentioning a word of sorrow,

We stared at his face,

Hardly thinking about tomorrow.

Together we dug a narrow grave,

Gently lowered his lonely coffin,

Enemies and strangers will trample this tomb,

And we will go far away at sea!

They will slander his dead soul,

Revile his cold ashes,

But it doesn't matter, as long as he sleeps in

A grave dug for him by his countrymen.

Our great work is not yet complete,

The current task has been completed;

The intermittent gunfire in the distance,

Must be the enemy venting idly.

Slowly and deeply we buried him,

In the beautiful soil acquired with his flesh and blood;

We do not inscribe a line of inscription, nor erect a stone tablet!

We leave only glory to accompany him.

### Double Tenth Festival First-Run Film Preview

— Liang

The Double Tenth Festival is coming in the shortest possible time. At that time, Shanghai's cinemas will inevitably select a few of the most exciting films to show. Now, let the author report to you fans a few of the ones I know. (National films are temporarily missing)

Nanjing will show "The Four Feathers," produced by United Artists, a complete natural five-color film directed by Alexander Korda, starring John Clements and June Duprez. This film is extremely grand and is a great film that inspires people's patriotism.

Da Guangming will show "Juarez," produced by Warner Bros., starring the famous stars Paul Muni and Bette Davis. This film is a palace history film, depicting the life of the Mexican President Juarez, who led the resistance war and finally achieved the great achievement of restoring the country with extreme perseverance and perseverance. Judging from the past achievements of the two leads, this film will undoubtedly arouse the love of fans.

(Note that the above two films are exactly what we need in the current situation.)

Da Shanghai will show "Sweethearts," produced by MGM, a complete five-color film, co-starring the famous singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. This film was previously shown at an increased price at the Nanjing Grand Theater. It is an extremely perfect music and art film; if we say that the above two films are hard, then this film should be considered soft.

The Double Tenth Festival film at Guotai has not yet been decided. I guess it will probably be one of the two films "Frais de St. Cyr" and "Union Pacific." The first film is starred by Ke Mao Kantong, Laurent Tuodan, and Qixi Fulai. The plot describes the heroic deeds of the French Army. As for "Union Pacific," it is co-starred by Bai Peilan Stanwei and Zuo Mikeley. The scene is quite grand, and the plot is also quite tight.

In short, the above films are all worth watching. By the way, let me say one more thing here, the "Four Feathers" in Nanjing has been filmed as a silent film before, and at the time of the performance, this film had already achieved great success.

### Pingju Talents Come in an Endless Stream

— Wei Wei

— Huangjin Invites Wang Yurong

After the golden autumn wind, the Shanghai theater world suddenly tends to be prosperous. The renovated Huangjin and Gengxin theaters have widely invited famous Peking Opera actors. The first batch of the four famous female performers of the Gengxin stage met with the people of Shanghai yesterday. After the performance, Tan Fuying will continue to take the stage; Huangjin Theater, Song Dezhu and Wu Yanheng will perform for a month. After that, after much consideration, they have invited female performer Wang Yurong, as the main character for Huangjin's invitation to actors. The agent went north a few days ago to invite her, and there is also talk of inviting the famous young actor Yu Zhenfei. They are expected to come to Shanghai around the ninth month of the lunar calendar. The male lead will be played by An Shuyuan, who has already been invited by Huangjin and is now in Shanghai.

Wang Yurong was born on the banks of the Qinhuai River, that is, Wang Yanfang, who was selected as the Queen of Songs in the Confucius Temple in those years. In 1934, she went north to study under the old actor Wang Yaoqing. Although Yaoqing has many students, most of them were taught by Wang's senior disciple Cheng Yuqing. Yaoqing especially loves Yurong, so Yurong is the only female actor who has been personally taught by Yaoqing. Yurong is talented and intelligent, and her voice is especially sweet and bright. In addition, she is diligent in learning. After several years of training by Yaoqing, her artistic skills must be considerable. A certain Pingju talent from the south once told me: "Master Wang (referring to Yaoqing) gave all his brain juice to Yurong alone, so Yurong's achievements can be higher than her peers." I have learned that Yurong's momentum in the old capital is already higher than that of Zhang Eyun and Xin Yanqiu, and is even comparable to Xue Yanqin in those years. Whenever she performs, it is always sold out, and she is calling with real art despite being a female actor. This time, she has been invited by Huangjin, and there will definitely be a lively scene at that time.

Improved Ping Opera

### Ms. Jin Suqin's Autobiography: Fourteen Years of Acting (Part 2)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

— And Her Dedication to Improving Peking Opera

Reforming Peking Opera is what I consider to be the most meaningful and interesting endeavor. Drama, as an important part of the cultural sector, must naturally advance with the times. Although Peking Opera is an old art form, at the very least, in terms of the script, we can use the "old bottle, new wine" approach to infuse it with contemporary consciousness and make improvements. This is both possible and necessary. Previously, Mr. Ouyang and I collaborated. Under his direction and writing, we performed five plays successively: "The Fisherman's Sorrow," "Liang Hongyu," "The Peach Blossom Braid," "Yang Guifei," and "New Jade Hall Spring." The general process was as follows: in terms of performance, the scripts contained new ideas, the stage settings were also slightly modified, and actors, in addition to singing and acting, also emphasized the understanding and expression of the characters' personalities. Great attention was also paid to the three-dimensionality of the stage, scenery, and new-style lighting. In terms of organization: actors were all trained beforehand, a directorial system was implemented for rehearsals, prompters were entirely eliminated, and backstage was divided into general affairs, stage management, performance, costume, and prop departments, with an emphasis on maintaining order through strict regulations. Although this was only an initial attempt and the performance period was only two months, I sincerely hope to have the opportunity to continue striving forward along this path.

Filming Movies

Last winter, Yihua Film Company invited me to film a movie, a costume drama called "Chu Overlord." Originally, I was very interested in movies and had wanted to make one as an experiment. However, after filming "Chu Overlord," I felt that this work was really impossible, too hard. At that time, it was the dead of winter, and working overnight in the freezing cold studio was truly bone-chilling. Also, I was performing at the "Golden" theater every night, and I didn't have enough time or energy to cope. As a result, many of my shots were cut, and it ended hastily. I was really dissatisfied with this movie. I hope to have enough time and a meaningful script in the future to make a better movie.

General Thoughts

I believe that performing Peking Opera requires real skill, otherwise it is difficult to sing well. Even when performing reformed Peking Opera, one must have a solid foundation. The most difficult problem in the reform work is the lack of playwrights, and there is a great shortage of scripts. This is because playwrights in the field of Peking Opera must have deep experience, new ideas, and be good at literature. Otherwise, even if the script is well-written, it may not be suitable for stage performance; and scripts that are suitable for performance may lack sufficient contemporary awareness. This is definitely not an easy task. Another observation: pure Peking Opera may as well be preserved by traditional performers. Southern Peking Opera should be developed as much as possible into reformed plays that are half-sung and half-acted—but definitely not plays with elaborate stage machinery. There are already many comrades in our old opera circle who have changed their thinking, are able to write their own scripts, and sympathize with the reform work. If everyone can work hard together, I believe that this reformed Peking Opera will definitely achieve the greatest success.

Star Six Diary, Episode Thirteen: Mi Ling

Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, it's already the Mid-Autumn Festival. I've been extremely busy this past week. I watched Song Dezhu's "Little Cowherd," and I was busy listening to Zhao Yurong, Wu Suqiu, Liang Yunqiu, and others in "Four or Five Flower Caves." Plus, I had to attend social events at the host's house and banquets at other people's houses. I barely had time to go to the dance hall, which I usually love. I heard that a charity tea dance will be held this Sunday at the Metropolitan, and there will be some entertainment programs, such as Jin Lili, Mei Yunyun, Ying Meihua, and others singing Peking Opera. Since Lili knows me as her nominal teacher, she naturally asked me to find her a qin player to warm up her voice. I arranged one for her yesterday, so I have to go to the Metropolitan to give her the news. If I go to the dance hall to talk to a dance girl, it seems a little impolite to go to her seat to talk. I have to dance with her once. As we were talking and walking, I suddenly heard a voice like an oriole calling out "Teacher." I turned around and saw that Mi Ling was dancing with a Buddha-like guest. This guest also smiled when he saw me and called out "Teacher" in a soft voice, which made me laugh first. It's really "humility from above, undeserved." How should I respond? Mi Ling has the reputation of a female poet, she is elegant and beautiful, and her behavior is dignified. She dances standard dances very well. Although I have not read her poems, I can tell from her conversation that she is not a mediocre person. As for me, I don't know how to write poetry at all, so how can I be a teacher to a poet? As for this disciple who looks like a Laughing Buddha, I am even more unworthy of the title.

The character "宓" (Mi) looks like "密" (Mi). One pronunciation is "Fu," I jokingly said to Mi Ling: Your surname should be read as "宓 (Fu)," which is a good medicine, "茯苓" (Poria cocos). Your surname should be read as "宓 (Mi)," the "secret order (密令)" during military periods is the most important. No wonder you are so popular and busy, and you are even involving two gentlemen with glasses and a Laughing Buddha in the hustle and bustle. This is your magic!

Speaking of learning to write poetry, I think it's not necessary. Since ancient times, poets have been poor and destitute, and talented and beautiful girls often have short lives. This is my superstition. Moreover, poetry is only for cultivating one's temperament, and it has no practical use at all. Reading should be for understanding principles, that is, we should know how to be a person. But it's always good to read poetry in one's spare time, but you should be careful not to overwork your mind.

### Anecdotes from the Opera World

Actors and Opium

Speaking of which, smoking opium does indeed have considerable benefits for actors. It is often said that their voice is their capital, which shows how important the quality of their voice is to their lifelong honor and disgrace, and their livelihood. After actors pass the difficult stage of voice change, from adulthood to middle age, they are most easily tempted by various external influences. The first is the problem of lust, which is costly, harmful to the body, and damaging to their reputation. However, opium is most likely to ruin one's blood. Once addicted, the body weakens, essence and blood are depleted, and the problem of sexual desire is greatly diminished. Going out also requires energy, patience, and the willingness to endure hardship in order to achieve one's goals. If one has a beloved, but then develops an addiction, when the craving comes, one's body is no longer one's own, and one can't even lift one's legs. Even if a celestial beauty is standing in front of you, you won't have the strength to reach out and pull her hand. So, anyone who gets addicted to this habit will not even think about it. The loss of essence and blood most affects the voice, making it dry or hoarse and unable to produce sound. Another thing is that colds and coughs can also make the voice hoarse, or even cause shortness of breath and rapid breathing, often interrupting a sentence several times. If this happens on stage, the audience will definitely boo or chase you off the stage. However, opium is most effective in stopping coughs, and those who smoke it do not suffer from minor ailments for many years. Furthermore, according to insiders, if one has satisfied their craving at home for half an hour before going on stage, the effect of the opium is still strong, one's breath is sufficient, and the voice is round and smooth. If it is not a full-length play like "Visiting Mother," which lasts at most three or four quarters of an hour, then one can definitely be full of energy and consistent from beginning to end, and cope with the play successfully. What is most feared is satisfying one's craving and then sitting backstage for two or three hours before going on stage. By then, the effect of the opium has worn off, the throat is itchy, and although one wants to exert oneself, one cannot muster any energy. (110)
