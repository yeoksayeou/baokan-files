Xingji: After the Chinese army in western Shanxi recovered Xiangning on the 14th, they took advantage of the victory to launch a full-scale attack. The Japanese troops in Da Ning, Pu County, Wu Cheng Town, and Xi County were easily defeated and collapsed completely. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 16th, the Chinese army first captured Da Ning City and continued to pursue the Japanese troops who were collapsing eastward. At 6 p.m., they recaptured Wu Cheng Town (northwest of Pu County). By 9 p.m. that evening, Pu County was also reported to have been recovered. The Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards Tumen and Heilongguan. The Chinese army ambushed them along the way and engaged them everywhere, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese troops. The number of prisoners captured and killed is currently being counted. (Dispatch from the 17th)

Xingji: Since the 14th, the Chinese army has continued to encircle and attack the Japanese troops entrenched in Nangang (south of Xiangning). The fighting intensified until yesterday morning. The Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Wenquan, Longwangpo, Nangangshang, and Jiayuan, and also sent troops to outflank and attack Shangxialingnan. By noon, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and collapsed towards Hejin. The strongholds of Wenquan, Longwangpo, Nangangshang, and Jiayuan were completely recovered. At this point, Nangang was also cleared. East of Xiangning, the Chinese army continued to recover Taishanmiao, Xinziyuan Dongxi Shang, and other places. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards Duanshanling, Linshanmiao, and Yuntaishan (north of Xiangning). In the valley area between Xiangning and Fencheng, a certain unit of the Chinese army is still stepping up its mopping-up operations. Niuwangmiao, Yitaitou, and Duanshanling are still in fierce fighting. (Dispatch from the 17th)

Xingji: Since the 9th, more than 600 Japanese infantry and cavalrymen, coming from Laiyuan Town (south of Taigu) on the northern section of the Baijin Highway, invaded Yushe from the east. The Chinese army blocked them in the areas of Dongxi Xingzhuang and Dongxi Qingpan. After fierce fighting for two nights, the Japanese troops were unable to escape westward. On the morning of the 11th, the Japanese troops dispatched more than 500 reinforcements to attack Yushe again. At the same time, more than 100 Japanese troops from Liao County also responded by invading southward, harassing the highlands north of Dalang Village, Caotinggou, and Wenquan Village. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 12th, the Chinese troops advanced to Yushe and launched a fierce attack. The two sides fought fiercely all night. The Japanese troops were hit hard and shaken, and secretly transferred troops from Shibi (southwest of Yushe) to rush to their aid, thus taking the opportunity to break through and escape westward. The Chinese army tracked and pursued them, advancing to the vicinity of Shibi on the morning of the 13th and continuing to attack the defeated and remnant Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in the Dalang Village and Caotinggou areas south of Liao County were also defeated and retreated in the afternoon of the 12th. (Dispatch from the 16th)

### Company Commander Liu Dies Heroically in the Line of Duty

Xingji: Liu Deshun, the company commander of a certain unit of the Chinese army, led his troops on the evening of the 5th to destroy the Xinyao branch line of the Tongpu Railway, destroying more than ten miles of the section from Anyi Village in Dingxiang to Donglou Village in Xin County, and sawing down more than 90 electric poles. At dawn on the 6th, a group of Japanese troops encountered the unit near Zhicun in Dingxiang. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops fled into the village. Company Commander Liu advanced fiercely, carrying a rifle in his left hand and a hand grenade in his right hand. As soon as he entered the village, he personally killed 20 Japanese soldiers. While continuing to search, the Japanese troops ambushed him in the alley and opened fire, hitting Liu with three bullets. Seriously wounded and collapsing to the ground, he stubbornly got up and continued to command, and died heroically in the line of duty amidst a hail of bullets. His subordinates were greatly moved and fought repeatedly, finally driving the Japanese troops away. In addition, a certain officer believed that Company Commander Liu's refusal to retreat despite his injuries and his heroic sacrifice were worthy of emulation by soldiers, and had submitted a request to his superiors for commendation.

### The Japanese Invade Qisha and Fangcheng; The Chinese Army is Fiercely Resisting; Japanese Aircraft Bomb Qin County Extensively; Fierce Fighting is Underway in the Litouzu Area

Guilin: The coastal battles on the southern route have shifted to areas beyond the range of Japanese naval guns, and the terrain is gradually becoming more favorable to the Chinese army's defense. The Japanese troops on the west coast, in the triangular area between Qisha, Longmen, and Fangcheng, have been fiercely resisted by the Chinese army. From morning to noon, after half a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. At noon, the Japanese attempted to enter Fangcheng, using aircraft to continuously bomb the city for two hours, followed by a fierce attack by infantry and cavalry. After fierce street fighting, the Chinese army began to shift to the northern suburbs of the city. On the east coast, at 7:50 p.m. on the 16th, the Japanese army used multiple speedboats to carry troops from Maowei Sea to forcibly land at Litouzu (south of Qin County). At the same time, Japanese troops also landed in the area west of Litouzu. The Chinese defenders bravely resisted, and the fighting was very fierce. Fierce fighting is still underway. (Dispatch from the 17th)

Guilin: Seven Japanese warships were anchored off the coast of Guantouling on the 16th, with no unusual movements. Beidi City is peaceful. There were a total of 28 Japanese warships in Qinzhou Bay on the 16th. (Dispatch from the 17th)

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Southwest Headquarters of the Guilin National Military Council stated to the press yesterday that, based on developments in the past 24 hours, it seemed unlikely that the Japanese army's landing in Beihai would develop into a large-scale battle. According to news received from the Beihai area, as of now, the Japanese army is using a small number of ground troops in an attempt to advance inland, while the main force of the landing Japanese troops is the naval force. As for the Japanese troops landing at Longmen, west of Beihai, they have been driven back to the warships. Fighting is still ongoing at Qisha, the entrance to Longmen Port. A communiqu√© issued by the headquarters of the Chinese army in Guangdong Province in Shaoguan stated that Qin County was under air raid alerts all day yesterday due to the activities of Japanese aircraft. (Dispatch from the 17th by Reuters)

Chongqing: According to news from this source today, the Japanese army has three landing points in the Beihai and Qinzhou Bay areas: (1) a location 70 kilometers northwest of Beihai; (2) a location near Fangcheng (65 kilometers from Beihai); both of these locations are more than 105 kilometers from Nanning; and (3) Qisha, the outermost part of Qinzhou Bay, 25 kilometers south of Fangcheng. According to a telegram from Longmen, the Japanese army landed there on Wednesday, but after landing, the defenders launched a fierce surprise attack while the Japanese were still establishing their positions. As a result, the Japanese army was unable to gain a foothold and fled back to the warships. On the same day, the Japanese army originally planned to attack Qin County, 25 kilometers away from Longmen, and therefore extensively bombed Qin County with aircraft. However, since they were unable to gain a foothold in Longmen, the attack on Qin County was also abandoned. However, on Wednesday, the Japanese side sent 40 ships and attacked Fangcheng in three directions, using dense fog to complete the landing operation. However, the landing Japanese troops were only naval landing forces, and the number of people was only 100. However, last night, a team of Japanese cavalry also landed in Fangcheng, but were met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army and were unable to advance. The number of Japanese troops landing in Qisha is unknown. As of yesterday morning, the number of people had increased again. Therefore, although the Japanese troops in Longmen were repelled by the Chinese, the Japanese troops in Qisha are still stubbornly resisting. According to someone from Guilin who spoke to a reporter, based on his observations, the Japanese landing operation on the southwest coast of Guangdong does not expect to conduct a large-scale war there.

### The US State Department Expresses Concern

Washington: Assistant Secretary of State Welles said today that the State Department is watching the Japanese invasion of the Beihai area. He does not know exactly what American interests are involved, but the State Department is now obtaining information about the Japanese move. (Dispatch from the 17th by Reuters)

Washington: The US government is now closely watching the Japanese military actions in the Beihai area of southern China in order to determine the impact on American interests after the war has occurred. Deputy Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that he could not yet say what impact the Japanese landing in southern China would have on the United States, but "we are looking forward to continuing to obtain information to clarify the truth."

Editorial

### The Attack on Beihai and Diplomatic Offensives

Why did the Japanese army suddenly invade Beihai in China again? According to a spokesman for the Japanese Navy in Tokyo, after capturing Beihai, all Chinese seaports will be under Japanese control. According to an official announcement by the Japanese side in Hong Kong, after seizing Beihai, they can cut off the lifeline between Chongqing in China and French Indochina. The two statements are mutually different and both are unbelievable. One is because Japan's strategy for dealing with China at sea is to blockade the Chinese coast with its navy, which has already been successful. Why is it necessary to take Beihai or any other seaport? Seaports are of little use without navies and ships, and China has no navy or ships; seaports are of little use without railways and highways to the interior, and Beihai is located on the coast, with narrow highways and no railway access; there are countless Chinese seaports like Beihai, and countless seaports that have not been occupied by the Japanese army. If Japan wants to occupy all Chinese seaports, it will need countless troops. Therefore, what the Japanese side claimed in Tokyo is sophistry and cannot be believed. The second is because although Beihai in Guangdong is close to Guangxi, and Guangxi is adjacent to French Indochina, Beihai is only 150 nautical miles from Haiphong in Vietnam by sea, and the connections between Haiphong and Chongqing are active. This is one of China's most important international routes at present, but the key is in Yunnan Province, not Guangxi. If one goes from Beihai through Guangxi to Yunnan, there are high mountains and valleys that are difficult for light vehicles to pass through, let alone heavy troops. So how can the Sino-French transportation be cut off? Therefore, what the Japanese side announced in Hong Kong is also sophistry and cannot be believed either.

What does the sophistry conceal? What is concealed is not about strategy, because the Beihai area is definitely not a place for combat. Regardless of whether China has its own arrangements between Guangdong and Guangxi, the natural terrain is limited, and the Japanese army will never be able to attack deeply. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Beihai is a dead end for military operations. What is concealed is not about politics or economy, because in terms of the War of Resistance, the political and economic status of this area can be said to be irrelevant to the overall situation. What is concealed is not about military aggression, because the area of military occupation is not necessarily the more the better. Even if more is required, why start a new furnace, claiming a major move, claiming a landing, to gamble on this dead end? Moreover, Japan has already clearly demonstrated the failure of its military offensive after more than two years, and the Japanese have already realized their failure. Therefore, recently, they have been desperately trying to end the so-called "China Incident" as their only national policy, and are exerting their full efforts on political and diplomatic offensives. So why did they suddenly invade Beihai again? Is it a disjointed national policy? Is it another launch of a military offensive? Does the political offensive also need a surprise attack? None of these. It is only because although this area is absolutely insufficient to cut off the transportation between Yunnan and Vietnam, it is very close and convenient to look at the Vietnamese border from here. It is a very good posture, and it is a flank attack in the diplomatic offensive.

If the Japanese army moves west from Beihai, it will be only a hundred kilometers away from the Vietnamese border. The closer it is to Vietnam, the more France will feel something. Japan regards France's sense of unease as a subtle diplomatic offensive. Indeed, France's largest rights and most concerned safety in the Far East are only Vietnam. Japan expects France to compromise with Japan in order to ensure the safety of Vietnam. Japan regards the Franco-Japanese compromise as one part of resolving the China Incident. France is fighting alongside Britain in Europe, and their interests are the same and their lives are shared. If France has to compromise with Japan, then Britain may be more accommodating to Japan because of its relationship with France. Japan regards Britain's accommodation of Japan as another part of resolving the China Incident. If Britain and France are close to Japan, it will be detrimental to Germany. The Soviet Union favors Germany because it is dissatisfied with Britain and France, and also prevents Japan from approaching Britain and France as much as possible because it favors Germany. Therefore, Japan is trying to coerce and entice Britain and France to make the Soviet Union closer to Japan for the sake of Germany. Japan regards the Soviet Union's closeness to Japan as another part of resolving the China Incident. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are all pursuing Japan, then Japan hopes that the justice advocated by the United States in the Far East will be isolated because it is too high-pitched and unpopular, and hopes that the United States will reduce its stance and forgive Japan because of isolation, that is, it will no longer take opposing Japanese aggression as its national policy. If the United States abandons its national policy of opposing aggression, Japan regards it as another part of resolving the China Incident. In short, Japan has its own one-sided verification, cleverly seizing and plundering, and striving to implement it. It is only because it has failed in its military offensive that it has supplemented it with political and diplomatic offensives. In the diplomatic offensive, it seeks to use various postures to win over the United States and manipulate Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Germany. Therefore, its every word and action, front and back, direct and indirect, effective and ineffective, is used to the extreme as long as it is related to winning over and manipulating. It claims to be pro-Soviet and pro-German, but its intention is to capture Britain and France. It regards Britain and France's concessions as nothing, and threatens them even more intensely, intending to thoroughly capture Britain and France. It captures Britain and France with strength, and then uses them to deal with the United States with gentleness. None of these strategies is very effective, but the point of Japan's disturbance is that it is persistent and will definitely pursue it regardless of whether it is effective or not. The large-scale landing in Beihai is a futile effort, but the meaning of the threat cannot be ignored.

### Sun Ke is Satisfied with His Visit to Britain; Britain's Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged; Sun Says the Soviet Union Will Continue to Aid China's Fight for Freedom Within the Scope of Neutrality

London: Before departing for Paris today, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, told a Reuters reporter that he was very satisfied with his trip to London. It is said that after meeting with British government officials, he was convinced that Britain fully understood China's position and there was no need to worry that Britain would change its policy toward China. The reason why the Chinese army has been relatively quiet in recent months is that it is not necessary to attempt large-scale military operations until the preparations that Chairman Chiang is committed to are completed. The Japanese side will then appreciate the actual situation of this preparation. Sun also mentioned the Soviet Union's interests in the Far East, saying that Stalin told him 18 months ago that the Soviet Union would take action when one of the following three conditions occurred: (1) if the League of Nations decided to take action; (2) if Britain, France, and the United States agreed to take joint action against Japan, the Soviet Union would join; or (3) if Japan attacked the Soviet Union. Although none of the above three conditions has been fulfilled at present, he believes that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China's fight for freedom within the scope of neutrality. (Dispatch from the 17th by Reuters)

London: Before returning to China, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, made a separate statement to reporters from the Associated Press, appealing to the United States to stop selling raw materials and strategic goods to Japan. Sun solemnly stated that the United States' assistance to Japan's invasion of China has increased its moral responsibility, because Britain and other countries have already reduced their exports to Japan due to wartime needs. Sun claimed, "If I were President Roosevelt, I would imply to Japan after the US-Japan trade treaty expires next January that they have stayed in China for too long. If Japan does not accept this implication, I will announce that the United States will terminate import and export business with Japan. The United States understands that the United States has nothing to fear from Japan, because Japan is already exhausted due to the war against China." It is well known that China regards the United States as its greatest friend. Sun Ke met with reporters at the Chinese Embassy in London, smoking cigarettes and talking about the general situation in the Far East. He said that China's minimum conditions for peace with Japan are that Japan withdraw all invading Japanese troops from China, and that Japan negotiate with China as an equal. Based on the above principles, China is prepared to reach agreements with Japan on economic and commercial issues. Sun avoided mentioning his conversations with British Foreign Secretary Halifax, Naval Minister Churchill, and other British leaders. He firmly denied that Britain had put pressure on China to negotiate peace with Japan. Sun claimed that the followers of Wang Jingwei "are mostly thugs." The Chongqing National Government is taking a calm approach to the organization of the "Nanjing Puppet Government" and the creation of a puppet army launched by the Japanese army and commanded by Wang Jingwei. When the puppet army is formed, they will abandon Wang and return to the righteous cause. Sun mentioned the close relationship between China and the Soviet Union, and said that the National Government has "complete trust in Moscow." He again denied the news reported by American newspapers that Soviet troops had been stationed in Xinjiang, and said, "There are no Soviet soldiers in Xinjiang Province." When a reporter asked what attitude the National Government would take if the Soviet Union attempted to turn Xinjiang Province into another Outer Mongolia under Soviet influence, Sun replied that he believed that the Soviet Union would never take such action against China, because that action would run counter to the wishes of the Soviet government and people. Therefore, that problem would not arise. Sun also said that the Soviet Union's treatment of Xinjiang is very different from what it has done in Outer Mongolia, because the Soviet Union has deeply rooted its influence in Outer Mongolia to resist Japan. Sun concluded by saying that the morale of the Japanese troops fighting in China is gradually declining, because they are eager to return home. Letters and diaries obtained from the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in battle by the Chinese side show that Japanese soldiers believe that the war against China is wasteful and fruitless.

### China and Britain Establish an Agreement; Open a China-Burma Air Route; The Agreement is Valid for Five Years; It Will Be Opened as Soon as the Situation Permits

London: The exchange of notes between the governments of China and Britain this year has now been announced. It is said that the Chinese government's proposal to open air services between Akyab in Burma or Rangoon and Kunming and to extend it to Hong Kong and Shanghai as soon as the situation permits has been accepted by the British government. The validity period of this agreement is five years. According to this plan, Chinese and British companies will jointly operate this route, but the British government will be responsible for discussing with the Chinese government the establishment of a Sino-British joint venture company after the end of the Sino-Japanese War to continue to develop this route and take over the business of the original company.

### Xinhua Daily Publishes an Article Welcoming the Enhancement of Sino-Soviet Relations; The Rumor of Discord Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is Absolutely Groundless; The Soviet Union is Still Providing Material Assistance to China

Chongqing: Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article today welcoming the enhancement of Sino-Soviet trade relations, saying that the enhancement of Sino-Soviet relations will crush the effect of "rumor attacks," and the enhancement of trade relations between the two countries will invalidate Japan's naval blockade. The newspaper also expressed its belief that Stalin and the Soviet Union will continue to provide active assistance to China. The rumors of discord between Chongqing and Moscow, or between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, are absolutely groundless. The newspaper concluded by saying that the Soviet Union is still providing material assistance to China, and although leaders of the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party may inevitably have differences of opinion from time to time, both sides recognize that only unity is in the best interests of the country.

Chongqing ‚Äì The news that the Vietnamese authorities have lifted restrictions on goods transported to China has been confirmed by the local Chamber of Commerce, which received an official notification from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.

### Germany Discloses War Aims: To Restore a Modified Polish State; British Opposition Demands Defined Policy; Parliament to Reopen at Month‚Äôs End for Full Discussion

London ‚Äì Both Houses of Parliament are scheduled to adjourn on the 23rd of this month and resume on the 28th. It is generally expected that a thorough debate on the overall situation of the war will take place, lasting approximately three days. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will also deliver a speech reporting on the international situation. Opposition members will also demand that the government explain its war aims in clearer terms, which will take up an entire day. (17th Havas)

London ‚Äì After Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon read Prime Minister Chamberlain's weekly report, Labour Party leader Attlee rose to speak, welcoming the Prime Minister's mention of Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, French Finance Minister Reynaud, and representatives of various autonomous territories visiting England. However, he stated that the discussions between the government and overseas guests had not defined the purpose of peace. Britain should now explain the purpose of peace in clearer terms. Britain is giving full consideration to the importance of peace plans and does not consider it too early. It is regrettable that the German government has rejected the peace appeals from the Netherlands and Belgium. The world hopes that the peaceful Netherlands and Belgium will not be drawn into the vortex. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, welcoming the economic and financial cooperation between Britain and France. He praised the Queen of the Netherlands for her courageous initiative in reaffirming the principles of reason and justice amidst the clouds of war. It is now very clear that the war was caused by Germany, and not by anyone forcing Hitler to fight. Britain should quickly provide assistance to the Netherlands and Belgium, as it is Britain's responsibility to protect their neutrality and freedom.

### Size of Poland‚Äôs Borders at Time of Restoration Can Shift with Circumstances

London ‚Äì Diplomatic circles here have been discussing war aims, and it is said that Foreign Secretary Halifax has stated that the main objective of the war is to achieve victory. At a time when the situation is constantly changing, other issues should not be considered for the time being. Regarding Poland, Prime Minister General Sikorski is currently in London for talks with British authorities. The future legal status and size of the country‚Äôs borders will depend on how the situation changes and how public opinion evolves. This has been fully understood, and no specific demands have been made. This shows his careful approach. One thing is certain: British authorities believe that Poland must be restored, as must Austria and Czechoslovakia. What cannot be predicted is the future legal status of the Czech and Slovak peoples, which will depend on how the situation evolves. In addition, political figures have also stated that the views of Central European countries are not as divergent as they were last year. Certain prejudices have been completely abandoned. This is very significant. For example, Czech leaders are no longer as opposed to the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria as they were before. Secondly, the Polish people are no longer as averse to the formation of a federation of certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe as they were before. In short, it is difficult to determine what basis the organization of a new Europe should be based on after the war. The British and French governments, apart from declaring that the people of Central and Eastern Europe must be freed from German control, are unwilling to accept any obligations. This is why Foreign Secretary Halifax only mentioned victory when discussing war aims. (17th Havas dispatch)

Today, the door to Soviet 'westward expansion' has been opened, and the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea, and even the Mediterranean Sea are threatened, which is regrettable.

### Japan's Overseas Shipping in a State of Decline; Affected by the War of Aggression Against China

Tokyo ‚Äì Japanese newspapers today openly admitted that Japan's attempt to take advantage of the situation to profit from shipping after the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident has failed. The reason is that the Sino-Japanese war has been prolonged, resulting in an insufficient allocation of ships. Because of the war against China, Japan must use most of its ships for military purposes, sailing along the Chinese coast. The construction of new cargo ships cannot be continued due to a shortage of raw materials. Since the outbreak of the European war, Japanese shipping companies have been thinking of ways to restore the Western shipping business that they abandoned due to the Sino-Japanese war. It is said that the Ship Control Committee has cooperated with the Ministry of Communications to formulate a plan. But since the outbreak of the European war, the number of ships sailing along the Japanese coast has not decreased, but increased by 29, while the number of ships sailing overseas has decreased by more than 7,000 tons.

### Shift in Japanese Policy: Seeking to Adjust Relations with the Soviet Union. Tokyo Talks Aim to Resolve Various Pending Issues First. Spokesperson Indicates Possibility of Concluding a Commercial Treaty

Tokyo: When the Foreign Ministry spokesperson received reporters this morning, some journalists used the sudden change in Japanese newspapers' attitude toward the Soviet Union as a topic of discussion. The spokesperson replied that since the Nomonhan armistice agreement was established, Japanese-Soviet relations had improved. The authorities and newspapers should naturally adopt an attitude that avoids unnecessary friction with the Soviet Union in this new situation. However, the government's policy of promoting good neighborly relations remains unchanged. Although the spokesperson could not announce the detailed content of the talks between Nomura and Smetanin, he knew that Wednesday's talks, translated by a single interpreter, lasted 50 minutes. It was impossible to discuss all pending issues in detail, but opinions must have been exchanged on various matters such as fishery problems. It is a common diplomatic practice for a new ambassador to discuss unresolved cases with the diplomatic authorities of the host country before presenting credentials. Smetanin is scheduled to formally present his credentials to the Japanese Emperor on November 20, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also mentioned that he did not know what procedures would be adopted to resolve the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, but since the Nomonhan Incident had been resolved, other issues could be handled. Everything depends on future negotiations, so it is too early to talk about future events today, the spokesperson said. An American reporter asked the spokesperson whether, at this time, Japan was optimistic about future negotiations with the Soviet Union despite past experiences. The spokesperson replied that he hoped to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, in which case the current situation between Japan and the Soviet Union would definitely improve with the establishment of the Nomonhan armistice agreement. In response to another question from an American reporter, the spokesperson vehemently denied rumors that Germany was mediating to bring Japan and the Soviet Union closer. Nomura and Smetanin are not currently discussing non-aggression. Japan is currently only implementing a good neighborly policy toward the Soviet Union and hopes to adjust relations between the two countries. If this can be realized, it will definitely contribute to peace and order in East Asia. The spokesperson continued that the two sides will only discuss issues directly related to Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is not impossible to avoid discussing the issue of China's "boots" during the discussions. At this point, another reporter asked whether the Japanese-Soviet negotiations would begin with the conclusion of a commercial treaty. In his reply, the spokesperson mentioned Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's remarks on the matter and said that if the Soviet Union had this intention, he saw no reason why Japan should not begin negotiations to conclude a Japanese-Soviet commercial treaty. The absence of a commercial treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union has been an anomaly in relations between the two countries. Someone asked whether Japan wanted to conclude a Japanese-Soviet commercial treaty to offset the adverse effects of the abrogation of the 1911 Japanese-American commercial treaty. The spokesperson replied in the negative, saying that the United States' abrogation of the 1911 Japanese-American commercial treaty was unfortunate, but Japan's good neighborly policy had not changed, so Japan would strive to adjust its relations with the United States when the atmosphere was right. A Soviet reporter asked whether the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border issue would be addressed following the resolution of the Nomonhan issue. The spokesperson replied that all pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, including the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border issue, would be raised for discussion. Regarding the establishment of a "new central government" in China, the spokesperson said that the various arrangements and preparations for the establishment of a "new central government of China" were proceeding smoothly, but he did not know when it would be established.

Chongqing: People here are paying close attention to the news of the Soviet-Japanese talks in Tokyo and Moscow. It is widely believed that both sides are eager to reach a compromise to avoid armed conflict in the future. There are two reasons why Japan is willing to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union: (1) to concentrate all its forces to resolve the war against China, and approximately move most of the troops and air force currently stationed in Manchuria to various front lines in China; (2) to prevent the Soviet Union from aiding China, while the Soviet Union also wants peace on the Manchurian border, so that it can devote its full efforts to developments in Europe. However, it is believed that the Soviet Union may reach a compromise with Japan on various pending issues between the two countries, while at the same time continuing to provide material assistance to China. (Reuter, 17th)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers continue to comment on the talks between Soviet Ambassador Smetanin and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura on Wednesday afternoon with sympathetic tones. "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that this meeting had special significance. At that time, Nomura stated the Japanese side's wishes regarding fishery issues, claiming that although Japan did not oppose conducting negotiations on other matters simultaneously in Tokyo and Moscow, Japan wished to hold negotiations on fishery issues in Tokyo and was willing to conclude a fishery agreement with a term of eight years, so as to avoid the labor of negotiating temporary measures every year and pave the way for the restoration of normal relations. If the Soviet Union showed a cooperative attitude toward Japan's efforts to establish a "New Order in East Asia," it would be even easier to restore normal relations. "Hochi Shimbun" expressed delight at the initiation of Japanese-Soviet talks, but said that there were reports that Britain and the United States were obstructing them, because democratic countries believed that close Japanese-American relations might result in direct or indirect assistance to Germany. In fact, Japanese-Soviet relations have a direct relationship with peace in the Far East. If the Japanese-Soviet border issue is not resolved, border conflicts are likely to escalate into a major war. "Chugai Commercial News" stated that the improvement of Japanese-Soviet relations was a cause for celebration. (Reuter, 17th)

Guilin: A certain section chief who has just returned from the front gave a recap of the Battle of Northern Hunan at a reception for reporters this afternoon, believing that it was the largest and most fruitful battle since the War of Resistance. He pointed out the confirmed number of Japanese losses. Regarding the tactics used by the Chinese army, the officer referred to it as "new tactics" and gave a brief explanation, saying that it was the culmination of combat experience over the past two years. The content was nothing more than taking advantage of good battlefields, good opportunities, and mobile strikes against the Japanese. All things within the battlefield that could be used by the Japanese were pre-arranged for certain procedures. Under this new tactic, the traditional Japanese strategies, such as "separate advances and joint attacks," "outflanking and encirclement," "wedge-shaped breakthroughs," and "deep tactics," were all shattered without a trace. All traditional tactics have been overturned, and the main "spirit of attack" in combat is restricted by space. Due to the difficulty of supplies, there is a "famine in battle" and a "physical famine," which also led to a slump, etc. (Note: Deep tactics is a Russian military term.) (16th dispatch)

Chongqing: The central government has effective measures for the surplus of food in the war zone provinces.

### British Imperial Aircraft Forced to Land on Weizhou Island, Pilot and Mail Detained by Japanese Army, Three Passengers Arrive in Hong Kong from Guangzhou, But Japanese Consul in Hong Kong Still Makes Strong Excuses and Evasions

Hong Kong Correspondence: The British Imperial Airways aircraft "Dardanus" flew from Hong Kong to Bangkok on the morning of the 8th. When flying near Weizhou Island, Japan dispatched three aircraft to pursue it. A bullet hit its fuel tank, causing it to make a forced landing. The three passengers and two pilots were taken back to Guangzhou by the Japanese aircraft. The passengers arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the American warship "Mindanao" at around 4:00 PM on the 10th. After the passengers returned to Hong Kong, they were interrogated by the naval authorities and gave a detailed report of the incident before going to rest at the Peninsula Hotel. Imperial Airways plans to send a special plane on the morning of the 11th to pick them up and fly them westward.

Announcement by the British Authorities

On the evening of the 10th, the Hong Kong naval authorities issued the following announcement regarding the British Imperial Airways aircraft "Dardanus" incident: "Three passengers of the 'Dardanus' have arrived in Hong Kong. The two pilots of the aircraft and the mail are being detained by the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. According to the passengers, they heard machine gun fire before realizing that they were being attacked by Japanese aircraft. Japanese bullets pierced both wings and the framework of the aircraft, but fortunately no deaths or injuries occurred. There were three or more Japanese aircraft involved in the attack. The Imperial Airways aircraft was forced to land. The pilots of the Imperial Airways aircraft did not want to land on the sea, so they landed on Weizhou Island. The group spent the night on the island and were then taken to Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft along with the pilots and mail. The passengers arrived in Hong Kong this afternoon on the American ship 'Mindanao'."

Japanese Consul Tries to Evade Responsibility

Regarding the forced landing of the Imperial Airways aircraft on Weizhou Island, the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong issued the following statement: "At 10:00 AM on the 8th, an unidentified aircraft appeared in the sky over Weizhou Island. It happened to be encountered by three Japanese naval aircraft on a reconnaissance flight in the same area. The Japanese naval aircraft pursued and threatened it, and opened fire. The aircraft was hit by several bullets and was forced to land on Weizhou Island. After investigation, it was found to be an Imperial Airways aircraft. The two British pilots and three passengers (one each from the United States, Norway, and Iran) were all safe and sound. The above five people were sent to Guangzhou by naval aircraft on the 9th, and arrived in Hong Kong by boat from Guangzhou on the 10th. Regarding the issue of flights over Weizhou Island, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly notified all parties concerned. On January 25, the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou, Okazaki, notified the consuls of various countries that if aircraft of third countries fly into the area of Japanese aircraft operations, they should notify in advance the time of take-off and landing, the route, and detailed information, and the altitude must be below 500 meters. If these procedures are not followed and damage occurs, Japan cannot be held responsible. On February 1, Consul General Okazaki again notified all countries that Japan had occupied Weizhou Island and that the island was within Japanese military operations. Aircraft of third countries flying within a 15-nautical-mile radius of the island should notify in advance. On February 3, the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong notified Imperial Airways, China Aviation, and Eurasia Aviation of this matter. The companies did not agree to Japan's request regarding altitude, but promised to fly 20 miles from the island. The Imperial Airways aircraft flew over the island on the 8th. On November 6, the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong inquired with Imperial Airways, and the company replied that it was flying on the original route. Unexpectedly, this incident occurred two days later."

### Chairman Chiang Issues Strict Order to Balance Prices in Chongqing, Regulations Added for Rice, Oil, and Fuel, Price Increases in Violation of Order Will Be Punished with Imprisonment

Chongqing Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, because unscrupulous merchants in the southwestern provinces are manipulating prices, causing the people in the rear to feel great hardship, has decided to adopt the most severe and effective methods to regulate them. In addition to personally instructing the Ministry of Economic Affairs to make overall plans, Chongqing, as the wartime capital, should be organized first as a model. The Chongqing Municipal Price Evaluation Committee was ordered to hold a joint meeting of various agencies. After discussion, according to statistical figures, a reasonable method was adopted. First, the three most important items related to the people's livelihood, coal, rice, and oil, were selected. After consulting with the relevant commercial associations, a profit was added in addition to the cost. It was specifically stipulated that the market price on November 2 should be the highest standard. Without special reasons and approval, no unauthorized increase is allowed. Otherwise, a fine of up to 1,000 yuan or imprisonment of up to one year will be imposed.

The order will be enforced, and there will be no leniency. As for the remaining industries, another meeting will be held to formulate regulations. Regarding the coal item in the resolution, the standard price will be announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. For rice and oil, the market price on the 2nd of this month will be used. The total cost of high-quality rice is 14 yuan, 2 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li per dan, and the standard price is set at 16 yuan. The total cost of vegetable oil is 6 jiao and 2 fen per catty, and the standard price is set at 6 jiao and 6 fen. The prices of essential items in Chongqing were originally relatively fair compared to Kunming and Guiyang. After this restriction, the lives of the people in the rear will be more stable. If other places can follow suit, it will definitely achieve great results in consolidating the rear.

### Japanese Aircraft and Warships Frenziedly Invade Southern Guangdong, All Districts in the Southern Route and Guangxi Are Harassed, Japanese Warships Traverse the Seas off Dianbai

Guangzhou Bay Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong Province have recently sent a fleet to harass the Southern Route on a large scale. Yangjiang, Dianbai, and the prefectures of Qinzhou and Lianzhou have all been ravaged. The Japanese aircraft carrier "Kaga" even sneaked into the sea off Weizhou Island at the end of last month. The aircraft carrier carried more than 70 aircraft, and the auxiliary aircraft carrier "Pengniao" was also hidden there. Dianbai, Hepu, Qinxian, Lingshan in Guangdong Province, and Wuming, Nanning in Guangxi Province have all been indiscriminately bombed. The details are recorded below:

Indiscriminate Bombing of Qinzhou and Lianzhou

Large teams of Japanese warships have been passing through the Leizhou Strait every day. Each team has more than ten ships, either sailing west or east, with unpredictable traces and cunning plans. According to reports, the number of Japanese warships in the sea off Qinzhou and Lianzhou has gradually decreased, while the sea off Yangjiang and Dianbai is crowded with Japanese warships. It is expected that the Japanese deliberately moved them to the left and right to confuse the observers. On the morning of the 1st of this month, two Japanese warships were anchored off Guanxianling in Hepu. At around 1:00 PM, one of them suddenly approached Beihai and patrolled back and forth in the area of Dijiao Nanhuan. Before long, it sailed to about 400 meters from the shore and fired hundreds of machine guns, indiscriminatelyÊâ´Â∞Ñ at the shore. The Chinese defenders calmly prepared themselves, but the Japanese warship hesitated for about 20 minutes before returning to its original position. At 2:10, seven Japanese aircraft took off from the Japanese aircraft carrier off Weizhou Island. After circling GuanÈ†≠Â∂∫ for a while, they went straight to Beihai, dispersed to reconnoiter, and then reunited and flew northwest. When theyÁ™úÊäµ Luku, they indiscriminately dropped four bombs, two fell in the suburbs, and two fell in a certain market, destroying eight houses and slightly injuring an old woman. After the Japanese aircraft showed their ferocity, they continued to fly to Lingshan County, wantonlyËÇÜËôê, dropping a total of seven bombs. A bomb also landed at a certain middle school, and more than ten civilian houses were destroyed. This was the third time the county had been bombed. At around 3:00 PM, the Japanese aircraft fled in two teams, one team rushed to Wuli and dropped five bombs, and the other team flew to Jiuzhou, a town in Hepu County, and dropped two bombs. Both places are small market towns with no military facilities. The Japanese aircraft are ferocious and make people grit their teeth. Fortunately, the people were evacuated in advance, so the losses were minimal. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, a Japanese aircraft flew along the coast of Hepu for reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs.

Repeatedly Harassing Guangxi Province

At around 2:00 PM, another nine Japanese aircraft crossed Taipu andÁ™úÂÖ• Guangxi Province. At 1:00 PM, they dropped more than ten bombs in Wuming, most of which fell in the suburbs. The Japanese aircraft then turned and flew to Nanning, dropping another twelve or thirteen bombs, destroying many civilian houses, but there were very few civilian casualties. At the same time, another third batch of four Japanese aircraft attacked Beihai, dropping twelve bombs, most of which fell near Tangzaicun, destroying more than ten houses and killing or wounding several people. By 4:00 PM, the various batches of Japanese aircraft had flew south to the sea one after another.

ÁÇÆÊàò in Dianbai

Japanese warships invaded Yangjiang on October 30, and then moved to Dianbai,ÈÄ°Â∑° and reconnoitering in the area of Liantouling and Bohai Port, and repeatedly sent speedboats to measure the water volume. After nightfall, they frequently used searchlights to illuminate the shore. At around 8:00 PM, they fired many shells to bombard the county town. Bombs fell on the county government and in the county. At around 9:00 PM, the Japanese warships on the sea again fired shells to bombard Bohai Port, and most of the shells fell into the sea. A few shells fell on the shore, destroying only a few civilian ships, and there were no other losses. The people, seeing the Japanese warships acting likeÁñØ, feared that they would land on a large scale, and evacuated overnight. Local teams were also mobilized to prepare for any eventuality. At around 5:00 AM on the 1st of this month, the stars were shining and the sound of artillery began again. Five Japanese warships jointly fired artillery to bombard Dianbai County, Liantouling, Bohai Port, and other places. The Chinese artillery also returned fire and resisted. The fierce battle lasted for a long time before it stopped. After investigation, the Chinese military positions were undamaged, but many civilian houses wereÊÉ®ÈÅ≠ destroyed. At around 9:00 AM, eighteen Japanese aircraft flew in from overseas in four batches, two in the first batch, six in the second batch, six in the third batch, and seven in the fourth batch, taking turns dropping dozens of bombs on the county town and Bohai Port. The county government, county middle school, party headquarters, and chamber of commerce were heavily bombed, and the prosperous streets were turned into rubble. Forty or fifty houses were destroyed, but fortunately the people had been evacuated earlier, so there were not many casualties. On the morning of the 2nd, the number of Japanese warships in the sea continued to increase, for a total of eight, and more than 20 armed fishing boats and small and large speedboats traversed the sea. At around 9:00 AM, several of the Japanese warships fired more than ten shells to bombard the county town again. The Chinese army doubled its defenses and did not return fire. The situation in Yangjiang and Dianbai is extremely serious, but the Chinese army has made considerable preparations, and it is difficult for the Japanese army to succeed.

### European Wartime March - Special Correspondence from London - The British Empire Enters the War

‚Äî Uncle Di

Where is the way out?

The first way out should be a thorough naval blockade. Just a few days after the outbreak of the war, all German merchant ships had disappeared from the world's oceans. From this, one can imagine the power of the British Navy. However, this kind of blockade will certainly not have a significant effect in the short term. To make it have a significant effect, it will probably take at least three or two years. Therefore, Britain's slogan today is to prepare for three years of war. However, there is a major problem here. Even though Germany has been blockaded, it can still obtain supplies from the Soviet Union, Italy, and various neutral countries. Britain absolutely cannot tolerate this abnormal situation for a long time, and countermeasures are currently being discussed. The most difficult issue is still the Soviet Union's supply, and Britain has almost no way to deal with this. If the Soviet Union turns against Germany one day and cuts off supplies, then, in order to achieve its war aims, Britain is fully prepared to immediately blockade the Mediterranean and all ports of neutral countries trading with Germany, and strictly enforce the provisions of international law regarding the prohibition of contraband; it is not even afraid to risk causing Italy to enter the war.

Secondly, in the current situation of absolute naval superiority of Britain and France over Germany and Italy, Britain and France have a great advantage in the war that has just begun, that is, in the course of this war, the threat of Germany at sea can be said to be fundamentally eliminated. What is the meaning of this? First, it means that Britain and France can use the vast resources of overseas colonies to engage in a long-term war, a war of attrition, with Germany; second, they can take this opportunity to train the vast manpower of the colonies. The manpower under British rule is about 400 million people; the manpower under French rule is about 60 million people. The lack of manpower was originally the biggest fatal injury to Britain and France against Germany, and they plan to seek a thorough remedy for this shortcoming in the prolonged war process. If Germany still cannot achieve a decisive victory during this period, then the comparative situation of manpower advantages and disadvantages will immediately reverse. Regarding how much time is needed to train people to maturity, this is currently a military secret. However, we can infer from the example of the United States during the last European war that it takes at least half a year to train an ordinary person into a complete soldier, and at least one year to become a junior officer. Even if Britain and France speed up, they probably won't be able to shorten it much. This path is the most fundamental and reliable path for Britain and France, but it is also a relatively distant one. But we all know that the theory that Germany regards as a classic is the so-called blitzkrieg. If the war cannot be ended midway at that time, then it may use the same tactics to deal with France as it is currently using to deal with Poland. If that happens, just militarily speaking, France's situation is probably also very critical. However, then again, if France's situation is critical, then the country that feels anxious because of it is probably not just Britain alone. - That is how the British authorities are calculating.

Either Britain and France will win, or the United States will eventually join the war. Either Britain and France will win, or there will be a final conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany. - That is also how the British and French authorities are calculating.

Precisely because the situation is like this, if Britain and France stubbornly fight on, so that Hitler cannot stop at any cost, then, in the end, Germany only has one way to step down, which is to accept the conditions of Britain and France and end the war. - This is what the current third path of Britain is thought of.

But what if Germany really forms an "alliance" with the Soviet Union? The major premise is that the British authorities absolutely do not believe that this will happen. The emergence of such a strange thing must have two prerequisites: first, the capitalist countries, except Germany, jointly besiege the Soviet Union; second, Germany falls into a situation similar to the end of the last European war, with the whole country crying out for food. Therefore, the current task of Britain and France is, first of all, to no longer mention the slogan of the anti-"Bolshevik" crusade, and secondly, to try to avoid the increase of the so-called "reddening" trend in Germany as much as possible.

Finally, when I end this article, I have to take the opportunity to express my personal impression of Britain's decisive measures and estimates this time. My impression is: on the part of the public, because of the long-term training of democratic rule, the general sense of responsibility is very well-developed. If this continues, no matter how long the war is, or how bitter the process is, it probably will never lead to major domestic unrest; on the part of the authorities, because the "Parliament" almost exists like a vice-government, therefore, unexpected achievements are of course impossible for every decision, but at the same time, the crisis of unexpected major mistakes is also removed. These two points should be the two most advantageous characteristics of Britain's war against the German Nazi regime. In the short term, of course, it will not be felt; but if the war drags on, in my opinion, their role will accumulate day by day and show day by day.

A war that is a true purely military failure is something for which it is difficult to find a precedent in history.

### Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River - Pig Boats Robbed - Losses of 50,000 Yuan

Correspondent from Rugao: Hog breeding is a major side business for farmers in this county. It is estimated that 300,000 to 400,000 hogs are shipped to Shanghai for sale each year. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, about 1,000 live hogs, worth more than 40,000 yuan, were loaded onto four civilian boats at Xinsheng Port and towed by the Japanese ship Tianrui Maru to Shanghai for sale. On the evening of the 11th, while sailing near Liuhe, two bandit boats suddenly floated over, with more than 40 people inside. They opened fire with guns and ordered the boats to stop. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Tianrui Maru cut the four cables and fled. The bandits rushed onto the four pig boats, forced them to sail into Liuhe, confiscated the hogs, and searched all the boat crews and hog merchants, taking all cash, watches, and clothing. The total loss is estimated to be about 50,000 yuan. One hog merchant, who was a little slow in his movements, was shot and killed. By dawn on the 15th, more than 40 people were released. Two boats with larger loads were still being held, and it was claimed that money had to be prepared to redeem them.

### The Ministry of Education Seeks Ways to Help Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China

Chongqing, 17th - The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education reported that recently, due to the anti-Chinese discrimination in Siam, many schools established by our overseas Chinese in Siam have been destroyed. Taking Bangkok alone, there are three closed secondary schools, resulting in 700 junior and senior high school students and even more primary school students losing their studies. Many do not want to drop out of school midway and return to China in the hope of transferring to another school. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, overseas Chinese residing in British and French territories in Hong Kong and Nanyang have also been sending their children back to China to study. Currently, there are three to four hundred overseas Chinese students who have arrived in Kunming and other places. If no measures are taken to help them, they will lose their studies. The Executive Yuan believes that overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the motherland, and the government should take measures to help their children who have lost their studies in order to strengthen their feelings of love for the motherland. It is studying appropriate measures to provide assistance.

### Education Briefs

### Grains A Certain Party and Speculators Are Both Disrupting the People's Food Supply Rice Prices Rise Higher and Higher Mostly Because the Source is Being Choked

Since the sudden rise in the rice market some time ago, the increase became even more intense yesterday. Because the inland sources are being obstructed and made difficult by a certain party. If the goods from Jing, Wu, and Jiangbei, etc., have long been out of stock, also the goods from Chang, Xi, and Songjiang are also often reported to be cut off. Only the goods from the Sujia Road area are arriving in an endless stream. The rice in Shanghai has been depleted in warehouses and stores since the food panic this summer. When the new harvest emerged, the intention was to accumulate stocks, but transportation became a problem, and it was constantly obstructed, making it difficult to achieve substantial results. According to the investigation in the previous month, the maximum amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses was less than 200,000 bags. Since then, the sources have become increasingly scarce and as sales continue daily, the amount of rice stored in the warehouses is gradually decreasing. According to the most recent investigation, the total amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses is only about 100,000 bags. Recently, only 3,000 to 5,000 bags of goods arrive in various districts each day, which is often not enough to meet demand. Yesterday, the shipments arriving by wheel transport included nine carts from Su, Tong, Kun, and Tai, eleven or twelve carts of goods from Qing, Si, Feng, and Jia, and one or two thousand bags of Changbang goods transferred from Baimao Estuary, totaling only three or four thousand bags. This prompted speculators to believe that it was a time to make profits. Before the market opened yesterday, the hoarders had already inquired about prices in order to avoid missing the opportunity. As a result, general merchants, seeing this situation, all regarded their goods as rare and were unwilling to sell them easily, further increasing their holding power. When the market opened, the hoarders began to buy in large quantities, and the market price immediately increased by one yuan. Those who entered the market did not flinch because of the high price; on the contrary, they became more and more aggressive. Their local stores competed to catch up, and there were also inland supporters adding to the mix. This created a very sharp market atmosphere that is difficult to describe. Consequently, the prices of all goods soared in this commotion. Among all the goods, glutinous rice was the most popular, because the goods in the market were limited, and general wine merchants were in urgent need of it during the brewing season. The food vendors and snack shops, seeing the soaring rice prices, became even more panicked and also bought in preparation, resulting in a huge increase of two or three yuan. The closing price of Changbang Chenyuan was thirty-four yuan, Xinyuan was thirty-two or thirty-three yuan, and Qingjiao Fenjia Yinyuan was thirty-one or thirty yuan. The price of Kejian was definitely the lowest, and the goods in the market were scarce. Under the interest of both retail and wholesale dealers, they were quickly sold out. At closing, the highest price of Jiangbei Jian was twenty-nine and a half yuan, and the lowest was twenty-eight yuan six or seven jiao, a sharp increase of one yuan and a half from the previous market. Other varieties such as Xinjing and Luyangjian were also not inferior to Kejian, but because there were more goods in the market, the price increase was not as comparable, increasing by more than one yuan. Changtejing had already opened at thirty-three and a half yuan, and the lowest had already opened at twenty-nine and a half yuan. Nangang early rice was twenty-nine yuan six or seven jiao. The highest price of Luyangjian was around thirty yuan, and the lower price was close to twenty-nine yuan. Only Yaolu Green Seed, because of its wet and soft body, was not easy to keep for a long time, and was slightly inferior, increasing by only four or five jiao to six or seven jiao. Statistics showed that the total transaction volume in the city was no less than 20,000 bags.

Kejian has already been grasped in the hands of Japanese merchants, who not only do not sell, but also show signs of increasing their purchases. Moreover, it is heard that the 100,000 passports held by Japanese retail merchants have not yet been effective for transportation. Therefore, the local market price of Wu rice does not rise with the Shanghai market. However, the Shanghai market is even more bullish, and the transaction of foreign rice has no impact. Compared with the previous day, it has increased by a huge one yuan four or five jiao, while the transaction volume is still only more than 3,000 bags.

After the transaction of 2,400 tons of foreign rice, another 500 tons were negotiated, and several other transactions are still in contact. However, foreign merchants are no longer willing to set prices according to the previous offer. It is said that Japanese merchants are inquiring in Saigon, so subsequent transactions will require one or two. Therefore, there has been no continuation to formal transactions.

### Flour Mills Reduce Production Oil and Rice are Both Expensive The Mindset of the Various Mills Remains Firm

The flour market has not escaped the state of decline, and sales have not seen development. Local sales are also not improving due to the dumping of inland flour. However, the prices of rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, and bran have all been expensive in recent days, so the mindset of the various mills has inevitably become firm. Therefore, the original offer of seven yuan and two jiao for No. 2 flour is maintained, while the sales of returned goods vary because of the difference between foreign warehouses and mill warehouses. It is heard that the price of car and boat branded warehouse receipts was sold yesterday for seven yuan one jiao seven or eight fen. The price of paoche flour needs to be increased by a few fen to one jiao compared to the mill price. The total transaction volume in the city is more than 30,000 bags, and the market can be said to be tired but stable. On the 18th, 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.

Furthermore, it is reported that the flour manufacturers in this city have recently been facing sluggish local sales, and miscellaneous branded flour produced by various inland mills is being hawked in Shanghai and dumped along the Yangtze River, causing flour prices to be easy to fall but difficult to rise. Meanwhile, wheat prices are expensive and costs are quite high. It is heard that the Fuxin and Fufeng mills have already reduced production internally, restricting production. When the flour market develops in the future, they will then process and manufacture again.

The source of wheat continues to be scarce, but the stock is sufficient. Some cargo owners are willing to sell at market prices, while the hoarders have more stable minds, so there has been no major up or down. The total city hoarders handled four or five cars, and the mills handled four or five thousand bags. The market is similar to the previous opening.

### Sugar Market High Quality Cotton Raw Sugar Opens at Forty-Three Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market association set the prices. The spot prices of coarse white sugar 24 fluctuated little. The price in local warehouses was 51 yuan, the price of new goods in foreign warehouses was 52.5 yuan, and the price of old goods was 51.5 yuan to 51 yuan 2 jiao. The price of transshipped goods rose by 5 jiao to 41.5 yuan. The price of Taikoo car white sugar remained unchanged. The price of Tung Tak B Mark was 55.5 yuan, the price of West Warehouse 56 yuan, the price of H Mark car raw sugar 40.5 yuan, and the price of Dutch raw sugar 42 yuan, all up by half a yuan. The price of local refined white sugar rose the same amount. The price of Zhenji No. 1 was 51.5 yuan, No. 2 was 51 yuan, No. 3 was 50.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 50 yuan. The price of local No. 1 rock sugar was 62 yuan, and the price of Jingming rock sugar was 63.5 yuan. Shantou cotton raw sugar has been lacking supply for a long time, and the market is quiet. Now, 100 bags of Fugui brand high-quality cotton raw sugar have been opened, priced at 43 yuan, which is already more prominent than before. There were some transactions of Chaoqing sugar, and the price was slightly looser.

### Oil Market Bean Oil and Raw Oil Race Each Other Bean Oil Has Already Overtaken Raw Oil Buying and Selling Still Escapes Into the Football Business The Result Will Be That the Public Has No Oil to Eat

The soaring price of bean oil in recent days is also rare. Usually, raw oil is more expensive than bean oil, with a difference of about one jiao per door sale. But as of yesterday, even bean oil has exceeded Jiangbei raw oil by five jiao. It seems that bean oil and raw oil are racing each other, one rising and the other rising high. The general public will have no oil to eat. Yesterday, the price of barrel bean oil was slightly looser, but the result was still a yuan higher than the market on the previous day. The price of basket oil was raised by another one and a half yuan. Although the current general situation appears to be rising without end, buying and selling does not escape the scope of kicking the football. Therefore, the potential softened slightly in the afternoon, and it would not be surprising if the city turned into a spiral. Yesterday, the transaction volume of Dalian oil was 30 barrels, priced at 78.5 yuan. The transaction volume of Qingdao oil was 60 barrels, priced at 74.7 yuan and 75 yuan. The transaction volume of Yanqi oil was 50 pieces, priced at 58 yuan. The transaction volume of Qingqi oil was 100 pieces, priced at 57 yuan.

### Japanese Troops Plan to Build an Airfield in Yuepu, Shortages of Funds and Materials May Hinder Success

Dingjiaqiao, located about three li south of Yuepu Town in Baoshan, is a small rural town that connects Wusong to the south and Shizilin and Liuhekou to the north. Recently, Japanese troops planned to build a military airfield near Dingjiaqiao. The size and construction of the airfield are similar to those of the Dachang airfield. Inside the airfield, there are four runways for aircraft takeoffs and landings, each 2,000 meters long and 200 meters wide. The runway surface is paved with a mixture of cement and sand. The airfield was contracted to a Japanese individual who is not very familiar with heavy construction, resulting in a delay in the start of construction. It is said that he recently obtained the help of a Chinese foreman who had previously been involved in the construction of the Dachang airfield. Construction is expected to begin soon. It is estimated that the construction cost of the airfield will be around one million. However, due to the Japanese military's severe economic difficulties and shortage of raw materials, it is feared that the construction will not be completed within the year.

Two Japanese Soldiers Killed in Shijiaxiang

In Shijiaxiang, Hongqiao, west of Shanghai, a truck loaded with rice and escorted by two Japanese soldiers was ambushed on the morning of the previous day.

### Agreement Reached for the Purchase of Tribute Rice; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Statistics Indicate a Decline in Rice Prices; Government Rice Storage Is Underway

Recently, the weather has turned cold, making transportation difficult. Although there is no concern about the continuous supply of government rice, the quantity has slightly decreased compared to previous days. The market sentiment is buoyant, and rice prices have risen slightly. The rice industry associations are urging traders to make every effort to transport rice and plan to increase reserves. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's report, rice prices have already declined due to the abundant harvest in most rice-producing areas and the increased ease of transporting rice to Shanghai from various locations. Last month, Japonica rice decreased by 8.58%, Indica rice decreased by 16.98%, and glutinous rice decreased by 3.32%. Currently, various rice merchants are jointly purchasing foreign rice to store in Shanghai. Details are as follows:

Purchasing Foreign Rice

Various rice merchants in the city believe that the rice shortage in Shanghai has passed. However, to prepare for unforeseen circumstances and increase reserves, they are not only making every effort to purchase and transport rice from domestic rice-producing areas but also jointly ordering foreign rice from Saigon and other places to store in Shanghai. They have already commissioned Da Fu Foreign Firm to negotiate and purchase 500 tons from Saigon, equivalent to about 5,000 bags. The foreign rice has already been loaded and shipped and is expected to arrive within a week. It is said that the quality of this foreign rice is quite good, and its selling price is similar to the current highest selling price of white rice in Shanghai.

Making Every Effort to Transport Rice

There is no concern about a shortage of food for the entire population of Shanghai. Although reserves are not increasing, there is no concern about the continuous supply of domestic rice. Currently, about 5,000 to 6,000 bags of rice are transported to Shanghai daily by water and land from various ports in the north and south. The sales of Japonica rice are sluggish, and the price is stable. The purchase of domestic rice for storage in Shanghai is being carried out separately by various organizations. Special commissioners have been appointed to liaise with various traders, urge them to make every effort to transport rice, and the Market Management Committee is responsible for finding ways to suppress rice prices.

### Affected by the European War, Overseas Chinese in France Return to Shanghai; The First Batch of More Than 150 People Will Return to Their Hometowns; France Is Actively Preparing for War, and Industries Are Affected

Since the outbreak of the German-Polish war, followed by the implementation of military action against Germany by Britain and France, various countries have been actively preparing for war. The state of war has spread throughout Europe. Most of the overseas Chinese residing in various European countries are engaged in business. Due to the impact of various countries' preparations for war, their businesses have been greatly affected. In the past month, many overseas Chinese residing in Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands have been forced to return to their countries due to sluggish business. Most of the overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian provinces have gone to Southeast Asia after arriving in Hong Kong to seek other means of livelihood. On the 14th of this month, the Italian postal ship Conte Verde arrived in Shanghai from Europe, carrying more than 150 overseas Chinese from Wenzhou and Qingtian in Zhejiang Province who had been residing in France. This is the first large-scale return of unemployed overseas Chinese since the European war.

The French Government Actively Prepares for War

According to a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency who interviewed the returning overseas Chinese, most of the overseas Chinese who came to Shanghai this time were residing in France, and some were engaged in business in Belgium. They were all engaged in the Western clothing industry and other small businesses. Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, France has been actively preparing for war. All able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 48 must be conscripted into military service. Therefore, the male partners in the original stores have successively joined the military service, and the affairs in the stores are generally handled by women. At the same time, due to the implementation of lighting control in Paris at night, the business hours of various stores have gradually been shortened, and business has been greatly affected invisibly. Recently, the French government authorities, in order to prohibit the export of able-bodied men, stipulated that from October 1st, all foreign residents in France who wish to export must have an export permit before they can leave the country.

Sluggish Business Forces Them to Return Home

Although the various stores run by overseas Chinese are not affected by the French government's conscription and have not reduced the number of employees, they are facing difficulties in importing goods due to France's implementation of control over various import and export goods. In addition, the business hours are gradually shortened, and the business has become sluggish, and income has been greatly reduced. Moreover, the French people have a strange feeling that the stores run by overseas Chinese are still managed by men. Therefore, the overseas Chinese engaged in business have been hit in both spirit and material. At the same time, if the war officially breaks out and they cannot leave the country, they will encounter various difficulties. Therefore, they decided to close down their stores and return to their countries from France. This time, they departed from France on September 29th, and the journey took one and a half months. Each person spent about 1,000 yuan on travel expenses. Currently, they have no jobs to seek in Shanghai and are preparing to return to their hometowns after transportation arrangements are made.

### Moganshan Still Under the Control of Chinese Troops

Wukang County Magistrate Manages Civil Affairs; Japanese Troops Have Completely Disappeared from the Mountain

According to Moganshan residents who recently came to Shanghai, most of the foreign residents in the summer resort area did not go there this summer due to the war. Only a few dozen people went to the mountain, less than one-tenth of the number in previous years. However, the situation of local peace and prosperity is exactly the same as before the war. The mountain is surrounded by Chinese guerrilla forces, and the Japanese troops cannot cross the boundary. In previous years, Japanese troops would occasionally climb the mountain for patrols, but this year they have completely disappeared. Although there are occasional encounters between the two sides at the foot of the mountain, the guerrilla forces have always been able to repel the Japanese troops each time. Currently, all civil affairs on the mountain are still managed by the Wukang County Magistrate appointed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. He is very capable and efficient. Although he is stationed in a certain place ten miles away from the mountain, the order on the mountain is well-maintained and extremely effective. The property of both Chinese and foreign residents has been fully protected and has not been damaged at all.

In the past, the National Government, in order to unify the names of bonds and exchange and compensate for various old securities, the Ministry of Finance issued unified public bonds of the Republic of China in 1936 with a total amount of 146 million yuan. Regarding the eighth installment of principal and interest, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has been carrying out lottery drawings in five months starting from August this year. The winning numbers of the four types of bonds, A, B, C, and D, have all been drawn.

The lottery drawing for E-type bonds has been scheduled for February 10th, and payments will be made by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks starting from January 31st next year. The payment methods will be announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time. The following is a record of the amount of principal and interest to be repaid: (1) Type A: Principal of 3.75 million yuan, interest of 4.1445 million yuan, totaling 7.8945 million yuan; (2) Type B: Principal of 1.5 million yuan, interest of 4.3245 million yuan, totaling 5.8245 million yuan; (3) Type C: Principal of 2.8 million yuan, interest of 10.1001 million yuan, totaling 12.9001 million yuan; (4) Type D: Principal of 44 million yuan, interest of 15.873 million yuan, totaling 20.273 million yuan; (5) Type E: Principal of 2.08 million yuan, interest of 7.50036 million yuan, totaling 9.5836 million yuan.

### British Troops of the East Surrey Regiment Transferred from Shanghai to Defend Tianjin and Peiping; The Second Battalion, Comprising 100 Officers and Soldiers; May Be Under the Command of the Shanghai Commander

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the Japanese Domei News Agency telegraphed from Tianjin today (17th) that the commander of the British garrison in North China notified the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin yesterday that a large detachment of officers and soldiers from the British Shropshire Light Infantry, approximately 600 men, would be withdrawn from Tianjin and Peiping and replaced by the Second Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment, currently stationed in Shanghai, consisting of over one hundred officers and soldiers, approximately one company.

It is said that half of the troops to be transferred north will be stationed in Peiping. According to reports, the British troops in the Tianjin area are under the command of Hong Kong. The commander of the area is Brigadier Lowry. It has not been announced whether Brigadier Lowry will remain in Tianjin after the departure of the Shropshire Light Infantry. It is widely believed that the British troops transferred from the East Surrey Regiment to North China may be under the command of the Shanghai area, and the command authority of the Tianjin area may be terminated. In the past, the British troops stationed in China were all under the command of the Hong Kong headquarters. In 1927, when the West Yorkshire Regiment came to Shanghai, North China (Tianjin and Shanghai) and South China began to be commanded separately. After most of the British troops left and the number of British troops stationed in Shanghai was reduced to one or two battalions, the regional system was implemented. However, the French troops stationed in China were different. The commander of the French troops stationed in Tianjin also commanded the French troops stationed in Shanghai. As for the exact number of French troops to be withdrawn, it has not yet been announced.

### At the Suma Reception, the Issue of Seized Eggs Was Raised; Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy Was Unable to Answer; Suma Advocated Talking About "Legs" Instead of "Eggs"

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", Suma, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after flying to Shanghai from Tokyo, hosted about thirty foreign reporters in the city at the Broadway Mansions last night (16th). The reporters asked questions about the possible establishment of a "New Central Government" soon, the potential non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, the new U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, and the "New Order in East Asia". After about an hour and a half, one reporter asked Suma to comment on the method recently exposed by the newspaper of the

Mitsui Company

Seizing the eggs purchased by foreign merchants. However, Suma did not answer, as the interpreter pointed out that Suma had only arrived in Shanghai a few hours before the reception. One reporter then asked the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy here about this question. The spokesman replied that the Mitsui Company denied knowing about the

Seizure of Eggs

One reporter pointed out that the Mitsui Company forcibly wrote its name on the bill of lading for the eggs as the consignee and seized the eggs that were originally purchased by foreign merchants in the interior. The spokesman did not answer this. The reporter further asked if a private company could forcibly seize the goods of another private company. The spokesman replied that the egg issue was related to

Legal Issues

One reporter then asked whether the Japanese side had used this to reply to the protest raised by the U.S. Consulate General. The spokesman said that he did not know that the British and American consulates had raised protests about this matter. At this point, Suma interrupted the discussion and said with a smile, "It's best to talk about 'Legs' instead of 'Eggs'."

### Increased Shipping on the Yong River; Establishment of a Navigation Management Office

Ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are managed by the Ningbo Garrison Command and must be approved by the Headquarters of the Tenth Army before they can sail. The Department has now established a Navigation Management Office specifically to handle navigation matters due to the increase in the number of ships and the increasing complexity of affairs. The office was established on the 15th of this month and is concurrently headed by Deputy Commander Zhang Guiling. The Ningbo Shipping Association has been notified to inform the shipping companies. At the same time, if the shipping companies have any suggestions for improving shipping, they can propose them to the Management Office for adoption and implementation.

### Difficult Transportation in Beihai; Passenger, Cargo, and Parcel Services Suspended; Japanese Warships in Zhejiang Waters Have All Sailed South; Ordinary Mail Services Remain Normal

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the Japanese warships have been harassing Beihai, so there have been no traces of Japanese warships in the Zhejiang waters recently. The residents of Hutou Ferry in Fenghua and Sansha Wharf in Haimen, which were previously disturbed by Japanese warships firing cannons, have been evacuated, and local order has now been restored. The coastal fortresses have been ordered by the Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commands to be on high alert to prevent Japanese warships from harassing them again. The Japanese troops who landed have been fiercely resisted by Chinese troops and have been blocked in Qinzhou Bay. The British Swire Shipping Company's ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hong Kong defense line, which stopped in Beihai Bay, Jinan was the first to implement, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram to stop receiving parcels, while ordinary express letters, registered mail, and remittances will remain temporarily unchanged. Details are as follows:

Post Office Receives Telegram to Stop Sending Parcels

The Shanghai Postal Administration has recently received a report from the Beihai postal district stating that the area is experiencing intense fighting, traffic congestion, and difficulties in postal transportation. It has requested that the receipt of small and large parcels sent from Shanghai to Beihai and transferred to various places in the Guangxi region be temporarily suspended. The Parcel Business Section of the Bureau has already issued a notice stating, "Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels and small parcel mail sent to Beihai and transferred through Beihai to various places in the Guangxi region should be temporarily suspended from acceptance." A reporter from the Xinhua News Agency further learned from the relevant departments of the Bureau that ordinary express letters, registered mail, and remittances will be maintained as before until a report is received from the local post office.

Swire Ships Stop at Beihai Bay

Since the British Swire Shipping Company opened the direct route between Shanghai and Hong Kong, all ships sailing on this line have also stopped at Beihai Bay. Since the Japanese troops landed in Beihai, all ships have stopped stopping at Beihai Bay in order to avoid danger. Therefore, the Swire Company has stopped selling passenger tickets to Beihai and stopped loading transit cargo to Beihai from today. The Swire Company's Jinan ship, which sailed from Shanghai to Haiphong on the 16th of this month, was the first to implement not stopping at Beihai. The following is a list of the ships of the Company that sail to Haiphong and also stop at Beihai: Jinan, Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Suiyang, Guangdong, Suzhou, and other ships.

### Economist Talks About the Danger of Hoarding Foreign Goods; This European War Is Very Different from the Previous Environment; It Is Urgent to Abandon Adventurous Actions

According to a certain economist, it is meaningless for speculators to hoard foreign goods by taking advantage of the European War. It only stimulates prices, increases the burden of living for the citizens, and will be unfavorable to themselves. It is urgent to reflect deeply. According to this person, the rise and fall of prices are usually based on the law of supply and demand. The price increase after this European War is entirely due to speculators'

Manipulation, which is a temporary and false phenomenon. We should know that during the last European War, our country was in a period of peace, and the purchasing power of the inland was not reduced. On the contrary, it increased due to the increase in foreign exports. This promoted the purchasing power of the rural areas. Therefore, the merchants of domestic goods in Shanghai unintentionally gained a good sales opportunity. This time, our country is also in a period of war, and the inland transportation is interrupted. Even if the incoming goods are cut off, the

Consumption of the isolated island is limited. Furthermore, this European War is very different from the last one. Currently, only four countries are participating in the war: Britain, France, Germany, and Poland. It is still unknown whether it will involve as many countries as last time. At present, not only has the supply of European goods not been interrupted, but the goods of various American countries are also actively exporting, taking advantage of the European War. Therefore,

There is actually no danger of a disruption in the source of foreign goods. In summary, we can know that the result of hoarding goods will not have the thick profits that were available last time. On the contrary, it contains great danger. Why bother to cause suffering to the lives of ordinary people? I sincerely hope that merchants in various industries will not deliberately raise the prices of existing inventories and seize excessive profits. People outside the industry should not blindly follow suit and attempt to try lightly.

### Damaged American Warship Towed to Shanghai for Repairs

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the U.S. Asiatic Fleet destroyer "Pigeon" was recently forced aground on sand and rocks off the coast of Qingdao due to a hurricane. It is now being towed to Shanghai by the U.S. warship "Finch" to enter the dry dock and will have part of its hull and propellers repaired in the Yangshupu Shipyard. The repair work on a certain damaged area will take about one month. According to reports, the "Pigeon" was suddenly caught in a severe weather and huge waves caused by a hurricane when it was berthed in Qingdao in the middle of last month and was forced to break anchor and run aground on sand and rocks. Afterwards, several sailors on the ship suffered minor injuries, but there were no major casualties. At that time, the U.S. warship "Finch" was berthed in Shanghai and rushed to Qingdao to provide assistance, taking several days to refloat the "Pigeon". After three weeks of preliminary repairs, the ship was towed to Shanghai by the "Finch".

### The Labor Dispute at the Lun Chang Factory Resolved; Negotiations Between Management and Labor Lasted for Months; It Is Now Concluded and Resumption of Work Is Imminent

The Lun Chang Cotton Mill and Dyeing Factory in Pudong, this port, was closed due to a labor dispute. After months of consultation between management and labor, with the cooperation of British officials and the Japanese army, navy, and consular authorities, as well as the assistance of all parties, the labor dispute was resolved satisfactorily. All negotiations between management and labor have now ended, so the two factories can resume operations soon, and thousands of workers can resume their jobs as before. The Japanese authorities had previously heard that the two factories were located in their "occupied area". For the sake of local "security", they paid close attention to the matter. Now that the negotiations between the two sides have been satisfactorily resolved, it is said that they are extremely "gratified" by the outcome.

### Japanese Troops Conduct Artillery Firing Practice

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the Japanese troops conducted artillery firing practice next to the Beifang Road this morning (17th). It is widely believed that the Japanese troops fired field guns with a caliber of about 75 mm. According to reports, the Japanese troops had conducted bombardment practice with smaller-caliber guns in the area yesterday morning and afternoon.

### Ice River Fee for Dagu Shipping to Be Implemented Next Month

Shallow Water in Tanggu and Ice Seen in Dagu; The New Beijing Ship Departs for the South

Foreign shipping on the Northern Sea Line has suffered repeated blows since the Chinese War of Resistance, resulting in heavy losses. After the resolution of the strike of barge workers in Yantai, the barge workers between Tianjin and Tanggu in October were incited by a certain party to strike again.

Still Unresolved

As a result, the Swire Company sent the New Beijing ship, which had previously sailed on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, to Tianjin in early October to be used for barge transport between Tianjin and Tanggu. Recently, it was reported that the waterway from Dagukou to Tanggu has suddenly become shallower, with a depth of only nine feet in deep water and four or five feet in shallow water. Therefore, the North Sea liner completely

Cannot Enter the Port

It can only anchor outside Dagukou to load and unload goods. The New Beijing ship, which was sent by the Swire Company earlier, departed for Shanghai the day before yesterday (16th) due to the shallow water. It is said that after arriving in Shanghai, it will be diverted to Nanhua and go to Hong Kong for repairs. According to the shipping industry, the climate in the north this year is

Colder This Year

The season also started earlier. Ice has recently been seen in Dagukou. Therefore, each shipping company must increase the ice river fee for Tianjin freight every winter. It is reported that it will be implemented on the first of next month, and the amount of the increase has not yet been announced.

### Missing Rickshaw Puller - Corpse Found in Jiangwan - Three Gunshot Wounds on Corpse - Rented Car User Likely Involved in Illegal Activity - Police Authorities Are Investigating Closely

On the morning of the 14th of this month, a taxi was discovered near the intersection of Race Course Road and Rue du Consulat. The driver was missing. Besides bloodstains on the seat, two bullets were found in the car. Following an investigation by the police, it was learned that the car belonged to the Japanese-owned Shin Yu Automobile Company on Woosung Road in Hongkou. The driver was named Zhao Xing, aged twenty. However, Zhao's whereabouts were unknown after a thorough search until yesterday when a Chinese corpse was discovered in a certain river in the harbor area.

After studying the photograph provided by the Japanese military authorities, the river police tentatively identified the body as the missing driver, Zhao Shanxing. Yesterday, they dispatched officers to accompany the driver's father to identify the body. Upon arriving at the scene, Zhao's father confirmed that the corpse was indeed his son and wept inconsolably. Zhao's body had been retrieved from the river on the 16th.

There were three gunshot wounds on the body: one on the left cheek, one on the right shoulder, and one in the abdomen. The motive for the murder remains unclear. The police have submitted the bullets found in the empty car to experts for examination, but no leads have been found. However, according to detectives, it is likely that the person who rented the car from the Japanese-owned Shin Yu Automobile Company on the morning of the 14th intended to use the car for some illegal activity. Fearing that the driver would inform the authorities, they

resorted to this cruel act. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Times, news from the police authorities last night (the 16th) indicated that a taxi found abandoned on Race Course Road on Tuesday morning, had its Chinese driver's corpse pulled out of a Hongkou creek yesterday. There were two bullet wounds on the head, indicating that he was shot dead and thrown into the creek. It is said that the Japanese authorities have taken custody of the corpse. Now that the driver's corpse has been found, detectives from the Chengdu Road police station are following the leads and

conducting an investigation in order to capture the murderer. The murdered driver was hired at around 6:30 AM on Monday morning. The car company is located at 170 Woosung Road and is managed by Koreans. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are also concerned about this case.

### Swindler Yang Qiaomin - Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentence

Also swindled a wealthy prostitute

Yang Qiaomin (also known as Di'an, Letian) from Wuxi, was skilled in astrology. Recently, he used his fortunetelling skills to defraud Shi Kongyu from Ningbo of over 76,000 yuan. The case was uncovered, and the head of the Chinese detectives, Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng, of the General Police Department arrested him and turned him over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zai Rongduo opened a criminal

court to continue the hearing. First, Shi Kongyu presented various evidence, proving that the defendant defrauded him of money under the guise of "improving fertility." He also proved that when Yang opened the Weiliduo Monosodium Glutamate Factory, he claimed a capital of 80,000 yuan and persuaded the plaintiff to invest over 20,000 yuan in a partnership under a pseudonym. However, the actual capital of the factory was only over 20,000 yuan. Therefore, the capital for the factory's establishment was entirely provided by the plaintiff, achieving his

fraudulent purpose, and so on. When Yang Qiaomin was questioned, he admitted to the evidence presented by the plaintiff. Finally, the police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, argued that the defendant's fraudulent methods to obtain property were extremely obvious. However, he also committed crimes such as forging seals when carrying out the fraud. However, all are absorbed within the crime of fraud. Since his fraud was continuous, he requested that the continuous fraud crime be

punished severely, and so on. The plaintiff's lawyers, Wu Linkun and Xiao Baichuan, requested that the defendant be ordered to compensate the plaintiff for the swindled funds. After review by the judge, the debate was declared closed, and a date was set for sentencing. It is heard that after obtaining the swindled money, Yang went to the Qiuyue gambling house at 65 Yuyuan Road to gamble. In that gambling house, he again used his skills, and a prostitute was also swindled of over 3,000 yuan.

### Indian Police Officer's Gun Robbed - Wanted Criminal Apprehended

On the morning of the 11th, at 9:20 AM, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and Western Detective Tierden of the Putuo Road police station arrested five bandits, including Ji Jurong and Huang Zhengfa from Jiangbei, at house number 5, Lane 1212, Xiaoshadu Road. They were taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending a later date. It was discovered that Li, the bandit, had conspired with other fugitives on October 12 at 9:55 PM to rob Indian police officer number 74 on wharf number 3, West Suzhou Road, of a .45 caliber revolver, number 647, containing six bullets. Regarding the suspects Huang Zhengfa, Yao Xinggui, Shen Baolin, and He Xiaowuzi, it was determined that they were not involved. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted the four men, including Huang, to the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhiyou, requested that the

detention be revoked. Judge Huang Risheng approved the request, and Huang Zhengfa, Yao Xinggui, Shen Baolin, and He Xiaowuzi were all released.

### Xue Ashun From Wuxi Kidnapped and Killed - Murderer Sentenced to Twelve Years

Xue Ashun, 36 years old from Wuxi, operated the Yilun small silk factory in his hometown of Butterfly Village. He was robbed last year on May 4th. This year on March 25th, Xue was again kidnapped by local tyrant Hou Genxiang and his gang, who demanded a large ransom. After negotiations between Xue's wife, Dai, and Hou, the amount was too far apart, so Hou shot and killed Xue, killing him. At the same time, a comedian shot and wounded Dai. The cruelty of the methods was unprecedented. Since then, Xue and Dai

came to Shanghai to make a living. This year on August 2nd, Dai passed by the Liangxi Inn at 144 Hubei Road and suddenly ran into Hou. After finding out that Hou was staying in room 20 of the inn, she reported to the Lou

Police Station. Chinese Detective Wang Jiaju rushed to the scene and arrested Hou, escorting him to the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, prosecuted him for murder. Due to the difficulty in investigating evidence, the trial was held through several court sessions. Finally, the trial came to an end. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court announced the verdict, sentencing Hou Genxiang to twelve years of imprisonment for murder. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial.

### General Manager of Dacheng Bookstore Accused of Embezzlement - Witnesses Summoned for Continued Interrogation Yesterday

Wu Xirong, shareholder and general manager of Dacheng Bookstore, Shen Zhongkun (Wu's son-in-law), manager of the branch of the liquor and water department of Dacheng, and Yao Jianqiu, accountant of Dacheng Bookstore, were recently sued by shareholders of the bookstore, Xiang Keming, Zheng Yuemei, Yang Dongquan, and Liu Xiangchu (also serving as assistant manager of Dacheng Bookstore), together with lawyers Zheng Lintong and Zhou Rong, at the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for the crime of jointly breach of trust and embezzlement. Judge Sun Pengxian held a court hearing for investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was continued. The two defendants, Shen and Yao, were still not present. Wu Xirong alone attended the court with his defense counsel. According to the plaintiff's attorney, after Wu Xirong withdrew from the Sibushui branch, the funds were not urgently used to repay the Xiaojingshanfang debt, but instead repaid the Dacheng Bookstore debt, which was not important, which was inappropriate and selfish. When Wu was questioned, he replied that the Dacheng debt repaid was also urgent. Therefore, the oval seal was used. Normally, the square seal was used for important matters. Later, it was conveniently used. Then, according to the testimony of witness Zhu Xiqi, who worked as a messenger at the Shanghai Bank, Dacheng Bookstore had been doing business with our bank for 20 years before it stopped after the August 13th Incident. Wu Xirong came to me to discuss, and I personally guaranteed a transaction of 2,000 yuan, which was repaid. Besides, there was an outstanding balance of more than 900 yuan. Because the bank urged repayment and Wu had no funds to pay, I personally lent 1,000 yuan to repay the transaction. This 1,000 yuan was repaid to me in early August or September of this year, and so on. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to December 1st. The defendant Wu Xirong was still released on the original bail. The absent defendants will be summoned again next time.

### Female Gangster "Elder Sister" Opens Morphine Den

One accomplice, Li Yangshi, arrested.

The day before yesterday (the 16th) at around 1 PM, the French police received a tip that a female gangster nicknamed "Elder Sister" was running a morphine den at No. 1, Ranfang Lane, Xujiahui Town. They dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address. However, the main culprit, Elder Sister, had fled after hearing the news. Only one accomplice, Li Yangshi (age 51, from Changzhou), was arrested. A large amount of morphine was seized and taken to the police station together. Yesterday, she was transferred to the Second Special Court.

### Worker Beats Factory Owner

Shao Moudao from Shaoxing, who operates the Nanyang Cotton Weaving Factory at 212 Qibu Road, entrusted the factory affairs entirely to Wang Zhihan, a manager from Jiaxing, because he usually focuses on running a money exchange. Recently, the factory's business has been slow, and the original 30-plus workers could not be maintained. After Wang explained the situation to Shao Moudao, 20 of the workers were laid off and paid two and a half months of severance pay. Last night, the factory staff held a banquet at the Sanhe Restaurant across from the Great World to celebrate the 30th birthday of Ye Daogen. Wang Zhihan and five of the laid-off workers went to congratulate him. After the banquet, the five workers asked Wang to take a walk on the street. While walking to the intersection of Sixth Road and Guangxi Road, the workers recounted Wang's reasons for the layoffs and beat Wang on the spot, causing Wang to suffer serious injuries to his chest and face. Subsequently, the Central Police Station sent the five to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The perpetrators are still being pursued.

### Car Accident - Knocks Down Person, Then Attacks

Yesterday at 1:45 PM, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Montauban in the French Concession, a delivery truck from Paul Chakhaya Food Company at 139 North Szechuen Road knocked down someone riding a rickshaw. Unexpectedly, three foreigners stepped out of the car and started beating the victim, causing a crowd to gather.

Outraged by the injustice, Western police arrived and tried to mediate without success. They took the three foreigners to the police station for questioning.

### Trademark Lawsuit for Pharmaceuticals

Defendant Chen Taiyan Found Not Guilty

Chen Taiyan, the owner of the America Pharmacy, a native of Ningbo, has recently produced a tonic called Tiger Bone Bear Deer (also known as Danggui Rongshilu). The trademark features illustrations of animals such as tigers. Due to the success of his business, a trademark dispute arose. The Liusan Industrial Company produces a tonic named Donkey-hide Gelatin Pill, and its trademark also features a donkey. Thus, Liusan believed that America Pharmacy's product had imitated their trademark. Because of the two trademarks, Han Longzhou, the owner of Liusan Company, sued Chen Taiyan for hindering agriculture, industry, and commerce in the First Special Court. A hearing had already been held. Yesterday, Judge Fang Qingxian of the First Special Court again held a hearing at the Eighth Criminal Court. The lawyers of the defendant Chen Taiyan, Qian Xingzhong, Ni Guangzu, and Zhu Qichao, presented a defense and listed various facts, proving that the defendant's product was unique and did not involve imitation. They requested the court to dismiss the plaintiff's suit and declare the defendant innocent. Judge Fang carefully studied the evidence and documents submitted by both parties, concluding that the goods of the plaintiff and defendant were obviously completely different. The judge considered the plaintiff's claim to be without merit and declared Chen Taiyan not guilty in court.

### Detectives Disguised as Customers - Bust Opium Trafficking Ring

Chinese detectives from the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Central Police Station received a tip-off the day before yesterday that someone was selling opium at the Leming Hotel on Guangdong Road. They disguised themselves and went to the address. A man named Wang Tianshi met them in the hotel lobby. They agreed on a price of 22 yuan per ounce and ordered 100 ounces, paying 50 yuan in marked banknotes in advance. They agreed to pick up the goods at No. 50, Lane 45, Qingdao Road, on the afternoon of the 16th. At the appointed time, Chinese and Western police officers searched the agreed-upon address. Besides the main criminal Wang Tianshi, they also arrested accomplices Lin Guizhen (26 years old), Huang Huichang, Li Zhiming, and Zou Chengfu, a Shanghai-based real estate merchant. One hundred and twelve ounces of opium and some banknotes were confiscated. Yesterday, they were taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court and requested to be detained to continue arresting the fugitives. After Judge Chuan Lin took the stand for a brief interrogation, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for another seven days.

### Large-Scale Arrest of Hat-Snatching Thieves - Bust of a Receiving Stolen Goods Operation - More Than One Hundred and Seventy Felt Hats Found

After the French police had consecutively arrested more than sixty hat snatching suspects in the concession on Route Amiral Bayle, Rue Hennequin, and Route Francis Garnier, they brought them all to justice. The Western Inspector Pulinan, Chinese Detective Captains Sui Wenzhi and Ma Yizhi, and detectives Qiu Guanrong and Nu Changxing, launched a thorough investigation. They discovered that the suspects had stolen a total of more than two hundred various felt hats in the French Concession within the past three months. Because this large batch of stolen hats had a ready market, they set up a large-scale modification operation at No. 4, Lane 126, Route Lafayette, managed by the receiver Cao Yushan. After the thieves snatched the hats, they would take the higher-quality ones to the operation to be modified and then sold, which would generate huge profits. After the detectives learned the details, they went to the address the day before yesterday, arrested Cao, and confiscated several hat-modifying templates and more than one hundred and seventy felt hats of various colors. The police are now awaiting the victims to go to the Foreign Affairs Section at No. 22 Route Tenant de St Livier to claim their hats.

### German Overseas Chinese Loses Love and Kills Concubine - Appeals Disagreeing with Sentence - Claims There Are Children Left Behind Without Care - Has Realized His Past Mistakes and Asks for Leniency

(Shanghai Guangshe) Hai Maina Lanya, a German overseas Chinese living at No. 36, Lane 225, Gongping Road, Hongkou, is 44 years old this year. He used to run a cloth shop in Berlin. Two years ago, he fell in love with Ya Benhaimeisi, a female employee in the shop (also German). In February of this year, Ya also fell in love with and married Fassen Huatuo, also of the same ethnicity. In March, they traveled together from Germany to Italy by

ship to Shanghai. When Ya boarded the ship, she had a disagreement with Fa, so she called Hai Maina Lanya long-distance, asking him to still love her and asking Hai to come to Shanghai. Ya first arrived in Shanghai with Fa, renting a room at No. 2, Lane 915, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, and living with Fa. The relationship between the two broke down, so Fa went to Hongkou to rent a house elsewhere. Ya then developed a relationship with another man. In May of this year, Hai Maina Lanya arrived in Shanghai. On the first night, Ya entertained

him for the night. Hai repeatedly asked Ya if she would marry him, but did not get a satisfactory answer. Hai, heartbroken, wrote a letter of mutual destruction, put it beside him, and on the morning of June 12 at about 8:00 AM, he took a razor to Ya's residence and cut Ya's throat, killing her on the spot. At the same time, Hai stabbed his own wrists with a razor and took a total of eighteen pills of aspirin and quinine

in an attempt to commit suicide. After the case occurred, the French Concession police reported it and ordered detectives to arrest Hai Maina Lanya. After treatment at the Guangci Hospital, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and prosecuted for murder. After investigation by the

court president, Hai Maina Lanya was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Hai disagreed with the sentence and hired lawyers Lu Dingxiong and Gao Lemao to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, Criminal Court President Wu Tingqi and judges Chen and Gu opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. Hai Maina Lanya stated his

reasons for the appeal. He did not deny the murder, but said that he has now realized his past mistakes. He requested the court to consider that the appellant still has an ex-wife, leaving a 17-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter without care, and to give him leniency. Then, witness Fassen Huatuo testified that the victim Ya Benhaimeisi behaved too romantically. After examining the testimony,

the court ordered a debate, declared the trial closed, and remanded the appellant in custody to await sentencing.

### Letter

To the esteemed editors: Recently, I read in the news column of your newspaper that the Yongtaichang Store at No. 825 Beijing Road had received stolen goods of lead bars, which were seized by the police and sent to the court, etc. After reading it, it is inconsistent with the facts. After checking, our store purchased a total of twenty lead bars from the copper and tin store, Tongfengxiang, on the twelfth of this month, with invoices as proof. This is a legitimate transaction between businesses. Our store had no way of knowing that Tongfengxiang had purchased stolen goods. We are deeply concerned that the outside world will misunderstand the truth and affect the reputation of our store. Therefore, we are sending this letter to clarify the facts and request correction. Yours truly, Hu Haitang, Yongtaichang Store, November 17.

Reporting: I am writing on behalf of my client, the representative of the Taili Company, who stated that he read in today's Shen Bao an article entitled "Owners of the Le'anfang Compound Appreciate Tenants and Cancel Rent Increase." It is deeply surprising that this is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, our company maintained a good relationship between the landlord and the tenant regarding the rent increase incident in Le'anfang. Therefore, both parties compromised with each other, and it was resolved through negotiations to increase the rent by 10%. Most of the tenants had already paid the rent according to the increased rent amount, which had reached September and October of this year. On the one hand, they applied to the court to collect the deposited items, and on the other hand, they issued rent receipts for the increased rent amount. Although a few tenants have not yet paid according to the increased amount, it is an established fact. How can it be said to be cancelled? This concerns the rights and interests, and we are deeply concerned that rumors are untrue and confusing the public. Therefore, we specially request the noble lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper office for a solemn statement to correct the public's view and avoid misunderstandings. Accordingly, we report the situation and request that your newspaper promptly correct it and publish the letter as a certificate to prove the facts. To the distinguished chief editor of the Shen Bao, Lawyer Wu Changlu, November 17.

Respectfully, Yu Tang et al. were invited by Yang Jinhai on the evening of the 9th of this month to attend a banquet at the Wanli Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Unexpectedly, disaster struck internally, and Yang and his friend Luo Zhibin were killed at the same time. At that time, Yu Tang et al. could not leave without authorization because the case involved human lives, which hindered the police's investigation procedures. Therefore, we waited quietly for the detectives to arrive. The police have already clarified the case and were released by the First Special District Court today after interrogation. It was found that Yang had recently established a Zhongyuan Barber Shop on Avenue Joffre, and Yu Tang et al. presented gifts to celebrate the occasion due to our fellow-provincial relationship. Yang then hosted a banquet on that day to thank us, which resulted in the accident. According to Yu Tang et al., who have been in Shanghai for many years, we all have legitimate occupations and have never participated in any political activities. Because your newspaper at that time published the phrase "Yang entertained cronies," we are writing to request that your newspaper correct it, for which we would be deeply grateful. To the distinguished chief editor of the newspaper, He Yutang, Dou Guiqing, Wang Mingtang, Wei Debao, November 28, November 17.

### Various Aspects of Life

‚Äî Mu Chang

Life and practice should be unified. However, life is not necessarily practice; its practicality can be determined by the depth of its influence on the group. The life of a group is undoubtedly a kind of practice, so the practice of an individual can only be fully realized within the group; if one "maintains" a considerable distance from the group, its positive effect will gradually disappear, even belonging to the realm of the individual. And so-called life can be derived into two aspects, the difference between the two being based on the group. However, are public and private completely separate and unconnected? To think so is to commit the error of idealism.

"Born into this world," one may not intend to do anything for the public, and may be a selfish individual, but one cannot truly exist in isolation from the outside world; hence, "I am because I am"; this is the same as the world and the group existing before the individual was born.

Therefore, "private" is not absolute either.

Muttering to oneself is a kind of private life, but people find it laughable. Once explained, however, everyone is relieved, and it becomes "public." Similarly, a person writing a book behind closed doors may seem to have no connection to society; but when it is published, even if it is inscribed "Dedicated to my √ó√ó," it still has a significant impact on the group, for better or worse. Here, the author's thoughts and theories exist as a social practice through an action, a means, expressing a certain way of life.

Of course, a speech or a writing does not necessarily express actual life. A person's private life may even contradict it, and to think that they are one and the same would be laughable or dangerous. This is the so-called multiple personality.

But life always has to be expressed; keeping it in one's mind is not life. In "public declarations," one can express one's personality and conceal other aspects; but what is expressed elsewhere, even if it does not exist in print, will ultimately not escape notice. The reason is that a foolish child muttering to himself in an empty room is certainly irrelevant to the group, but when he runs out, he will be pointed out even in the dark. As an old saying goes, "Sincerity within manifests itself outwardly," which is indeed true.

Here, what is considered important is how to unify a person's personality in all aspects: theory, practice, and life. We do not deny that what exists publicly has its objective effect, but if we ignore the aspect of "unity," we will be unknowingly deceived and taken advantage of. A gesture or a step may seem unimportant, but when combined, they often align with future tendencies. Of course, excessive consideration in observation is not without its drawbacks.

Wang Fuzhi, a thinker of the late Ming Dynasty, once wrote his own epitaph: "Embracing Liu Yueshi's loyal integrity, but unable to realize it; aspiring to Zhang Hengqu's righteous learning, but unable to achieve it. Fortunately returning completely to this hill, forever bearing sorrow for generations." This is certainly an expression, with the ideological existence of an intellectual with a sense of justice in feudal society, but it is still somewhat abstract. What is most powerful is his complete life as a patriot and scholar.

We are not afraid of people attacking private life in any way. Whole Black-boned Chicken and White Phoenix Pills from the market include even the feathers and claws, because this is to take its entire meaning; but if, in the course of debate, you publicly point out that someone used to be a tailor, or that their ancestors were Jewish, that is naturally a lack of understanding on the part of the one pointing it out, and is not merely trivial.

### On Olive Ridge

‚Äî Fen Lang

A Remembrance of the Battle of Northern Hunan

When I took the assignment order from the Brigade Headquarters to report to the Second Battalion Headquarters, my initial impression of Battalion Commander Peng, my superior and colleague, was that he was like a drunken loach.

You see, his smooth throat convulsed suddenly, letting out a loud belch. The smell of alcohol was pungent, clearly mixed with the fishy odor of meat.

"Battalion Deputy Wang, you've come at a good time. Have you had dinner yet? Have a couple of drinks!" he said, squinting his gloomy eyes quickly.

"Ah! I've already eaten," I said, tossing the assignment order from my trouser pocket onto the table. Battalion Commander Peng hurriedly took it, his liver-colored, cloudy eyes widening as he looked at it.

After reading the assignment order, he patted me on the shoulder very affectionately, making me feel a little sore.

"The Brigade Headquarters has ordered us to depart tonight for Olive Ridge, more than ten miles northwest of √ó County. ......" I reiterated to Battalion Commander Peng.

He nodded and pressed the electric bell with his hand. Company Commander Liu, who I had met before, strode in, saluted us, and stood still.

"Liu Jingru, from here to Olive Ridge in √ó County is about 120 li. According to the regulations on the order, use the 'combat marching' speed‚Äî15 li per hour‚Äîdeparting promptly at 9:00 PM and arriving at the designated location promptly before 5:00 AM."

Company Commander Liu exited the door. Battalion Commander Peng and I leaned on the window, looking out at the steep ridges and the villages connected to the green river; this area was clearly the dividing point between mountain and lake regions. Looking westward, a faint shadow at the end of the sky was Olive Ridge, where we were to be stationed.

The sun had set, and a flock of crows flew around the bare locust trees, making a noisy racket, their curved wings tearing through the golden sunset.

The weather was very cold at night. Battalion Commander Peng and I both put on yellow woolen military coats and looked at a military map under the water-like lamplight.

At eight o'clock, the bugle call floated into our ears through the swirling air. Battalion Commander Peng and I each straddled a pony, creeping along a dim, narrow path behind a group of more than 500 brothers!

As dawn approached, a gray stone tower stood tall in the embrace of the mountains, arrogantly looking down on the city and the river. Battalion Commander Peng pointed with his riding crop and said to me:

"See that? That's Olive Ridge."

At this time, Battalion Commander Peng, based on the report from Deputy Adjutant Zhao, who had "gone ahead to reconnoiter," decided to set up camp at the small valley entrance.

Olive Ridge commanded a high position, allowing us to overlook the open area in front. If the enemy did not avoid sneaking to Zhanglang Mountain, ten miles away, we could effectively fire upon them. Moreover, our task was defense, which simply took advantage of any tactical advantage.

I allocated the troops on behalf of Battalion Commander Peng, using one company as a reserve team and spreading the remaining three companies as a sentry line, forming a tight "fire net." We didn't need to dig trenches; the undulating arc of Olive Ridge, the rugged rocks and mounds of this stony ridge, could all conceal our bodies and tracks.

The leaves had fallen, and the autumn sun was bright and clear. Our skirmish line had an unobstructed view, making communication and command extremely flexible.

Battalion Commander Peng and I rode our horses, standing actively and bravely at the forefront of the defense line‚Äîon Olive Ridge‚Äî

### Lingering Grass

‚Äî Liu Chou

I don't know which good person brought the news, saying: Autumn is deep.

Is autumn deep? Yes. Don't you hear the hymn ringing in heaven: "Lovely, beautiful, deep autumn!" Awaken from a languid and enchanting blue dream, let us use wine tasting, chrysanthemum appreciation, wild geese listening, and holding brushes to weave a brilliant poem like autumn clouds.

On the quiet walkway, few people are seen. Looking through the sparse gaps in the street maples, there is a deep, dark blackness. The autumn sky here is always overcast, even when it doesn't rain. I lower my head to look at the long, thin shadow under the lamplight. Occasionally, a paulownia leaf falls from the branch with a "swish," but is blown up again by the wind behind me, slowly and slowly swirling in the air. I stop to watch, this touch of autumn light makes my nerves tremble, and my body seems to be carried by the leaf, drifting, drifting to a very, very far place.

"The reeds are green, the white dew is frost, ..."

In my heart, there is a misty and smoky cold mountain, and at the foot of the mountain, there are also old vines, old trees, small bridges, flowing water, and families. Let the wheelbarrow rumble over the wind and sand of the ancient road, the setting sun gradually approaching; I see the old garden, shrouded in the low twilight, although it is already ruins and broken walls, and rubble has blocked the stream, but it is known that under this abandoned ruin and smoke, there are indeed buried my ten years of youthful time.

The first thing that comes to mind should be the third watch in the countryside, wearing straw raincoats and hats, and holding red lanterns with family members to go to the beach to catch crabs! Otherwise, it is standing in the harbor, enviously watching the small steamer setting sail, carrying baskets of large crabs to another place to go for great fortune... But who is born with this kind of temperament, willing to go to the dusty steles to find eroded handwriting? It is nothing more than that the taste of life is too bleak. Counting theÊÇ†ÊÇ† tolling of the bells in the church over and over again, the asphalt road is always endless; those cold mountains, old vines, beaches, and straw hats have all become pictures of drinking horses in deserted cities today.

The hustle and bustle pulls me into the downtown area. Under the bright electric light, there is a green earthenware jar, wooden bucket, filled with crabs, tiredly crawling their claws, have the lakes and mountains been well, how could they have met here in a foreign land in wandering? Having endured cunning, bullying, and humiliation, in the end, it is still difficult to survive, aren't the people watching the crabs just like the crabs, squatting in the "cage"? Looking up to the horizon, the misty autumn water is cut off, the heavy mountains and passes, the night's homesickness withers the good appearance.

"Why are you wandering in this Jiangnan land‚Äî‚Äî"

Like a fallen singer, traveling all over the world, and in the end still wandering on the street, holding a pipa, singing out the feelings in his heart from legends.

But this is not the poem of "Returning Home," wanting to go into seclusion in the Yinshan Mountains with a staff; it seems that these are only suitable to be added to the paintbrush, to be the embellishments of the "Eastern Fence Appreciating Chrysanthemums" picture. Humiliation should give birth to determination, where is the place to stay‚Äîjoining a flood, letting it rush to the horizon.

Entertainment World

### The Discussion on What Peking Opera Should Have During Extraordinary Times

‚Äî The Master of the Thirsty Cloud Tower

Currently, the art of Peking Opera is the leader in the entertainment world. With its widespread appeal to ladies and gentlemen, its influence on the psychology of the audience is immense. Although Peking Opera performers aim to make a living by selling their skills, they can take advantage of their acting skills to give a direct and forceful warning, fulfilling their national duty and enabling the audience to gain a profound impression in addition to entertainment. At this extraordinary time, when the life and death of the nation are hanging by a thread, plays with a conscious message should be staged. Therefore, I have compiled the plays related to the inherent virtues of our country, "Loyalty," "Filial Piety," "Integrity," and "Righteousness," and listed them as follows.

Loyalty

"The Hate of Coal Hill," "The Pavilion of the Wind and Waves," and "The Dream of Trust and the Monument Crash"; these fully demonstrate how the ancients were loyal to the country and regarded death as returning home.

Filial Piety

"Fishing for a Golden Turtle," "The Three Mothers Teach Their Son," and "Filial Piety Touches Heaven"; our country has passed down the tradition of ruling the world with filial piety for generations. At this time, when people's hearts are not ancient and cases of disrespect for ethics are frequently seen, moral corruption is at its worst. If the performance is well-supported, it will benefit people's hearts and be truly not insignificant.

Integrity

"The Battle of Puguan," "A Handful of Snow," and "Assassinating the Tiger"; the spirit of integrity is moving and worthy of tears. In recent times, social customs have been declining, and moral integrity has been swept away. Everything is only for profit, and power is used as a wall-climbing weed. Actors should understand the plot and perform it deeply, giving a sharp criticism and awakening people's minds.

Righteousness

"The Ninth Watch," "The Iron Rooster," and "Reading Under the Pine Tree"; noble righteousness is admirable for all time. Therefore, the word "righteousness" is the foundation of one's life.

As described above, due to space limitations, I cannot list the names of the plays in detail, but only briefly express the main points. As for plays such as "Living Buddha Jigong" and "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights," although their plots are close to absurd and unbelievable, they deeply appeal to the general audience. They can take advantage of the words and actions in the plays to constantly instill healthy thoughts, which will have a broad and far-reaching influence on the audience's psychology. This is an easy thing to do, and I sincerely hope that the performers of these plays will pay more attention to it.

### Recent Events of Shirley Temple ‚ÄîTruly a Talented Artist‚Äî

‚Äî New Film

According to a teacher who guides Shirley Temple in various dances, if any new type of dance is needed in a film, Shirley Temple only needs three minutes of learning, and all the steps will be mastered. Even people who specialize in dance as a profession cannot learn a dance method within three minutes, so you can see that Shirley Temple has an extraordinary talent for dance!

Prolific Star

In just four or five years, Shirley Temple has starred in twenty or thirty films for 20th Century Fox, and the company has made a lot of money from each film, almost always treating Shirley Temple as a cash cow! When her new films arrive in Shanghai, they are translated into a series of "Little √ó√ó," making it difficult to remember them all. Recently, she is filming "Blue Bird." According to the direct translation, it is "Blue Bird," but I wonder if this film will be translated into "Little √ó√ó" when it arrives in Shanghai.

Envoy of Qingdao

Film fans from all over the world, especially young film fans, often write letters to Shirley Temple. Especially before Christmas and New Year, there are many such letters. Some write to ask for her photos, some ask for her autographs, and some even ask her for toys or even financial help. If possible, Shirley Temple always replies to these letters, even agreeing to their requests. Now that Christmas is approaching again, the green men in Hollywood have often brought thick stacks of letters to Shirley Temple's home these days!

Time Flies

Shirley Temple is now a ten-year-old girl, and she is also a precocious child. Looking at her on the screen, she seems like a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl. Therefore, people are worried about her, her childhood is about to pass away, and she will no longer be a child star. But Shirley Temple's mother doesn't care about this. Fortunately, she has made a lot of money in recent years. Whether Shirley Temple will continue to make films after her childhood has passed depends on the company's decision and Shirley Temple's own willingness.

Film Shadow of Dance Troupes (50)

### Imported Goods

‚Äî Xiao Tian

There is a friend who often goes to dance halls and is very generous with money in front of the dance girls. The day before yesterday, he ran to my office to handle official business, and it happened to be tea dance time, so I invited him to Dahua together. He suddenly said he didn't want to go to dance halls anymore. I said, what's wrong, heartbroken? He said, no, middle-aged people like us go to dance halls just for fun, it's impossible to talk about love. I was thinking, am I a little guilty towards the country and society? In the past, I thought that we went to dance halls to relax and boost our spirits. Spending a few more chips on the dance girls would also make them happier. It's like the saying, "A person from Chu lost his bow, and a person from Chu found it," it's all the same inside and out. I didn't expect to discover a very bad impression a few days ago.

It turns out that my friend doesn't specialize in courting red stars. He thinks that black stars must have their reasons for being black, so he doesn't like to chat with them either. The dance partners he chooses are usually middle-class dancers who earn hundreds of dance tickets a month. He is willing to spend money, so the middle-class dancers, with his dance fees added, unknowingly become upper-class dancers. The two dance girls he chose were originally very simple, but after his embellishment, they inevitably went down the road of extravagance. A few days ago, he discovered that the stockings they used to wear were only two yuan a pair, but now they want to wear imported goods worth twenty yuan a pair. When he checked their clothes and cosmetics, almost all of them used imported goods. He tried to persuade them, but they said they didn't like Chinese goods. He thought, in this way, wouldn't he indirectly become a salesperson for imported goods? In this year, should we still encourage the outflow of funds?

### Guohua's Newcomer Cheng Yuehua Will Meet Film Fans in "Seven Heavens" and "Li Amao" (Qin Tailai)

New Film Introduction

### "Dust Be My Destiny" Re-Sees the Light

‚Äî Qi Hua

We will certainly not forget Paul Muni's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" in that work the screenwriter took distrust of the law as a theme. The law is established to punish criminals, but the law is dead words. "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" raised this serious question for the first time, as an innocent falsely accused person, because they could not obtain sufficient rebuttal, he will never have the opportunity to rehabilitate, and eventually wanders the world. Is this a flaw in the law? Naturally, the initial legislation was very detailed and cautious. It is for this reason that dead words cannot cooperate with the various criminal behaviors under various circumstances. This defect requires adjudicators to carefully assess the case and weigh the severity.

Although "Dust Be My Destiny" adopts the same theme, the ending is a full reveal of the truth, which shows that the screenwriter only doubts the dead law, but not absolutely. The director's description of the young couple fleeing for their lives under the pursuit of the law and not being able to have a moment of peace is very strong and powerful, but the story of "Dust Be My Destiny" is not as simple as "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang." For example, the section where Bell (John Garfield) inadvertently took news photos of bandits robbing a bank after escaping from prison inevitably disrupts the unified development of the entire play and loses its stimulating power.

But individually, the following scenes are very powerful. For example, (1) Charlie discovered the love of Bell and Maybo, using two dolly shots to strengthen the tension of the young couple at that time. (2) Their wanderings everywhere, when they were about to separate, Bell and Maybo's two backward glances were also powerful enough. (3) Bell, when he had no other choice, attempted to rob, and finally regretted going home, and (4) after escaping from prison, the owner of the restaurant sent them to the train, etc., which can show the director's transcendent skills.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

‚Äî Xu Muyun

Old Actors Rely on Ability to Eat, New Artists Rely on Support to Make Money

There is also another level, the better the actors, the more they have to fight to the death. No one is willing to give in to anyone, so at that time, there was a popular saying in the Pear Garden industry: "We'll see each other on stage." This means that "no one should exaggerate their abilities privately." After a while, when the gongs and drums sounded, and the dramas "Breaking Through the Secret Valley," "Arresting and Releasing Cao," "Visiting the Mother," "Five Family Slopes," etc., performed by the sheng, jing, and sheng dan together, everyone used their full strength and raised their spirits, as if they were competing; each used good singing and showed their supernatural powers. If anyone recited a word incorrectly and the audience shouted "boo," then you deserved to be unlucky, and from then on, you were considered to have failed and completely lost to the other party. Back then, even with his great ability and lofty status (head of the Jingzhong Temple), Boss Cheng (Changgeng) would not let He Guishan have his way in "The Second Entrance to the Palace." The old man was so angry that he kept shouting, "Today, this kid is going to fight with me again!" He had no choice but to tighten his belt tightly, willing to sweat all over rather than show weakness to him. Tell me, wouldn't such a play be satisfying? There was also an incident where Lao Tan was plotted against while singing "Zhaoguan." When he was supposed to sing the allegro "Day after day passed, my heart was like boiling oil, I carried a three-foot sword around my waist, but I could not avenge my parents' injustice," the costume manager unexpectedly handed him a knife to hang around his waist. At this critical moment, the time was extremely urgent, and there was no time for any delay. As soon as the curtain was lifted, Wu Zixu had to come on stage and start singing the allegro. The person who plotted against Lao Tan (said to be Liu Hongsheng) was sitting high on the side, thinking that Lao Tan would definitely fall this time. Obviously, with the knife hanging by his side, as soon as you sing "sword," someone will immediately shout "boo" to you. If you stumble, I can become a big hit. (144)
