Attacking Soviet forces have been routed, thanks to new Finnish rifles specifically designed for forest warfare. Several villages and towns have been destroyed by fire, but Finnish losses are minimal.  Fighting is also fierce on the Karelian Isthmus, where, except in a few locations, the enemy has been pushed back. Fighting is ongoing.  The Soviets lost 11 tanks yesterday and at least eight more today.  Nine Soviet aircraft were lost today, while all Finnish aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 1st)

Helsinki - After continuous air raids in recent days, the Soviet army finally occupied Petsamo, a Finnish port on the Arctic coast, yesterday. Consequently, the entire Finnish Arctic coastline is now under Soviet control. While the port's strategic importance is not paramount, the Soviet Union's aim in occupying it is clearly to cut off the import of foreign military supplies to Finland. (Haitong, 2nd)

Air Raid Alarm in Helsinki

Helsinki - After a quiet night, residents of Helsinki were again startled by an air raid alarm at 8:45 AM this morning. Men and women rushed into air raid shelters. The streets quickly became deserted. However, this alarm was apparently a false one, as it was lifted five minutes later. The population of Helsinki may be forced to evacuate at any time. Major businesses have already relocated to other cities. Food supplies are still adequate, but food shops do not operate on a regular schedule, closing immediately upon hearing an alarm and not reopening that day.

Moscow - The Soviet government responded yesterday in an abrupt tone to President Roosevelt's appeal that Soviet military aircraft not bomb Finnish civilian areas. The Soviet note advised the United States to stay out of the Soviet-Finnish war. Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov interrupted commercial negotiations with Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigenori Tōgō yesterday to receive US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt. Molotov replied that President Roosevelt's note was "baseless and based on misunderstanding." He said that the United States is 8,600 kilometers from the Soviet Union and therefore cannot determine the true purpose of the Soviet Union and events within Finland. He denied that Soviet aircraft were bombing any Finnish cities, stating that the Soviet Union had no intention of bombing Finnish cities because the Soviet government valued the interests of the Finnish people as much as other countries did. Soviet aircraft were only bombing Finnish airfields. (United Press, 2nd)

Editorial

### An Analysis of Soviet Actions

The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland demonstrates that its negotiations with Finland over the past two months were merely a facade. The war has only been raging for three days, but given the Soviet Union's immense strength and careful planning, Finland, despite its best efforts, is not strong enough to resist. Moreover, there are traitors within Finland selling out their country and colluding with violent neighbors. Adding to this, the European continent is shrouded in the clouds of war, with powerful nations preoccupied and weak nations living in fear, so although international interests, grievances, and favors are complex and intertwined, Finland's appeals go unheard. Because of all this, we do not need to wait for the Soviet Union to occupy all of Finland to boldly predict that Finland will inevitably be unfortunate. Perhaps there is hope in one of two scenarios: first, that the Soviet Union has absolutely no ambition to annex Finland, whether militarily, politically, formally, or spiritually, and only seizes three or five strategically important locations for its own use, allowing Finland to remain an absolutely independent and free nation; second, that the Soviet-Finnish war is prolonged, and before the Soviet Union achieves total victory, the scope of the war expands immeasurably, making the Soviet-Finnish war a small part of a world war, which the two countries cannot resolve on their own and must await the restructuring of human thought and the establishment of international principles. In short, awaiting a global solution. These two hopes are not inherently impossible, but we still find them exceptionally remote. A newly emerging and refined peaceful nation is suddenly struck by a seemingly irresistible catastrophe, like a brilliant and handsome youth suddenly afflicted with a deadly plague, with no cure and life hanging by a thread; all those with a sense of justice cannot help but shed tears of sympathy!

The psychological and emotional impact of this Soviet action on the world is almost indescribably strong. We have historically been quite distant from Finland, with virtually no cultural, political, or commercial ties. Conversely, our relationship with the Soviet Union is far deeper, encompassing material, spiritual, and emotional aspects. However, even deep friendship cannot shake the judgment of right and wrong dictated by conscience, and intense stimulation can only be restrained by basing it on deep friendship to suppress its overflowing reaction. Therefore, concerning the current Soviet-Finnish issue, rather than offering stern criticism, it is better to attempt a lateral explanation.

Analyzing Soviet actions: it believes that the current European war is the Second World War of imperialism, and that this world war did not begin today, with the September 18 Incident years ago already being the beginning of this war. However, the Italian-Abyssinian War, the Spanish Civil War, Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia and Austria, and even the Sino-Japanese War in the East since the September 18 Incident were all imperialist aggressions against weak nations and small countries; while the current European war is imperialists fighting among themselves, a new stage in the world war. In the previous stage, the Soviet Union's strategy was to organize a united front of democratic nations and weak nations to oppose aggressive fascism; in the current new stage, the Soviet Union's strategy has changed. It hates fascist imperialism and even more so anti-fascist imperialism. This is certainly not because fascist theories and spirits are superior to anti-fascist ones, causing the Soviet Union to hate them to different degrees; rather, it is because the Soviet Union, based on its own interests and communist system, weighs the advantages and disadvantages, distinguishes between urgent and less urgent matters, and thus differentiates between friends and enemies. The most cynical view is that the Soviet Union's differentiation between friends and enemies has facilitated the European war and even seeks to manipulate it into becoming a world war. In reality, the existence of contradictions between fascism and anti-fascism will inevitably lead to war; the scope of that war, whether involving several nations, all of Europe, or the entire world, depends entirely on the two sides of the contradiction and does not require the Soviet Union to facilitate or manipulate it. The Soviet Union has simply seized the opportunity of the current new stage, never hesitating, never letting go, and doing several things most beneficial to its own interests. Striving for the most beneficial to its own interests is the most basic desire; the so-called strategy of the previous stage and the strategy of the current stage have already changed at a very large angle, and even greater angle changes are not surprising or magical; because any change, any strategy, does not violate its consistent spirit of striving to implement its desires! It just so happens that fascist leaders covet every chestnut and possess the fearless spirit of plucking chestnuts from the fire; thus, they complement each other, evolving into the current situation of raging flames.

In past years, because of poverty, the Soviet Union declared a change in style, promising not to actively promote its communist system to other countries, in exchange for international resources. Then, it proceeded with comprehensive construction: this declaration originally could not nullify the supranational nature of its system. Its nature is such, so the partition of Poland and the invasion of Finland are, in its subjective view, entirely right, with absolutely no wrong. To be more precise: regarding Poland, the world sees this as a partition by the Soviet Union and Germany, but from the Soviet perspective, it is not a so-called partition. It only believes that the environmental situation at the time dictated that it should, in fact, extend beyond its original boundaries to the boundaries it now occupies: as for the remaining part, it is not considered to be given to Germany through partition but is simply regarded as not yet belonging to the Soviet Union. Regarding Finland, the world considers the Soviet Union's so-called feeling of being threatened by Finland to be a shameless lie; in reality, it is not a lie. The Soviet Union under the communist system genuinely believes that non-communist countries outside its borders are all threats to the Soviet Union, with Finland being only one aspect of that threat. If one were to say that the equator threatens the frigid zone, that the Southern Ocean threatens the Arctic Ocean, this, in Soviet logic, is definitely not incomprehensible. Based on this logic, expanding its defense into other countries' territories, constituting class struggle within those countries, is sufficient to enhance the security of the Soviet Union and weaken threats to the Soviet Union, all of which are the norm for the Soviet Union, and are part of the international topic!

If it is beneficial to befriend fascism, then befriend fascism; if it is convenient to take Finland, then take Finland: benefit and convenience are the principles of all Soviet actions. Participating in any aspect of the current stage of the war in violation of the principles of benefit and convenience is what the Soviet Union will certainly not do. If Britain and France fear Soviet participation in the war, this is a groundless worry. If Japan wants the Soviet Union to abandon its own interests and collude with it, this is limited by the necessary conditions that Japan must have the determination to "fight" with other imperialists and not create the possibility of Japan threatening the Soviet Union, increasing Japan's territory and power of threat to the Soviet Union. Japan does not have this determination and violates this condition, then thinking of colluding with the Soviet Union is delusional. The reason why China can maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union is that China fundamentally overflows with a non-threatening mediocrity.

### New Finnish Cabinet Formed; Willing to Seek Honorable Peace, On Condition that Independence and Sovereignty Are Not Compromised; Will Resist Violent Aggression with All Efforts

Helsinki - After the resignation of the Cajander cabinet, Risto Ryti, Governor of the Bank of Finland, has formed a new cabinet, which has now been established. The cabinet members are as follows:

Prime Minister: Risto Ryti (Governor of the Bank of Finland)
Foreign Minister: Väinö Tanner (Former Finance Minister)
Interior Minister: Ernst von Born (Leader of the Swedish People's Party, former Minister without Portfolio)
Defense Minister: Juho Niukkanen (Immediate appointment)
Finance Minister: Mauno Pekkala (Former Minister of Agriculture)
Minister of Justice: Johan Otto Söderhjelm (Leader of the Swedish People's Party)
Minister without Portfolio: Juho Kusti Paasikivi (Former Envoy to Sweden) (Havas, 1st) According to sources, the new Prime Minister Ryti is not a well-known figure in politics. Foreign Minister Tanner, the former Minister of Finance, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been to the Soviet Union to participate in the Moscow talks. What is noteworthy about the new cabinet is the appointment of the envoy to Sweden, Paasikivi, as Minister without Portfolio. Paasikivi was the chief representative who participated in the Moscow talks. (Haitong, 1st)

New York - Risto Ryti, the former Governor of the Bank of Finland and current Prime Minister, issued a broadcast today stating, "We are willing to negotiate all issues, but we are not prepared to relinquish our independence or our right to decide our own affairs." He also said, "The Finnish people demand the right to continue to achieve their political independence." (Reuters, 2nd)

The Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Astrom, also spoke to the press here, saying that the new cabinet is a coalition cabinet including all parties and factions, and will continue to pursue an independent and neutral policy. The "puppet government" established by the Soviet Union in our country is enough to prove the value of the declaration previously issued by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In short, the policy pursued by the Soviet Union is to incorporate Finland into its territory and endow it with Bolshevik-style freedom. (Havas, 2nd)

London - Following the formation of the new Finnish cabinet, well-informed sources here stated that while the new cabinet is prepared to negotiate with the Soviet authorities to seek an honorable peace, if the Soviet Union continues its aggression, Finland will resolutely resist to the end. Given that the Soviet Union has established a "Finnish Revolutionary Government" in the Karelian region, it is clear that Finland's attempt to propose honorable peace terms to the Soviet Union has very little hope of success. (Havas, 1st)

### Foreign Minister Tanner Speaks

Helsinki - The new Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, in an interview yesterday with a reporter from the "Social Democratic Newspaper" of Helsinki, declared, "The previous government considered the situation too serious, and the only way to make way for the virtuous and form a coalition government was to resign. Our strong neighbor, Soviet Russia, wants to eliminate the Finnish nation and force us to accept unacceptable conditions. This is the situation that the new government is addressing. We will do our best to find out whether understanding with the Soviet Union is possible. We consider safeguarding Finland's independence and security to be the only issue of the new government; all other issues are set aside." (Haitong, 2nd)

### First Meeting of the New Finnish Cabinet

Helsinki - The Ryti cabinet held its first meeting at 6 PM today to discuss current issues. According to official statements, the members of the "Communist Government" established in Terijoki are all domestic fugitives who recently returned from the Soviet Union and are insufficient to represent public opinion. (Havas, 2nd)

### Policy Guidelines Passed by Parliament

Zurich - According to news from Helsinki, after the establishment of the new cabinet, the Finnish parliament held a meeting in an air raid shelter this morning and immediately unanimously approved the cabinet's policy guidelines. (Havas, 2nd)

### Finnish Commander-in-Chief Encourages Troops

Helsinki - Finnish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Mannerheim today issued a general order to all troops, encouraging every soldier to fulfill their duty, stating, "The war for our independence is still continuing. We are now entering the final stage. We are fighting for our country." (Reuters, 2nd)

### Red Government Established Within Finland; Current Organization is Provisional; Soviet Union has Officially Recognized It

Moscow - News from Leningrad: A "new government" called the "People's Government of the Democratic Republic of Finland" has been established in the Finnish border town of Terijoki today. It is jointly composed of representatives from Finnish left-wing parties and defecting Finnish soldiers. The list of members of the new government is as follows: "Chairman" and "Foreign Minister": Otto Kuusinen; "Finance Minister": Mauri Rosenberg; "Defense Minister": Akseli Anttila; "Interior Minister": Tuure Lehén; "Agriculture Minister": Armas Äikiä; "Education Minister": Inkeri Lehtinen; "Minister for Karelian Affairs": Paavo Prokkonen. The "People's Government" has also issued a declaration announcing its "Political Program." (TASS, 1st)

Moscow - The Chairman and Foreign Minister of the Finnish People's Government, Kuusinen, yesterday sent an official document to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, stating that the Finnish People's Government has been established and proposing the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Finnish Democratic Republic. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet immediately decided to recognize the Finnish People's Government and establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Finnish Democratic Republic. (TASS, 2nd)

Helsinki - The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Finnish "People's Government," Kuusinen, was born in 1881 and joined the Communist Party in 1905. From 1918 to 1919, he was a member of the revolutionary government. After Finland seceded from Russia, Kuusinen was very active in the Communist Party, serving as the chairman of the Finnish Communist Party and the secretary of the Executive Committee. (Haitong, 2nd)

Berlin - According to a Moscow dispatch received by the German official news agency, the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party today issued a statement explaining the basis on which the Soviet Union could immediately cease hostilities and negotiate peace as follows: (1) The formation of a democratic people's government; (2) The conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland; (3) Certain changes in the national and economic life structure of Finland, but not the Bolshevization of Finland. (Reuters, 1st)

### Declaration

Moscow: This station has just received a broadcast declaration from the People's Government of Finland as follows (translated from Finnish broadcast):

"The Provisional People's Government of Finland, based on the will of the people who hate the vicious policies of the Kallio and Tanner governments, was established today in eastern Finland. This government calls on all the people of the country to rise up and overthrow the tyrannical rule of those butchers and challengers. In 1918, those reactionary wealthy rulers, relying on the power of foreign imperialists, destroyed the democracy and freedom of our working masses, turning our country into a prison controlled by the White Guards. After selling out Finland's independent rights and interests, they united with the imperialists, the common enemy of the Finnish and Soviet peoples, and incited anti-Soviet war in every possible way, finally leading our country into war with our friend, the socialist Soviet Union. Under this kind of crisis, the Finnish working masses, who have always wished to coexist peacefully with the Soviet people, have no choice but to rise up and save the fate of their motherland and exercise their sacred powers. Now, the people in various parts of the country have risen up and declared the organization of a democratic republic. Some soldiers have also joined the new People's Government. The Soviet Union has never threatened or disturbed our country. On the contrary, it has always respected our country's independence and has repeatedly tolerated the challenging actions of the Finnish White rulers for twenty years. However, today the Soviet Union has no choice but to use the power of the Red Army to stop the threat to its independence. This goal is also completely in line with the interests of our people. Therefore, the Finnish people unanimously welcome the Red Army, knowing that its entry into Finland is not to conquer our country, but to liberate our people. The People's Government firmly believes that the Soviet Union has no intention of harming our country's independence, so it also supports the Red Army's actions within our country, believing that the Soviet Union's purpose is to help our people and work together with our people to eliminate the war bases created by the malicious challenger government in our country. To complete this task, the People's Government welcomes the Soviet government to provide all necessary assistance to the Finnish Democratic Republic through the Red Army.

In order to fight together with the Soviet Red Army, the People's Government has organized the First Finnish Corps. In future battles, this corps will absorb revolutionary workers and peasants who volunteer to join the army at any time, becoming the backbone of the future Finnish People's Army. This First Corps will raise high the national flag of the Finnish Democratic Republic, enter the capital, and plant it on the Presidential Palace, making all the people rejoice and the enemies tremble. Our country must become a democratic republic that serves the people, different from the rich republic of capitalists, landlords, and running dogs like Kallio and others. But our country is not a Soviet country, because the Soviet regime cannot be established by the government's sole power without regard to the public opinion of the people, especially the peasants. Therefore, our government is the People's Government of the Finnish Democratic Republic, backed by the broad laboring people's front. The current organization of the People's Government is of a provisional nature. After moving to the capital Helsinki and being formally recognized, its organization will be expanded to include representatives of all parties participating in the laboring people's front. Its final organization, its powers, and its actions will be approved by the parliament elected based on universal, equal, direct participation, and secret ballot.

The People's Government recognizes that its primary tasks are to overthrow the Finnish White Guard government, defeat its armed forces, conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, and establish permanent friendly relations, thereby guaranteeing Finland's independence and security. The People's Government has proposed to the Soviet government the signing of a Finnish-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and, in accordance with the wishes of the Finnish nation, to reunite the Karelian people with independent Finland. The People's Government firmly believes that its resolute policy of friendship with the Soviet Union will enable the Soviet Union to accept this proposal. The People's Government is willing to maintain friendly relations with all other countries and recognizes Finland's economic and financial obligations to other countries, provided that these obligations do not violate Finland's sovereignty and that other countries do not take hostile steps against the Finnish Democratic Republic and its government."

### Policy Outline

Regarding domestic affairs, the People's Government has determined the following policies: (1) Establish the Finnish People's Army; (2) Private large-scale banks and industries will be subject to government control, while efforts will be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises; (3) Implement measures to eliminate unemployment; (4) Reduce working hours to eight hours per day and stipulate that each worker or employee should have two weeks of summer vacation; (5) Confiscate the land belonging to large landowners, but will not violate the land property of farmers, and will distribute the confiscated land to farmers who originally had no land or very little land; (6) Exempt farmers from overdue taxes; (7) The state will provide assistance in developing the economy of poor peasants, first by providing more land, pastures, and even forests if necessary, to poor peasants for their needs. This land is confiscated from large landowners; (8) Democratize all state organs and courts; (9) Increase state funding for cultural needs and improve schools. All workers and other children who cannot afford to attend school will be given the opportunity to study, and close attention will be paid to the development of public education, science, literature, and art.

According to recent news, the Kallio wealthy government, which has plunged the country into ruin and is hated by the people, has now resigned due to being abandoned by the people, and the Tanner government has been organized to replace it. However, Tanner and Kallio are both public enemies of the people, and their government is of the same ilk as Kallio's, both hated by our people. Our people must drive out these butchers and overthrow all bankrupt government party members. All Finnish working masses must rise up to resist the oppression and tyranny of the butchers, protect our country's future, throw off the heavy burden on our people's shoulders, and clear the obstacles ahead, in order to strive for the cultural well-being of the people, which is the wish of our nation for thousands of years. Strive for the victory of the cause of Finnish workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves, and march towards victory under the banner of the independent and free Finnish Democratic Republic." December 1, 1939 (TASS dispatch on the 1st)

### Molotov Issues Statement, Government Reorganization in Finnish Capital Deemed Useless

Moscow: Molotov recently issued a statement to the United States regarding the development of the Finnish issue, stating that the resignation of the Kallio government and its replacement by the Tanner government is, in fact, useless. Tanner is clearly not a suitable candidate. Tanner was an ominous figure in the recent Soviet-Finnish negotiations. If the Soviet-Finnish negotiations had not been attended by Tanner and were presided over by Paasikivi, the negotiations would have been successfully concluded. Tanner's participation has completely failed the negotiations and has bound Paasikivi, preventing him from fully exerting his talents. In view of this fact, the Soviet Union knows that the Tanner government will not help the matter. Moreover, the Finnish People's Government organized by Kuusinen has been established, and important facts make the Soviet Union expect to obtain a peaceful and satisfactory solution. (TASS dispatch on the 2nd)

### Soviet War Report

Moscow: According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, the troops in the Leningrad Military District continued to advance yesterday: (1) Soviet troops advanced westward from the northern port of Murmansk and have occupied the port of Petsamo; (2) Those advancing westward from the city of Libera have approached the Namsi railway station; (3) Those crossing the border from the two towns of Porusajärvi and Pitäjäätskoski have penetrated 25 kilometers into Finnish territory; (4) The Soviet army in the Karelian Isthmus has reached the mouth of the Töppölänjoki River (along Lake Ladoga) and occupied the Raida station on the Koivisto railway, and then crossed the city of Terijoki, occupying the intersection of the cities of Zelenogorsk and Vammelsuu, advancing along the railway towards Koivisto. The retreating Finnish army burned villages and forced the people to evacuate. The Finnish Air Force attempted to bomb the Soviet army in the Karelian Isthmus, but was repelled by the Soviet Air Force. When Soviet aircraft carried out bombing raids, Finnish aircraft attempted to engage Soviet aircraft, resulting in the downing of ten Finnish aircraft, while two Soviet aircraft did not return to base. (TASS dispatch on the 2nd)

### Eastern Newspaper Commentary on Soviet-Finnish Situation

Tokyo: Today, various newspapers in this city have commented on the Soviet-Finnish conflict. The Japan Broad Knowledge News, under the title "Pure Aggression," stated that apart from the Soviet Union and Germany, no one has failed to express sympathy for Finland upon hearing this news. The "China and Foreign Commercial News" also condemned the actions taken by the Soviet Union, but stated that if the United States, Britain, and France do not immediately provide Finland with effective assistance, they will abandon their right to speak on the new situation in East Asia. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that it is unknown whether the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States will provide assistance to Finland, but even if they do, it may not be very effective, because the resources and military equipment of the Soviet Union and Finland are too disparate. It also stated that after the end of the Finnish incident, the Soviet Union may focus its attention on the Ruthenian region, even if friction occurs with Italy, it will not care. Observing the different attitudes of Germany and Italy towards the Soviet Union's attack on Finland this time, everything can be foreseen. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

### Three American Officials Meet in the Philippines

Manila: The United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, the United States Consul to Shanghai, Gauss, and the Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hord, held a special meeting in Baguio today, lasting two hours. Sayre declined to say much afterwards, only stating that the discussion was about how the three would cooperate in their duties in the Far East. Also, Sayre and Hord inspected Philippine officer cadets this morning. Sayre is scheduled to return to Manila on Sunday to prepare for a tour of the Philippine Islands. Admiral Hord plans to return to Manila next week. It is heard that Gauss and his family will stay in the Philippines for Christmas before returning to Shanghai. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

### Suining Province War Achievements in the Past Six Months

Xi'an: All aspects of the Party, government, and military in Suining Province have been adjusted and unified in the past six months, and have made rapid progress and outstanding achievements. Judging from the war achievements alone, it is quite in line with accumulating small victories to make big victories, and achieving the goal of consuming Japanese resources. There were 95 battles of various sizes in the past six months, 21 in April, 15 in May, 10 in June, 6 in July, 18 in August, 13 in September, and 14 in October, killing a total of 4,131 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 163 horses, 377 rifles, 21 machine guns, shooting down one plane, destroying 92 cars, and capturing one car. In addition, one Japanese political instructor, Fujisawa, and one puppet reconnaissance chief, Guo Zhongyi, were captured. Comprehensive observation of the recent situation shows that all the installations set up by Japan on the Ping-Sui Line are intended to be permanent in nature. For example, roads and bunkers are built with foreign cement and steel bars, and the Ping-Sui Line is deliberately managed. The bridges along the line from Baotou to Guyang are all new-style engineering. The Baotou Japanese airfield is large in scale and is the best in North China. The construction of the aircraft depot is particularly huge. All of these are sufficient to prove that Japan wants to permanently occupy the border area of ​​Suimeng and expresses its determination to prepare for war against Mongolia and the Soviet Union.

### Ding Muhan Predicts the End of the Japanese Army

Chongqing: Ding Muhan (Jin Jie) is a senior in the Chinese military, proficient in strategy, and famous in the north and south. A Central News Agency reporter recently showed his two articles (Prediction of the Japanese Ending) on his views on the Sino-Japanese war situation, asserting that Japan will one day take off its military uniforms, surrender its arms, and surrender. The gist of his article is: "Japan has banned the people from eating eggs in exchange for military supplies. It has ordered bathhouses to close to save coal to make military supplies. It has banned the people from wearing leather shoes and making new clothes to supply military uniforms. His financial and material resources are exhausted, which is conceivable. He has ordered 30,000 overseas Chinese in China to enlist in the army, and his small population is also conceivable. Some people have raised questions, 'Since Japan has clearly seen that there is only a dead end ahead, why doesn't it withdraw its troops and escape?' I think that Japan will never dare to withdraw its troops happily. This is equivalent to us fighting for another hundred years and not being able to negotiate peace before the Japanese army withdraws from the country, because we can never recognize the 'September 18th' invasion as an accomplished fact, so we must resist the war. The goal of resisting the war cannot be achieved in one day, and we cannot negotiate peace in one day. This is our interpretation of resisting the war to the end. As for him, the Japanese warlords have exhausted their big words. Didn't they say that 500 million military expenses, three divisions of troops, and five months of time would completely solve the 'China Incident'? Not only his own emperor and people are used to hearing these words, but Westerners have also heard enough of them. Now, if he suddenly withdraws his troops, not only will Westerners laugh at him, will the people of his own country silently agree? Moreover, can the country contain more than one million Japanese soldiers? And there is a deficit of 20,000 million yuan, can this account be submitted? Therefore, his future result is only that the soldiers themselves take off their military uniforms, drop their guns and cannons and ask us to take them in as ordinary people. At this time, their rulers have been eliminated. This time is not very far away, as early as next spring, and at the latest it will not pass the autumn of next year. Now is the time for our people to be united on a single front, unanimously obey the supreme leader, and finally contribute money, shed blood and sweat. Not only do we not agree to negotiate peace, but we also do not hope that Japan will withdraw its troops safely and happily, so as to avoid future troubles for our descendants."

### Roosevelt States Attitude Towards Soviet Union Under Consideration, Possibility of Severing Relations Between U.S. and Soviet Union, American Aircraft Factories No Longer Supplying Military Aircraft to Soviet Union

Washington - President Roosevelt today read a formal statement at a press conference, stating that he will discuss the situation in the Baltic Sea with congressional leaders by telephone, but he does not intend to convene a formal meeting. Before the Soviet Union invaded Finland, the United States issued a diplomatic note expressing its willingness to mediate the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland, but the Soviet Union has not yet responded. The United States now publicly and formally stands on the side of Finland, which is one of the various steps currently being discussed in the United States to show the attitude of the United States towards the actions of the Soviet Union. There is still the possibility of recalling the American ambassador to Moscow to return home for consultations and severing diplomatic relations with Finland. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Washington - President Roosevelt told a government official here yesterday that due to the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, he was under great pressure from influential people to sever relations with the Soviet Union. It is said that the President stated that he and Secretary of State Hull did not intend to make a hasty decision on this issue. Rumors here are that the Soviet representative in the United States is trying to order a large number of American aircraft from the United States. The government departments responsible for implementing the Neutrality Act yesterday considered the possibility of implementing an informal ban on arms exports to the Soviet Union, similar to the current moral sanctions against Japan. In October, the Soviet Union purchased only US$8,800 worth of aircraft from the United States. In 1939, the Soviet Union purchased aircraft, propellers, and engines worth a total of US$1,066,000 from the United States. At this time, Democratic Congressman Tiah claimed that he would submit a resolution to the next Congress to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He stated that the Soviet invasion of Finland was a "reprehensible matter." The United States recognizes this as the first wrong step by the Soviet Communist government. Republican Congressmen Fish and Sun expressed similar opinions. Democratic Congressman Panjin requested the government to "strive to eliminate the forces of the Communist Party in the United States." Republican Senator Bo Shu claimed that severing diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union would not help world peace and would not help Finland resist the Soviet invasion. The Soviet Union's actions are indeed surprising, but "we must remember that when building world peace, the United States must be in a position to speak. I feel that we can best maintain peace and humanitarianism by striving to maintain normal relations with all warring countries." (2nd United Press dispatch)

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull indicated today while hosting a press conference that the United States will impose a "moral" ban on aircraft and munitions bound for the Soviet Union when it receives more detailed official reports. He also said that the same ban will also be applied to Japan. The Department of the Army has just announced that it will no longer allow military supplies to be shipped to the Soviet Union.

New York - According to the Washington Bangbao today, American aircraft manufacturers have stopped supplying military aircraft to the Soviet Union. A delegation from the Soviet government has been rushing to various factories to buy all kinds of fighter planes with huge amounts of cash, but no one responded.

The ship had no armored protection and was patrolling the North Atlantic. Once it encountered a German warship with modern equipment, it was naturally unable to resist.

The Royal Navy's sixty cruisers were scattered across the oceans, and it was necessary to temporarily assign the patrol mission to "Rawalpindi." (2nd Haitong dispatch)

### Japan's Relationship with Britain and the Soviet Union Is Delicate

London - Regarding the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, all Japanese newspapers disapprove of the Soviet Union's actions, which is attracting great attention here. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union wants to resolve various outstanding issues with Japan in the Far East in order to be able to act freely in Europe. Judging from the comments made by Japanese newspapers, this Soviet attempt may not succeed. In addition, the Soviet Union and Japan will conduct business negotiations within a short period of time. Soviet newspapers are doing their best to reduce the importance of these negotiations, saying that what Japan is requesting is to obtain fishing rights. In view of this, British people believe that in order to ease the situation in the Far East and to satisfy its ambitions in Europe, the Soviet Union may pay Japan a heavy price. In other words, it may propose to Japan issues other than fishery issues, thereby seeking a solution. This is what Japan would like to obtain a temporary understanding with in China. However, the agreement that Japan and the Soviet Union can reach is a truce agreement for those who are tired of war, not a true agreement. Because the Soviet Union has not clearly explained what ambitions it has for China, Xinjiang Province may become a true protectorate of the Soviet Union, and Japan is not without concern. As for the relationship between Britain and Japan, after the British government announced a blockade of German exports, Japan threatened to take retaliatory measures, and relations between the two sides became tense. Regarding this matter, the British government has already made some concessions. Goods purchased by various neutral countries from Germany, the money of which has been paid, will still be released. Tokyo has thus been impressed and there is a possibility of reaching an understanding between the two sides. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### London Times Military Correspondent Hart Resigns

Amsterdam - Political figures in London are extremely surprised by the resignation of Captain Hart, the famous military expert of "The Times," and his replacement by Captain Fours.

The above two points are slightly different from the current general public opinion in the United Kingdom, so "The Times" hired another military reporter to replace this most famous military writer in the United Kingdom.

### Submarine Warfare and Minefields

— London Correspondence

Economics is always the background of war. The focus of the Second European War is on the sea. Observing the intensity of submarine bombings and the strictness of mine blockades, one can imagine. British merchant ships that are not equipped with cannons do not dare to travel alone in the dangerous areas of the Atlantic Ocean. They generally travel in groups, accompanied and protected by large warships on the left and right, with submarines advancing on the left and right to open the way and guard the rear. This is called the Convoy System in English, and can also be translated as the escort system. If a British merchant ship discovers an enemy mine at sea, the simplest way to destroy the mine is to telegraph nearby waiting fishing boats to use the speed of their motors to find and remotely strike with cannons. The dangerous area of the sea in the Second European War extends from 60 degrees north latitude, the northernmost part of British territory, the Shetland Islands, to 30 degrees north latitude, the west coast of French Morocco in Africa, with 15 degrees west longitude of the Atlantic Ocean as the boundary to the west, and to the east from the French coast, including the North Sea along the coasts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, England and Germany, as well as the East Sea, i.e., the Baltic Sea along the coasts of Sweden, Germany and Denmark. As shown in the attached map, the British and German sides have densely laid minefields in the North Sea, with German minefields protecting the west coast of Germany and British minefields protecting the east coast of England. In addition, a large British minefield blocks the German coastline. A large sandy beach straddling 1 degree to 5 degrees east longitude is sandwiched in the middle. The northern route is completely blocked, and the southern route is blocked north of 51 degrees north latitude directly opposite the mouth of London, leaving only a shallow waterway between the east coast of England and the La Sandettie sandbar, which is not laid with mines to allow entry and exit. Apart from the territorial waters within three nautical miles of the coast of neutral countries, which are non-mine areas, anywhere else, any ship of any country is at risk of hitting a mine if it does not carefully follow the safe waterways that are left out. In the cold season from November to March of the following year, the wind and waves on the sea increase, and mines placed below sea level must break free and float to the surface. If the current is rapid at this time, even ships 50 miles away from the minefield will inevitably be sunk.

There are two types of mines. One type is used to destroy submarines, and must sink to the seabed before floating up, remaining at a depth of 80 to 100 feet (about 30 meters) below the sea surface, surrounded by tentacles to form a net. If a submarine mistakenly passes by, even if it does not come close to the mine but slightly touches the tentacles, it can explode. During the four-year European War last time, German submarines destroyed in this way accounted for a quarter. There is no way to escape from an underwater explosion. Of all the death-defying adventures in the world, the people in submarines are undoubtedly the most courageous. The other type of mine is to destroy all sizes of ships on the sea surface. The depth at which it stays in the water should vary depending on the size and type of the ship. For example, if a large warship comes to a calm sea with no wind before high tide, and the mine below it is 12 yards (about 8 meters) deep in the water, it may be lucky enough to pass through without exploding. However, the tides rise and fall indefinitely during the day. For example, in Bristol Channel on the west coast of England, the tides rise and fall 40 feet (about 13 meters) every day, so it can find the dangerous time to explode. In just a few minutes within 24 hours, the mine hitting the sea and avoiding it depends on precise calculations. The degree of danger is just like a bomb falling from the air, not everyone is without a chance to escape. The height at which a mine stays in the sea is first carefully calculated based on the water pressure at different depths below the sea surface to make it self-assemble and move accurately. A mine is a large sphere, weighing 700 to 800 kilograms and has a diameter of 3 feet 6 inches (more than one meter), larger than a round table. The surface of the sphere is covered with glass bubbles that break upon impact, containing chemical materials that can generate electricity and heat. The cost of each mine is about 200 British pounds. There has been no major change in the past 25 years. At the end of the First European War, the United Kingdom used as many as 120,000 mines to cut across the North Sea. If the mines are placed in the sea without specialized patrol boats to cut the cables to destroy them, it is feared that they will still explode upon contact for two years after the armistice, and will harm ocean traffic.

### Ministry of Education's Improvement: Social Education Plan (3) Cultivating and Guaranteeing Social Education Personnel Implementing Special and Relief Education

(D) Compiling, reviewing, and promoting popular reading materials for social education. The compilation of various teaching materials is of great importance. In the past, the Ministry of Education had compiled two types of textbooks and teaching methods for people's schools, and one type each for abacus textbooks and teaching methods. Recently, it organized a committee to compile popular self-study textbooks, patriotic story songs, comic strips, and other popular reading materials. In addition to the Ministry designing and directly promoting these materials, various provinces and cities should assist in promoting them to ensure they are recited in every household. Popular reading materials already circulating in various provinces, counties, and cities should be reviewed, and local worthy stories, local teaching materials, novels, songs, etc., should be compiled to ensure that harmful reading materials disappear from the public and those circulating are rich in educational meaning. The methods are as follows:

(1) In addition to continuing to compile and print supplementary reading materials for the public, the Ministry of Education should also compile two sets of "Must-Read for Citizens," providing a comprehensive and concise description of China's history, geography, politics, morality, etc., so that the general public can have a clear understanding of Chinese culture. In addition to compiling these teaching materials into reading materials, it is also planned to compile the content into materials for movies, slides, broadcasts, music, dramas, storytelling, etc., to achieve the effect of educating the public.

(2) Excellent popular reading materials edited, reviewed, and announced by the Ministry of Education should be promoted by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities using the following methods:

a. Issue orders to all social education institutions and schools under their jurisdiction to adopt them.

b. Issue orders to all public education centers under their jurisdiction to contact and train local ballad singers to perform them widely.

c. Introduce them to bookstores and stalls to promote them on their behalf.

d. Imitate printing and distribution.

(3) The following types of popular reading materials should be reviewed by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, and those that are not good should be banned:

a. Novels, songs, plays, etc., that are already circulating among the people should be widely collected and reviewed. b. Newly published popular reading materials in the market should be required to be submitted for review by bookstores and publishers in accordance with the law.

c. Popular reading materials compiled and used by the education bureaus, sections, schools, and social education institutions of various counties and cities in the province should be submitted for review.

(4) Popular reading materials prohibited from publication by the Ministry of Education or central party and government agencies should be uniformly investigated and banned by the education administrative agencies of various provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the order.

(5) The following types of popular reading materials should be compiled by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities and submitted to the Ministry for review:

a. Supplementary teaching materials for public schools in the province and city.

b. Stories of local worthies, anti-Japanese war stories, legendary novels, ditties, plays, songs, proverbs, etc., in the province and city.

(E) Cultivating Social Education Personnel The success of social education is greatly related to the quality of the personnel. Social education is a difficult work, and those who handle it cannot succeed without a firm will and a spirit of hard work and endurance. Now that social education is becoming increasingly developed, it is imperative to establish specialized training institutions at all levels to cultivate service personnel. The methods are as follows:

a. In addition to the Ministry of Education planning to establish national social education personnel training institutions to cultivate senior personnel of central and provincial social education institutions in batches, each province should establish social education personnel training institutions according to the needs of social education development to provide general social education training and select various specialized skills in social education for group study.

b. Normal schools should add social education courses (emphasizing both theory and practice) to train primary school teachers to have the skills to concurrently handle social education.

(F) Guaranteeing Social Education Service Personnel Social education personnel and school teachers and staff both serve the country. They should go deep into the countryside at ordinary times regardless of the cold or heat. During wartime, they either face the front or travel thousands of miles, diligently teaching and enduring hardships. Therefore, cases of death or injury resulting in disability in the line of duty, whether in peacetime or wartime, are frequently seen. However, there are still no laws and regulations that can be cited for old-age care and pensions. In order to show the fairness of national treatment and to stimulate service enthusiasm, service personnel of social education institutions should receive the same old-age pensions and survivor benefits as teachers and staff of military academies. The methods are as follows:

The Ministry of Education should submit a request to the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations on old-age pensions and survivor benefits for school teachers and staff so that they apply equally to service personnel of social education institutions or to formulate separate regulations on old-age pensions and survivor benefits for service personnel of social education institutions.

(G) Supervising Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education

The Ministry of Education promulgated and implemented the Measures for Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education in May of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938]. However, school education has always been limited to the inside of schools, and this has become a deep-rooted habit, making it difficult to change. Now, in order to correct old concepts, expand the scope of education, make schools social and cultural centers, adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and complete the mission of the entire education, it is not easy to achieve consistent steps and obtain practical effectiveness without detailed regulations and effective implementation. Based on the actual situation and the minimum needs in fact, the following measures are proposed:

(1) Organization: a. Secondary schools and primary schools above the sixth grade should uniformly set up social education promotion committees to be responsible for designing and implementing social education matters in each school in order to achieve specific responsibilities. b. Each county, city, and autonomous region should gather people in charge of public education and Baojia personnel at all levels to organize social education promotion committees and set up a chief secretary to preside over social education matters in schools at all levels within the jurisdiction in order to facilitate progress.

(2) Training: a. The Ministry of Education will provide training to the people in charge of the social education promotion committees of secondary schools and above and other personnel who serve as the mainstays of concurrent social education in order to improve work efficiency. b. The competent education authorities of each province, city, and county should use holidays to convene and hold training sessions for the chief secretaries of the social education promotion committees of each county, city, and autonomous region and the personnel in charge of social education in primary and secondary schools.

(3) Work: a. In addition to teachers and staff being the main body of education in schools below the junior high school level, all teachers and students in schools above the junior high school level should be mobilized, and student service performance should account for an important part of moral conduct grades in order to strengthen their belief in service in the rear. b. Colleges and universities should each conduct two or more types of more specialized social education work based on their expertise and should delineate areas near the school to run social education implementation areas and implement civic education, livelihood education, and family education. c. Primary and secondary schools should conduct two or more types of social education work in accordance with the "Measures for Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education" promulgated by the Ministry of Education (such as popular lectures, wall newspapers, public art life guidance, achievement exhibitions, etc.) and should run public schools and family education classes.

### Ministry of Education Investigates the Service Situation of Normal School Students

(Chongqing Communication) The Ministry of Education believes that normal school graduates from national secondary schools have all been assigned to serve in accordance with the normal school student service regulations. However, the Ministry of Education has not yet fully understood the service situation of normal school students in various provinces after graduation. Therefore, in late last month, it instructed the education departments of various provinces to issue a ministerial order to report on the service locations assigned to normal school graduates in various provinces. The items are very detailed, and each department is required to fill out and report quickly without delay in order to collect and organize them for review.

### Education Briefs

Relief Center for Out-of-School Children: Ten compulsory primary schools have been added, and the city has been divided into twenty districts. Teachers and staff are being recruited, with slight stipends. Anyone interested can go to the center at 519 Edward Road, Pudong Fellow Association, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day to pick up an application form for registration.

### Today It Is Difficult to Eat Oil, Rice, Flour, and Wheat Are Very Expensive Is There Any Theory of Heaven

What people cannot do without for a day is firewood, rice, oil, and salt. In Shanghai people's lives, firewood is also important, but it only costs 1.8 yuan. Before the war, 1 yuan could buy ten buckets of the most common fuel, briquettes. Recently, due to competition from new factories, it once fell, but the day before yesterday it rose again and again, 70 yuan a ton, 3.8 yuan a load. Salt is filled with private salt, which is still considered cheap. Rice is unimaginable. They collude with each other. The hoarders are pushing up the price, and it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. No matter what people in the society criticize, they cannot move a single hair. The price has been rising frequently these days. Yesterday, the normal Ding Geng actually opened at 41 yuan, and Kunshan Geng rice was also above 39 yuan. The source is like this in the new Wang period. If there are no villains transporting from it, and no profiteers taking advantage of the fire to rob, the market price will never be so bad. What is suffering is the plight of Shanghai people, and no one is paying attention to it. Therefore, the courage to manipulate is getting bigger and bigger. Oil prices are manipulated more violently. Since Germany started the war, the supplement of domestic food has been to purchase soybeans in the three northeastern provinces in large quantities, and to order one million tons from Japan, which are transported to Germany by the Siberian Railway. Soybeans can be used as food and can be made into oil, and can also be used to make margarine, and gasoline (搿司林) can be extracted from the oil. Therefore, Japanese merchants are stirring up soybean oil in large quantities, and Shanghai oil merchants are stepping up hoarding. Yesterday, Qingdao soybean oil actually broke the 100 yuan mark. The market for flour and wheat will rise again tomorrow. Seeing this situation, the lives of ordinary people in Shanghai will have the feeling of "life is so difficult, is there any theory of heaven". Please see the details below.

The market for Dumi is still in the hands of the devil because the source is not prosperous. Therefore, the hoarders are using their tricks, rising and falling every day. It has become commonplace. The reason why hoarders dare to manipulate is (1) to use the fact that supply is needed and demand is strong, (2) to use the unstable hearts of people in the sound of expensive things, and (3) to rely on Ling Rong　as their backing. One principal can have three side effects. Yesterday, it seemed that there were few boats arriving at the river. Wheel buns were loaded with 145 cars from Su Tong Kun Tai, etc. The initial sales market was still limited, but the rise in foreign exchange and gold actually stirred people's hearts. The interest of the visitors rose again. Whenever one is mobilized, they will grab each other, fearing to fall behind. The shout of the visitors will be high, and the market price will see a new high price. Changding Geng once shouted over 43 yuan, and the closing price was 41 yuan. Changzhou Geng rice also knocked on the 40 yuan mark, opening at 39 yuan. As a result, thick Geng, thin rice, Luyang lost and other goods all rose by 1.5 yuan to 1 yuan. The total turnover was about 156,000 packs.

The arrival of Keqian is gradually surging. Two or three thousand packs of whole batches have gradually arrived in the Jiangbei area. Various places in Jingwu have also arrived one after another, and a large amount of foreign rice has been scheduled to arrive. The market seems to be gradually leveling off, but at the time of rising prices, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry are unanimously upward. In addition to the increase of guests as shops, the hoarders are even more greedy. With the shrinking of gold and the rise of foreign rice, Keqian has been raised by one yuan. Each Jiangbei Jingwu Xian has risen to about 36 yuan, and more than 3,000 packs have been sold.

Foreign rice is coming one after another. In addition to the transfer from Hong Kong, Saigon has also come to Shanghai one after another. However, with the rise of gold and the shrinking of foreign exchange, the later schedule will be more expensive. Annam Geng has reached a maximum of 36.5 yuan, and Saigon has also reached about 36 yuan. However, there were another 2,000 tons of new transactions yesterday, including 500 tons of Jianyuan No. 1, priced at 41.2 yuan, and 1,500 tons of Dafu, priced at 39.7 yuan for No. 2 and 38.2 yuan for Nos. 1 and 2.

The price of flour rose steadily yesterday. After the callback rose to 7 yuan, the factory goods have crossed the 8 yuan mark. This is because the gold market is rising, foreign exchange is shrinking, and the price of wheat raw materials has soared to a peak of 13 yuan. Therefore, people's hearts are rising day by day, and sellers insist on it. In order to maintain their own streets, factories still supply retail at the original price of 7.8 yuan, and customer sales have been stopped. It is reported that the recycled goods such as Cannon Cart and Pi have been raised to 8.23 yuan. The miscellaneous brand powder in the mainland is also welcomed by the local customers, and the price has also reached 7.34 yuan. The market environment is quite good, and the factory disk of 8 yuan at the beginning of next week will definitely be realized.

The trend of wheat is soaring. It is reported that a small number of goods arriving in Suchang were hoarded by guest hoarders and unwilling to sell. The intake of each factory is very good, and they still intend to choose skillfully. However, the market has long been stimulated by the environment. It is reported that the market traded ten cars of Suchang wheat yesterday, and the price has set a new peak of 13 yuan. It is also reported that the factory has also accepted the price of 13 yuan, but it has not yet been officially agreed. The market will open up at the beginning of next week.

The source of soybean oil is still gradually arriving in the form of baskets of oil, but it is difficult to relieve people's panic for a while. Although iron barrels of oil are available, the shocking price yesterday was unprecedented. Yesterday, Qingdao oil reached 103 yuan, and the market price of other oils increased by 78 yuan compared to the previous market. According to the opening, 15 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 103 yuan, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at 80 yuan, 100 loads of this factory's oil were priced at 83 yuan, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil road goods were priced at 77 yuan, and 200 pieces of Qingqi oil road goods were priced at 78 yuan.

Peanut oil is transferred according to soybean oil, so the market continues to follow the increase of 3 yuan. It is estimated that 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold for 75 yuan, 70 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were sold for 96 yuan, and 50 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil were sold for 97 yuan.

### Finance Cotton, Wheat, and Foreign Exchange Result in Huge Payments; Market Momentum Tightens for Six Consecutive Days; Futures Also See Active Closing

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange was due to Saturday being only a half-day of trading, which further intensified the upward trend, already sustained for six days. Yesterday's unofficial market was softer than HSBC's listed rates. This was likely due to the prevalence of rumors in the market in recent days, causing anxiety. Speculators revived old tricks, fueling the situation. Furthermore, other operators followed suit, and importers closed accounts for cotton and wheat. On the other hand, banks wanting to sell often bargained for higher prices, naturally creating an imbalance in supply and demand. The future remains difficult to predict. The day's process began with the American and British exchange rates rebounding to 1.875 points, then tightening to 0.03125, with prices at 4 shillings 6.6875, and 7 yuan 6.625. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and foreign firms actively bought in, and many payments for foreign wheat were made. Cotton yarn dealers also aggressively sought to buy. It was reported that Japanese firms Tohto Menka and Fukuya Yoko both entered the market to buy. Coupled with the willingness of Chinese banks and HSBC to absorb, the market briefly stabilized midway. However, by noon, the price had tightened to 4 shillings 4.4375 and 7 yuan 1.1875. By the afternoon close, British gold was still at 4 shillings 4.46875, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 2.25, tighter by 0.25 for British gold and softer by 0.34375 for American exchange compared to the previous day. As for the futures market, it was slightly more in line with the spot market, with no significant differences in the overall situation.

Foreign Banks Show Weak Willingness to Sell

In the morning, London broads were flat for both near and far terms, New York silver prices remained low, and London raw gold remained stable. Exchange rates for British versus American and versus French currencies remained stable. British versus Shanghai weakened by 0.0625, American versus British rebounded by 1.875 points, American versus Shanghai weakened slightly by 0.20, and American versus French strengthened significantly by 0.875. Central Bank listed rates for all currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 4 shillings 6.6875 for British gold and 7 yuan 6.625 for the American exchange rate, tighter by 0.03125 for British gold and harder by 0.03125 for American exchange compared to the previous close, due to the rebound in exchange rates. After opening, Chinese merchants were the first to buy in, and Chinese firms, foreign firms, and Japanese firms also competed to buy and close accounts, so the market immediately showed a softening trend. British gold went from 4 shillings 6.625 to 5.5625, and the American exchange rate went from 7 yuan 5.5625 to 4.4375. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and there were no increases or decreases announced for the silver equalization tax. There was a slight stabilization at one point, but the buying spree soon resumed. A certain flour mill also entered the market to buy and close accounts, and cotton yarn dealers, along with Japanese firms Tohto Menka and Fukuya Yoko, also competed to buy. At the same time, Chinese banks in Shanghai and Japanese banks aggressively bought futures. In addition, foreign banks were still reluctant to supply, and it was rumored that HSBC was also absorbing, so the market gradually tightened further. By noon, British gold was only 4 shillings 4.4375, and the American exchange rate was only 7 yuan 1.1875, with a small number of transactions reported. The afternoon close was slightly more stable, with banks' spot selling prices at 4 shillings 4.46875 for British gold and 7 yuan 2.25 for the American exchange rate. December British gold was at 4 shillings 4.4375, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 1.1875. As a result, spot British gold was tighter by 0.15 and spot American exchange was softer by 0.34375 compared to the previous day. Futures British gold was higher by 2.234375 and American exchange weakened by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Large Amount of Hong Kong Dollars Used to Purchase Gold; High Reaches 4,200 Yuan

Yesterday's cash gold bullion unofficial market saw prices soar daily. It was reported that the confirmed amount of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers used to purchase gold the previous night reached as much as one million Hong Kong dollars. The foreign exchange trend continued to tighten, boosting market sentiment. The market jumped by 105 yuan at the opening, to 4,150 yuan. Later, many profit-taking parties, such as silver shops and gold firms, sold at prices above 4,100 yuan, causing the price to fall back to 4,110 yuan twice. Soon after, money exchange firms, securities firms, and a certain gold firm entered the market to aggressively buy, reportedly on behalf of Hong Kong interests. The price then rose again to 4,170 yuan. However, a certain money exchange firm suddenly offered to sell on behalf of Hong Kong interests, causing retail investors to follow suit and dump, pushing the price down by 40 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market remained weak, and a certain money exchange firm aggressively bought on behalf of its client, pushing the price back up, reaching the day's high of 4,200 yuan. Subsequently, sellers who had set limit orders came into the market, and securities firms, silver shops, and many retail investors sold heavily due to today's holiday, providing an opportunity for Hong Kong interests to buy. By the close, the price had fallen slightly by 35 yuan, to 4,165 yuan, a sharp increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The off-market trend remained positive in the afternoon, with continued buying interest, and the price was above 4,170 yuan. Trading remained brisk in the half-day, with approximately 2,000 taels traded. Silver shop ornaments also closed at a price 10 yuan higher. Customs gold and other types remained flat.

Gold Bullion Rises Again by Hundreds of Yuan

Starting in the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the upward momentum from the previous two days. The report that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were used to purchase gold, reportedly amounting to a million Hong Kong dollars, intensified the bullish sentiment among buyers. When the exchange market opened weaker, market sentiment immediately surged, and buying orders boomed. Bullish parties seized the opportunity to aggressively raise prices. The opening price jumped by as much as 105 yuan by 9:30 AM. A money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,150 yuan. Shortly after, a certain gold firm suddenly pressed prices to sell, and retail investors also dumped at prices above 4,100 yuan, causing an immediate drop of 40 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 10 taels to a securities firm for 4,110 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying on behalf of Hong Kong interests, pushing the price up again by 30 yuan. A certain money exchange firm entered into a deal with a fellow firm for 20 taels, at 4,140 yuan. Later, silver shops and retail investors frequently sold, and Hong Kong interests had ceased buying, causing a fall of 30 yuan, returning to a low of 4,110 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms and gold firms again bought on behalf of Hong Kong interests, and securities firms also absorbed. As the exchange market continued to report weakness, the price soared by 60 yuan. A line exchange firm traded 30 taels with a gold firm, for 4,170 yuan. A certain money exchange firm, which had been buying on behalf of Hong Kong interests, suddenly offered to sell, amounting to approximately 200 taels, causing retail investors to follow suit and sell, immediately pushing the price back down by 40 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a leading firm for 4,130 yuan. After 11:30 AM, another money exchange firm aggressively bought on behalf of local interests. Given the tight exchange market trend, sellers disappeared, causing the price to rise rapidly. Soon after, it jumped by 70 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a silver shop, for 4,200 yuan. The influx of limit sell orders at 4,200 yuan halted the rising momentum. Subsequently, a certain silver shop affiliated with a securities firm, and many retail investors competed to sell. Hong Kong interests took the opportunity to bargain and absorb, and the price quickly fell back by 35 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm for 4,165 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. After the close, the price continued to fall to 4,150 yuan, but it soon rose again to 4,165 yuan. Saturday afternoon was a market holiday. The result, compared to the previous day, was a surge of 120 yuan. In the preceding three days, the price had risen quickly, totaling 299 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 90 yuan in the half-day. The selling price of cash shop brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of gold bullion, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Listed at 420 Yuan

The initial selling price of silver shop ornaments was 410 yuan per tael, maintained by the major firms. At 9:40 AM, the price was raised by 10 yuan. At 11:15 AM, it was raised by another 5 yuan. At noon, it fell back by 5 yuan. There were no further changes after that. The major firms ultimately changed the listed price to 420 yuan. The new firms had the same price as the major firms. The buying price was 15-20 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply; US Dollar Draft Reaches 13.85 Yuan

Yesterday, the demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, increased, and market prices rose further. Customers eagerly sought to close accounts for British and American gold drafts, causing market prices to rise sharply. The price of a US dollar draft reached 13.85 yuan. Market conditions eased slightly near noon, with the evening price at 13.67 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong drafts and French franc drafts was scarce, and market prices were firm. The demand for Japanese gold drafts was slightly stronger, and market prices rose slightly. The evening price was 1.25 yuan. Korean drafts were slightly weaker, with the evening price at 1.137 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by 2.50 yuan, British gold drafts rise by 2.20 yuan, American gold pounds rise by 3.00 yuan, American gold drafts rise by 0.52 yuan, Hong Kong drafts rise by 0.07 yuan, and French franc drafts rise by 0.003 yuan. There were no changes in other currencies.

### Securities; Bull and Bear Forces Neutralize in Foreign Stocks; Buyers Dominate Domestic Bonds

Yesterday's unofficial securities market was still weak. Class A and C shares broke through 7 yuan, and Class E shares also fell below 8 yuan. This was likely influenced by the sudden surge in gold bullion prices. For many days, the market has been difficult to rise or fall. Bullish forces are still strong. Based on recent trends, bearish forces may suffer previous losses. In the morning trading, Nos. 20 and 35, and Great Trade and Yuan Yu bought in. Yong Kang, Lian He, Run Li, and Yong Da Lian Yi sold out. In the afternoon, Yong Kang, Lian He, and Run Li continued to sell. Tai Feng, Da Tong, Chang Ji, and Hong Da all bought in. Observing this buying and selling lineup, the bullish parties were more bullish, and the bearish parties were more bearish, largely adhering to their consistent principles. Market prices ultimately fell by 0.10 to 0.30 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 25 shares of Qingfeng Textile Factory were traded at a price of 7 yuan each.

Yesterday's market for shares of various guilds saw a final five-minute rush to close positions, aligning with the tightening trend in foreign exchange. This caused the prices of various shares to fall again, resulting in a large transaction volume after the bull and bear forces were neutralized. At the close, activity among buyers was not uncommon at a reasonable price level. Rubber shares were also softened by a small number of floating positions, but the impact was clearly not as great as on industrial shares.

A London dispatch on the 1st reports that the market for Chinese Foreign Detective Police shares remained stable today. There were no changes in the official prices for upper and lower grades.

A London dispatch on the 1st reports that the market for shares of various British-owned Far East companies was generally calm today. Only the price of Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares rose sharply by 11 pence, to 21 shillings 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton and Yarn; Domestic and Foreign Cotton Markets; Dramatic and Extraordinary Rises

Common Cotton Raised to 160 Yuan; Japanese Factories Order Over 10,000 Bales of American Cotton

There was less domestic cotton trading than before, but the price increase was extraordinarily high. This was due to the continued rises in overseas American and Indian cotton markets, and the simultaneous shrinkage of drafts, leading to a rise in both official and unofficial prices. As a result, sentiment was extremely bullish. Most market participants holding goods were aware of the previous situation and claimed they had no goods to supply. Everyone closed their doors and refused to provide samples, resulting in reduced transactions. This situation resembled a cotton shortage. The prices quoted in the market were chaotic. The price of common cotton opened at 158 to 162 yuan in the morning, a sharp increase of 7-8 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, goods could not be obtained even at higher prices. This state of affairs was somewhat overly alarming. The source of supply from Northern Jiangsu was 2,318 bales of common cotton, and from North Sha, 1,880 bales. The situation of current cotton is recorded on the left:

White Bag Fire Machine 150.00 Traded Among Peers 160 Bales

American Cotton 165.00 Traded Among Peers 160 Bales

American Cotton 169.00 Traded Among Peers 200 Bales

Another report on foreign cotton market prices stated that the New York cotton market had seen a sharp rise in recent days. The consecutive rise had lasted nearly ten days. The opening yesterday morning was also due to the buying by speculators and increased overseas demand. Spot trading was very brisk. Dispatches from Liverpool and Mumbai both reported favorable conditions, resulting in extremely excited market sentiment. Short covering was very active. As a result, closing prices were over ten pound coins higher than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 3 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by over 40 pound coins, and Liverpool cotton rose by over 10 pence.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the increase in exchange rates caused a quietening of deals from Chinese factories. However, it was active for the Japanese factories. They are all making major acquisitions due to the trend of rising American cotton with the possibility of one jiao one or two points. Yesterday, over ten thousand bales were sold. The big reason for the rapid shrinkage of American exchange is the price of payments for the cotton. Here is the factory price sent to the factory after folding in the American exchange of 7 yuan 25 points.

20 Count American Middling 203.50

Also Also Grade Below 198.90

32 Count 201.85

42 Count 203.50

### Yarn Prices Rise Rapidly; Double Horse Reaches 700 Yuan Again

The yarn market became firm and prices rose dramatically. This was due to the continued advances in overseas European and American cotton markets, with the appearance of unlimited price increases. Meanwhile, there were reports that Japanese yarn was being transported for export and shipment to India, which also affected domestic yarn. Factory costs were also increasing daily, so speculative buying became active again. Sales have also ceased being as sluggish as in the past. Small-scale purchases by Hong Kong interests were more active. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn once reached a high of 700 yuan.

In the morning, peers discussed the current yarn market and the conversation quickly tightened, as the rise in Indian cotton was alarming. Buyers flocked to the market, and the situation was favorable. The opening price jumped 13 yuan, with 20-count Change Horse yarn at 690 yuan.

### Coal; Kailan Coal Prices Increase

Although new goods have recently arrived in succession, the "Manly Marler" ship brought another 5,600 tons of Kailan General Coal yesterday. The merchants and guest merchants in this street are handling them, with a tendency to sell as soon as they arrive.

### Western Shanghai Becomes a Den of Vice; Another Terrible Murder Occurs; A Bloody Human Head Found in Caojiadu; Body Also Discovered, Awaiting Examination

The areas outside the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement, where roads were built without authorization, have become a hotbed for crime since the Japanese and puppet regimes encroached on the police powers of the settlement. Order has deteriorated daily, becoming a "bad land." Robberies in broad daylight have frequently occurred in the Caojiadu area. Shops close at 7 PM, and pedestrians disappear by 10 PM, creating a desolate scene. At around 11 PM the night before last, a bloody male head was suddenly discovered in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, creating a scene of extreme horror. The deterioration of security in Western Shanghai and the lawlessness of the gangsters are evident from this. The details are recorded as follows.

A Human Head, a Terrifying Sight

Around 11:25 PM the night before last (the 1st), a human head was suddenly discovered in front of the Zhengxingguan noodle shop in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu. The hair was in a flat-top style, the face was pale, blood was streaming from the nostrils, and there was a gold tooth in the mouth. The eyes were tightly closed. Beside the head was a cloth resembling a scarf, stained with blood. The scene was extremely gruesome, causing onlookers to shudder. A crowd gathered immediately, and rumors spread.

Police Investigation Reveals Body

After receiving a report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately dispatched multiple patrol cars and armored cars to the scene. Because only the head was found, and not the body, it was very strange. Detectives were sent to investigate the area and discovered a piece of paper on a wall corner inside the Fusheng Company gambling den, which said, "Zhang Zhidong, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang." The detectives believed the note was related to the case and immediately took it back to the police station for investigation. Then an ambulance was summoned to send the head to the morgue.

Disagreement over Looting Causes Conflict

According to an investigation by a reporter from the China News Agency, the head belonged to Wang Zhidong, nicknamed "Little Wang," who was a disciple of Xia Xijiang, nicknamed "Stinky Fish Head." Wang was a local hoodlum who made a living by extortion and theft. Because of a disagreement over looting, Wang had a falling out with his accomplices. Recently, a mole within the police station learned this, so the accomplices were arrested one by one. As a result, those guys suspected Wang of snitching, and they sought to kill Wang.

A Large Group of Criminals Commit Murder

Around 11 PM the night before last, "Little Wang" was bathing in the Laborer's Road Bathhouse. When those guys heard the news, they gathered a large group of criminals, carrying weapons, and forcibly took him out of the bathhouse. Seeing the situation was bad, Wang dared not resist. He was taken by those guys to an open space near the Yongcheng Pottery Shop behind the Xinchang Silk Factory in Sanjiaochang. They fired twelve or thirteen shots with a box cannon, killing him. Then, they dismembered the body into three parts with a sharp weapon, throwing the torso into the Suzhou Creek. They took the head to Wujiaochang and discarded it on the ground. They then scattered in all directions. The police station is currently dispatching detectives to investigate.

Car Speeds By, Throwing Out a Human Head

The English "China Press" reported that at 11 PM last night (the 1st), a car sped along Rue Cardinal Fesch. Suddenly, a gunnysack was thrown from the car, containing a bloody head. It fell to the ground and rolled out. Passersby were shocked. After a search by police officers, a body was found near the cemetery next to Avenue Haig, not far from Wujiaochang on Rue Cardinal Fesch. The head had been chopped off. The identity of the deceased has not yet been determined.

Two Bullet Holes Were Fatal Wounds

The head had two bullet holes, which were the cause of death. Two shell casings were found near the body. The murdered Chinese man was in his thirties and had two gold teeth. The body was wearing a wool overcoat. According to witnesses, there were three or four people in the car from which the head was thrown. The location of the murder has not yet been discovered. It is likely that the murder site and the disposal site were not close. This is the latest crime in the "bad land" of Shanghai. The cause of the murder may be revenge between thugs. Police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Great Road Police are investigating the matter.

### Ample Coal Supply; 120,000 Tons Recently Arrived; Worth Over 5 Million National Currency

The European war has stabilized, and the coal supply is increasing. Inventory has increased, reaching 500,000 tons city-wide. However, due to the arrival of winter, the demand for coal is high, and prices have not fallen. According to Jianghai Customs, the recent coal supply is as follows: (1) In September, total imports of coal fuel and asphalt coal tar reached 18,223 tons, worth 3,393,233 yuan in national currency, with coal blocks being the largest category, totaling 17,3502 tons, worth 3,307,491 yuan in national currency. (2) In October, total imports of coal fuel and asphalt coal tar reached 104,719 tons, worth 1,759,309 yuan in national currency, with coal being the largest category, totaling 101,957 tons, worth 1,704,035 yuan in national currency. In total, 122,942 tons of fuel were imported in September and October, worth 5,152,542 yuan in national currency. Regarding the selling price of coal briquettes, the industry association strictly enforces price limits. However, due to a slight increase in the selling price of coal dust recently, the cost has increased. Some coal briquette shops are automatically adding 0.10 to 0.20 yuan per dan for top-quality goods sold at the door.

### In Memoriam: Mr. Wu Guangxin, Launched by Yu Qiaqing and Others, Held at the Cypress Apartments

Following the news of the passing of Mr. Wu Guangxin, a member of the Military Council of the National Government, in Hong Kong, a wave of mourning arose. Prominent figures from various circles in the city, including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jingren, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Qiufan, Yuan Ludeng, and Wu Yunzhai, initiated preparations for a memorial service. Yesterday, they jointly issued a public announcement stating that Mr. Wu Zitang passed away in Hong Kong on November 15th at Chenshi (around 8 am).

### Moving Speech by Cole at the Royal Air Force Association Meeting: British Government Urgently Needs Aviation Personnel; Those Willing to Serve Will Surely Rise Up

The "North China Daily News" reports that the Shanghai branch of the Royal Air Force Association held a luncheon yesterday (the 1st) at its headquarters in the HSBC Building to honor Sir Archibald Kerr Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, and others. During the luncheon, the Ambassador addressed the members of the Association and other guests, first expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome. He then discussed their obligations to the country and hoped that they would all provide whatever service they could.

**Willing to Remain at Their Posts Awaiting Opportunity**

The Ambassador continued, stating that British expatriates in China could still best serve their country by remaining in their positions and awaiting the opportunity. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, I made a broadcast, advising British citizens not to rush back to their home country or hastily seek to join the trenches, but to maintain their original positions and rise up when the country needed their services. There is no reason for me to reiterate what I said before; the events that have transpired since then have confirmed the accuracy of my earlier statements.

**Britain Needs Aviation Personnel**

Since that broadcast, instructions have been sent from the British government to all consular offices in China, ordering them to record the names of all British expatriates with aviation-related skills. At this point, the Ambassador read out the full text of the instructions, which directed British consulates to record the details and names of local British expatriates with suitable qualifications to serve as aircraft pilots and wireless operators. The Ambassador continued, saying that most of those present were probably aware of these instructions. Judging from your expressions, I know that most of you believe you are qualified to apply for service. Beyond this, I regret that I cannot say more.

**Deep Congratulations for the Opportunity to Serve the Country**

This is an extraordinary war. In recent months, we have witnessed a trend in the war, namely, that victory in the air is more important than in other areas. Therefore, when the time comes to issue a call to arms, those of you with pilot qualifications will surely receive this call. I used to be an infantryman, and I doubt there will be an opportunity for me to participate in this war. You are pilots, and that is to be congratulated.

**Sir Victor Sassoon Responds with a Speech of Thanks**

After the Ambassador's speech, the members and guests sang songs together. Then, Sir Victor Sassoon, the Chairman of the Association, gave a reply, welcoming the Ambassador and briefly stating that there is no doubt that the war cannot be successfully concluded unless we exert all our efforts. Therefore, the members of the Association are prepared to depart and serve when needed, and they have already requested the British authorities here to record the names of those who have applied for service. Although they are far from the battlefield, they have not been forgotten by their country.

### 40,000 Bags of Saigon Rice to Arrive Today; 2,500 Tons Traded Yesterday: Rice Shortage Even More Severe in Japan

Yesterday, inquiries to rice industry sources revealed that local rice trading firms have jointly commissioned French merchants Davie, British merchants Buchheister & Co., and the Jian Yuan Chinese Firm to negotiate Saigon rice purchases via telegram. Contracts for a total of 300,000 bags have already been concluded. It is reported that (1) 3,000 tons (30,000 bags) of Grade 1 and Grade 2 Saigon rice were traded the day before yesterday, and (2) 2,500 tons (including broken rice), or 25,000 bags, were traded yesterday at a price of 31 yuan. 40,000 bags are being loaded onto the French Postal Shipping Company's "Dumont d'Urville" and are expected to arrive in port today. It is also understood that Japan's annual rice needs are largely met by imports from Saigon. Now that Saigon has also refused to trade with Japan, the Japanese are unable to obtain supplies indirectly from the occupied areas, indicating that Japan's rice shortage is even more severe than Shanghai's.

### British Garrison's East Surrey Regiment Transferred to North China; West Yorkshire Regiment Has Already Arrived in Shanghai: Troop Rotation is Purely Routine

On the 13th of last month, the British War Office announced that the British government had decided to withdraw British troops from North China, leaving only a few necessary units to protect the safety and assets of British citizens. Yesterday, according to Tianjin sources, a company of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry, a British unit stationed in Tianjin, was scheduled to take a train to Qinhuangdao on the evening of the 4th, and wait to embark on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Kia-sang" Steamer, but the date of departure and destination were not announced.

**Tianjin Garrison Transferred to Hong Kong; Shanghai Garrison Troops Transferred to Tianjin**

It is understood that the Tianjin British troops will be transferred to Hong Kong, which is the first step in the complete withdrawal of the entire King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment. After the Tianjin British troops are withdrawn, it was previously reported that a portion of the Shanghai British troops would be transferred to take over the defense. Yesterday, this was also confirmed by reliable sources.

**Shanghai British Garrison Augmented by Over 100 Men**

However, this move does not constitute an actual reduction of the Shanghai British Garrison. Although a company of the East Surrey Regiment of the British garrison in Shanghai had already returned to North China on the "Daisheng" Steamer yesterday and arrived on the evening of the 5th to relieve the departing King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment, the "Daisheng" Steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 1st, had carried 120 men of the West Yorkshire Regiment to Shanghai to take over the defense. According to sources within the British military authorities, this troop rotation is purely a routine procedure. Even if the European war had not occurred, troop movements would still be necessary during the regular rotation period.

**French Garrison Reinforcements in Shanghai Recalled**

When Britain announced the withdrawal of troops from Tianjin last time, France also followed suit with a similar announcement. Yesterday, according to Tianjin news, after the withdrawal of the British King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment, the Tianjin French troops will also withdraw to Annam (French Indochina) soon. As for the French garrison in Shanghai, a unit of 800 men had already withdrawn to Annam on the 25th of last month. As a result, the French garrison in Shanghai has reverted to the situation before the "August 13th Incident" in 1937. At that time, the French garrison numbered 1,200 men, including infantry, artillery, and a tank squadron, and was called the "Mixed Battalion." When the Shanghai war suddenly broke out, France drew soldiers from various battalions in Annam, formed two mixed battalions, and sent them to reinforce the French Concession in Shanghai, calling them the "China Expeditionary Force." Until last year, the number of returning soldiers in the standing garrison and reinforcement units had gradually decreased. The most recent standing "Mixed Battalion" was supplemented by soldiers drawn from the reinforced "China Expeditionary Force." Thus, the quotas of the two reinforced units were further reduced. Those who were dispatched to Annam this time were all reinforcement troops, in other words, all the reinforcement troops were recalled, restoring the garrison situation before the August 13th Incident.

### Gaoqiao Puppet Army "Battalion Commander" Xu Maifei Shot Dead; Previously Escaped Assassination; Killed Instantly by Bullet to Vital Spot

Xu Zhifei, the puppet "Battalion Commander" under Qin Xingyan, the puppet "Regimental Commander" of the "Self-Defense Corps" in the Gaoqiao district of Pudong, had more than 200 puppet "soldiers" under his command, stationed at the puppet "Battalion Headquarters" in Gao Hang Town on the border of Shangchuan. Xu's movements were heavily guarded, always with four puppet "soldiers" protecting him to prevent accidents.

**A Month Ago**

Two people waited for Xu's return from Shanghai to Gao, ambushing him on the road from Donggou to Gao Hang, hoping to assassinate Xu. However, the plot was discovered, and they were captured by Xu's personal protection puppet "soldiers" and taken to the puppet "District Team Headquarters" at Xijialukou in Chuansha, where they were executed. Afterwards, Xu became more careful about traveling. However, three days ago, when Xu was traveling from Gao Hang to the Gaoqiao puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" to meet with the puppet "Regimental Commander" Qin Xingyan, just as he arrived at the

**Gaoqiao Highway**

Several people suddenly jumped out from the roadside, catching Xu and his party off guard. After disarming the puppet "guards," they opened fire on Xu several times, hitting vital spots. He collapsed on the spot in a pool of blood and died. The perpetrators, having achieved their objective, calmly escaped with the four Mauser pistols seized from the puppet "guards".

**Calmly Escaped**

By the time the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" received the report and pursued them, they were long gone. According to reports, when the war shifted west, Xu Zhifei once claimed to be a guerrilla fighter. He then surrendered to Hattori Kazuyoshi, the Japanese advisor in Gaoqiao Town, and became a member of the puppet "Self-Defense Corps."

### Workers at Xiangtai Sawmill Request Improved Treatment, Proposing Wage Increase and Other Conditions; Factory Agrees to Collective Discussion

The Dazhong News Agency reports that the British-owned Xiangtai Sawmill on Yangshupu Bridge in Shanghai is a large-scale operation with approximately 600 workers. Recently, due to the factory's reduction of working days for workers, the workers' livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. After collective discussions among all workers, five conditions were proposed to the factory, requesting a response from the management. Details are as follows:

**Content of the Conditions**

After a meeting and collective discussion on the evening of the 28th of last month, all the factory workers submitted five conditions to the management on the 30th through their representatives: (1) Increase wages, the method being that the management should increase workers' wages by one jiao per day starting from the first month of each year; (2) Provide pensions, the method being that workers who have worked in the factory for one year should be paid one month's salary as a pension, those who have worked for two years should be paid two months' salary, and so on; (3) If the factory orders workers to work only three days per week, wages should still be calculated based on six days; (4) If workers contract illnesses or die due to their work, the factory should provide medical expenses and compensation; (5) Wages for holidays and memorial days should be paid as usual.

**Management's Response**

After receiving the conditions proposed by the workers' representatives, the management replied to the workers' representatives that it could only accept the second condition regarding pensions, but the method would be changed so that the workers' years of service would be calculated from the current year. The other conditions could not be accepted at all. At that time, when all the factory workers heard this news, they were in a state of panic, and the so-called "Workers' Welfare Association," which was instigated and organized by the puppet "Great People's Association," took the opportunity to agitate, attempting to entice the factory workers to join the association and confront the management. However, most of the workers deeply understood the importance of the situation and did not take this action. The management also advised the workers that if they wanted to hold a meeting, they could do so in the factory's open space to avoid being exploited. Therefore, all the factory workers have decided to hold a collective discussion in the factory's open space yesterday morning.

**Business Conditions**

The factory is very large, with branches in Tianjin, Nanjing, Qingdao, Hong Kong, and Xiamen. Its raw materials are partly sourced from Fujian, the three northeastern provinces, and domestically. Its business has always been prosperous. However, since the outbreak of the "August 13th" war, all branches except those in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been closed. The products made by the Shanghai headquarters are mostly materials needed for Hong Kong cigarette boxes, egg boxes, and buildings.

### Night Shift Workers at Lun Chang New Factory to Resume Work on Monday

After the resolution of the labor dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Textile Factory's new factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, its day shift workers resumed work at the factory on the 27th of last month. More than a thousand night shift workers are also scheduled to enter the factory this morning (Monday), while the day shift workers who resumed work last week will rotate to the night shift and enter the factory at 6 pm tonight. When the workers at the old factory in Bailianjing resumed work, a new dispute arose briefly, with some people attempting to obstruct the resumption of work again in order to obtain more favorable conditions. However, because all the workers deeply understood the importance of the situation and expressed their aversion to the strike, the majority have been working as usual for several days, proving that those who were disrupting the resumption of work have failed.

### Central Bank Sends Letter to Chamber of Commerce to Stop Hoarding Auxiliary Currency Notes; Exchange of Corner Notes Limited to 50 Yuan; Can Be Linked to the Issuance of New Cent Notes

Due to the shortage of auxiliary currency notes in the city, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, requesting a measured increase in issuance. Now, a reply has been received from the Central Bank, stating that it has received your letter No. Pu Zi 8693, stating that recently the city's auxiliary currency notes are extremely scarce, making it inconvenient to purchase small items, and that it is necessary to find a way to regulate the situation to facilitate circulation, etc. It has been found that the bank's auxiliary currency notes have been exchanged in large quantities in recent months, and it does not seem that there is a shortage in the market. Since there is a sudden shortage, it may be due to excessive inflow into the interior or that some people are taking the opportunity to hoard in order to profit. This kind of behavior has a great impact on people's daily lives and should be stopped by your chamber. In addition to the insufficient application of auxiliary currency notes, the situation has been reported to the head office for approval and decision. Corresponding reply, I hope you will check it out.

**Jiao Coins from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Other Provinces Have Been Exchanged**

After the panic over jiao coins in Shanghai, those generally responsible for regulating the economy have tried various methods. Therefore, banks such as the Central Agricultural Bank, the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank have exchanged all their stored one-jiao, two-jiao, two-jiao five-fen, and five-jiao corner coins as much as possible to facilitate circulation in the market and reduce the suffering of ordinary people and small businesses, which has been very beneficial. Since its implementation, companies and firms have gone to these banks to exchange coins from morning to night. Until the day before yesterday, banks such as the Central Agricultural Bank, the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank had completely exchanged their stored corner coins.

**Restrictions Reimposed on Exchanges at the Central Agricultural Bank**

The Central Agricultural Bank is still exchanging coins at the Central Bank on Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road). However, since the goal of the entire city is to gather at the Central Agricultural Bank after the Jiangsu Provincial Bank and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank stopped exchanging coins, the exchangers are even more crowded. It has been heard that the bank has decided to reimpose regulations starting yesterday, limiting exchanges of corner coins to 50 yuan per person, because unlimited exchanges still lead to hoarding and speculation. It is said that the exchange will continue until all the coins are exchanged, and it is hoped that it can be linked to the new cent notes issued by the Central Bank on the 8th, so that there will be no more panic in the market.

### Rebuilding Commercial Ethics: Special Broadcast on the Second Day of the Moral Re-Armament Movement

Since the decline of ethics in the business community in the past, the general businessmen have been selfish, self-serving, and engaged in infighting, using fraudulent and intimidating means to seek the interests of one person or one's own, and eventually causing friction and disputes. The parties involved have used business as an excuse, recognizing this as their duty, resulting in the increasing bankruptcy of commercial ethics. In view of this, the city's Moral Re-Armament Movement held a special broadcast yesterday, in which people from various professions in the city, including businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and foreign firm employees, each discussed the importance of rebuilding commercial ethics based on their own experiences of reforming their morals and changing their environment. The words were extremely cautionary and can serve as a guide for people in the professional world today.

**Personal Morality More Important Than Money**

The broadcasters all said that people in the professional world must not use business as an excuse and neglect personal morality, and must take honesty, purity, selflessness, and love as the standards of life, discover personal sins and shortcomings, repent and reform, remove the bad habits of greed, hatred, deception, and selfishness, and practice a life of God's management. By practicing what we preach, we can move others with our new lives and change the environment. Then, moral re-armament will be based on this, and a new society and a new world will be established.

**The British King's Uncle Broadcast Yesterday**

Also, yesterday at 2 pm and this morning at 2 am, the Earl of Athlone, the uncle of the British King, broadcast for the Moral Re-Armament Movement in London (London time was 6 am and 6 pm yesterday). The Earl had co-signed a letter to the editor of "The Times" with other London celebrities on November 12 last year.

**The Relationship Between National Strength and Morality**

Stating that the strength of a nation must be judged by whether it is able to recognize its own mistakes, and that the glory of a nation depends on whether it is able to take responsibility for building a new world. Therefore, we not only need a God-inspired political morality, but also need to be governed by God daily, in every place and at every time. We must teach ourselves to live according to the principles of honesty, purity, selflessness, and love, and to fulfill God's will in our personal and public lives. Moral Re-Armament is the foundation of this kind of life, and we cannot but devote ourselves to it.

**Two More Broadcasts to Conclude Today**

Today is the last day of the special broadcast for the movement. In addition to broadcasting at the original scheduled time on the Oriental Radio Station, the speeches on moral re-armament by Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of the movement, and the American tennis star Austin, etc., will be broadcast at XMHA Radio Station from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. People from all walks of life should listen on time.

### Moral Re-Armament in China (Part 1)

Since the Moral Re-Armament Movement originated in Europe, it has been only a little over a year, but its bright and brilliant light has already shone on every corner of the earth. Its impact has not only reached heads of state, scholars, and the masses, but also the semi-civilized natives of South Africa, who have also benefited deeply. People from all walks of life in various countries have praised and admired it in unison, and have joined this new movement that bears the mission of the times. Standing under the banner of the Moral Re-Armament Movement, the masses are marching forward with full enthusiasm towards the goal.

President Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling, the highest leaders of our country, have given their strong support to the Moral Re-Armament Movement. Their speeches on this matter in recent years have aroused enthusiastic welcome and attention from people all over the world. At the first and second world conferences, they both sent special telegrams of greetings, recognizing this movement as an effective remedy for the current chaotic and corrupt situation. That is, to thoroughly eradicate the roots of greed, selfishness, cowardice, and hatred. This is the initial step in solving any evil in the world.

What is the Moral Re-Armament Movement? What is its mission? The Moral Re-Armament Movement provides individuals with a practical program—sincerity, righteous intention, self-cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and world peace. It has no partisan, ethnic, or class boundaries. It is formed by a group of enlightened comrades who are united in spirit and abide by the four major principles in their daily lives—honesty, selflessness, purity, and love. To improve the individual, transform the country, and create a new world.

Our country's response to the Moral Re-Armament Movement was earlier than that of other countries. The reason for this is that the Moral Re-Armament Movement meets our country's needs. The people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is solid, the country will be stable. At this critical moment of survival, the Moral Re-Armament Movement, with its aim to cleanse the heart and reform behavior, is the only essential plan to save the nation and ensure its survival.

The Moral Re-Armament Movement is distributed in all parts of our country, east, west, north, and south. Its scope of activity is the entire society. Schools, churches, public organizations, government employees, businessmen, etc., have all joined the movement one after another.

Recently, Shanghai newspapers published a message from the Ministry of Finance, stating that a certain Ms. Hua in Western China, influenced by the Moral Re-Armament Movement, repaid the National Government the full amount of customs duties that had been leaked.

### Two Children Kidnapped on Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road; Along with a Maid, They Were Abducted by Three Bandits

A kidnapping case occurred in front of the Shanghai YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road in the Public Concession at around 3:10 pm yesterday.

Suddenly, a car carrying three men in long robes drove from the west, stopped near the area. The three men immediately got out of the car, and one of them

**Pulled Out a Gun**

And threatened the maid and others, not allowing them to make a sound. At the same time, two bandits each held one of the young children and, together with the wet nurse, jumped into the original car and sped off east. By the time the other maid called for help, it was too late. She hurried back to the owner's residence to report the incident, and then reported it to the police, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police immediately ordered detectives to conduct a thorough investigation, but there was still no news as of late last night. According to an investigation by reporters, the two kidnapped children are the sons of the managers of the Chongqing Bank and the Sichuan Bank, located in the Wuzhou Building at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road in this city.

**Sons of Managers**

One is only three years old, and the other is only one year old, an infant still in swaddling clothes. Their residence is located at No. 24, Lane 61 (Tianlefang), Xieqiao Lane. Yesterday afternoon, the wet nurse of the infant suddenly proposed to go to watch the horse races. With the owner's consent, they went out, but unexpectedly encountered a kidnapping. At the same time, when the two children were kidnapped, the wet nurse's demeanor was unusual. Therefore, in the occurrence of this case, it is feared that the wet nurse cannot escape responsibility. At present, the police are conducting a thorough search based on various clues.

### Robbery of the Wulin Steamer - Passengers' Cargo Undisturbed - British Ship "Moth" Escorted Vessel to Shanghai - One Pirate Killed, Rest Fled

The British firm Butterfield & Swire's Wulin steamer, sailing from Haimen, Jiangbei, to Shanghai one morning, was attacked by over fifty pirates while loading cotton at Sanhe Port, Qidong County. The pirates, traveling in small boats, boarded the ship armed. According to Butterfield & Swire, the pirates attempted to seize the cotton being loaded and also sought to rob the ship's valuables. As the pirates boarded, they first stormed into the first-class cabin. The Russian security officer of the ship, seeing the pirates swarm aboard, opened fire. The pirates returned fire, creating a barrage of shots as dense as a string of beads, numbering over a hundred. Passengers and crew members rushed to the cabins for cover, causing considerable disorder. One pirate was shot dead. The exchange of fire lasted for half an hour. A British gunboat, the "Moth," which was anchored nearby, responded to the distress call and sailed to assist. Seeing the situation turn against them, the pirates whistled, boarded their original boats, and fled. By the time the "Moth" reached the Wulin steamer, the pirates were long gone. After the killed pirate was transferred to the gunboat, the British ship escorted the Wulin steamer to Shanghai, only returning after reaching the outer reaches of Wusong. It is reported that the Wulin steamer suffered no other losses except for a shoulder injury to the Russian security guard, and the cotton was not taken.

### Cantonese Girl Chen Qianwen - Fraudulently Collects Bank Remittance - $1,800 USD Remitted from the US to Shanghai - Collected Under the Name of Chen Sanmei with a Guarantor - Chen Qianwen Arrested and Investigated After Discovery

Chen Qianwen, a Cantonese girl, 17 years old, residing at 32 Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road, is suspected of fraudulently obtaining US$1,800 (over 20,000 legal tender yuan) from the Citibank on Jiujiang Road by impersonation. Chen voluntarily surrendered to the General Police Department a few days ago, and was transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning for detention. According to the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu's statement, on October 18 of this year, the Shanghai Citibank received a telegram from Citibank's head office in the United States, stating that US$800 was remitted from San Francisco, USA, to Shanghai for Chen Sanmei to collect. The bank noted that there was no Chen Sanmei account, only Chen Qianwen, a female residing at 14, Lane 1265, Avenue Edward VII. The bank sent a letter addressed to Chen Sanmei. Upon receiving the letter, the suspect went to Citibank, claiming to be Chen Sanmei and requesting the funds. The bank, not knowing Chen Sanmei, and following established procedure, required a guarantor. So, the suspect was instructed to find one. On November 2, the US head office sent another telegram remitting US$1,000 to Chen Sanmei. The Shanghai branch notified her again, and Chen Wenqian enlisted Liang Qihua, a representative of Paramount Pictures, and Shen Chuanren, a translator for the Motion Picture Association of America, as guarantors to collect the funds, claiming the US$1,800 was remitted by her husband from the US. The bank rejected the guarantors as unsuitable. Consequently, Chen Qianwen secured an Italian, "You Ge Qiansha," who had dealings with the bank, as a guarantor and successfully withdrew the funds, depositing them into a passbook under Chen Qianwen's own name. Several days later, Chen withdrew all of the aforementioned funds. Unexpectedly, on November 29, Chen Sanmei, residing at 4 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, attempted to collect a US remittance at Citibank, revealing Chen Qianwen's impersonation. Citibank employees Zhang Zhixiang and the Westerner Keding sought out Chen Qianwen's guarantor, the Italian, who had already left for Japan. Only Liang and Shen were found. Liang et al. only knew Chen's mother, Chen Li, resided at 32 Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road. They reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police a few days ago. Detectives were dispatched to find Chen Li, and yesterday, Chen Qianwen surrendered to the police. Detective Zhang Baoxing is in charge of the investigation. Chen confessed that she had lent all of the US$1,800 to the Italian "You Ge Qiansha." As the Italian has already gone to Japan, the veracity of her statement remains to be investigated. He requested permission for detention. Judge Zhan instructed that Chen Qianwen be detained for seven days for further verification.

### Doorkeeper Arrested for Setting Up Gambling Den - Busted by French Police

Sun Maizhong (32 years old), a doorkeeper from Yangzhou residing in Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, recently had an eccentric idea. He used his position to entice tenants to gamble in flower lotteries. After collecting the bets daily, he would send them to the Yiji General Factory in Caojiadu. The French Police learned of this and dispatched detectives disguised as gamblers at 11:00 PM the night before. They arrested Sun on the spot, seizing a large number of flower lottery slips and over 60 yuan in gambling money from his coat pockets. He was taken to the police station and transferred to the Second Special Court for investigation yesterday.

### Bizarre Kidnapping Case Occurred on Avenue Billeau the Day Before Yesterday - Gang Hired a Car and Took Off the Driver's Uniform - Drove Off Themselves to Kidnap an Eight-Year-Old Child

The *North-China Daily News* reports that a shocking kidnapping case occurred in the extra-Settlement Roads Area, West Shanghai, during daylight on December 1. At approximately 11:00 AM, four bandits, each carrying a handgun, stripped a taxi driver of his uniform on Rue Sikiang. One bandit put on the uniform and drove the car, while the real driver was placed in the back of the car and instructed not to make a sound. The taxi, belonging to a major Shanghai taxi company, drove to an alley off Avenue Billeau. Two bandits got out of the car, walked down the alley, and returned a few minutes later with an eight-year-old Chinese boy. The boy was placed in the back of the car, and the car drove west along Avenue Billeau, deep into the "badlands." There, the car stopped, the bandits took the boy out of the car, and handed the uniform back to the driver. The bandits disappeared into the suburbs with the boy. The injured driver put on his uniform and drove back to the taxi company. The kidnapped child is believed to be hidden somewhere in the "badlands." Also, on Thursday evening at 6:15 PM, three armed bandits kidnapped a Chinese man near Route Mandel and Chongqing Road, forcing him into a car that drove along Avenue Haig and into Fahua Town. They robbed the man of approximately 500 yuan in cash and then released him without firing a shot.

In order to relieve refugees and promote charity lottery tickets, Ye Cheng Industrial Society took advantage of the new launch of "Double Joy" toothpaste and "Ever Ready" toothpaste, and issued the "Great Joy" ticket. Each ticket is a unique number. Anyone using an empty tube of "Great Joy" toothpaste, "Double Joy" toothpaste, or "Ever Ready" toothpaste can redeem a ticket directly at the Society's location at the corner of Sanma Road and Shanxi Road.

They will be issued once a month, with prizes awarded according to the Central Savings Society's draw. The number of tickets issued will also be based on the number of tickets issued by the Central Savings Society. There are four sets of numbers in total, with four special prizes, 116 first prizes, 116 second prizes, 116 third prizes, 116 fourth prizes, 16 supplementary prizes, and over 23,000 consolation prizes. In addition to a large number of charity lottery tickets, there will be cash and toothpaste prizes awarded according to the prize level. The ease of the award procedure, the vast number of prizes, and the speed of the drawing are creating new records for prize-winning events. Therefore, each person uses one tube of "Great Joy" toothpaste, "Double Joy" toothpaste, or "Ever Ready" toothpaste each month, and their hope and rights are no less than joining the Central Savings Society each month. Since the "Great Joy" tickets started being redeemed to great fanfare on the first of this month, people have been coming to redeem them in an endless stream every day.

### Cotton Boat Robbed - All Seven People on Board Shot Dead

Shi Zhusan, the manager of the Hengxing Cotton Ginning Factory in Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, sent clerks Wu Shutian and Zhang Xianglian to the Xiji Cotton Shop in Wujiaqiao, Punan, in October to order 700 bales of cotton, worth over 17,000 yuan. At the time, Wu paid 2,000 yuan in advance and hired a local boat in Wujiaqiao to transport 200 bales of cotton, with Zhang Xianglian (the only son of Zhang Fengxiang of Caohejing Town, 22 years old, scheduled to be married on the 5th of next month) escorting the boat, and Wu returning to the factory first. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached a remote area north of Minhang, it was suddenly attacked by over ten bandits, each armed with guns, who forced them to stop. Zhang et al. had no choice but to bring the boat ashore. Somehow, the bandits were angered. In an instant, Zhang Xianglian and the seven boatmen were all shot dead. All the cotton was looted. The remaining empty boat was also smashed by the bandits and sunk to the bottom of the river. When Fengxiang and his wife learned of their son's murder, they were grief-stricken. Nearly a month has passed. Two major criminals in the case were arrested by a guerrilla unit near Maqiao Town a few days ago, and over a hundred bales of cotton were recovered. However, the bodies have not yet been recovered.

### The Son of a Former Wife - Actually Abandoned by the Stepmother - Wang Yulong is Deeply Liked by His Father - The Stepmother Hated and Falsely Claimed Yulong Was an Orphan

Recently, a case of a stepmother trying to abandon a child occurred in Shanghai. The police are continuing their investigation, hoping to apprehend the person. On the 29th of last month, a middle-aged woman named Zhao Qingshi (transliteration) led a child to the Xinzha Road Police Station, requesting shelter and placement for the child. According to the woman's statement, she lives in the Zhabei area. The child's name is Wang Yulong, nine years old. Because his parents are deceased and no one is taking care of him, she is requesting the police station to do a good deed and transfer the child to a charitable organization for education. The Xinzha Road Police Station took the statement and sent the child to the Department of Child Protection of the Public Works Department for disposition. Unexpectedly, after thorough and lengthy questioning, it was discovered that this was a stepmother's scheme to abandon the child. It turns out that the child's father's name is Wang Weiqing, who is currently working in Suzhou, and the middle-aged woman accompanying the child is the child's stepmother (who has two children of her own). Because the stepmother deeply dislikes Yulong, she falsely claimed that Yulong was an orphan, requesting the police station to take him in. According to Yulong's own account, his father Weiqing is indeed very loving and caring. The Department of Child Protection has sent the child to the Children's Home of the Child Welfare Association. They hope that anyone who recognizes the family can come forward to report and provide clues so that the problem can be resolved satisfactorily.

Children's Weekly

### Endurance of the Environment

— Chen Liang

Not long ago, there were a few days of sudden, severe cold. Many children hid in their beds in the morning and refused to get up. Only after being urged by their mothers three or four times did they reluctantly get out of bed to wash. They put on extra layers of warm clothes - woolen sweaters, thermal underwear, woolen overcoats - but still kept complaining about the cold. They simply didn't want to brave the cold to go to school. Copying books and keeping diaries, these extracurricular assignments were all stopped, because their hands were too cold to hold a pen.

Here I want to tell a story of a foreign great man, Nelson, in his childhood to those children who are afraid of the cold. It was a bitterly cold day with snow and wind. Nelson, on his way to school, because he did not want to endure the snow and wind, and longed for the warmth of the fire at home, turned back halfway. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, he was severely lectured by his parents. He had to brace himself and go back to school, which made him feel a surge of courage. From then on, he developed the habit of not fearing difficulties and enduring hardship, and finally became a great man.

Don't you children often hope to become great men in the future? But great men are not made by sitting idly by. The prerequisite is to endure all kinds of hardships. Being able to endure hardship means being able to break the constraints of the environment, and then one can build a great career and become a great person. Why can't you even endure a little cold! In China, there is also the story of reading by the reflection of snow. Everyone knows that it is particularly cold on snowy days. That poor scholar had no oil lamp, but he could still read at night by the reflection of the snow. Children, sitting comfortably under electric lights, can you still complain about the cold and shrink away from laziness!

Why not look at the rickshaw pullers on the road, the janitors in schools, the people who deliver milk for the milk company...? They work all year round, regardless of wind, frost, rain, snow, heat, or cold. They never interrupt their service work in order to eat. Look at your parents, too. Except for holidays, they have to rush around and work hard every day. No matter how cold the weather is, they still have to go to the office with red noses. Why? Because they have to earn money to support you and provide for your education. How can they be afraid of the cold and be lazy!

In comparison, children, you are much happier. You don't have to worry about food or clothing, and you don't have the burden of life. You can devote yourselves to studying and reading seriously. The cold is just a small environmental obstacle, and of course, you should endure it.

### Too Expensive - Dare Not Eat

— Xin Fang

In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a little girl in Hankou, not yet ten years old, named Yi Chuanfu. Her brother worked in politics. One day, he bought a pomelo and brought it back for her to eat, but she didn't want to eat it. After he peeled it and gave it to her again, she still didn't want to eat it. "What does this mean?" her brother asked. She replied slowly, "This pomelo was bought by my brother at a high price. I dare not eat something that is so expensive." (Recorded from a children's magazine)

Now, aren't pomelos back on the market? The price is more than twice as expensive as in previous years. Children! When your parents buy them back for you to eat, do you have the same thoughts as her?

Today's prices on the isolated island can be described in eight words: "Everything is expensive, nothing doesn't rise." Children! You probably all understand. So, for everything, whether it's food, supplies, or toys, you must practice the word "thrift," and especially for things that are too expensive, you should suppress your desire for them. In this way, on the one hand, you will be considerate of your parents; on the other hand, you will cultivate the virtue of frugality, and you will be worthy of the title of "good boy."

Recently, the weather has been getting colder day by day, and all sectors are calling for an expansion of the campaign to raise winter clothes for refugees. Children! You are members of society, and you should also bear a part of the responsibility. At the very least, you must persuade your family and friends to respond to this movement. In addition, save your daily expenses and do not eat things that are too expensive. If you can do this, you will have fulfilled your responsibility.

Too expensive - dare not eat. I hope you can do it, too expensive - don't eat. On the other hand, if you can make your parents do it, too expensive - don't buy; then, it will be even more perfect.

### Happy Event—A Ming's Escape Notes, Forty-Fifth—

— Bai Zheng

Scene after scene, the New Year decorations in the village were clearly reflected in A Ming's eyes. In a blink of an eye, it was the Lantern Festival again, and the village had the same custom of lighting lanterns. On that evening, most families lit all kinds of paper lanterns, but they were all simple, like "Zhuangyuan" (top scholar) lanterns. In front of the doors, inside the houses, and in the courtyards, lanterns were hung high one after another. Looking from the alley, the lanterns of each household formed a string, which was quite a sight, as if a lantern festival had been opened. A Ming's family, of course, had no mood to celebrate this festival, and the dim oil lamp was still flickering. The landlady was really good to them, and even sent a few maids to hang lanterns in their courtyard - A Ming's home suddenly became much brighter, and at least had some decorations to make the festival not wasted. She even invited them to go to the ancestral hall to see other people's happy events. Such a landlady was rare.

Happy events, especially the happy events in this village, which foreign strangers would not want to visit and broaden their horizons? And the curious A Ming was particularly happy, of course, not willing to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

A large group of villagers seemed to have gathered together after hearing a concentration signal in the army, and the happy event in the ancestral hall did attract this group of people, making a lot of noise and turning the quiet ancestral hall into a noisy auditorium.

Holding a happy event in the ancestral hall was extremely novel in A Ming's mind. Indeed, this was a special custom in the village, because there was no restaurant there, and the houses were so small that they could not even accommodate four or five tables of dishes. So, they had to use this spacious ancestral hall as an auditorium.

That day, a family was marrying off their daughter to another village nearby. The ancestral hall had already been decorated in a neat and presentable manner, but it could not be simpler. On the stone platform in the center, a pair of thick happy candles were inserted high on the stone candle holders, and the flames illuminated the hall brightly. (Because A Ming's eyes were usually accustomed to the light of the oil lamp, when he encountered candlelight, it was like being under gasoline lamp light. In fact, the light of those two candles was very limited, and it was also in this vast ancestral hall.) Many men wearing red flowers were sorting out red invitations, which were to be sent to foreign guests.

There was a burst of noise outside the ancestral hall. It turned out that the bridal sedan chair from the other village had entered this village. The sound of trumpets, gongs, shouts, and drums came in waves, pouring into the ears of everyone waiting outside the ancestral hall.

The ceremonial guard was mighty and disorganized, getting closer and closer to the ancestral hall, and the mixed sounds were quite loud. After a string of firecrackers, the very ornate bridal sedan chair entered the gate of the ancestral hall. The trumpet players were the village strongmen trained as buglers. What they were playing, was it military music? Or wedding music? How interesting!

A large group of people surrounded the bridal sedan chair to see it clearly. After a full hour, the bride, dressed in bright red and green like a Bodhisattva in a temple, came slowly. Except that the bride's height was almost like a child, which could be seen, nothing else could be seen. Her face was covered by that hateful embroidered handkerchief, not allowing any ventilation. Amid the extraordinary chaos, the bride entered the bridal sedan chair. The ceremonial guard then scattered and embarked on the original road to the groom's house.

Later, A Ming learned that the bride was only thirteen years old when she got married. No wonder she was so short. Early marriage was also prevalent in the village. Our country is called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and this bad custom of early marriage must bear a large part of the responsibility.

### Campaign to Collect Winter Clothing for Refugee Children

— Lu Qizhao

Now is the winter season, and the cold wind is blowing fiercely. There are countless compatriots in Shanghai who have been displaced and do not have winter clothes to wear. They are relying on us for relief. I now have a small suggestion, listed below: All older compatriots should relieve the older compatriots who have been displaced, and all of us younger compatriots should relieve the younger compatriots who have been displaced. I am one of the younger compatriots and should take the responsibility of relieving the younger compatriots who have been displaced.

There is now the China Child Welfare Association. It is collecting 10,000 pieces of winter clothing for refugee children. All of us younger compatriots, if you have old clothes, pants, etc.: or national currency of two, three, four, five jiao, etc., can send them to the China Child Welfare Association, address No. 208, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road, to relieve our young compatriots so that they will not be harmed by the cold wind. Moreover, now is a time of national crisis, and young compatriots are the future pillars of our Republic of China. We should cultivate them and relieve them. This is an immeasurable merit!

### The Blue Dwarf (11)

— Ai Li

A Li, being in this exquisite and delicate environment, suddenly felt that she was so clumsy and oversized. For example, her feet, for someone her age, were very well-proportioned and not too big, but if she put one foot on the window of that small house, she would definitely knock over everything inside the window.

A Li stared around for a while, muttering to herself, "Oh, I didn't expect myself to be so big and clumsy! Look at me, I seem to have turned into a clumsy farmer; I have to shrink my body to be just like them!"

Suddenly, a voice came from beside her, saying, "Yes, there are all kinds of inconveniences!" A Li quickly lowered her head to see who was talking. It turned out to be the dwarf who had initially talked to her. She was a little embarrassed, thinking, "What I was thinking in my heart, I didn't say it out loud, how could he know it?" So she opened her mouth and said, "No matter what, there are conveniences on one hand and inconveniences on the other. For example, it is very suitable for you to live here, but when you come to our world, don't you feel that your bodies are too small?" The dwarf nodded and said, "That's right, that's right, things do have conveniences and inconveniences."

A Li saw that he did not refute her words, and thought to herself that the dwarf's temper was quite good. So she came up with an idea to find out some of their shortcomings and criticize them. She then said slowly, "Your village is indeed very small and beautiful, but - please forgive me, I don't mean to be rude -" The dwarf quickly said, "No, you won't be rude, because Auntie once told you to be polite to us." A Li was surprised and said, "Whose aunt? She is not your aunt!" The dwarf quietly replied, "Whether she is your aunt or my aunt, in short, Auntie's words are correct." A Li heard this arrogant tone and was very unhappy, wishing she could stomp her feet and scold him, but when she thought of her aunt's words, she didn't dare to disobey, so she swallowed her anger and didn't say anything more.

She paused for a moment and then said quietly, "What I want to say is just to express some of my opinions, and I can't say it is rude. From my perspective, everything in your village is indeed small and beautiful, but it lacks variety and is a bit monotonous. If there were more variety, it would be even more beautiful. Look at yourself, aren't many houses in the village completely the same, without any changes? And the people in your village, and your wives in those brown clothes, aren't they also exactly the same, without any changes? Wait, I still want to ask you, do you have children?" The dwarf said anxiously, "Of course we do, and there are many of them." A Li asked, "So where are the children? Could it be that they are all asleep?" As she spoke, she spoke in a mocking tone, thinking that it was just getting dark, and the children would definitely not be asleep so early." Who knew that the dwarf would calmly answer, "Yes, they are all asleep, and most of them are dreaming now. You always know that children like to dream." As he said this, he looked up at A Li, with a very strange expression on his face, and even his voice was very strange. A Li also felt a strange feeling in her heart, thinking that his words seemed to be directed at her. Isn't she also a child? Isn't she also dreaming?

### Ideal Becomes Reality Nine Performances of "Chasing Han Xin" A Grand Crossover Performance by Veteran Actors of Civil and Military Roles

— Sui Wo

Three months ago, I suggested in this publication that the relief authorities could hold a "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance" based on my suggestion. Last month, the Refugee Relief Association prepared to perform a charity show and showed some interest in my suggestion. However, Qilintong himself, to avoid sectarianism, did not want to use the term "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance." After some discussion, the ideal has finally become a reality. The Relief Association authorities have scheduled to stage this good show at the Tianchan Stage on the 7th of this month. Although it has been renamed "Grand Crossover Performance by Veteran Actors of Civil and Military Roles," it is actually derived from a "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance." The program is arranged as follows:

Wang Fuying Double

Yu Zongying Performs

Filial Son

Li Ruchun (Fan Kuai)

Chen Hefeng (Zhang Liang)

Qilintong (Fan Zeng)

Gao Baisui (Xiang Yu)

Yang Baotong (Liu Bang)

Wang Fuying (Xiang Bo)

Hongmen Banquet

Zhao Songqiao

Zhao Ruquan

Wang Zhuangbai

Lending a Head

Qilintong

Zhao Ruquan

Gao Baisui

Chen Hefeng

Wang Chunbai

Chen Xiaomu

Yang Baotong

Li Ruchun

Liu Wenkui

(Energetically plays Xiao He)

Wang Shaolou

Wang Fuying

Yu Zongying

Li Junyu

(Four play Han Xin)

Liu Yunfang

Qian Lintong

Zhang Mingsheng

Pan Dingxin

(Four play Liu Bang)

Liu Binkun

Jiao Baokui

Li Hansan

Xiao Wenlin

(Four play Xia Houying)

(Full)

Xiao He Chasing Han Xin under the Moon

Liang Cishan (Woodcutter)

The above program is roughly the same as what I previously proposed. The distribution of roles in the Hongmen Banquet play is entirely based on my idea. Qilintong unexpectedly plays Fan Zeng, which is bound to be a surprising performance. The finale of Chasing Han Xin brings together veteran actors of civil and military roles in one performance, which can be said to be an unprecedented creation. It is said that Qilintong only plays the later part of ascending the stage to pay homage to the marshal, Zhao Lao starts the performance with a round stage run, and three Golden Halls change three Xiao Hes. Six play Han Xin, four play Liu Bang, and four play Xia Houying, all of which are innovative. This one play alone is enough to cause a sensation.

Theater News The Gongyu Yaji Drama Research Society will hold its fifth public performance today (3rd) at the Gubal Apartment Hall on Guba Road. Seven plays will be performed each day and night, all of which are wonderful masterpieces. The list of plays is recorded as follows: (Day) Hu Yunming, Pan Jingmei, Celebrating the Pearl; Tang Lifen, Lu Chenghou, Teaching His Son; Sun Minhou, Ying Shaomei, Mu Kezhai; Ye Anna, Chunxiang's School闹; Zhu Shuzhang, Zhou Shunhua, Bao Lian Deng; Bai Shunyi, Min Dihua, Woman Escorting; Yu Jingmei, Pan Jingmei, Sangwei Sent a Letter. (Night) Zhu Zhongchang, Min Dihua; Li Zhitang, Liu Zuwei, Tian Zhongyu, Empty City Plan; Wei Shenpu, Yumen Pass; Yang Jingyi, Li Zhimei, Dragon Town; Yu Jimei, Min Dihua, Sun Minhou, Chen Yunzhang, Cui Ping Mountain; Hu Zhongwen, Sun Minhou, Wei Xuepu, Yang Junhao, Yellow Crane Tower.

### Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda (New Film Introduction) "Sherlock Holmes"

— Qi Hua

The absolute difference between "Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" and "Phantom of the Ancient Castle" is that in the former, the appearance of Moore Tai leaves the audience with the impression that he is the culprit, while in the latter, it is not until the end that it is proved who the culprit is. Therefore, the performance effect of "Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" is not as tense and exciting as "Phantom of the Ancient Castle."

"Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" develops two cases simultaneously and interactively. Because the culprit appears first, director Wegg omits him after Professor Moore Tai sends out the threatening letter, focusing the audience's attention on Branden's unease and on the assassination of Lloyd. This point does make up for the flaws in the script, but I think that the section where Moore Tai is declared innocent in court at the beginning might as well be deleted. Then, from Holmes accepting the commission of Sir Donner, the manager of the ancient pagoda royal palace jewelry, and Branden, the two cases will develop interactively. Then, the two climaxes of Lloyd being killed and Holmes learning of Moore Tai's conspiracy from the murderer of Lloyd and rushing to the ancient pagoda to solve the case will be more powerful.

In the handling of these two climaxes, the director's grasp of the atmosphere is successful. When Lloyd was killed, Holmes' carriage was speeding; Lloyd and Hunter's actions were secret; after the miserable scream, several close-up shots of the police, grooms, etc., made this scene very compact and powerful. The latter scene of Moore Tai and Holmes' pursuit is also equally tense. The director's use of the London fog and strong light money further strengthens the suffocating air of the detective film.

Other things, such as outlining the personality of Holmes and Watson, are also lovely

Basil Rathbone's Holmes is successful in highlighting the character by using his gazing eyes.

### Li Li from Beiping Joins Yihua Starring in "Burning the Biyun Palace"

Li Li from Beiping returned to Shanghai from the United States three weeks ago, which few people know. When she returned to China, she only sent a telegram to Yan Youxiang, the little owner of Yihua Company, from the ship. Therefore, on the day of her arrival, people in the film industry were unaware of it. At that time, Yan Youxiang contacted her about joining Yihua to film movies, and Li immediately agreed, but said that she had to return to Hong Kong to deal with private affairs before coming again. Therefore, Li Li only stayed in Shanghai for one night and then took a ship to Hong Kong. The reason why Yihua kept it secret was that the time was not yet ripe. Now that Li Li has come to Shanghai from Hong Kong and it has been decided that she will star in "Burning the Biyun Palace," there is little doubt that Li has joined Yihua.

### From Soviet-Finnish Negotiations to Soviet-Finnish Conflict

— Yan Maode

The current evolution of the European war situation does not lie in the battles on the battlefield, but in the fierce struggle of international diplomacy, economy, and propaganda, especially the fierce battles on the stage of foreign affairs. Everyone is engaging in intrigue and using the wrists of vertical and horizontal alliances. In just half a month, the Soviet Union first signed mutual assistance agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, making the Baltic units form a solid outer line. Then, it invited Finnish representatives to Moscow for talks. Unexpectedly, it fell into a stalemate, and the relationship between the two countries suddenly became tense, to the point of war. Why did these negotiations suffer setbacks, and what is the crux of the matter? We need to review it here.

Before discussing this article, the past relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland should be explained first:

Past Relations between the Soviet Union and Finland

Finland is located in northern Europe, on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, and is one of the four neutral countries in Northern Europe. Finland used to be part of Sweden for seven hundred years. It was conquered by old Russia in 1808. In 1917, the Russian Revolution occurred, and it declared independence in early December. In January 1918, the Soviet government recognized Finland's independence. In July 1919, communist forces were rampant in Finland, causing a powerful anti-communist movement in Finland; Led by the Lapuans Party, in July 1930, it prepared to conduct negotiations. Why did the Soviet-Finnish negotiations fluctuate, and the crux of the matter lies in the Hanko issue. Hanko is a commercial port at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, only sixty miles away from the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Soviet Union demanded to establish a naval base in Hanko, which would not only control the Gulf of Finland, but also control the entire Baltic Sea. However, Finland believed that Hanko was the throat of the Gulf of Finland - also the founding throat of Finland - and absolutely refused to cede it, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. Hanko is not only closely related to Finland, but also has a great relationship with Sweden. Originally, Hanko was only over a hundred miles away from the Swedish capital Stockholm. If the Soviet Union stationed troops there, it would control Stockholm, and if the Soviet Union further occupied the Aland Islands, Sweden would be greatly threatened. Therefore, Sweden is extremely concerned about the future of Finland.

Since the negotiations fell into a stalemate, the Soviet Union has fiercely criticized Finland in newspapers. At the same time, the Lapuans Party forced the Farmer's Party cabinet to resign, and the parliament was also dissolved. However, the activities of the Lapuans Party became more rampant, which aroused the anger of the people across the country. As a result, the activities of the Lapuans Party temporarily subsided for a while. However, in February 1932, more than four thousand Lapuans Party members mobilized in the area of Manwansala, attempting to occupy Helsinki. The army and defense forces of Helsinki were loyal to the government, so in less than a day, the Lapuans Party's rebellion was quelled, and not a drop of blood was shed. In the same year, Finland and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of friendship. Since the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations and loudly appealed for peace, the Finnish people have become more fond of the Soviet Union. However, since Litvinov resigned, the Soviet Union's policy has changed, suddenly dividing Poland with Germany and then placing Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under protection, immediately arousing strong resentment from Finland.

The Crux of Soviet-Finnish Negotiations

However, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have been going on since October 11th, almost two months, and the unit process has been quite tortuous and difficult. At that time, the Soviet side had a fairly firm attitude and had long had a clear plan at the beginning of the negotiations, while Finland was willing to maintain the freedom and equality that an independent country should have and was unwilling to make excessive concessions. Therefore, the views of the two countries were quite far apart, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. Recently, war has finally broken out, arousing the attention of people all over the world.

### Nanning Sketches

— Gong Huai

Since suffering an unprecedented defeat in the Xiangbei Campaign, the Japanese army, in a state of frustration and anxiety, considered launching a new offensive to salvage its military decline. Their recent forced landing in the Beihai, Longmen, and Qisha areas was intended to cut off the highway between Guangxi and Vietnam and to seize Nanning, thereby recovering the reputation lost in the Xiangbei rout.

Evolution and Position

Nanning, also known as Yongning, is the capital of Guangxi province. During the Han dynasty, it belonged to the Yulin Commandery. In the Jin dynasty, Jinxing County was established as the seat of Jinxing Commandery. During the Kaihuang era of the Sui dynasty, it was renamed Xuanhua County, under Yuan Prefecture, and in the early years of the Daye era, it belonged to Yulin Commandery. From the Tang and Song dynasties onward, it served as the seat of prefectures and commanderies. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was the seat of Nanning Prefecture. After the establishment of the Republic of China, it was renamed Yongning County, but the general public still calls it Nanning. Located near the Guangdong Sea in the south, bordering Annam to the west, connecting to Guizhou and Yunnan in the north, and overlooking Xunwu in the east, it occupies a strategically important geographical position. The city is situated on the north bank of the Yu River and was built during the Huangyou era of the Song dynasty. Legend has it that the prefect at the time dreamed of a deity who told him, "Build the city in the shape of a snake, and it will be successful." The next day, a snake was indeed seen coiling around the land, so the city was built according to its shape. However, it was destroyed by a major flood in the fourth year of the Qianlong reign. The current city walls were rebuilt in the sixth year of Qianlong, but some remnants of the old city still exist. Many years ago, this place was just an ordinary commercial port in the remote southwest, but in recent years, as the Guangxi provincial government accelerated its reorganization, Nanning has become one of China's model cities.

Magnificent Cityscape

Under the slogan of "Building Guangxi," the cityscape of Nanning has indeed undergone a tremendous transformation. The streets formerly paved with stone slabs have now been largely rebuilt into smooth asphalt roads. Many of the old and simple houses have also been renovated into magnificent and spacious new buildings. The most bustling streets are Nanning Main Street and Delin Road, where most of the major businesses are concentrated. Nanning Main Street is mainly home to stores selling goods from Suzhou and Hangzhou, as well as gold shops. Delin Road is dominated by shops selling local goods, hardware, soy sauce, groceries, and sundries. Muchang Street is filled with brokerage firms dealing in matches, foreign yarn, and medicinal materials, as well as shipping companies. Yanfa Street is home to shops selling salt, peanut oil, bean curd, tung oil, and cowhide. Datie Street is full of shops selling porcelain and iron pots. However, while Nanning is bustling and lively, it is not extravagant, and a sense of emerging vitality pervades the entire city. The goods displayed in the shops are mostly domestic products, with fewer imported goods. The people walking in the streets, whether military, government, academic, or business, all wear cloth hats, cloth clothes, and cloth shoes. There are hardly any lavishly dressed or fashionable men and women. These are all the achievements of the Guangxi authorities in the past three years and the result of putting politics on the right track.

Abundant Products

Because Nanning is surrounded by fertile fields and lush vegetation, its products are very abundant, earning it the reputation of "Guangxi's Granary." The main product is sugar cane, which in its heyday could produce over ten million catties per year. Although production has declined somewhat, it is still enough to compete with foreign white sugar. In addition, rice, fennel, butter, raw silk, tobacco, oranges, tangerines, jackfruit, etc., are also produced in large quantities, with an average annual export value of 2.1 million customs taels. As for mineral resources, there is a vast mining area with high-quality lignite in Ertang, Santang, and the Gaoling area across the river. The coal seams are three feet thick, and many people dig it up and transport it to the city for sale. At the bends of Lingli Bay, there are placer gold mines, and on Fosha Ridge, there are galena and hematite mines, all with abundant reserves.

Famous Scenic Spots and Historical Sites

The most famous scenic spot in Nanning is Wangxian Slope, which towers over the east of the city. During the Huangyou era of the Song dynasty, Wu Xiang Wang Di Qing and Generals Yu Jing and Sun Mian camped here during their southern campaign against Nong Zhigao. Later, the people of Yongning built the Temple of the Three Dukes on the slope to commemorate their merits in suppressing the rebellion, and it has been worshiped continuously throughout the seasons. Later, Su Jian was also enshrined. Wang Shouren renamed it the Temple of the Five Dukes, and during the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty, Mang Yitu was also enshrined, hence the name Temple of the Six Dukes. Qingfeng Tower is located in the Higher Court (formerly the Prefectural Government Office) on Macao Street. During the Song dynasty, it was Qingfeng Terrace, but it had long been destroyed. During the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, Prefect Fang Yu built Qingfeng Pavilion on its site, which is commonly called Qingfeng Tower.

Nanning has now been temporarily lost. However, students and militia from all over Guangxi are enthusiastically enlisting and heading to the front lines to defend their homeland with iron and blood. Under the command of Bai Chongxi and other generals, they will surely demonstrate their combat skills and have a day to recover Nanning.

### Beihai

— Xiao

The first place the Japanese troops landed was Beihai. Beihai, located north of Tokyo Bay, is situated in the Sanyou Port of Lianjiang. It was opened as a commercial port in 1876 according to the Yantai Treaty. It is accessible by steamboat to Haikou on Hainan Island, a journey of only ten hours. The harbor is good and free of hidden reefs. On land, there is a highway leading north to Hepu (Lianzhou). From Hepu, the highway branches northwest, connecting to Qinzhou, Lingshan, and Fangcheng. This is a hub of communication in southern Guangdong. More than thirty years ago, due to the water conservancy of the Lianjiang, Wuli River, and Daqin River, it implicitly became a port for goods dispersing eastward from the upper reaches of the West River. However, since Guangxi's Cangwu (Wuzhou) and Yunnan's Mengzi were opened as commercial ports, this advantageous position has disappeared.

Xiaodong Another noteworthy place name is Xiaodong. Xiaodong is located south of the Shiwan Mountains, a branch of the Goulou Mountain Range, and is more than 100 kilometers away from Yongning (Nanning). According to mileage estimates, the advance of mechanized units does not seem to require much time. However, the Goulou Mountain Range is truly an important barrier. High ridges over 3,000 feet are no less than a natural moat, and the Japanese army's penetration will ultimately face great difficulties. While the Yongqin Highway is convenient for travelers, the Shiwan Mountains are undoubtedly a superior defensive barrier in combat.

Qinzhou Qinzhou has already fallen. Of course, we will also consider it a loss. Qinzhou was originally Qinzhou, the leading town formerly under the Qinlian Circuit. In terms of water conservancy, it has the advantage of Longmen Port, which is precisely the throat of the Qin River's outlet to the sea. However, according to reliable surveys, the water conservancy of Tokyo Bay is far inferior to that of Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, in his National Reconstruction Strategy, Sun Yat-sen considered dredging and building a port there only as a second-class port. On land, the Yongqin Highway leads directly to Yongning, which is the gateway to Guangxi. Heading southwest through Fangcheng to Dongxing forms a communication line connecting to Vietnam. Qinzhou is 150 kilometers away from Dongxing. The Beilun River, the southernmost end of China's coastline, is also located there. The most important resource in Qinzhou is manganese ore, because manganese is essential for steelmaking and has significant value in national defense. Moreover, the reserves are exceptionally abundant. However, for the Japanese, even if they wanted to utilize it now, it would probably be beyond their capabilities.

Yongning The Japanese army, using Qinzhou as a base, aims for Yongning. Yongning is the center of the south, and in terms of terrain, it holds a commanding position. It leads east to Xun (Guiping) and Wu (Cangwu), west to Longzhou (Zhennanguan), south to Qinlian, and north to Maping. By seizing Yongning, the Japanese army vainly hopes to use it as a preliminary step to control Guangxi.

Liuzhou Currently, in the strategic defense of Greater Guangxi, the value of Maping is even more important. Maping was formerly known as Liuzhou. The Liu River flows around the city, which is located on the right bank of the river. In terms of the entire province, it can be said to be right in the center. Transportation routes radiate in all directions. In terms of transportation, it is an important city between Guangdong and Guangxi (upper reaches of the Liu River).

Hepu In addition to Yongning, we cannot ignore another route of the Japanese offensive, which is to proceed northeast along Hepu and Yulin to seize Cangwu and block the passage between Guangdong and Guangxi. However, the Japanese army's actions are ultimately unwise: due to the limited convenience of using Longmen Port, subsequent supplies will encounter some difficulties, and our army's deployment on the West River is even stronger. Another point worth noting is the threat to France. The Japanese army seems to be only attempting to cut off the passage between China and Vietnam, making our country's arms transport difficult. However, all our preparations will surely disappoint Japan. And the deeper invasion of southern Guangdong after occupying Hainan Island is at least an embarrassment for France, because they cannot but feel that this is the beginning of the shaking of their Far Eastern interests. Indeed, Japan's military operations in southern Guangdong must be said to have national significance.

### Our Country's Gold Production

— Ju

According to the book Atlesof To—day and To—morrow published this year, the total value of the world's existing gold is £2,889,000,000, with the United States holding the most, followed by the Central Bank of France.

Although China does not have much gold reserves, its gold production is not small. Recent statistics show that from this month (November of the 28th year of the Republic) onwards, in the past twelve months, 180,000 ounces of gold were produced, and in the twelve months before that, 130,000 ounces. From these figures, we can see the increase in the annual amount of gold production. If we improve the mining methods and carry out large-scale excavations, these underground treasures can be said to be inexhaustible and endlessly useful.

According to reliable sources, Chinese banks have purchased and stored 143,000 ounces of gold for the government in the past twelve months. If calculated at a value of US$200 per ounce, the value of the gold stored by the banks would be US$28,600,000.

### American Ambassador to France William Bullitt — President Roosevelt's Confidant

— Chen

Ambassador William Bullitt is President Roosevelt's confidant. Bullitt is a highly influential advisor on decisions regarding U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, and the President almost always follows his advice.

Like other ambassadors, Bullitt is eloquent, witty, and capable, possessing all the smoothness that a diplomat should have. We must remember that the American ambassador does not represent the American government, nor Congress, nor the American people. He represents the American president who decides foreign policy. Therefore, in addition to transmitting messages from the coast to the White House at all times, Bullitt has a transoceanic long-distance telephone conversation with Roosevelt almost every day. Recently, he returned to the United States, had intimate conversations, and stayed overnight in the same room. The President repeatedly urged him to stay, showing their close relationship.

The American Embassy in France is quite magnificent, with 170 rooms. Since the outbreak of this European war, Bullitt has been busy day and night, constantly providing information to Roosevelt. In ordinary times, he has to handle at least 9,000 letters and messages each month, and also receive guests. Wartime official duties are even more tedious. Moreover, he also serves as a representative of the army, navy, and commerce, so although he lives in this magnificent building, he leads a very laborious life.

His entertainment expenses are not much, only US$4,800 per year. The ambassador to London has US$70,000, but he has a private income of US$45,000 per year, plus a government salary of US$17,500, which is enough to make up for the shortfall. His residence is on Avenue d'Iéna, which can be said to be the center of Parisian society. His daily exercise is golf and tennis, and he especially loves horseback riding.

Bullitt grew up in France from an early age, and his French is very fluent, so it is most suitable for him to be the ambassador to France. One of his ancestors, named Joseph Bullitt, was originally French and immigrated to the United States in 1637. Since there is a relationship in bloodline, he naturally has a close affection for the French. Vlaner said: "Bullitt's current closeness to the French is like the past three hundred years being just a week."

Recently, the United States amended the Neutrality Act, abolishing the embargo on arms and other items, giving great assistance to Britain and France. Britain and the United States are of the same race, and they should help each other in times of difficulty. France also benefits greatly from having this American ambassador, so although the United States does this out of a sense of justice, these indirect reasons may also be one of the factors.

### Women and War

— Ruiwen

Women participating in war like men is something that has existed since ancient times. In the Middle Ages, if the lord of a fortress led troops out to fight, then the mistress of the fortress had to command the soldiers under her to defend the fortress if she encountered someone leading troops to attack. In modern times, women's participation in rear-area work has become even more active. In 1914, after the outbreak of the last World War, British men were transferred to France to fight. At that time, after a long period of peace, British women were pampered and did not know what war was. Every British soldier who went to the front always thought that after they left Britain, their women would forever remain peacefully behind the times. However, not long after, when they had the opportunity to return on leave, what surprised the country was that women not only drove ambulances and trucks transporting military supplies, but the entire United Kingdom became a world of women's work. The trains were staffed by women, the trams were staffed by women, and women also wore gray uniforms, transporting wounded soldiers from the front lines to the rear in large numbers, which was extremely brave and astonishing, far from the weak and pitiful image they had imagined. After this war, all air defense and rescue work was taken over by women, and women became even more active in the war.

### Chinese Christian Church Child Labor Nursery

— Xu Ying

Yesterday, the author made a special trip to the Child Labor Nursery on Yanping Road to visit Mr. Tao Yongfu, the person in charge, and learned about the internal situation as follows:

The Process of Establishment

At the time of establishment, there were about one hundred child laborers. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Ewo Cotton Mill allocated a workshop on Yulin Road, and President Mei organized the Second Child Labor Nursery. Since then, the nursery affairs have gradually developed. At that time, there were 33 two-story buildings and 23 ground-floor buildings, enough to accommodate 600 child laborers. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, entrusted by Shenxin Mills No. 5 and No. 6, a Shenxin Workers' Children's School was established at Gaolang Bridge. In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, entrusted by Shenxin Mills No. 1 and No. 8, a second school was established in Zhoujiaqiao. In total, the four locations could enroll 1,000 child laborers each year, and at its peak, it reached 1,300. When the August 13th Incident broke out, because the nursery was in the war zone, it was necessary to dismiss the child laborers. President Mei led 50 homeless orphans to stay temporarily in the Renji Infant Welfare Home. This spring, they moved to Yanping Road in western Shanghai to continue classes. In addition to the 50 orphans, poor children from nearby can also attend school for free. There are a total of 328 male and female students, mostly day students. Boarding students must pay a small fee for meals according to the economic situation of their families.

Current Situation

The current Child Labor Nursery only has two two-story buildings, and in addition to the four classrooms (grades three and four use one classroom, and grades five and six also merge), there are only two bedrooms. One room is a girls' dormitory made up of a sun terrace, and the other is a toddlers' bedroom. Older boys have to use their desks as beds at night. Although the place is small, it is kept very clean and orderly.

In the past, the Child Labor Nursery was divided into three parts: a nursery, a free school, and an orphanage. All children of workers could enter the nursery. Every morning when they went to work, they would send their children here, and the nurses, nurses, and nannies hired by the nursery would take care of them. In the evening when they finished work, their parents would pick them up again. The school was divided into kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school. Most of the children in the orphanage were sent by their parents, and some were sent by the church.

Relationship with Family

The child laborers do not sever relations with their families. Although they can find their own way out after graduation, the nursery can also help introduce them to jobs. As for the orphans without family members, older girls can be matched by the nursery, and others are introduced by the nursery to work in factories or learn crafts in other shops. Those with higher talents also have the hope of continuing their studies, but since the outbreak of the war, the market has been in a slump, so it is even more difficult to introduce orphans to work outside.

Economic Situation

Although the Child Labor Nursery is of a Christian nature, it has no direct relationship with the church, so the church does not provide financial assistance. Before the war, the nursery's monthly expenses were 2,000 yuan, but now, because it has reduced its scope, it only needs 800 yuan per month. Originally, factories and the Shanghai Municipal Council had subsidies every year, and the deficit was raised from the outside world, but now the factories have stopped the subsidies, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has also canceled the subsidies because the nursery is located on a road built beyond the settlement. Therefore, the nursery's finances are even more strained. Recently, President Mei has traveled far to the United States, hoping to raise some funds for the development of the Child Labor Nursery.

### Records of the Extraordinary

— Ju

Normally, two-tenths of a gram of arsenic can be fatal. But in one place—the city of Styria (formerly part of Austria)—people often feed arsenic to infants, hoping that they will grow up to be beautiful. And the amount of arsenic consumed increases with age. Now an adult can eat three grams of arsenic without any danger.

On the Edison Memorial Tower in Menlo Park, New Jersey, USA, there is an extremely large light bulb. This light bulb was custom-made by the Corning Glass Manufacturing Company of New York. It is fourteen feet long and has a maximum diameter of nine feet six inches. The bulb is equipped with 960 incandescent lamps and a 24-inch reflector, and the light emitted at night can illuminate the sky for hundreds of miles around.

More than 900 companies in the United States are run by tens of thousands of young people, both male and female, aged 16 to 21. New York alone has 60. From servants to managers, all positions are held by children. The goods they sell are mostly birdcages, flower pots, knives, wooden bowls, chairs, cuffs, toys, ashtrays, cigarette cases, purses, canes, paper cutters, and other daily odds and ends.

### About "Human" Words

Humans drink an average of one ton of water per year. If one ton is equal to 1,500 catties, then one person drinks four catties and one-half ounces of water per day.

Humans breathe an average of ten times per minute; therefore, they breathe 20,340 times in a whole day of 24 hours. The weight of air that must be inhaled every day is 21 catties, and the weight of air that must be inhaled every year is 7,665 catties.

Blood accounts for 5.5% of the human body. If a person loses three-quarters of their blood, they will die. For example, if a person weighs 100 pounds, then their blood weighs more than five pounds. If four pounds of blood are lost, they will definitely die.

Human body temperature is between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius. Any more or less is a morbid state. In typhoid fever, the temperature can rise above 46 degrees.

The human brain weighs approximately 39 taels.
