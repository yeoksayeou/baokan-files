Three hundred Japanese naval personnel landed on Manzhou Island, south of Beihai. At the same time, three Japanese transport ships and one aircraft carrier are anchored off the island. Chinese military sources do not attach much importance to this landing, believing it insufficient to alter the overall strategic situation. Japanese troops attempting to cross the West River at Hekou (transliteration) have repeatedly failed due to intense Chinese artillery fire. Fierce fighting is taking place in Zengcheng, 50 kilometers northeast of Guangzhou, where Chinese troops have completely surrounded the city and cut off all lines of communication.

(Chongqing) According to military dispatches received here, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province crossed the Fen River in early December, intending to advance westward, but failed due to heavy snow. On December 25th, the Japanese army simultaneously invaded the Yellow River in five routes. The first route used Fenyang and Xiaoyi as bases, advancing southwest, attacking Shilou and Wenxian. Its vanguard appeared near Xingu Pass (transliterated), having crossed the Yellow River from the east bank at the confluence of the Wuding River and the Dali River. The second route used Linfen as a base, advancing northwest, intending to attack Puxian and Daning via Heilong Pass. The third route used Xiangling, southwest of Linfen, as a base, moving westward and then turning north to link up with the second route of the Japanese army at Heilong Pass. The fourth route used Houma, Quwo, and Xinjiang as bases, aggressively advancing southwest, having occupied the towns of Sanquan and Quanzhang. However, this route of the Japanese army is currently being夹击 by Chinese forces on both the north and south sides. The fifth route used Hejin, located north and west of the confluence of the Fen River and the Yellow River, as a base, attacking Yumen, but was defeated by the Chinese army. The Japanese army then turned north, attacking Xiaozhuang and Liaoning in order to meet the second route of the Japanese army fleeing west from Linfen to Daning. The Chinese artillery units on the west bank of the Yellow River are fiercely bombarding the opposite bank to prevent the Japanese army from crossing stealthily. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Xi'an) Military news reports that the Japanese army in Zhongyang and Lishi in western Shanxi Province, after suffering a major blow from the Chinese army on the 13th of last month, immediately began actively preparing for an invasion, attempting to retaliate. In order to thwart the Japanese invasion attempt, the Chinese army took preemptive action, using the KKK Division as the main force on the 30th night, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese in multiple routes. At the same time, a certain division was ordered to attack Lishi City from the north to disrupt traffic on the Lishi-Fenyang highway. That night, the sky was dark and the north wind was howling. The Japanese army was completely unprepared. All Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely. First, the right-wing K Tuan of the Chinese army rushed into Luo Town, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers and burning a large amount of Japanese ammunition and provisions. The Chinese army K Tuan on the front of the highway, with a portion of its forces, also bypassed and attacked the Japanese army in Cungeida, often occupying the village and annihilating seventy to eighty Japanese soldiers. As a result, the rear of the Japanese army in Lijiawan was cut off by the Chinese army. The K and K Tuan simultaneously concentrated their forces and attacked Jijiwan, engaging in fierce fighting all night, eventually recovering Lijiawan. The seven bunkers built by the Japanese army on the southwest mountain in that area were also successively occupied by the Chinese army, who captured four of them. The remaining Japanese army stubbornly resisted in one remaining bunker. On the left flank, the two to three hundred Japanese troops entrenched in Hejiayu were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army’s K Tuan, and most of them were annihilated. Hejiayu, Xingkoukou, and other places were also recovered by the Chinese army at the same time. On the morning of the 31st, the Japanese army increased its forces from Lishi and launched a fierce counterattack. As of the evening of the 31st, fighting was still intense on all routes. (Dispatch, 5th)

(Xi'an) Military news reports that the number of Japanese troops invading the area of the mountain of Liangshan has reached over 7,000. They began to act on the 25th and 26th of last month. One route, consisting of four to five thousand men, invaded Tumen Heilongguan from Linfen. Another route, coming from Nangling, trespassed Guo Village; and another, comprised of two routes of some four to five thousand men came from Jishan invading Xiangning, with a fourth coming from the River crossing and invades West Yugou. After being beaten back soundly by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops at Guo Village retreated north to rendezvous with the Japanese army in Linfen, invading Puxian Daning. The route along the way was constantly attacked by the Chinese garrison, suffering heavy casualties. The rear of the Japanese army that invaded Tumen Heilongguan has been cut off by the recaptured Chinese forces, causing great panic among them. The Japanese army that invaded north from Jishan rendezvoused with the Japanese army at West Yugou and successively invaded Xiangning and Jixian on the 30th and 31st, continuing west. After three days of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was greatly defeated. The remnants of the Japanese army mostly fled north, appearing to be attempting to rendezvous with Daning to attack Pingdu Pass. At the same time, the Japanese army increased by more than 5,000 men at the end of last month. One unit was added to Lishi Zhongyang and another to Dui Jiuyu, attacking F County. The Japanese army in Zhongyang invaded Yuguan via Shuai Village on the 29th. The Japanese army invading Lishi and Zhongyang, after being violently attached by Chinese forces at Jinzhenzhen, have currently taken no action. According to news reports, a unit of the Japanese army in Shilou sneaked across Xinguandu and is currently engaged in battle with a certain unit of the Chinese army. (Dispatch, 5th)

(Hong Kong) The consulate in Hanoi telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Jingwei is still residing in Hanoi and is greatly distressed by the criticisms and rejection by the people of the country. Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai are still desperately lobbying on his behalf. As of the 5th, various parties at home and abroad have telegraphed the Central Yuan departments, requesting that he be openly denounced and punished. Overseas Chinese communities are reportedly outraged. (Special dispatch, 6th, 5:00 PM)

(Hong Kong) Jingwei is scheduled to issue a statement on the 7th.

(Chongqing) Cantonese Central Committee members Luo Yiqun and others sent a telegram to the President on the 1st, expressing their indignation at Jingwei's telegram and requesting strict action. The original telegram reads: Respectfully submitted to President Chiang and esteemed members of the Supervisory Committee: We are astonished to read reports that Mr. Jingwei has recently suggested to the central government that it should make peace with the enemy. We believe that the enemy's attempt to destroy our country is its traditional policy, and that breaking their delusion relies on a long-term war of resistance. Currently, the people of the whole country are united as one, willing to perish together with the country, and the international situation has also improved. Enemy Prime Minister Konoe knows that our government cannot be subdued and that public sentiment cannot be insulted, so he deceives and deludes himself with sweet words. At this critical moment, the people of the country should make persistent efforts to deal with the enemy and strive for final victory. Unexpectedly, Wang has the absurd notion of making peace. We are indignant and earnestly hope that the central government will make a decisive decision and take strict action to correct public opinion. We urgently make this request, hoping that you will consider it. Luo Yiqun, Liu Weichi, Li Qian, Deng Qingyang, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Qingyun, Chen Ce, Ou Fangpu, Huang Linshu, Lu Youling, Guan Jushi, Yu Junxian, respectfully. Eastern [sign]. (Dispatch, 5th)

Editorial

### The Issue of Amending the American Neutrality Act

In his address to the 76th Congress, President Roosevelt, in addition to supporting democracy and criticizing dictatorship, also advocated amending the Neutrality Act. He said: "The Neutrality Act, in its current form, is sufficient to facilitate aggressor nations and disadvantage the nations being invaded, and must be amended." Indeed, the current American Neutrality Act is a superfluous [tumor] under the current international situation. It is not sufficient to protect the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, and it passively contributes to the atrocities of aggressors, causing its own legitimate interests to be repeatedly encroached upon. The American president, recognizing this, has again put forward the proposal for amendment in this session of Congress. This is not only desired by the invaded, but also a necessary measure to protect all legitimate interests of the United States.

The current American Neutrality Act was enacted in 1935 and amended in 1937. In the autumn of 1935, when the Italian-Abyssinian War was about to break out, American isolationists, in order to prevent the United States from repeating the mistake of 1917 and being drawn into the vortex of war, hastily passed this Neutrality Act in Congress. Its main points are: (1) When international war breaks out, the United States must prohibit the transportation of weapons and ammunition to belligerent countries; (2) prohibit American ships from transporting such items; (3) prohibit American citizens from traveling on ships of belligerent countries; (4) crack down on submarines of belligerent countries in American seas or territorial waters; (5) restrict American ships from supplying warships of belligerent countries from American ports. Such content has many drawbacks. In the larger sense, first, it prohibits the export of arms to warring nations, regardless of aggressor or victim, which is tantamount to weakening the resistance of the invaded and passively contributing to the aggressor's atrocities. Second, the so-called "arms" has a broad meaning, and implementation is quite complicated. Third, loans to belligerent countries are the main reason for the United States being drawn into the vortex of war, but this is not stipulated in the Neutrality Act. Therefore, this Neutrality Act cannot prevent the invasion of the United States by war.

So-called international war, legally speaking, must go through the process of declaring war. Although the Italian-Abyssinian War did not go through the process of declaring war, we still recognize it as an international war, so this bill can still be used reluctantly. But now the world is changing, often unexpectedly. After the Italian-Abyssinian War, there was the Spanish War, which contained international war within civil war. Under this form of war, this bill lost its effect. Therefore, the United States amended it in January 1937, banning the shipment of arms to both sides of the Spanish war, on the grounds that the war in Spain was likely to spread beyond Spain's borders. Also, the Japanese invasion of China, which began on July 7, 1937, was also undeclared. Although the American government did not implement the Neutrality Act because the two countries, China and Japan, had not formally declared war, financial giants on Wall Street violated the will of the majority of the American people, undermining the traditional American policy in the Far East, and subsidizing the Japanese invasion. As a result, Japan's ambition to monopolize China was increased, and American interests in China were plundered.

American politicians with foresight have long been calling for the U.S. government to adopt effective measures to stop the aggressor's atrocities. President Roosevelt's request to amend the Neutrality Act is a preliminary measure to sanction the aggressor.

The torrents of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans cannot withstand the aggressor's atrocities. It is impossible for American isolationists to want to stay out of all wars. Only by actively rising up and taking effective measures to stop the aggressor can world peace be maintained and one's own legitimate interests be preserved. Now, at the beginning of Congress, we deeply hope that both houses of Congress can accept the President's opinion, thoroughly amend the Neutrality Act, eliminate all elements that are unfavorable to the invaded and favorable to the aggressor, and more actively stop the aggressor's atrocities!

### British Authorities Actively Discuss Economic Retaliation Against Japan; Plan to Impose Special Taxes on Japanese Goods Throughout the Empire; Chamberlain Consults with Relevant Authorities for the Second Time; American Public Opinion Largely Supports Revising the Neutrality Act

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain once again held talks this morning at the Prime Minister's office on Downing Street with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and Colonial Secretary MacDonald. The discussion revolved around the issue of Japan's interference with other countries' interests in China and plans to retaliate with economic measures, specifically, the imposition of a special tax on Japanese imported goods within the British Empire. It is reported that Britain will wait for the United States to take similar actions and for all possibilities of friendly resolution to prove futile before resorting to retaliatory measures. (Havas, 6th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain held talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon this morning, reportedly discussing the issue of imposing economic retaliation against Japan as the only way to compel Japan to treat British interests in China more favorably. Regarding this matter, experts reportedly advocate raising import tariffs on Japanese goods and reducing import quotas in all British territories. Sir John Simon seems to disapprove, but the final decision of the British government will depend on the attitude of the United States. Even if the U.S. does not take the same measures, merely taking similar actions would allow the British government to take a tougher stance against Japan. In any case, it can be asserted that the amount of British credit loans to China will definitely be increased substantially. The first batch of loans approved by the British government, totaling £500,000, is reportedly being used to purchase heavy-duty vehicles and road construction materials for the滇緬 (Yunnan-Burma) Highway. In addition, a plan for British investment in railway construction in southwestern China is also under consideration. If this materializes in the future, a substantial amount of additional loans will be granted to China. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) Regarding the U.S. government's embargo on arms shipments to Spain in accordance with the Neutrality Act, the number of people in American public opinion calling for its repeal is increasing daily, including one of the drafters of the Neutrality Act, Republican Senator Nye. He even submitted a new bill to Congress in the last session, but it was not passed. He recently told a Havas reporter that there is widespread support for this bill and that he intends to resubmit it to Congress for discussion in the near future. At this point, American public opinion largely supports President Roosevelt's foreign policy. Many members of Congress have received numerous letters from their constituents expressing their support. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate have also received many letters from the public, mostly advocating for the lifting of the arms embargo on Spain and revising the current Neutrality Act to prohibit arms shipments to Japan on the one hand, while still being able to aid China on the other. In addition, five major organizations, including the Spanish Civil Government Relief Association, have submitted a petition to President Roosevelt, based on the recent public opinion poll conducted by the American Institute of Public Opinion (according to the institute's statistics, 76% of the American people support the Spanish Republican government, while only 24% support the Nationalist government), urging him to take action to lift the arms embargo on the Spanish Republican government.

### British Newspaper Advocates Timely Joint Action with the US to Restrain Japan; Economic Leverage Can Be Used to Control Japan's Fate; Establish Understanding with the Chinese Government

(London) The Financial News stated in an editorial today that direct intervention in China by Western countries is clearly impossible today, but Britain's defense of its economic interests is another matter. We have sufficient military strength and powerful tools to utilize. The most effective way to control Japan's fate is through the market, not capital. Britain, with its current trade surplus, can decide to reduce imports from Japan, and no one can prevent it. The same is true for the United States. While war expenses or export credit loans are being discussed, we should not abandon the opportunity to make the current relationship with China even closer. In summary, if the British government does not seize this opportunity to establish an understanding with the United States and the Chinese government, it would be dereliction of duty in the new trade movement. (Reuters, 6th)

(London) The Manchester Guardian stated in an editorial: "Those who say that the period should be extended to promote Japan's failure are extremely thoughtless, because Japan is currently able to engage in war with significant economic means, and will soon gain advantages by controlling China's natural resources. However, on the other hand, Japan is absolutely dependent on its export trade, and its gold reserves are depleted, which is a dangerous weakness. This is well known to President Roosevelt's advisors." (Reuters, 6th)

News from Wellington: According to the detailed regulations for import licenses released by the authorities here yesterday, no restrictions have been imposed on the import of Japanese goods. One importer stated that he heard that import licenses for Japanese cotton goods, English blankets, and German rubber sheets will no longer be issued. British domestically produced cotton cloth is not affected, but Japanese goods have been reduced by one-third compared to before. The import volume of both British and Japanese artificial silk has been reduced by one-third. One car repair shop owner stated that British rubber tires can be imported in the same quantity as in the first half of last year, but Canadian tires have been reduced by half. British cars can also be imported in the same quantity as in the first half of last year. Importers are still urging the government to announce its import license policy clearly as soon as possible, so that they can understand the government's intentions and plan for the future.

### British Chambers of Commerce Closely Liaise to Protect Trade with China

(London) Mr. Stewart, Chairman of the Far East Group of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, stated today, praising Sir Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, for his capable work in keeping domestic merchants informed of the changing situation in the region. He also described the situation of Japan's control of important import and export commercial lines and transportation lines in China, saying that the situation that will arise when the war ends in the future is a matter of great concern. Representatives from the China Association and the Chambers of Commerce of London, Bradford, and Manchester have now jointly formed a Liaison Committee on China in London to maintain close contact and protect British trade in China.

### Japanese Rumors Are Futile; Ambassadors to Britain and the United States Deny Peace Talks

(London) After rumors circulated in Shanghai that the Chinese ambassadors to Britain, France, and the United States had telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek, requesting him to accept the peace proposal put forward by Wang Jingwei, the Chinese Embassy in Britain issued a public statement today, firmly denying it and stating, "This is a false message issued by the Japanese side, completely unfounded. In fact, Ambassador Guo Taiqi has twice telegraphed Wang Jingwei in his capacity as an old friend, strongly advising him to abandon the peace movement. The Japanese side is now deliberately engaging in false propaganda, intending to deceive public opinion, spread doubts, and confuse people, only to see that their efforts are futile." (Havas, 6th)

(Washington) The Chinese Embassy issued a statement today, regarding the rumors spread by the Japanese in Shanghai that the Chinese Ambassador to the United States had requested the government to negotiate peace with Japan, stating that it is completely unfounded and deliberately fabricated by the Japanese side, which is sufficient to prove the difficult state of Japan's war against China for the past two years. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Strong US Note; Japanese Side Still Studying; No Comment on Roosevelt's Message; US Ambassador Returns Home Saying It Is Not Important

The spokesperson of the Tokyo Foreign Ministry stated at the first reception for journalists after the New Year that the note sent by the United States to Japan on December 31st of last year was worded very well, and the Japanese side has been studying it. However, it is too early to make any criticism at this time, and it is difficult to make a definite reply. The spokesperson refused to comment on President Roosevelt's message to Congress, and said that the return of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew to his home country was not of great significance. If Grew can report the actual situation in Japan to the U.S. government and people, then he will have made no small contribution to promoting relations between Japan and the United States. When asked whether Japan had investigated reports that drug trafficking was extremely rampant in the areas of China occupied by the Japanese army, the spokesperson replied that drug trafficking in the areas occupied by the Japanese army has been strictly controlled by the Japanese authorities, and continued, "The statements made by the British House of Commons may have some basis." (Reuters, 6th)

(Washington) Officials are reluctant to comment on the new Japanese cabinet, but are paying close attention to it. Observers believe that President Roosevelt's statement in his message to Congress that the United States may apply other means more forceful than "words" to deal with aggressor nations is a new hint to Japan, and they believe that there is little hope of improving U.S.-Japan relations under the Hiranuma cabinet. (Associated Press, 5th)

### British Troop Increase to Strengthen Hong Kong Defense

### Roosevelt's Great Words and Wise Sayings; Chamberlain Welcomes Them Greatly; American Democracy is a Compass for Human Progress; German Newspapers Once Again Scathingly Attack

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a written statement commenting on President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday, stating, "President Roosevelt yesterday welcomed the members elected by the American people with solemn words. Those who bear the great responsibility of governing will surely feel a deep impression upon hearing them. If we want to maintain and promote the achievements we have worked hard for over many eras, so that we ourselves and future generations can benefit from them, we must maintain freedom and preserve peace. Since this is well known to us, we must welcome the emotions expressed by President Roosevelt. American democracy should occupy an important position in world affairs and strive with all its might for the ideal of orderly human progress. All of this can be seen in President Roosevelt's message." (Havas, 5th)

(London) After President Roosevelt delivered his message to Congress yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain was deeply impressed, as can be seen from the written statement he issued shortly afterward. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister has decided to take a more resolute attitude towards the dictatorial countries. Those in the know say that Britain's attitude towards Japan, Italy, and Germany should become tougher. Regarding Japan, the British government seems to be waiting for the United States to make a decision on the issue of revising the Neutrality Act before contacting them, hoping to unite economically to put pressure on Japan. In Britain, there are many who advocate that only by launching a "counterattack" can British interests be protected. Regarding Italy, Prime Minister Chamberlain seems to be advising France and Italy to resolve their current disputes within the scope of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain will not accept any compromise plan for the Spanish Civil War that would facilitate the Spanish Nationalist government. Regarding Germany, any plan that would reduce Britain's commercial competitiveness should also be avoided. (Havas, 5th)

(Berlin) According to news from this area, although the German diplomatic community is displeased with President Roosevelt's speech, it will not make any formal protests. The most likely development is that Hitler will give a reply to Roosevelt in his speech when Germany convenes on January 30th. The general opinion is still that the severing of diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States is not an issue. (Reuters, 6th)

(Berlin) German newspapers did not initially comment on French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Corsica and Tunisia in North Africa, but by yesterday afternoon, they had changed their attitude, clearly siding with Italy, and using headlines with the words "Italian Indignation". (Havas, 6th)

### American Diplomatic Community Pays Close Attention to the Infiltration of Dictatorial Ideologies into Central and South America

(Washington) The propaganda movements carried out by National Socialism and Fascism in Central American countries are still being watched by people in the American diplomatic community. It is said that there are many Germans working in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, especially El Salvador. They are gradually instilling these countries with totalitarian ideas in the same way that Germany does. El Salvador even has three military academies and military training affairs entrusted to the German general Pontzet. The re-election of President Martinez for six consecutive years is also a major focus of the totalitarian propaganda movement. (Havas, 5th)

Boston: Federal Court Inspector Dewey of New York stated yesterday that German travel agencies had remitted funds to Germany in the name of sending "travel marks" through the German Relief Association here. Upon hearing this, the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare urgently wanted to find out whether the relief association was financially linked to Germany and has begun an investigation. (Havas, 5th)

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress; Formation of the Atlantic Fleet; Fifty Warships of All Sizes; On Par with the Pacific Fleet

(Washington) President Roosevelt warned the dictatorial countries yesterday, and today he expressed his determination with actions, officially announcing the formation of the Atlantic Fleet. The fleet includes fifty warships, and from now on, the U.S. fleet has become two major parts: the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. This is a fact that has not been seen for many years. Both fleets have been assigned to designated locations, ready to deal with aggressor nations. The newly established Atlantic Fleet includes eight first-class cruisers, eight of the newest destroyers, fifteen older destroyers, and an unspecified number of submarines and aircraft. According to senior U.S. officials, President Roosevelt had previously stated that he was determined to make the U.S. fleet the leader of the world, and the U.S. will build a stronger Atlantic Fleet within a year, so that the President's determination can be seen in practice. According to the defense plan presented by the President to Congress, the U.S. government will use $2,000,000,000 to build 100 new ships, two giant battleships, two cruisers, eight destroyers, eight submarines, two seaplane carriers, and one repair ship. The so-called giant battleships are each around 45,000 tons. Government officials also stated that a large part of the defense budget will be used to build 10,000 first-class aircraft, which will be completed in three or four years. (Associated Press, 6th)

(Washington) The Navy Department recently submitted a bill to Congress, proposing to authorize the Federal Maritime Commission to requisition all national seamen as soon as the President declares a "state of alert," even before declaring war. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) The Federal Communications Commission submitted its annual report to Congress this afternoon, stating that the Commission is discussing matters related to the organization of all means of transportation in order to cope with future international emergencies. All radio, wired, and telephone communications should be studied. The proposed measures can be used for national defense and for natural disasters such as floods. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt submitted next year's budget to Congress, with revenues totaling $5,669,300,000 (an increase of $149,230,000 compared to this year) and expenditures totaling $8,995,663,200 (a decrease of $496,665,800 compared to this year). Among them, defense expenditure is $1,319,558,000 (an increase of $309,351,000 compared to this year). The difference between revenue and expenditure is $3,326,343,200, and the principal and interest of public debt, which requires $100,000,000, is not included. The President also declared in his message, "If we want to increase the national gross income, it cannot be achieved by enacting laws. If the government can implement a wise tax policy, it will be of great benefit. This has been proven by recent years of experience. At present, the national gross income is $60,000,000,000 per year, which has increased compared to several years ago, and should continue to be increased." In addition, various federal agencies, such as the Federal Credit Bureau, the Federal Import and Export Bank, and the Federal Rural Electrification Association, are of great benefit to economic recovery, and Congress should be asked to extend their terms of existence. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) Well-informed sources here say that the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh submitted a report to the U.S. government on the overwhelming superiority of the German air force after inspecting the air forces of Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in August of last year. Although personnel from the Department of the Army are unwilling to confirm this, the government's intention to increase defense expenditure has become even more determined because of this. The next year's budget submitted by President Roosevelt to Congress yesterday, which contains a defense expenditure of as much as $1,319,558,000, was also influenced by this report. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently asked Congress to allocate $875,000,000 for the Federal Public Works Administration to handle various projects to relieve unemployment, stating that the current fiscal year will end at the end of June, but the unemployment relief funds approved by Congress are only enough to last until next month, and additional funds must be allocated in order to continue relief work. It is expected that the Federal Public Works Administration can employ 3 million unemployed workers in February and March, but this number will be reduced to 2.7 million in June. (Havas, 5th)

### Wells Condemns Dictatorship; Australian Prime Minister Expresses Regret

Melbourne: H.G. Wells, the famous British writer currently visiting Australia, spoke to visitors, condemning Hitler as a "madman" and Mussolini as a "traitor to social democracy." Australian Prime Minister Lyons does not agree with Wells's remarks insulting the heads of other countries and published an article expressing regret for Wells's criticism of the leaders of other countries, and hoping that Wells would use his genius to promote international understanding and not cause misunderstandings. Wells now says that he will respond shortly. (Reuters, 6th)

### 平沼 Announces Political Views:  Spare No Effort to Cope With the Difficult Times; Emphasize Uniting the People and Concentrating Resources; Also States Fascist Colors Have Been Abandoned

(Tokyo) Last night, when the new cabinet members held their inaugural ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Prime Minister Hiranuma and others all wore formal attire. This was the first time since the Yamamoto Cabinet held its inaugural ceremony the day after the Great Kanto Earthquake on September 1, 1923. After the ceremony, all the new cabinet members gathered at the Prime Minister's official residence, using rice wine instead of champagne to toast the new cabinet. The average age of the cabinet members is 57, three years older than the Konoe Cabinet. (Reuters, 6th)

(Tokyo)  The newly appointed Prime Minister Hiranuma, after holding the first cabinet meeting of the new cabinet last night, immediately met with journalists and stated earnestly that he intended to implement the policy of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, passed at the Imperial Conference on November 30th. He also resolved to fully respect the Constitution and the parliamentary system. The China policy drafted by the Konoe Cabinet and approved by the Emperor must be implemented, and the various plans that have already begun in accordance with that policy must be carried out. He intended to maintain the Konoe Five-Minister Council system "towards China" and the cabinet deliberation council system. When asked about his attitude toward the various political parties, the Prime Minister replied that Japan originally had a constitutional government.  He would not only respect the Constitution but also respect the Parliament. He did not want to ignore political parties, nor did he want to organize a dictatorial party or rigorously reorganize the nation. Political education must be allowed to mature in order to ensure the healthy development of the various political parties. If the people could prioritize the interests of the imperial family and the nation, then selfish interests would be eliminated. School, social, and political education must proceed according to this direction. The regular budget plan for 1939 to 1940 had already been compiled by the Konoe Cabinet, and the new cabinet would adopt it. The continuity of Japan's financial policy could be attested to by the appointment of Ishiwata as Minister of Finance, who had served as the Director-General under the previous Minister of Finance Ikeda. Reporters also inquired about Konoe serving as Minister without Portfolio. The reply was that there were two previous examples of Ministers without Portfolio in Japanese history. This morning at 10:40 AM, the new cabinet held its second cabinet meeting, attended by all cabinet members, including Konoe. Foreign Minister Arita explained the policy of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations passed at the Imperial Conference on November 30th. (Reuters, 6th)

(Tokyo) Hiranuma delivered a radio address to various sectors of the country on the evening of the 6th, asking the people to unite to establish the "New Order in East Asia."  It lasted ten minutes.  He stated that the "China Incident" had now reached its third year and entered a new phase. The policy Japan held towards the "China Incident" had already been decided and approved by the Emperor, and the previous cabinet had also been implementing it in accordance with this policy. The current cabinet was resolved to strive to achieve its objectives in China in accordance with this fixed policy. Japan's future was full of thorns, and today the entire nation needed to concentrate resources to overcome difficulties.  From now on, the government's policies would focus on the development of national resources, the strengthening of general mobilization, in order to cope with the international situation. Japan's political institutions relied on the unanimous support of the entire nation. Every citizen should perform their duties. Whenever the nation was in crisis, the result was invariably the strengthening of domestic unity. Today, it was necessary to strengthen this traditional national spirit and fully mobilize national resources in order to complete the arduous task of establishing a "New Order in East Asia." (Wire Report, 6th)

(Tokyo) Finance Minister Sotaro Ishiwata today asked former Finance Minister Ikeda to accept the position of advisor to the Ministry of Finance. (Wire Report, 6th)

(Berlin) After the formation of the Hiranuma Cabinet in Japan, German newspapers have commented, generally stating that Japan's diplomacy and domestic affairs should remain the same. This could be seen in the circumstances of the Hiranuma Cabinet's formation. Its objective in the war against China also remained the declaration issued by former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on December 22 of last year. It was unknown by what method the objective would be achieved. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported that General Araki's reappointment as Minister of Education was a manifestation of Japan's radical tendencies. The political methods advocated by former Minister of Interior General Koiso were even more rigid than those of General Araki. Having failed to form a unified political party, Koiso had withdrawn from the cabinet. The promotion of Ishiwata from Director-General of the Ministry of Finance to Minister of Finance was quite important. "Due to the war against China, Japan's financial problems are numerous and require resolution." The Münchner Neueste Nachrichten reported that "The anti-Comintern policy that the paper advocates will not change due to the cabinet reshuffle. Former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe bravely admitted that various problems arising from China could not be resolved one by one, and therefore he withdrew to make way for a strong new cabinet to cope with them, and the new cabinet would overcome the remaining internal resistance. What is unknowable is what method will be used." Although Japan's China policy took Konoe's December 22 declaration as its conclusion, "the peace based on this declaration has been rejected by China. Jingwei's attempt to negotiate peace has also been sanctioned. This is something the world should not forget." (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

(Tokyo) It is still difficult to say what the political colors of the Hiranuma Cabinet will be. Its tendencies may be similar to the policies already adopted during this time of political tension. The universal crisis of the Japanese nation, that is, the so-called construction project, that is, in reality, ending the "China Incident", must be tackled with all efforts. However, in order to cope with the China Incident, the new cabinet may have to demand that the various zaibatsu make real sacrifices. Regarding the diplomatic event, the Japan-Soviet fisheries agreement may easily cause incidents. The new cabinet must pay close attention to the Soviet Union. As for the increasing pressure exerted by the UK and the US on Japan, how the new cabinet should respond is a difficult matter to grasp in the current political situation. Regarding domestic affairs, the House of Representatives has a strong right-wing tendency. The military and the nationalists all hope that Hiranuma can place the House of Representatives under guardianship and, reversing Konoe's wavering attitude, resolutely form a unified political party.

### Chamberlain to Visit France First, Then to Rome

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will go to Rome on the afternoon of the 10th of this month. When passing through Paris, they will have tea with French Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, taking the opportunity to hold talks. (Havas, 6th)

(London) After a meeting with Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Prime Minister Chamberlain held important talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax in the afternoon. Informed sources have recently stated that the main issues discussed were two: Firstly, jointly with the United States, economic measures would be used to sanction Japan, thereby protecting the interests of the UK and the US in China. Secondly, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary would visit Italy in the middle of this month. Regarding the latter, it was heard that they had agreed not to mediate the dispute between France and Italy, and that pressure should be put on Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to ensure that the plan for the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers from Spain would materialize. At the same time, Italy's cessation of intervention in the Spanish Civil War was the best way for France and Italy to reopen negotiations and for the Anglo-Italian Agreement to be fully implemented in spirit and in letter. (Havas Wire Report, 5th)

### Holding Meetings to Discuss Military Matters

Algiers Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by his entourage, arrived here at 8:30 this morning on the cruiser "Admiral Foch" from Bizerte. The local fortress immediately fired a salute, and 45 aircraft soared into the air. Welcoming crowds lined the streets, mostly Arab chiefs and natives, cheering. Premier Daladier then went to the cemetery for war dead and laid a wreath. Thousands of people sang the French national anthem in unison. At 10:00, he reviewed the garrison, with a total of 12,000 soldiers participating. The crowd shouted "Long live Daladier," "Long live France," and "Long live the Army." National flags were hung throughout the city, decorating it anew. Premier Daladier then went to the headquarters and convened a military meeting with military and political authorities from various territories in North Africa. The cheering of the residents along the way was very enthusiastic. After the meeting, Daladier had lunch at the palace. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

Susa The welcome Premier Daladier received here yesterday, concluded his tour of Tunisia. Although the grandness of yesterday's welcome could not exceed that received in Tunis, its warmth was deeply touching. One of the most moving moments was when Daladier presented a new flag to a regiment of the colonial artillery. Daladier's face was more solemn than usual, and in the sudden silence, he kissed the flag before a great cheer erupted. The scene at that time was truly moving. Daladier then mingled with the French and native crowds, shaking hands with countless people with great enthusiasm. When Daladier boarded the train to return to France, a grand farewell ceremony took place. Daladier seemed deeply moved by this sincere expression and only made gestures to express his joy. (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

Susa Before Premier Daladier left here yesterday, an Arab bishop who welcomed the Premier to El Jem stated that "Our protector is Daladier, not Mussolini. We need France, not other countries." (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

### Franco-Italian National Flag Insult Case: Italy Protests to France

The semi-official Stefani news agency issued a message stating that the Italian Overseas Chinese Association in Tunisia, North Africa, passed a resolution yesterday, solemnly declaring that the various rights enjoyed by Italian Overseas Chinese should not be infringed upon. They also expressed loyalty to King Umberto III and Prime Minister Mussolini, stating briefly, "Although Italian Overseas Chinese in Tunisia are calm, self-restrained, and law-abiding, provocative acts are emerging one after another, causing indignation." (Havas Wire Report, 5th)

(Rome) Regarding the pro-Italian demonstrations held during French Premier Daladier's visit to Tunisia, the Italian Consul-General in Tunisia lodged a protest directly with the French Resident-General, informing him of the indignation of all Italian Overseas Chinese regarding the insult to the Italian flag. Political figures here are paying close attention to the future developments of this matter. According to indications here, in addition to increasing the number of troops stationed in Tunisia and the North African garrison, a second detachment will depart from Marseille today for French Somaliland. (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

(Rome) All newspapers here have prominently published in large fonts the incident of the insult to the Italian flag that occurred in Tunis on Tuesday. The Turin Stampa reported that "this unexpected event is a crime" and stated that "France is now carrying out an act of aggression in a place not legally under its sovereignty." It ended by saying, "Although this account is becoming ever longer, the French will ultimately pay the last penny in accordance with the demands of justice." (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

(Rome) The Italian newspaper Giornale d'Italia reported that 20,000 Italian immigrants were resettled in Libya last year, and it is planned to continue sending 20,000 people there this year. The newspaper also carried a message from Tripoli stating that Libyan Governor-General Balbo and senior Fascist officials, in a meeting, drafted a colonial program for 1939 to build five new villages, six small villages, and 2,000 farms for Italian colonists to live in. (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

(Berlin) German newspapers, which had previously refrained from attacking US President Roosevelt when commenting on Daladier's tour of North Africa, are now launching a major attack on the US President. Some newspapers have headlines such as "Want to Starve German Women and Children" and "Biddleman Wants to Deprive Dictatorships of Food." The Börsen-Zeitung published an article by Dr. Meggle, stating that President Roosevelt now intends to challenge, aiming to weaken Britain so that the United States can seize British territory. (Reuters Wire Report, 6th)

### Clashes Erupt Again on the Czech-Hungarian Border: Fourteen Deaths on Both Sides

Budapest The Hungarian government notified the German and Italian envoys today that a serious incident occurred in the small town of Munkács near the Czech border in the north this morning. At the same time, it lodged a protest with the Czech government, stating that the Hungarian government would not be responsible for any consequences if the matter were to escalate. Regarding this case, semi-official sources have stated that a group of Czech troops and Ukrainian terrorist party members, at 3:40 this morning, drove three armored vehicles across the Hungarian border, occupied the village of Oroszvány, and immediately advanced towards the town of Munkács with machine guns. Hungarian border guards immediately opened fire in retaliation. One of the trucks fell into a mountain stream, and the soldiers in the truck have been captured. Police and gendarmes in Munkács rushed to the scene of the incident after being alerted and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Czech soldiers. At that time, the Czech side suddenly opened fire, and eight shells hit a hotel, a theater, and several civilian houses. The Czech artillery opened fire again at 10:00 am and had not stopped as of the time of the telegram. Czech soldiers and Ukrainians attempted to forcibly cross the Latorca River without success. Several Hungarian officers belonging to the Hungarian-Czech border demarcation committee were also forced to join the battle. On the Hungarian side, four officers and five soldiers have been killed. Five Czechs have also died from gunshot wounds. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

### Polish Foreign Minister Meets with Hitler: Discusses the Issue of Germans in Poland; France Considers it of Great Importance

Munich Führer Hitler received Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck at the town of Berchtesgaden at 3:00 this afternoon, and they held talks until 6:15. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Before returning to his country, Colonel Beck may continue talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, which is also possible. German political figures have stated that the talks between Poland and Germany are of little significance. Foreign Minister Beck's trip is of a personal nature. In view of the friendly relations between the two sides, this move is also a matter of course. The German public did not know about Foreign Minister Beck's visit to Germany until the German News Agency issued a brief communique this evening. (Havas Wire Report, 5th)

Berchtesgaden Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived here at 3:00 PM yesterday. He immediately paid a personal visit to Führer Hitler's private residence, the Berghof, to present his credentials. The Führer and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop welcomed him at the door and exchanged greetings. Those who came here with Colonel Beck included Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski, Director of Protocol of the German Foreign Ministry Baron Dörnberg, and German Ambassador to Poland Moltke. A guard of honor organized by the Führer's personal guard stood at the entrance to pay their respects. The Führer then invited Beck into his library, where they held talks for a long time. The German interpreter Schmidt acted as the interpreter. At that time, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Ambassador to Poland Lilke, and Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski were all present. (Haitong Wire Report, 4th)

Munich Informed sources stated last night that Polish Foreign Minister Beck did not discuss the Ukrainian issue when he met with German Führer Hitler at the Berghof yesterday. From Germany's standpoint, this issue is not urgent. The issues discussed by Hitler and Beck included Memel and Danzig, but the German side did not propose changing German-Polish relations. What was noted was all the economic and cultural measures recently taken by the Polish authorities in Olsa and Silesia against the German minority. The German side believes that such measures are tantamount to being anti-German. Good relations between Germany and Poland are only possible on the condition that the Polish authorities respect the cultural and economic rights of the German minority in Poland. (Haitong Wire Report, 6th)

(Berlin) Informed sources here have stated that Führer Hitler discussed the following issues with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck: (1) If conflicts were to occur between Italy and France, what attitude should Germany and Poland take? It is not yet known what decisions were reached regarding this. (2) Regarding the issue of the German minority in Poland, Führer Hitler stated the points of dissatisfaction of the Germans. Foreign Minister Beck said that according to the German-Polish press agreement, both sides' newspapers should avoid interfering in each other's internal affairs. It was inappropriate for German newspapers to support the Ukrainian autonomy movement in Poland. (3) The issue of the Memel autonomous region of Lithuania. (4) The issue of aid to Polish Jews deported from Germany. (5) The issue of whether the non-aggression pact signed between Germany and Poland on January 26, 1934, remained fully valid. Both sides had agreed on this. (Havas Wire Report, 5th)

(Paris) The talks held between German Führer Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck have been commented on by French political figures, who believe that they are extremely important. It is said that the fate of Poland depends on the outcome of these talks. Foreign Minister Beck's trip is comparable to former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg's trip to Berchtesgaden. It is heard that Führer Hitler had demanded that the Polish government abandon its plan to connect its territory with Hungary and assist Germany in expanding its influence towards Ukraine. If Poland were to comply, it would be difficult to maintain its independent status. Foreign Minister Beck had considered this when he was vacationing in southern France recently and had discussions with the Polish ambassadors to France and Italy. It was generally believed that although Italy had once supported the plan for Poland and Hungary to connect their territories, it no longer supports Poland. In addition, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had previously indicated to the Polish authorities during his visit to Warsaw that he was willing to support German policies. (Havas Wire Report, 5th)

(London) Informed sources here have stated that once the Memel autonomous region issue is "resolved smoothly," Germany will incorporate the Free City of Danzig into its territory. Because the UK and France are unwilling to see the League of Nations suffer another blow, they plan to ask the League of Nations' High Commissioner in the Free City of Danzig, Burckhardt, to resign voluntarily, thus relieving the League of Nations of its responsibility. Poland and Germany have long been pursuing a policy of direct negotiations, willing to resolve the Danzig issue directly with Germany. How this issue evolves is beyond the control of the UK and France, so they are unwilling to interfere. Even the League of Nations should not let itself be manipulated and placed in a difficult position. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's talks with German Führer Hitler yesterday may not be able to establish a friendly solution to this issue. If Germany were to "perform surgery" in the short term, then Poland's "thoroughly Polish policy" would have to bear the consequences on its own. The UK does not criticize it and can only express its helplessness. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

Warsaw Regarding the talks between German Führer Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, all newspapers here have placed it in a prominent position, but the government-run newspapers only publish brief news. The industrial and commercial newspaper "Polski" reported that it would be superfluous to assume that the Polish people are deeply concerned about the outcome of these talks. In the new Europe, German-Polish relations should occupy an important position. The end of 1938 will be the period of the final trial of German-Polish relations. The world press describes this phenomenon as the "Ukrainian storm," but there are still important issues related to the two countries that need to be resolved urgently and should be discussed by the diplomatic leaders of Germany and Poland as soon as possible. (Haitong Wire Report, 6th)

Warsaw After Foreign Minister Beck held talks with German Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich, Germany, informed sources here stated that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop would visit Warsaw this month. The date of his visit may be decided face-to-face by him and Foreign Minister Beck today, or it may be on the 26th of this month, which is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

Warsaw Regarding Foreign Minister Beck's talks with German Führer Hitler, the newspapers here are generally silent. The government's daily illustrated newspaper reported that Poland's foreign policy aims to maintain a balance, and this trip is to help promote this policy. These talks are not directed at anyone, but rather to show that Germany is willing to maintain good relations with Poland. The opposition Democratic Party's Polish Post reported that Germany is currently exploring where to attack this year. Since it knows that the plan to establish an independent Ukrainian state cannot be realized, it will not act in Ukraine. The semi-official Dobre Report criticized someone in France for trying to win over Germany, alienating it from Italy, and expanding its influence to the Ukrainian region. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

(Rome) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's trip to Germany has been commented on by political figures here. An Italian newspaper once said that there was no lack of friction between Germany and Poland. Now that Foreign Minister Beck has made this trip, these doubts can naturally be dispelled. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to visit Warsaw next month to persuade Poland to cooperate closely with Germany and Italy in the Middle East and Europe within the Berlin-Rome Axis. This task may be facilitated by the talks between the German and Polish authorities this time. (Havas Wire Report, 6th)

### Bank of England Restricts Foreign Exchange Gold Transactions to Maintain the Current Value of the Pound; US and French Authorities Agree

(London) Reuters, from reliable sources, has learned that the Treasury, due to recent large-scale speculative trading against the pound, has requested all banks and major gold and silver trading firms not to assist in speculative transactions unfavorable to the pound by borrowing to acquire gold or by selling and buying gold and foreign exchange. The banks of the United States, Britain, and France, which have concluded the Tripartite Monetary Agreement, have all received the same request. (Reuters, 6th)

(London) The Bank of England has issued a notice to all private banks in the country, requesting that they refrain from gold and foreign exchange transactions of a speculative nature and not lend gold to stabilize the position of the pound. In addition, the Bank of England is also requesting that France and the United States, the other two signatories to the monetary agreement, advise their respective private banks to follow suit. According to statistics from the end of December last year, the gold held by the Exchange Equalisation Account and the Bank of England decreased by as much as £145,000,000 from March to the end of September last year. Financial circles here deeply believe that since the resolution of the Czech problem at the end of September last year, capital previously deposited in the UK by various countries must have been gradually withdrawn. Therefore, the outflow of gold from the UK has not stopped, as evidenced by the unrest in the foreign exchange market today. (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) Following the automatic adoption of restrictions on foreign exchange and gold transactions by banks in Britain and France today, it is generally believed here that this is a legitimate measure permitted by the monetary agreement between the United States, Britain, and France. The U.S. Treasury Department has decided to support Britain and France in accordance with this agreement, but it will not advise U.S. banks to follow suit, as U.S. law grants private banks greater freedom. (Havas, 5th)

(New York) After the Bank of England adopted restrictions on foreign exchange and gold transactions today, banking circles here declared that, recently, a large amount of capital has flowed out of the UK, weakening the position of the pound. The government has therefore taken various measures to maintain it, with restrictions on foreign exchange transactions being one aspect. It is said that since the failure of Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy, foreign funds deposited in the UK have flowed abroad, and even British capital has flowed to other countries (mainly the United States). The decline in the value of the pound is due to this. (Havas, 5th)

(Paris) After the Bank of England restricted transactions in foreign exchange and gold, the French Ministry of Finance declined to comment. It expressed sympathy for the efforts of the British authorities to maintain the current price of the gold pound. Responsible persons here stated that the French government was supported by Britain when it stabilized the French franc in November last year, and France should reciprocate, but the specific measures have not yet been determined technically. (Havas, 6th)

### Sharp Drop in British Government Bond Prices; Widespread Discussion

(London) British government bonds have been weak repeatedly and fell sharply again yesterday. This is now a major topic of discussion here. It is said that those dealing in British government bonds have been expecting prices to fall for several weeks, because the previous market price was too high, making it difficult for the government to successfully borrow for military expenditures. In addition, the weak pound discourages general investors from using their savings to purchase British government bonds, resulting in few buyers. Sellers have had to reduce prices to find buyers. The first sellers are said to be Britons preparing to pay income tax and foreigners determined to remit their funds back to London. The Financial News's suggestion that the Exchange Equalisation Account should use its surplus funds to purchase government bonds to maintain prices seems not to have been adopted by the authorities.

### Belgian Gold Shipped to Britain; Germany Expresses Dissatisfaction, Saying It Impairs Independence

(Berlin) The People's Observer reported today that the continuous shipment of Belgian gold to London endangers Belgium's neutrality. According to reports from Brussels, the Belgian gold already shipped to London by March last year was worth £62 million. Germany, as a guarantor of Belgian independence, cannot continue to ignore this issue. If the Belgian government loses its freedom of action due to the gold being stored in Britain, then the independence proclaimed by the King of Belgium is indeed precarious. It is said that Belgium has created a situation in which, once a war occurs, Belgium will be forced to favor one side when implementing neutrality. In the event that Britain and France violate Belgian neutrality, Belgium fears the confiscation of its gold stored in Britain and will inevitably weigh the pros and cons. This weakness must be eliminated. (Reuters, 6th)

### Anglo-German Relations in a Stalemate; The Government Does Not Approve of Norman's Trip

(London) German Ambassador Dirksen met with Foreign Secretary Halifax today, reportedly to inquire about the British government's position before engaging in talks with Italy and to discuss general relations between Britain and Germany. Political figures here say that relations between Britain and Germany are now in a stalemate. The Federation of British Industries, which had originally planned to send a delegation to Germany in the near future to promote trade, has now postponed the discussion. In addition, although Bank of England Governor Norman traveled to Berlin yesterday, it is unlikely that he will achieve any results, and he did not report to the government before his departure. The authorities here only learned of his trip from the newspapers and do not necessarily approve of Norman's trip. (Havas, 5th)

(Berlin) Bank of England Governor Norman, currently visiting Deutsche Bank President Schacht, attended the christening ceremony of Schacht's beloved grandson yesterday in the splendid reception room of Deutsche Bank. Norman was the only foreign guest to attend the ceremony and served as the godfather to Schacht's grandson, who was named "Norman." From various hints, it appears that important talks between the two major financiers will be reserved for the meeting in Basel. Individuals here believe that the visit of the U.S. Ambassador to Italy to Mussolini yesterday and the presentation of President Roosevelt's letter on the Jewish question will add a possible new factor to a certain aspect of the meeting between Norman and Schacht. Here, considerable attention has been paid to the possibility of linking Norman's visit to Berlin with the upcoming visit of a British industrial delegation to Germany. (Reuters, 6th)

(Berlin) Several British newspapers, including The Times of London, were again confiscated this morning upon delivery to Germany for unknown reasons. (Havas, 6th)

(Berlin) Bank of England Governor Norman is scheduled to leave Germany today for the Swiss capital, possibly accompanied by Schacht, to attend the board meeting of the Bank for International Settlements. Authoritative sources are keeping silent about Norman's visit to Germany, but private sources say that "Schacht's visit to London regarding Anglo-German trade relations and Jewish immigration will be continued during Norman's stay in Germany." (United Press, 6th)

### Legislative Yuan Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday

(Chongqing) The Legislative Yuan held its 153rd meeting at 2 PM yesterday, with over 50 members present, chaired by President Sun. The matters discussed included the revision of Articles 1, 4, and 5 and the protocol of the annex to the Covenant of the League of Nations. The decision was made to pass the review report.

### Government Abolishes Over 6,000 Kinds of Extortionate and Miscellaneous Taxes

(Chongqing) According to reports here, through several years of effort and implementation by the National Government, and compliance from various provinces and cities, over 6,000 kinds of extortionate and miscellaneous taxes have been abolished, amounting to over 70 million yuan, greatly reducing the burden on the people. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the government has consistently implemented the above policy without change. Moreover, to facilitate the transportation of domestic goods and develop foreign trade, transportation agencies in various regions have been improved, transportation routes have been expanded, transportation costs have been reduced, and raw material taxes have been eliminated to promote production, increase transportation, and thus prosper the national economy and enrich national strength.

People from Wuyuan and Gui Sui say that when the Chinese guerrillas attacked the old city of Suiyuan at the end of last month, they killed several traitors. Chairman Fu's proclamations were found in every street and alley in the city, and the people were extremely excited. (Telegraph, 5th)

### General Outline of Policies Implemented in Fujian Province

Yanping Since the War of Resistance, the authorities in Fujian Province have implemented policies for internal line construction in preparation for a protracted war. In the past year, they have done their utmost to mobilize manpower, financial resources, and material resources for this purpose. Governor of Fujian Province Chen Yi recently inspected various locations on the internal lines at the beginning of the new year and passed through here yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him to inquire about his impressions of the achievements of this policy and his plans for promoting work in various departments this year. According to him, the main tasks of the past year were to conduct conscription and organize and train the people. Replenishing troops is the primary task to support the war. Therefore, all 60+ counties in the province last year focused on this as the top priority. The conscripts sent by the counties each month, mostly those who voluntarily requested to enlist and were determined to kill the enemy, often exceeded the quota. There were no instances of counties failing to meet their conscription targets. This certainly indicates the efforts of propaganda and office personnel, and the heightened awareness of the people is commendable. Any malfeasance discovered among the personnel involved was immediately punished to ensure that evil was completely eradicated. Training the people is the basic work for mobilizing the people to resist Japan and implementing all-out resistance. In the past year, with community training and mass education as the center, the majority of the people in the province, regardless of gender or age, have received new instruction and are making rapid progress in both large cities and remote villages. I have personally witnessed white-haired elderly men and women in their sixties and seventy, along with three-foot-tall children, happily attending classes together. We hope that this basic work will enable the elderly, weak, women, children, and able-bodied men to be transformed into strong collective organizations to participate in combat. In terms of developing the national economy, the prerequisite is to complete internal line transportation. Currently, the main east-west and north-south highway lines in the province have been mostly renovated. This year, it is planned to continue building three lines, including [omitted place names], and to implement joint transportation with neighboring provinces to facilitate the transportation of special products from this province, develop inter-provincial trade, and do our utmost to develop export trade, implementing an active trade policy. In terms of finance, policies of adding taxes and heavy taxation are rejected; only existing taxes will be reorganized. Other tasks, such as completing land administration surveys and water conservancy surveys, and then expanding cultivated land, developing water conservancy, and waterways, will also be simultaneously advanced and developed in parallel. Recently, several new tasks have been determined: improving the people's livelihood, without favoring cities or the upper echelons of the population, but focusing on the universal improvement of the grassroots population, with an eye toward improving the lives of the vast number of farmers and workers; specific plans can be announced; establishing a provincial research institute to enable specialized personnel in various departments to continue academic and technical research and improvement to meet practical needs; promoting national physical education, as the weak physique of the people of Fujian is a manifestation of national decline; this year, national physical education movements will be expanded, and a physical education class will be established first to train new talents and send them to work in various counties; establishing a publishing house dedicated to compiling and printing wartime reading materials, with the aim of strengthening the will to resist Japan, and focusing on the translation of foreign languages to improve knowledge and cultural standards; these are all work goals that must be achieved this year. Chen concluded by discussing the situation of the War of Resistance, saying, "Although we have experienced the most dangerous storms in the process of the War of Resistance in recent months, thanks to the great leadership of the leader and the government, and the strong will to fight of the soldiers and people of the whole country, we have now seen the light at the end of the tunnel. On this day next year, we will be able to celebrate the great victory and success together." (Telegraph, 5th)

### Military, Political, and Diplomatic Developments Before the Launch of the Second Phase of the War; Chiang Determines to Complete the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Within Five Years; Relations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Are Increasingly Harmonious

Chongqing Dispatch Chairman Chiang believes that the Chinese War of Resistance, from the Lugouqiao Incident to the fall of Guangzhou and the abandonment of Wuhan, was the first phase of the war. Now, it has entered the second phase. Although the battles on all fronts have become quieter, in reality, both China and Japan are engaged in replenishment and preparation, transferring troops and generals. The second phase of the war is about to begin. At this critical juncture, the situation of all parties is recorded as follows:

Current Situation

Recently, the situation of the Sino-Japanese war has converged from all fronts into two major centers: South China and the Northwest. In South China, the Japanese army occupies Guangzhou, cutting off transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong to sever China's foreign aid. They are also attempting to invade Guangxi along the West River and to land at Beihai, heading straight for Nanning and Longzhou to seize Zhennanguan and further cut off China's international transportation to achieve their blockade objectives. In total, the Japanese army now has a strength of 240,000 troops in South China, but the Japanese claim it to be 300,000 troops. However, due to strategic considerations, the Japanese army is eager to engage in a major decisive battle with the Chinese army in South China to avoid being encircled. Recently, Japanese Commander Ando in South China issued a challenge to Chairman Chiang via radio, but the Chinese army was unmoved and continues to stick to its original strategy, steadily advancing on all fronts, avoiding direct conflict with the Japanese army, and gradually pressing forward, aiming to annihilate them in one fell swoop and prolong the war to wear out the Japanese army. However, a major battle in South China will be inevitable in the short term, and the Japanese army will be driven out of Guangdong and Guangxi. In the Northwest, the original Japanese plan was to take advantage of the severe winter and the freezing of the Yellow River to launch a large-scale invasion, attack Xi'an, reach Lanzhou, and cut off the international route between China and the Soviet Union. In total, the Japanese army concentrated 160,000 troops at various strongholds in the Northwest. However, before launching a large-scale attack on the Northwest, the Japanese army must first clear out the guerrillas in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi to avoid being threatened and endangering their retreat route. As a result, five divisions were besieged by guerrillas in Shanxi, nearly losing their military effectiveness and facing the risk of being annihilated by the Chinese army. Currently, although the Yellow River has frozen, the Japanese army does not dare to rashly invade the Northwest due to various reasons. In Central China, the Japanese army is facing difficulties in advancing, and their troops are being moved frequently. The Chinese army is actively working to recover Wuhan.

Military Deployment

After Chairman Chiang convened a military conference in Hengshan, he made new decisions on the overall strategy in Chongqing. To facilitate the issuance of orders, the Military Affairs Commission was moved to Chongqing to coordinate the military affairs of the South China and Northwest war zones. A Southwest Headquarters was established in Guilin, with Bai Chongxi appointed as its director, responsible for all military affairs in South China. In the Northwest, a Northwest Headquarters was newly established in Xi'an, with Zhu Shaoliang and Jiang Dingwen in charge of all military affairs in the Northwest. Chen Jicheng, the Superintendent of the Central Military Academy, was appointed as the Director of the National New Soldier Training Office to train 1.2 million new soldiers in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces to replenish various armies and recover lost territories. According to the new strategy, it was decided that one-third of the national forces would penetrate deep behind enemy lines, one-third would defend key points on the front lines, and the remaining one-third would be withdrawn for training to prepare new elite forces for future decisive battles. At the same time, two war zones were established behind Japanese lines: one for guerrilla warfare and one for mobile warfare, both of which could inflict significant blows on the Japanese army. Efforts were also strengthened in various tasks behind Japanese lines. A special agency was established by the Military Affairs Commission, concentrating the forces of the party, government, and military to jointly counter the Japanese army's political offensive and to destroy all traitors and puppet organizations. Chairman Chiang personally drafted the main points of the second phase of the War of Resistance: "Politics is more important than military affairs," "The rear is more important than the front," and "The people are more important than soldiers." Chiang also said that revolutionary warfare must go through a long period to be completed, which is ten times more important than the revolutionary era. Even if it takes ten years, it will not be too long. However, to implement the planned plan, it is now limited to completing the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation within five years.

Political Situation

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all bad systems in China's political situation have gradually improved, and due to the urgent demands of the people of the whole country and the trend of the world, it is moving towards the road of democracy day by day. The unanimous cooperation of all parties and factions in the country and the convocation of the National Political Council have all achieved good results. Now, the provincial, municipal, and county councils are also being organized one after another. In the future, the determination of China's national policy and the implementation of important political affairs will be decided by the people of the whole country to promote the power of the people to meet the needs of the present time. However, there have been recent rumors of a reorganization of the central political situation to strengthen organizational structure and enhance administrative efficiency. There are reports that the current Premier and Minister of Finance will step down. However, since the success of loans from Britain and the United States, and the diplomatic relations have been getting better day by day, the fate of Premier Kong's administration has been extended again. And through the proposals of Chairman Chiang and others, the central political situation will temporarily maintain the status quo without reorganization, so as to avoid changes and differences. At the same time, the Fifth Plenary Session, which Wang Jingwei fully advocated to convene, was also declared bankrupt due to the obstruction of Chiang Kai-shek and Kong Xiangxi. Thus, Wang became passive and took the initiative to go abroad. However, Wang's actions have no impact on the central political situation. The original national policy and the consistent plan for resisting Japan and building the country will not be changed at all due to Wang's departure.

Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become more harmonious and progressive after Chairman Chiang and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, met and talked several times. The Communist Party decided to abide by the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, unanimously supporting the Kuomintang Central Committee, supporting the National Government, believing in the Three Principles of the People, and supporting Chairman Chiang. The entire Communist Party unanimously accepted Chairman Chiang's guidance and orders. Regarding the Three Principles of the People Youth League under the leadership of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party also expressed its willingness to join, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party submitted the list to the Kuomintang. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and others are negotiating that the 8th Route Army Zhu De and Peng Dehuai troops are completely subordinate to the Military Affairs Commission and must not act alone. As for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region administration under the Communist Party's jurisdiction, the Communist Party will hand it over to the central government, abolish the Border Region government, unify the consistent ideology of all Chinese people, and Chairman Chiang will discuss with the Communist Party the temporary abolition of the propaganda of Marxism. According to the current situation, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have become as inseparable as milk and water, and no estrangement has occurred.

The Chinese government's diplomatic path has been quite diversified in the past, with no clear purpose. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the effects of foreign aid have been minimal. After extreme adjustments and major changes, we have made every effort to strengthen friendship and good neighborliness with all countries in the world except Japan. With the success of British and American loans and the announcement that the Sino-American Silver Agreement will remain in effect, China's diplomacy has changed from a slow trot to a sharp turn. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now planning to take further steps to use diplomatic means to obtain joint collective assistance from friendly countries to China. At the same time, the external world is making the greatest efforts to adjust relations with various countries.

### New Fourth Route Army Focuses on Tactical Training of Soldiers; Soldiers Are Not Recruited, but Enlist Voluntarily

A dispatch from the New Fourth Route Army Headquarters south of Wuhu by Belden, a special correspondent for the English-language *Ta Mei Wan Pao*, states that if a farmer, tired of farming life and admiring the name of the New Fourth Route Army, wants to enlist without a letter of introduction or guarantee, the New Fourth Route Army may not accept him. There are several reasons for this. Because the government has ordered certain troops to replenish in certain areas, if a farmer who is supposed to replenish another troop wants to enlist in the New Fourth Route Army, he will be told to enlist in the recruiting army in that area. If the New Fourth Route Army recruits people from other areas, and the government finds out, they will still be sent back. The New Fourth Route Army's recruiters must have a solid person's guarantee and be investigated; they do not accept everyone. As for soldiers in other troops who want to enlist in the New Fourth Route Army, the troops will politely talk to them and send them back to their original troops. However, if farmers in the New Fourth Route Army's combat zone are moved by patriotic indignation and resolutely enlist, with the guarantee of a solid person, the army will record their name, age, background, etc., and test whether they are suitable for the hard life of a soldier. They will also ask about their purpose for enlisting. If they say they are tired of farming and want to enlist to earn merit and money, the army will not accept them. If they say they want to fight the Japanese army to save the country and protect their families, they can immediately become a member of the army. If there is a uniform, they will be given a uniform. If not, they will wear plain clothes. They will then be given training in standing at attention, etc., for as little as two days or as long as two weeks before being sent to the front lines. Only then will they be given firearms and taught how to load bullets and shoot. Some may receive two days of training, or they may learn how to fire a gun in the afternoon and go into battle that night. When they are not fighting on the front lines during the day, they are constantly drilled by officers or experienced soldiers. Bayonets and hand grenades are the main weapons of the New Fourth Route Army. Teaching them how to throw hand grenades is faster than using bayonets. To ensure the accuracy of soldiers' shooting, target practice is held two or three times a week. Soldiers are careful, but because bullets are not easy to obtain, live ammunition shooting is only two or three rounds per month. The New Fourth Route Army focuses on night combat training because they often attack at night. Their cadres must study guerrilla warfare knowledge and train junior officers to command independently and fight independently. Because the educational standards of the soldiers are low, their tactical training focuses on practice. The most peculiar thing is that the training school is affiliated with the General Headquarters, which is probably not found in the Eighth Route Army. The school is not several miles from the front lines and currently has 840 people, divided into nine classes. One class is for 70 women, another class is for 40 children, and the rest are soldiers. After three months of training at the school, they return to the front lines for alternating training. Of the nine classes, two classes are for political training, one class trains army mechanics, and there are one class each for women and children. The rest strictly train combatants. Each class climbs a mountain at least once a week. If they cannot climb a mountain, they cannot be guerrillas. There are also machine gun squads in the army, but although they practice shooting, they do not use live ammunition due to insufficient bullets. Women are taught nursing and hygiene knowledge and are taught to read and write. Most of them are soldiers' wives, and some are former factory workers. The New Fourth Route Army does not recruit; they are all volunteers.

### Glimpses of the Guangdong-Guangxi Road After the Fall of Guangzhou (3) Japanese Troops Invade Various Cities and Towns Along the West River Guangxi Army Moves East to Strengthen Defense Lines

On the 24th, this reporter left Guanshan again to the west, taking the route through Taiping, Sanzou, and other market towns to enter Gaoming. This place is farther from Guangzhou and is located on the West River. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, they have not yet had time to advance here, so everything seen along the way is very peaceful. However, refugees fleeing this way have numbered several hundred each day since the 20th, either in groups of three or five, or in clusters of hundreds. Those who take this route mostly scatter back to their hometowns, or take the Yaoming Highway bus to Zhaoqing, going upstream along the West River and turning into Guangxi Province. Because this route is westward and not a transportation hub, it can avoid Japanese aircraft pursuing them. When this reporter arrived in Gaoming, I heard that Chencun was invaded on the morning of the 24th by more than a hundred Japanese soldiers from Weiyong and Lezhu, who clashed with the local self-defense corps. Chencun Old Market was the first to be breached by the Japanese army, burning more than a hundred shops and residences. They then proceeded to occupy the New Market and Bijiang. Unscrupulous elements lurking in both the New and Old Markets took the opportunity to loot, causing losses of more than two or three million yuan throughout the market. Two salt boats on the river were intercepted and looted, and more than two hundred civilians died. On the same day, Daliang (Shunde County seat) also fell. On the 26th, Xinan Market (belonging to Sanshui) was also engulfed in a large fire, which burned for a whole day and night without being extinguished. It is said that after the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, they dispatched planes to Foshan, Daliang, Xinan, Sanshui, Qingyuan, and the surrounding areas for several consecutive days from the 23rd to the 25th, bombing non-stop all day long. The army then advanced along the Guangsan Road towards Foshan, Xinan, and Sanshui, while simultaneously using small motorboats to transport Japanese troops to attack Foshan and Xinan. According to merchants who fled from Foshan back to Gaoming, on the 25th, the Japanese army entered Foshan. The battalion of security forces stationed there had already withdrawn towards Sanshui and Sihui. Therefore, when the Japanese army arrived, only the self-defense corps put up a slight resistance before retreating into the countryside without any fierce contact. However, due to days of bombing by airplanes, many of the shops and residences near the train station, as well as various match factories, were destroyed, with hundreds of them ruined. On the morning of the 26th, several hundred Japanese soldiers advanced to attack Xinan Market. That night, a large fire and looting broke out, and more than 80% of the shops in the entire market were burned down. Qingyuan County town was bombed by more than twenty Japanese planes on the 23rd, and incendiary bombs were dropped. The fire burned from 10 am to 11 pm, destroying three to four hundred shops, and the entire city was almost reduced to scorched earth. With the fall of Xinan, the Japanese army extended to the Sankou River in Sanshui, completely occupying the Guangsan Railway.

On the 29th, this reporter detoured from Gaoming to Baitu Market, and then from Baitu Market to Zhaoqing. At that time, Sanshui and Hekou were already under the control of the Japanese army, and water traffic below Zhaoqing was completely cut off. It was heard that the Japanese army occupying Sanshui had been dispatching teams to break into the countryside for days, forcibly conscripting civilian laborers to build fortifications, extremely busy, apparently to defend the area against the counterattack of our West River forces. Later, around November 5th and 6th, this reporter received an express letter in Wuzhou from Hekou, stating that the Japanese army had redeployed more than twenty shallow-water warships from Guangzhou to Hekou to reinforce defenses. At the same time, several hundred soldiers occupied Makou and Jinli Market (belonging to Gaoyao) opposite Makou. A pontoon bridge was built from Makou to connect Jinli, connecting the north and south banks and cutting off and occupying the West River. Since the Japanese army stationed heavy troops here, the various rural markets, mindful of the horrors of bombing and burning, mostly moved out with all their belongings and cleared the fields, as a passive form of resistance. The Japanese army needed a large amount of food every day, but had no supplies, so they sent troops in separate groups to loot grain from villages in Jinli, Dongbao, and Lucun. Due to family relationships, the self-defense corps of various villages once united to resist, fighting fiercely for a day. As a result, Maibian Village, Lucun, and other places in Jinli Market were set on fire by the Japanese army. Currently, the Japanese army still occupies Jinli and Makou on both banks, and dozens of watercraft, rubber dinghies, armed shallow-water motorboats, and small warships are moored on the Makou River to prevent the Chinese army from coming down from Zhaoqing. They also send planes to bomb Guangning, Sihui, Xinxing, and other counties upstream along the West River every day.

According to a friend who fled from Zhaoqing to Wuzhou, on November 23, nine Japanese planes flew to Zhaoqing city and Baitu Market (more than twenty li from Zhaoqing city) and dropped bombs. It is estimated that more than twenty bombs, including several incendiary bombs, were dropped on the riverbank of the South Gate of Zhaoqing, destroying one Suichang tugboat, one Shengxin tugboat, one Portuguese oil barge, and two cargo ships, killing and wounding more than ten boatmen. On the Baitu Market side, more than ten bombs were dropped, killing thirty-four men and injuring twenty, killing twenty-four women and injuring thirteen, destroying one rice shop and collapsing five houses. That day happened to be the market day in Baitu, and many villagers gathered to attend the market, so the deaths were so tragic. On November 25, the Chinese army stationed in Zhaoqing detoured to attack the Japanese army in Jinli. On the 26th, they repelled the Japanese army and destroyed a Japanese pontoon bridge. The Japanese army in Jinli then retreated to Makou, confronting the Chinese army across the river.

A few days before this reporter arrived in Zhaoqing, the joint supervision office of the military and police stationed in Zhaoqing ordered the evacuation of the old, weak, women, and children back to their hometowns. Most shops stopped operating and entered a state of war. The remaining troops were all sent to strategic locations in the Xiaxia area of Zhaoqing to set up defenses in dangerous locations.

### Dr. Lin Scholarship Recipients Intern To Study Abroad This Summer

Last year was the 70th birthday of Dr. Lin Sen. The Central Standing Committee resolved to send a commemorative scholarship fund of 200,000 yuan, and decided that two-fifths of the interest would be used to fund students to study abroad, and three-fifths would be used to reward outstanding high school graduates in the national joint examination. The scholarship procedures were handled by the Ministry of Education. The first scholarship for studying abroad was held by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing from November 1st to 3rd last year, selecting one student to study military chemistry in the United States. It is now known that a total of sixteen people registered for the exam. One person failed the physical examination, and one person did not make it to Chongqing in time for the exam. A total of fourteen people actually took the exam. All students were outstanding graduates of chemistry departments from domestic universities and had served or continued their research for more than two years after graduation. The examination results have been evaluated by the Examination Committee and reviewed by the Ministry of Education, and it has been decided to admit Han Jibang, who has the best results. Han is from Haining, Zhejiang, and graduated from the Chemistry Department of National Tsing Hua University in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. He served as a technician at the Aviation Committee Oil Research Institute and an inspector of physics and chemistry books and instruments at the Chung Hwa Book Company. He is currently a technician at the Central Industrial Experiment Institute. After this decision was made, he visited Dr. Lin Sen in early December of last month for instructions. Dr. Lin Sen gave many instructions. It is heard that Han needs to intern in China for six months before going abroad this summer.

### Tongji Moves to Dali on Foot More Than a Thousand Teachers and Students Make a Long Trek

National Tongji University was originally located in the north of Wusong Town and was known for its medical, engineering, and science departments. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the school buildings have been destroyed and suffered heavy losses. More than a thousand teachers and students in the school successively moved to Jinhua to start classes. In February, when Hangzhou fell, they moved to Ganzhou, Jiangxi. This academic year, according to the order of the Ministry of Education, the school moved to Babu, Guangxi. The teachers and students walked along the highway to Babu and started classes on December 1st. Unfortunately, Babu was bombed, and the area was close to the West River. The Ministry of Education ordered the school to move to Dali, Yunnan, as a permanent location. After receiving the order, the school began to walk. They were divided into forty large teams, stipulating that they would travel seventy kilometers per day. They were expected to reach their destination in March. It is heard that they have arrived in Bose, Guangxi, and are in high spirits. They will be able to start classes in Dali in two months. Some medical students from the Shanghai school who want to go to Dali must first contact the Kunming office to obtain passports and certificates.

Nanjing Middle School Jiangsu Nanjing Middle School has a long history. Since the August 13th Anti-Japanese War last year, the Jiangyin campus, all the school buildings, classrooms, and instruments operated by Huang Tifang, the founder of more than fifty years, were the original Qing Dynasty Academy of Wang Xianqian. He spent a lot of effort compiling the Huang Qing Jingjie, which originally had more than 8,000 pages of woodblock prints. The Nanjing Series of woodblock prints was completely destroyed in the fire. The two sets of editions have been lost since then. Now the alumni of Nanjing in Shanghai, at the request of the old students of the school, are preparing to reopen the school in Shanghai. They have been preparing for a long time and have submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for approval. They are also looking for a school site. The position of principal must be recommended by the school affairs committee and then submitted to the Education Department for appointment. All old students must first register. The registration office is located in the Fudan Alumni Association, Room 309, 3rd Floor, Pudong Building.

Zhengfeng College of Arts Since Mr. Jiang Weiqiao took over as the president of the Zhengfeng College of Arts, the college affairs have been thriving.

School Profile

### Nanyang Girls' Middle School

Private Nanyang Girls' Middle School was founded in the first year of the Republic of China, originally named Nanyang Girls' Normal School. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was ordered to change its name to its current name. The principal was Ling Mingzhi. At that time, the school building was in Sanduoli outside the West Gate, and then moved to Arabias Road. The August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out. Because the school site was in the northern district, it could not start school, and Principal Ling also died of illness. Therefore, the board of directors appointed Ms. Yang Ruo'an to take over, and temporarily borrowed Weifeng Elementary School on Datong Road to start school. In February of the twenty-seventh year, it was moved to No. 124 Kaifeng Road, renovated the school buildings, expanded the grades, and gradually restored its former appearance.

Shanghai Special Edition

### Shanghai's Food Supply

— Feng Liutang

Shanghai is originally a land of cotton and rice. It is surrounded by vast rice-producing areas, so there is no concern about the people's food supply. During the Kangxi era, there was a great harvest, and grain prices fell sharply, insufficient to pay the silver tribute. People fled and abandoned their land deeds, with no one willing to pick them up, which was called "harvest ruin." This has two meanings: first, it shows that the customs of the time were simple and honest, the people's food supply was abundant, and they feared the law and officials. Unable to pay the tribute, they resorted to abandoning their land. Second, it shows that foreign powers invaded China, imposing exorbitant taxes and ignoring the people's livelihood. At that time, Qin Songling from Wuxi, an official in the Hanlin Academy, mistakenly reported that his clan's widowed aunt owed three-tenths of the tribute, causing the local officials to impeach him, leading to his dismissal. Ye Fangai, the second-place scholar from Kunshan, owed only a tiny amount, worth only a fraction of a cent, and was also stripped of his position. Hence, there was a saying, "The second-place scholar is not worth a cent." This reflects the cruelty of the exploitation, making people abandon their land and flee.

Since Shanghai became a treaty port, people from all over gathered, losing its original local character. The population gradually increased to more than three million today, and the food supply also expanded accordingly. Since the Republic of China, Shanghai's rice prices have been high because the Japanese transported rice for export in the eighth and ninth years, emptying the reserves everywhere. In addition, rice was plagued by pests and natural disasters. The peak of high rice prices was seen in the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the Republic of China. However, although Shanghai's population is dense and its food demand has increased, there is still no concern about supply, because it is a distribution area for rice production in the Yangtze River region.

The increase in Shanghai's population is related to the political stability of China, not just the convenience of trade. During the Taiping Rebellion, many people from the interior took refuge in Shanghai. The same was true in the year of the revolution. Subsequently, Shanghai's population inevitably increased after each civil war. Only during the January 28th Incident did people move in the opposite direction to the interior. When the August 13th Shanghai battle began last year, the population also moved to the interior to avoid the war. In the spring of last year (the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China), the population of the interior gathered again in Shanghai, creating the current situation of high rents. As for the food supply, during years of high prices, local officials and merchants often managed rice sales at a stable price to benefit the ordinary people. When the war first started the year before last, there was a rice-grabbing frenzy, but it quickly subsided because rice transportation from the north and south remained normal. By the end of November, when our troops withdrew from Shanghai and the war zone shifted westward, the rice-producing areas gradually fell, and the supply was cut off. People became more anxious and considered stockpiling grain to be a wise move. The rice stores were emptied, and even those with stock did not dare to sell it, fearing it would be snatched away. As a result, the poor suffered greatly, and some ran around all day without being able to obtain even a small amount of rice. At that time, there were still more than 20,000 stones of river rice in Nanshi, which could have met the temporary need. However, due to obstructions and extortion, it could not be transported into the concession and was eventually seized by the Japanese army, and the rest was looted. Later, the Public Concession and other organizations came forward to purchase foreign rice, limit the amount of rice purchased, and sell it in various locations. People crowded together, standing in long queues, shoulder to shoulder, and back to back. A little carelessness could lead to being whipped, but compared to being exposed to the elements, the difference between suffering and joy was like heaven and earth. Since last year, farmers in the interior have been selling their rice in large quantities; in addition, much of the autumn harvest from the year before last was not transported to Shanghai because of the war. Shanghai, unable to obtain supplies from the interior, begged for foreign rice. Therefore, the reduced consumption may have offset the losses from the war and even more. Therefore, rice prices were calm last year. When the new rice came onto the market last winter, the rice industry wanted to re-export the rice due to falling prices, but it was under the control of the Public Concession, and the restricted and regulated re-export was not realized. However, the rice from the interior was packed up and shipped to Hongkou for export by transshipment, and there was nothing that could be done.

If the food supply is properly managed this year, there should be no serious problem in Shanghai. However, the hidden worries are already emerging. If things continue to develop, we cannot be too optimistic. However, this problem should be addressed based on future developments, and there is no need to worry too much now.

Shanghai's food supply is not lacking, which is related to its geographical location and also to commercial considerations. (1) Shanghai has a large population with many consumers, so grain is easily unloaded upon arrival without fear of stagnation. (2) After the rice is sold, the payment can be settled quickly and returned, with no outstanding debts. (3) Rice that is not easily sold can also be stored in warehouses. (4) Regardless of the quality of the rice, there are diverse tastes and no fear of not finding a market. (5) Merchants from various regions also concentrate in Shanghai, and rice that cannot be sold locally can be sold in other ports. (6) The exchange of funds is convenient. If merchants want to purchase other goods and transport them back to their hometowns, Shanghai is also convenient. Due to these characteristics, not only rice from Sujia Song Chang Xicheng is transported to Shanghai, but also indica rice from Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi is often transshipped through Shanghai. Even if local rice is scarce, foreign rice can be purchased. With a telegram to the port, the rice can arrive in Shanghai within ten days. Shanghai also has the most flour mills. During the panic of the winter before last, fortunately, flour was available, which alleviated the situation. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Therefore, Shanghai's food supply is responsive and sufficient, but there is concern about high prices.

However, there is room for research and improvement in the organization and incomplete equipment of Shanghai's rice industry. In his early years, Mr. Ye Huijun was in Japan and often discussed Shanghai's food affairs with me. I mentioned the plan for a large Shanghai rice market. He believed that Shanghai's rice market has this atmosphere entirely due to its geographical location, not due to the perfection of the rice industry's organization. In the future, with the advancement of various industries and the expansion of division of labor, the Shanghai rice industry should have specialized facilities for warehousing, docks, transportation, unloading, milling, and drying, and then gather rice from the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake regions in Shanghai to distribute and regulate it, which will solve Shanghai's food supply problem. However, as the trend goes, the rice that Guangdong wants to purchase will likely not be transshipped through Shanghai. The needs of Fujian and Zhejiang may still be dominated by the Shanghai rice market, but with the expansion of transportation facilities, Shanghai's rice industry will eventually lose its position as a rice distribution center. This is a crisis for the rice industry and a concern for Shanghai's food supply.

### The Association for Resistance and National Reconstruction Supports the Central Government's Decision to Punish Wang Jingwei, Military and Political Circles in the East War Zone Issue a Declaration Under the Association's Organization

Patriots engaged in political and military work in the guerrilla areas of the Eastern War Zone have united under the organization of the Chinese Association for Resistance and National Reconstruction. When Jingwei telegraphed advocating surrender and peace, the association immediately petitioned the central government to punish him. Now, the association has issued a declaration, vowing to support the central government's decision. The original text reads: "This association leads patriotic heroes from all over the Southeast to fight against the enemy continuously, advancing wave upon wave, with sacrifices every day. Our sole purpose is to seek the final victory of the war of resistance, to drive out the ugly captives, and to restore the brilliant territory created by our ancestors. This association hereby informs the people of the country that we support the central government's decision on the punishment. But we still believe that the punishment is not enough to cover his guilt. This association firmly opposes all attempts and speeches that compromise with the enemy and vows to never coexist with national traitors. We hope that our patriotic compatriots will unite to condemn them, so that justice prevails and evil spirits hide, promoting national character and completing the mission of resisting the war and building the nation. As long as one member of this association remains, this will will not waver. We are willing to encourage each other with the people of the country."

### Fierce Battles in the Three Counties of Xichangcheng, Many Japanese Troops Annihilated, Gu Shan Anzhen North [?] Country

After the Chinese army in the guerrilla areas of Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Changshu counties were unified under the central command, their strength has become increasingly great. According to merchants from Xilaihu yesterday, the Chinese armies in the counties have established contact and decided to begin coordinated action after planning. Fierce battles have broken out in Gu Shan in Changshu County, Anzhen in Wuxi County, and Bei [?] in Jiangyin County. The Japanese troops originally stationed in these towns and cities have suffered heavy casualties and losses of equipment and ammunition after being heavily besieged and attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in each county and city have imposed a curfew early and dare not go out due to insufficient troop strength. In addition, Zhao et al. in Hupu, who were reorganized by the Japanese side as puppet police and security teams of 400-500 men, were also severely suppressed by Xiong Jiandong's troops. Most of the puppet police refused to recognize the thief as their father. They were taken advantage of by traitors and defected with their weapons.

The British inland gunboats currently docked in this port also include the new flagship Scorpion and the Beetle, which is under repair. Furthermore, the US Navy transport ship Henderson passed Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning and docked in this port around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, carrying the replacement troops for the US Asian Fleet and the Fourth Marine Regiment.

### The National Government Approves the Weili Han Company to Sail the Shanghai Wenzhou Yong Line, Approved by the American Chamber of Commerce in this City, Shipping is to Commence Within Ten Days

According to the Continental News, in order to facilitate commerce between Shanghai and the ports of Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, the Chongqing Central Government yesterday (5th) issued a license to the American Weili Han Shipping Company to operate four ships between Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Yong. According to Fei Xiaosheng, the owner of the company, last night, the company will dispatch ships to operate between the two ports within ten days. Chartered ships will be dispatched first in order to make use of the licenses as soon as possible. The office of the Weili Han Shipping Company received the license, which bore the words "East Coast Trade License," yesterday evening. The American Chamber of Commerce in this city sent a telegram to the Central Government last week, emphasizing the need for American merchants to occupy a seat in the shipping industry. The Central Government immediately issued the shipping license.

### The Township Associations Fund Raising Committee Will Be Established Today, Invite All to Participate, Launch Piggy Bank Movement

In order to concentrate the strength of the local associations and assist the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in soliciting donations, the various Shanghai township associations have resolved to jointly organize a Township Fundraising Committee. After Cao Zhigong and others were designated to carry out the preparations, the committee has scheduled a founding meeting for 3:00 PM today at the Bank Association at 59 Hong Kong Road. Representatives from the various Shanghai township associations will attend, and Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the association, will also attend to guide the event. The details are as follows:

List of officials for the meeting:
Presidium: Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunqing, Xu Xiaochu, Lu Wenshao, Cao Zhigong
Master of Ceremonies: Zhang Yizhai
Secretaries: Hu Shouqi, Chen Weifan, Lin Daji
Recorders: Zhu Chaoran, Yu Yaoqiu
Reception: Chen Peide, Tang Chongshi, Dong Xinqin, Wang Jingdong, Ge Futian, Liu Zhongying, Hu Xiru, Wu Mingxin, etc.

Invitation to participate in the committee: The preparatory committee sent letters to all Shanghai township associations yesterday, inviting them to participate. The original letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern, In order to assist the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in soliciting donations, the 15th resolution of the dinner meeting on December 29, 1938, decided to organize a Township Fundraising Committee. Zhigong and others were designated as preparatory committee members. It has been decided through the preparatory meeting to hold a founding meeting at 3:00 PM on January 7, 1939, on the 5th floor of the Bank Association at 59 Hong Kong Road. In addition to inviting the leaders of the Refugee Relief Association to attend and guide the event, we hereby specially invite your association to designate one to three representatives to attend on time to assist in this good cause. Your attendance is greatly appreciated. The committee believes that the addresses of the township associations may have changed, and there may be omissions. We sincerely hope that you will see this notice in the newspaper, prepare an official letter, and send representatives to participate."

Piggy bank movement: Cao Zhigong, a standing committee member of the Weining Township Association, proposed to the conference to promote a piggy bank rescue movement, which would arouse the rescue interests of families and women and children, and develop a habit of thrift. The first step is to start with the members of the various township associations themselves, and then gradually extend to others. Assuming that the total number of members of each township association is 100,000, and each family uses a piggy bank, saving an average of one yuan per month, then the monthly reveal will be 100,000 yuan. If it is promoted to every family in the city, then hundreds of thousands of donations can be raised every month. The measures are listed below: (1) This piggy bank is named the Rescue Piggy Bank and will be manufactured by the Township Group Committee. The various township associations will receive them from the committee without charge. (2) After the various township associations receive them, they will distribute them to their members. (3) When distributing or receiving them, an application form will be attached. If the application is made by a township association, three copies must be filled out, one for the applicant, one to be kept by the issuing organization, and one to be kept by this association. If the application is made directly to this association, only two copies need to be filled out. (4) It is tentatively scheduled to be revealed once a month. (5) If the applicant does not have time to send it, or this association will find a way to send someone to collect it. (6) Each time it is revealed, there will be a reward for the applicant who donates the most money. (7) To make use of waste materials, all piggy banks will be made from 50 empty cigarette cans. This association will find a way to collect these cigarette cans or collect them at a price. (8) Cover the original cigarette can with a narrow opening as a storage place. All sides of the can and lid are sealed with the seal already printed by this association. (9) Various advertisements are attached to the seal, and advertising subsidies are collected as appropriate.

### The Ministry of Judicial Administration Announces the Method of Circuit Court Trials in War Zones, Circuit Court Judges Can Register with the Court to Facilitate Appeals in War Zones

The Ministry of Judicial Administration, considering that appeals are especially inconvenient for the public due to traffic obstructions in various war zones, has promulgated the Method of Circuit Court Trials in War Zones to benefit the people. The details are as follows:

Notice from the Ministry of Judicial Administration

Notice from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Pu Zi No. 4: Regarding the notice, due to traffic obstructions in the various war zones, civil and criminal lawsuits are particularly inconvenient to conduct, and appeals to the second instance are especially difficult. The Ministry has drafted the "Method of Circuit Court Trials in War Zones" to provide relief and has submitted it to the Judicial Yuan for promulgation and implementation. Regarding the selection of judges for circuit court trials, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 2, and Article 16 of the method, they should be filled by those who have the qualifications of judges stipulated in the Court Organization Law and have experience in trying civil and criminal lawsuits. Those who meet the above qualifications and are willing to take on this position may submit a detailed resume, stating their aspirations, service area, and current mailing address, to the local court where the Ministry is located before January 31, 1939, to apply for registration, so that they can be assigned as needed. In addition to separate orders, this notice is issued.

Method of Circuit Court Trials in War Zones

(Promulgated on December 15, 1938) Article 1: In order to facilitate litigants in the war zone, the High Court or Branch Court may send judges to conduct circuit court trials of civil and criminal lawsuits under its jurisdiction. Article 2: Circuit court trials shall be conducted by one or three judges. The judges in the preceding paragraph shall be filled by those who have the qualifications of High Court judges stipulated in the Court Organization Law and have experience in trying civil and criminal lawsuits. Article 3: The area of circuit court trials shall be determined by the relevant High Court or Branch Court, taking into account the circumstances. Article 4: The duration of circuit court trials should be determined by the relevant High Court or Branch Court, taking into account the actual situation, and should be announced in the circuit area in advance.

Article 8: Even if the litigants in civil and criminal lawsuits have not purchased the necessary documents, the circuit court trial judge should accept them. Court fees shall also be waived for civil lawsuits. Article 9: Cases that should be sent for review may be sent directly to the circuit court for review by the original trial organ.

### Commander Guo Telegraphed that Dinghai is Safe

The shipping line between Ningbo and Dinghai has resumed. Since the Xu Department guerrilla team withdrew to Hengliang, the situation has eased, and order in the county has been restored. It is understood that the Xu Department guerrilla team has taken its weapons to Hengliang. Hengliang is a small coastal town in the southeast of Dinghai County, about fifty miles from the city. The team will accept reorganization to maintain order. The water police who died and were injured have been coffined and treated. The county government will also provide generous compensation and provide all post-mortem care. Officials from the Ningbo Defense Department have been sent to Dinghai to investigate. The radio station has been repaired. The Dinghai Township Association sent a telegram to County Magistrate Lin to inquire about the details. Yesterday, they also received a telegram from Guo Chiping, Commander of the Defense of Ningbo: "The telegram from the Dinghai Township Association in Shanghai has been received. There was a slight misunderstanding between the military and police, which has been resolved and order is normal. Please do not worry. Respectfully, Guo Chiping." It is also learned that the Tianbaoli and Baoli ships on the Ningbo-Dinghai line have resumed sailing. The Meda ship opened Haimen from Ningbo yesterday and returned to Dinghai on the way to Taiwan. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Dinghai were picked up by the ship, so sailing has resumed.

### Generous Donors – Requesting Awards – Huacheng Tobacco Company Donates the Most to Refugee Relief

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group Solicitation Committee decided to broadcast special programs on various radio stations, featuring Peking Opera, Pinghua storytelling, Tanci ballad singing, Shanghai Opera, comedy, famous actresses, amateur performers, Suzhou Tanhuang Opera, and stories, rotating daily to solicit donations. The results have been excellent. The largest donor of funds for refugee relief is the Huacheng Tobacco Company, which committed to providing for 600 refugees monthly, donating 1,200 yuan per month for six months, totaling 7,200 yuan. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has not only sent a letter of thanks but will also submit this generous donation and title to the government for commendation.

### Norwegian Merchant Ship – Detained in Qingdao – Crew Handed Over to the Japanese in Dalian – Consulate Has Lodged a Protest

The Yongda, a Panamanian ship belonging to the Norwegian merchant firm Wah Lun & Co., loaded cargo in Shanghai last month and sailed to Fuzhou, then loaded timber in Fuzhou and sailed to Qingdao. It was detained by the Japanese at the end of last month. The firm has reported the incident to the consulate and requested intervention. The crew has been escorted to Dalian. Details are as follows:

Loading Timber and Sailing to Qingdao: The Panamanian ship Yongda, with a gross tonnage of 3,305 tons and a net tonnage of 2,078 tons, was built in 1906 and is managed by the Norwegian merchant firm Wah Lun & Co., located at 93 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, and represented by Taichangxiang Customs Broker. It loaded general merchandise in Shanghai on the 15th of last month and sailed to Fuzhou, then loaded domestically produced timber in Fuzhou and sailed to Qingdao. After arriving in Qingdao at the end of last month, the ship was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy in Qingdao on the 30th of last month.

Suddenly Detained: After the ship was detained by the Japanese Navy in Qingdao, the entire crew of over 40 people, except for the captain and senior officers who were foreign nationals, were Chinese, including stokers, sailors, and tallymen. They have now been escorted to Dalian by the Japanese Navy. The reason for the detention, it is said, is that the Japanese believe the ship is owned by Chinese merchants and is only flying the Panamanian flag. The ship is currently docked in Qingdao, with Japanese troops stationed on board, prohibiting it from sailing anywhere.

Consulate Intervention: After Wah Lun & Co. received news that the Yongda had been detained by the Japanese Navy in Qingdao, they immediately reported it to the Norwegian Consul, who lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities, demanding the prompt release of the ship and crew. It is said that the Japanese have agreed to investigate the ship's nationality. It is also said that the ship is indeed owned by Panamanian merchants and is registered with the Panamanian government, flying the Panamanian flag.

### Four Banks' Loan Amounts – Based on Current Estimates – Approximately 80 Million Yuan

Since the Chung, Chung, Chiao, and Farmers Banks were ordered to establish joint loan committees in various locations, they have been handling mortgages, re-mortgages, discounting, and lending in accordance with the regulations for inland loans promulgated by the ministry, in order to facilitate capital flow and assist agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises that have been severely affected by the war. All locations where the four banks have branches or offices have loan agencies. It is estimated that the current outstanding loan amount is 89 million yuan, but the total amount of past business is several times this figure.

### Farmland of Soldiers' Families – Heads of Villages to Arrange for Substitute Farming

According to a communication from the Ministry of Interior to the Military Affairs Commission, regarding Tan Pingshan's proposals for conscription and requisition of labor, the fourth item states: "For future conscription remedies, if universal conscription is required, the government should clearly stipulate measures for substitute farming by soldiers' relatives and tax exemptions for soldiers, so that those who serve the country have certain preferential rights to show guarantees and encourage them." The commission believes that the reduction of temporary donations for soldiers' families has already been stipulated in the fifth article of the measures for preferential treatment of families of soldiers fighting against the enemy. As for substitute farming by relatives, the Chinese people lack a spirit of mutual assistance. If it is stipulated by a clear government order, there may be practical difficulties. It is proposed to designate the village as a unit, ordering the village head to convene a village meeting to find a way to handle it, which seems easier to implement. The Ministry of Interior has already been notified to follow up. The Ministry of Interior has now informed the provincial governments to comply.

### Fake "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" – Failure to Manipulate the Labor Movement – Hollow Organization Weak and Untrusted by the Japanese, Subsidy Has Been Stopped, Soon to Dissolve Invisibly

In order to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement and expand the power of the people for their own use, the Japanese puppets previously established the "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" through the puppet "Director of Social Affairs," Hu Shouchang, with Japanese national Tamiya Kyujo as the instructor, Korean Lim Ja-hyong as the secretary-general, and recruited some unemployed people, fabricated trade union names, and claimed to exercise the functions of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. It is now known that the fake organization has been unanimously rejected by the original legitimate trade unions in the city, resulting in an extremely hollow internal organization, which is not trusted by the Japanese. As a result, activity funds have been stopped, causing the association's affairs to fall into a state of stagnation. It is expected to dissolve invisibly soon. Details are as follows:

Current Situation of the Labor Movement in Shanghai:

The labor movement in Shanghai has always been unified and led by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. The organization is relatively sound, and its strength is also very strong, making many contributions to the country and society, and especially achieving remarkable results in protecting workers' lives and promoting labor welfare. Since the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the association automatically ceased activities due to environmental factors. Except for those that were suspended due to the war, the remaining trade unions still maintain their original organizations and continue to handle daily affairs or participate in refugee relief work. Although there is no organization of the federation on the surface to lead, the trade unions in various industries still maintain close contact. In order to manipulate the labor movement, the Japanese puppets, seeing that the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions had ceased activities, organized the "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" through the puppet "Director of Social Affairs" Hu Shouchang in October last year, claiming to relieve labor suffering and rescue unemployed workers, hoping to attract trade unions from various industries to participate. However, the heads of various trade unions, with a sense of righteousness, unanimously and sternly refused. The "Association" had no choice but to use money as bait, recruiting some unemployed people, fabricating trade union names, and posing as representatives to join the organization, practicing self-promotion and boasting that it was exercising the functions of the federation. According to sources, the existing trade unions in the "Association," such as the "Cold and Hot Stove Industry Trade Union," "Noodle Making Trade Union," "Vendor Trade Union," "Foreign Affairs Trade Union," "Rattan Ware Trade Union," "Cart and Basket Trade Union," "Pujiang Sailing Ship Trade Union," "Steamboat Stoker Trade Union," "Sailor Trade Union," "Tallyman Trade Union," "Cart Driver Trade Union," "Cargo Trade Union," "Helmsman Trade Union," "Paint Trade Union," "Fan Wood Trade Union," and "Bone Ware Trade Union," have never existed and are purely fabricated. There are no so-called members or masses under them, so the internal organization is extremely hollow and completely a deal of selling short and buying long.

Deceived Workers Withdraw One After Another: At the beginning of its establishment, the association set up an office on the second floor of the Nisshin Company on the Bund. In addition to calling for relief for the unemployed, it also stipulated that "members of the association" could receive inland travel permits free of charge. Many workers who planned to return to their hometowns or go to Pudong and Hongkou went to participate. However, when applying for "travel permits" later, the association suddenly demanded a fee of one yuan. At the same time, it formed the "Fude Society" to attract workers to join, charging an admission fee of three yuan per person. At this point, the general workers realized that they had been fooled and withdrew one after another, making the content of the association even more hollow.

Japanese Dissatisfaction, Subsidy Stopped: The fake organization was originally allocated a huge subsidy by the Japanese, which was handed over to Lim Ja-hyong and others for distribution. Lim, seeing the rare opportunity, filled his own pockets, and the general unemployed people were given meager shares, so they gradually became indifferent and expressed negativity towards the "trade union." As a result, there were no "achievements" at all. The Japanese were very dissatisfied after hearing about it, so they stopped paying the subsidy. It is now known that Lim and others, due to the exhaustion of funds, asked their minions to petition the Japanese. If no results are obtained, they will decide to stop the process. Therefore, it is expected that the fake "Welfare Association" will soon dissolve invisibly, and the Japanese attempt to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement will ultimately fail.

### American Relief Wheat – Arriving in Shanghai Today – The Sarcoxie Has Sailed from Hong Kong

A large amount of American wheat was collected by the American business community and entrusted to the Red Cross for relief in China. It has been loaded onto the American merchant Willys Overland Export Corporation ship Sarcoxie and is being transported to Shanghai, totaling 24,000 bags, weighing 3,360,000 pounds. The ship unloaded 8,000 bags when passing through Hong Kong to provide relief to disaster-stricken refugees in South China. It sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 3rd. According to news from the Willys Overland Export Corporation yesterday, they have received a telegram from the ship stating that it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today.

### Songjiang Is Peaceful

The Songjiang County area, since the fall of the county seat, is still very peaceful in the guerrilla areas in the suburbs. In addition, the harvest year is abundant, so the people's livelihood is very affluent. As for the position of county magistrate, the previous report that Li Leng was appointed has been changed. It is heard that Mr. Li has been transferred to a coastal county vacancy, and the provincial chairman Han Deqin has selected another person to fill the position.

### Last Year – Chinese Tea Maintained a Superior Position – Total Exports of 65.62 Million Pounds – Japanese Tea of Low Quality Sharply Reduced by Over 10 Million

The Mainland News reports that Mr. Xisang, Technical Advisor to the Foreign Trade Commission and the China National Tea Association, in his memorandum "A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Working Teas in 1937 and 1938," determined that China maintained its tea industry position last year, while Japan has lagged behind so far. Mr. Hui's report briefly stated as follows: In previous years, especially in 1937, Japan made great efforts to drive China out of the world tea market. This is well known. In 1937, Japanese and Taiwanese tea sold only 6 million pounds in London, more than in 1936. However, the quality of Japanese and Taiwanese tea was greatly inferior that year, and it was indeed boycotted in the London market because these teas were used to mix with more expensive teas produced by other countries. Due to the low quality of Japanese tea, the mixed tea was also very bad, so tea shops refused to buy Japanese tea anymore. In addition, the London tea market, of course, like other commodity markets in London, hoped to prove its opposition to Japan's attitude towards China. The most prominent was the appropriate move by the Wholesale Cooperative Society of England, urging its affiliates to boycott all Japanese goods, including tea. The United States also took the same attitude. At the beginning of last year, Japan claimed that due to the "chaos" in China, the world tea market would indeed have no supply of Chinese tea. I obtained this information and immediately contacted some major tea merchants in London and my friend Graham, Chairman of the International Tea Committee, who all refuted this news, saying that it was just Japanese false propaganda. The above can be known to be true by comparing the exports of Chinese and Japanese tea. In short, during the period from January to December 1938, China exported a total of 65.62 million pounds of tea, only about 1 million pounds less than the 66.766 million pounds exported in the whole year of 1937. The entire tea market has moved from Shanghai, the usual general sales office, to Hong Kong, which has caused serious inconvenience. In addition, considering the war situation, I think China's handling of the tea industry is exceptionally perfect. In the same period last year, Japan's tea exports were sharply reduced by more than 13 million, in contrast to China's decrease of only about 1 million pounds. The exact number of Japanese tea exports in the whole year of 1938 was 21.643 million pounds, while the total exports in the whole year of 1937 were 34.85 million pounds. Japan is very advantageous in the tea industry because no war has invaded its tea-producing areas and it can continue to produce tea without hindrance. This goes without saying. It is also worth noting that each time Japan exports tea, with a few exceptions, it generally does not publicly announce which country it is going to. The reason is probably not wanting people to know where its tea industry has suffered losses. Although Chinese tea exports to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union seem to have decreased significantly compared to 1937, the truth is not so. The increase in Chinese tea exports to Hong Kong also includes those that are first transported to Hong Kong and finally to the Soviet Union and the London market.

### Kala-azar – Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment – Very Effective

Kala-azar is widespread in the Jianghuai area. On December 11 last year, this newspaper published the rampant situation of kala-azar in Funing, where there were about 40,000 patients. However, because Western medicine is expensive, the poor cannot afford to buy it, and they often wait to die. According to a letter from Wang Shuxiang of Huaiyin to Cheng Jingsheng, Chairman of the North Jiangsu International Relief Committee, he described the treatment method of kala-azar with traditional Chinese medicine in detail. Excerpts are as follows: "Our office has been handling kala-azar relief for nearly five years, and we have not stopped distributing pills for decades. Although we have repeatedly reported military alarms, the medicine distribution office still operates as usual. In addition to the continuous distribution of medicine in Huaiyin, there are also medicine distribution offices in Lianshui and Muyang. Mr. Zhu Bofu is in charge of Lianshui, and Mr. Xu Baoping is in charge of Moyang. The reason why I dare not neglect is because it can really save people. The so-called kala-azar is the growth of masses in the abdomen. The cause of the disease is unclean diet, poor water and soil, and infection with the improper seasonal epidemic, so it is also called epidemic mass. People die very quickly and it is easily transmitted, which is completely different from ordinary blood masses and qi masses. Before administering the medicine, it must first be verified whether it is kala-azar. Our office has a brochure for examining the symptoms, which is distributed with the medicine to prevent errors in diagnosis. The treatment is to make pills, which have different sizes. Adults take three doses a day, one large pill per dose. Children also take two doses a day, three small pills per dose. It is extremely simple and convenient. Mild cases can be cured in one month (Western medicine injections are also effective, but they must be given for more than a month). Severe cases must be cured in fifty or sixty days. Farmers in the countryside do not have the financial resources for injections, so it is convenient to treat them with this medicine. Mr. Qiu Jinzhang (Mr. Qiu is Zha Zhenchang of Funing) is concerned about this, which can be said to be a heartfelt person. However, Zha Zhen is temporary in nature. To save this disease, long-term treatment is necessary. It is best for Mr. Qiu to select sincere and truly charitable gentry in Funing County to persuade them to take charge. Our office can send as much medicine as possible. We can first send 20 pounds of pills for trial. We have instructed our medicine distribution office to prepare them. You said you were raising funds, please postpone it for the time being. If someone is in charge of the office and the treatment is effective, the number of people who are saved will be many if it is done for a long time. My strength is weak, and I ask you to help with charitable funds again. To administer this medicine, you must find someone who is kind and patient, because the medicine for dozens of days cannot be given to the patient at one time. It must be given in doses, either once every ten days or once every five days, and in the meantime, you must observe the condition and add medicine as needed."

### Excess Profit Tax Introduced – Collected by the Income Tax Office – Those Suffering from War Losses Are Exempt

The Regulations on Excess Profit Tax in the Extraordinary Period were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 28, 1938, stipulating that all profit-making enterprises of companies, factories, merchants, firms, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, profit-making enterprises jointly operated by officials and merchants, and temporary profit-making enterprises, whose profits exceed 15% of the capital, and the profits from property leasing exceeding 12% of the property value, shall be subject to excess profit tax. It is collected from July 1 last year, and each collection is collected every six months. It is heard that this tax is collected by the Income Tax Office. Now that the implementation of this regulation has reached the six-month collection period, the Income Tax Offices of all provinces and cities have been ordered by the General Office to collect on their behalf. Factories that have moved inland due to the war and businesses that have suffered significant losses due to the war will be temporarily exempted from tax after verification. Those who conceal their income or make false reports shall be fined two to five times the amount of tax payable, and in serious cases, they shall also be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to six months. If the taxpayer fails to pay the tax within the prescribed period, in addition to ordering him to pay, he shall also be fined up to twice the amount of tax owed. As for the procedures for calculating, declaring, investigating, and reviewing the profit tax, the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations shall apply.

### Five-Percent Gold Bond – Principal Repayment Begins – Two Types: US$50 and US$1.25

According to the French Shanghai Daily, the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank of Shanghai announced that it recently received a large sum from the Chinese Maritime Customs and was instructed to use it to pay the principal and interest of the 1925 Chinese Five-Percent Gold Bond. It is heard that the principal and interest of this gold bond have been paid 27 times, and this will be the 28th time.

### Jewish Refugees: A Not-So-Bad Life of Wandering; Each Person Needs 60 Gold per Month, While Chinese Refugees Need Only Two Yuan

Due to having nowhere to settle in Europe, Jewish refugees have come to Shanghai successively. As of now, according to the Shanghai European Refugee Relief Society's report, there are a total of 1,500 people. Among them, 10%, or 150 people, have work in Shanghai or can obtain financial assistance from relatives and friends. All other refugees rely on the Society for support. In addition to normal food and clothing expenses, the monthly cost for sanitation and hygiene amounts to 90,000 yuan. According to the European Refugee Relief Society, this funding does not come from the Society's fundraising but is actually subsidized by foreign governments. The Society has great sympathy for the plight of these refugees and strives to meet their needs. Among all the refugees, there are 25 children, who are separately taken care of and supported by their parents outside, with expenses still provided by the Society. Considering 1,500 people, the monthly cost of 90,000 yuan means that each person needs 60 yuan per month for living expenses. In contrast, Chinese refugees only need two yuan per month. Even considering 1,500 people, it only costs 1,000 yuan per month. The comparison between the two is beyond measure.

### Shanghai Municipal Council: An Overview of Important Administrative Matters (I)

The post-war reconstruction of the International Settlement faces considerable difficulties. The Council has engaged in negotiations with the Japanese side regarding the management rights of the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts. These negotiations were still ongoing at the end of last year. The machinery plants of both the Waterworks Company and the Electricity Company are located in Yangshupu, but the operations of both companies have not been interrupted. The Tramway Company and the Bus Company have not been able to resume operations north of the Suzhou Creek. Buses transported from Japan have already started running in Hongkou. This business conflicts with the franchise granted by the Council to the Chinese Bus Company, so the Council has protested to the Japanese authorities.

Chinese people passing north of the Suzhou Creek are still limited to those holding permits issued by the Japanese authorities. Japanese soldiers are stationed at each bridge leading to the area, checking permits. Several vegetable markets, sanitation branches, police stations, and fire brigades have reopened, but other properties owned by the Council, such as schools and hospitals, remained closed at the end of the year. The berthing facilities at the Hongkou wharves have been improved, and ships from several large shipping companies can dock at these wharves. A number of Chinese people (mostly workers) returned to the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts last year, but few foreigners who previously resided in these areas and moved away have returned. Fifty Chinese police officers are already performing duties in Hongkou, but only to direct traffic. The Sanitation, Public Works, and other departments are cooperating to restore normalcy to the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts. However, as of the end of the year, there is no hope of returning the management of these two districts to the Council.

The management of refugees south of the Suzhou Creek and the establishment of factories in the western district required careful consideration. The refugee problem has placed a heavy burden on various departments of the Council, especially the Sanitation and Police Departments. Fortunately, the funds from charitable organizations, the Council's subsidies, and amusement taxes have largely covered the relief expenses. Council staff have spared no effort in handling relief affairs. The Refugee Repatriation Committee continues to work, with Council member Bland as the chairman and Mr. Raes of British firm Butterfield & Swire as the secretary. The Refugee Advisory Committee, jointly established by the two settlements' authorities, also continues to exist. The committee is responsible for studying the overall refugee problem and paying attention to its development. Some of the refugee shelters' buildings are privately owned, and the owners have suffered great losses. To remedy this, the Council has decided to assist relief organizations in finding suitable open spaces to build sheds for relocating refugees. Council member McKinnon is the chairman of the Refugee Shelter Relocation Committee, and Council member Mitchell also serves on the committee. At the beginning of last year, the Sanitation Department inspected 190 shelters, accommodating 90,000 refugees. By the end of last year, this had been reduced to 70 shelters, accommodating over 50,000 people.

Sir Cairn Robert Marshall, chairman of the Food and Fuel Control Committee, continuously investigates the status of food and fuel and seeks to clear supply channels. Mr. Cairn is also the chairman of the Rice Joint Control Committee, overseeing the rice situation in Shanghai and deliberating on how to dispose of the remaining foreign rice purchased by the Council in previous years.

Some foreigners in the Hongqiao district have returned home, but the area remains under Japanese military control. Guerrilla warfare sometimes occurs there. A foreign youth was killed by a stray bullet.

On August 1st, a conflict occurred between soldiers in the Chinese Lone Army Barracks and Russian guards, resulting in an unfortunate incident. Four guards were slightly injured, and three Lone Army soldiers died in the hospital from serious injuries. Afterward, the Council agreed to provide each soldier's family with 3,000 yuan in national currency as compensation, to be distributed through the Chinese Ratepayers' Association.

From a public health standpoint, the cholera epidemic was the most serious problem of the past year. The disease spread rapidly between May and August, and the Council's Sanitation Department had to add hospitals to cope with the emergency. (To be continued)

Wang subsequently confessed that there were accomplices and military supplies, so at around 10 AM on the 5th, they worked with Chinese detective officers Chen Yaoting, Cui Chengguang, detective Zhang Kuilian, Li Wenzhao, and all other detectives to arrest seven gang members, including Fei Jinbao, Zheng Amao, Han Jinsheng, Gao Yuanhuai, Zhu Qunshan, Shan Huaibin, and Shan Huaichuan, Jiangbei natives, at the Jintai Teahouse near No. 6 Xinzha Road. They then went to a shed in the Dian Dang Lane of Jessfield Road and Brenan Road, confiscating a hand grenade, a watch, a pawn ticket, and a flashlight, bringing them back to the police station. Detectives later learned that a large number of military supplies were hidden in No. 5 Wangjia Lane in the western district of Shanghai. They then teamed up with the police force to drive to search, but the gang had already moved the military supplies, leaving nothing behind. They returned to the police station, and yesterday morning, sent the arrested criminals to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the case and requested permission for personal escort to continue the investigation. Judge Xiao approved the request and ordered Fei Jinbao and others to be detained for further investigation.

### Murder Case over Extortion; Main Culprit Arrested

The rascal Chen Along, together with four or five gang members, went to No. 66 Ruifuli, Zilaihuo Street, in the French Concession at 8 PM on December 27th last year to extort money from the blind man A Fu, also known as Xu Bingsheng or Chen Afu, who was selling morphine. A verbal argument broke out, and Chen Along was stabbed in a vital spot in the dark, dying on the spot. The murderer and Chen's companions fled in a panic. The police received the report and sent the body to the coroner's office for examination, and then had it buried, awaiting identification. They also arrested a suspect, Shao Rongbao, and sent him to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention, and postponed the hearing. Now, detectives have learned that the murderer, the blind man A Fu, fled with his concubine, Ms. Wu, to the Changzhou Inn on Beihai Road in the International Settlement after the incident. So, the day before yesterday, they worked with the British police to arrest the blind man A Fu, also known as Xu Bingsheng (26 years old, from Wuxi), and his concubine, Ms. Wu (23 years old, from the same hometown as Xu), and brought them back to the French police station. It was found that Xu had been sentenced to one year and four months in prison for a morphine case in the British Concession. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Liao Yuan questioned them. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer representing the French Concession's administrative authorities, explained the case and requested a postponement to investigate and prosecute the case together with Shao Rongbao. The court verified the report, interrogated the defendants, and ordered a postponement until the 9th to hear the case together with Shao Rongbao. The defendants were sent back to custody.

### Pervert Xu Shansong Sentenced to Seven Years; Raped an Underdeveloped Girl

Xu A Si, a 17-year-old girl from Jiangbei who lived at No. 139 Annakin Road, went to work at the Huiying Silk Factory on Kaifeng Road at 6 AM on the 2nd of this month. When she passed the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Baker Road, she was lured to his workplace by Xu Shansong (57 years old), a Yangzhou native who was the gatekeeper of Lane 374 on Nanjing Road. From 8 PM to 10 PM on the 3rd, he raped her twice, but failed to achieve his goal because the girl was not fully developed. At 2 AM in the late night, he raped her again and finally destroyed the girl's virginity. However, the girl cried out in pain, which was heard by patrol officers, Chinese police officer No. 1165, and others. They investigated the matter and took Xu Shansong to the General Police Station, sending him to the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted him for rape under Article 221 of the Criminal Law. After the court hearing was adjourned, yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie continued the hearing and appointed lawyer Deng Pingfan as the defendant's pro bono counsel. Judge Xiao then sentenced Xu Shansong to seven years of imprisonment as a warning.

### Landlord and Tenant in Repeated Disputes; Second Landlord Obstructed Furniture Removal and Committed Assault; Tenant Accused of Fraud After Reconciliation

Shen Youqi, from Pudong, rented the living room upstairs and the back wing room downstairs at No. 40 Baoqingli, Baotian Tong Road, from Xu Jingxing, the owner of the Damei Leather Shoe Company, for more than a year. Recently, Shen moved some of the furniture upstairs, so he moved some of the furniture downstairs to the upstairs. Xu Jingxing, the second landlord, tried to prevent this, so Shen reported to the Huisi Police Station, which informed Xu that he must not obstruct the exercise of rights. On January 2nd of this year, at 10 AM, Shen instructed his son Shaoqiu and daughter Huifen to supervise the workers to move the furniture. But Xu ignored the police station's advice and ordered more than a dozen leather craftsmen he hired to beat Shaoqiu and Huifen, causing them injuries. At that time, Shen Youqi happened to be returning home, so he twisted Xu to the Huisi Police Station. The police verified that the injuries were real, and ordered Xu to allow Shen to move the furniture and bear the medical expenses. The two parties went outside to reconcile. After Xu was released, he initially refused to reconcile, but later Shen met with him at the Xinhua Restaurant on Tiantong Road at 4 PM on the 5th of this month to discuss a reconciliation plan, and agreed to pay 100 yuan for medical expenses. At that time, Shen Youqi and his wife, Ms. Chen, went to the meeting on time. Unexpectedly, Xu had reported to the police station in advance, accusing Shen and others of blackmail, so when they were receiving the money, detectives arrived and arrested Shen and his wife to the Huisi Police Station, and confiscated 100 yuan in stolen money. Ms. Chen was released first because she was irrelevant, while Shen was detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case and prosecuted him for extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. When questioning Shen Youqi, he hired three lawyers, Li Weibin, Fan Gang, and Yu Siliang, to defend him in court. Judge Jiang ordered the case to be debated and set a verdict for next Monday. The defendant was sent back to custody.

Qin, the leader of the 8th Company of the 2nd Detachment Directly Under the Righteous and Patriotic Army of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee, personally led his soldiers to patrol the Chenjiaqiao area of Hongqiao Road the day before yesterday afternoon. They unintentionally arrested a spy, confiscating the seal of Kitamura Guixiong, the head of the Lincoln Road Ifu Ban in Shanghai's western district, and other items from the suspect's body.

After Captain Qin obtained the confession, he believed that the suspect dared to act as a spy, spying on military secrets, a heinous crime. He then prepared a document to report to his superiors and executed the suspect by firing squad yesterday.

### Japanese Army Induces Thugs to Patrol Railways, Strictly Preventing Guerrilla Sabotage

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been repeatedly sabotaged by Chinese guerrillas, causing the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to be frequently interrupted. The Japanese side has been unable to prevent it, forcing residents of villages along the railway to strengthen their patrols and offering bonuses. If a section of the track is damaged, the residents of that section will be held accountable, and the village chiefs will be ordered to be responsible for patrolling. Japanese soldiers (two or four soldiers per bridge) are stationed with guns on the bridges along the road. However, recently, the guerrillas have been specifically bombing bridges along the road (such as a recent bridge that was bombed at night), making it impossible for the Japanese soldiers to prevent it. Now, the Japanese have appointed Japanese man Miyajima, along with Chinese traitors Wan and Gao, to recruit forty or fifty unemployed thugs to form a Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Protection Team. Wan and Gao will serve as the captain and deputy captain, and Miyajima and others will be the top advisors, responsible for patrolling in sections. It is reported that the team members' salaries range from 30 to 50 yuan per month, and they started service on the first day.

Mr. Zhu will rest in Hong Kong for a while before heading to Shanghai.

### Yongzhen Regularly Sails Between Funing and Shanghai

After the fall of the Yangtze River coast in northern Jiangsu, the local products and transportation of nearly 20 counties in northern Jiangsu were often suspended.

In November and December, the competition between the various ships was fierce, and the scene was quite lively. However, most of them stopped and started from time to time, rising and falling, and changing unpredictably. It is said that the Yongzhen ship of Yongli Shipping Company, in order to maintain transportation in northern Jiangsu, has always sailed regularly and without interruption.

### Chinese Servants Serving Japanese All Agreed to Flee on New Year's Day, Perhaps Because They Were Unwilling

According to the French newspaper, several Chinese who served the Japanese in Hongkou this year seemed to have anti-Japanese behavior, or an organized movement. It is reported that a Japanese couple from a certain tourism agency hired a certain Chinese servant, who suddenly rolled up the furniture and money on New Year's Day and fled.

### Gambling Dens Abound in Pudong and Hongkou; Although the Stakes Are Not as High as in the Western District, Workers Have Suffered a Lot

According to people from Yangshupu, the area has not yet been opened up, and those who live there are all recognized by the factories. Entry and exit require permits. There are currently hooligans who have opened two gambling dens and one Huahui major factory, all located in the Xiaocai Market inside the Badaitou of Pingliang Road. The facilities in the gambling dens are slightly inferior to those in the Western District, but there are all kinds of gambling equipment. The gamblers are all ignorant workers, and the stakes are not as high as in the Western District. The Huahui major factory actually opens three tubes a day, absorbing the hard-earned money of ignorant female workers. There are also many listening tubes, such as Renshouli on Jingzhou Road and Dingheli on Dalianwan Road, helping Datong to raise gambling funds.

Moreover, in order to "prosper" the market, the Japanese puppet regime in Pudong is also actively trying to create a second Western District. The Yongli Club, a large gambling den that has been preparing for a long time, opened today in the mansion of Fu Hujun, a rich man on the west side of the Santai cigarette and paper shop on Dongchang Road. Last night, more than a dozen gasoline lamps inside and outside shone like daylight. All kinds of monsters appeared together. Today is the first day of trading, commonly known as "Langtai." After resting for three days, it will officially open. It is reported that the reward to the special service agency and the puppet "municipal government" was originally set at 150 gold per day, but because the income is still uncertain at the beginning of the opening, it has been temporarily reduced to 40 gold per day.

### Japanese Troops Build Water Pavilion in Suzhou Creek

Since the complete withdrawal of the Japanese Army from Zhabei, the defense duties are now fully undertaken by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. However, their troop strength is very thin. In various inland locations, such as the 63rd Garden, Baziqiao, Liuying Bridge, Tan Jiaqiao, Pengpu New Bridge (also known as the Cement Bridge), and Da Yang Bridge, etc., there is only one Japanese soldier stationed at each location.

It protrudes into the water, measuring over three zhang in length and over one zhang in width, resembling a building. All three sides, east, west, and south, are fitted with glass, allowing for observation. The purpose is unknown. Some say it is to observe the merchant ships passing through the river, while others say it is to guard against guerrilla attacks.

As a result, those suffering from diphtheria and colds are quite rampant. Since the day before yesterday, it has suddenly turned severely cold, with northwest winds piercing into the bones. Thin water has congealed into ice, truly a scene of midwinter. However, the moisture content in the sky is too low, so the degree of dryness is as before, and it has affected human beings and agriculture. However, the sky has been dark for days, as if there is a sign of snow. It was not until 8:10 PM yesterday that sparse snowflakes finally fell. They fell and stopped, and did not continue to fall until after 10:00 PM. Goose feather white flakes rolled down, fluttering in the wind, smoothly and densely. Occasionally, there were raindrops mixed in, so there was no accumulation. The snowfall stopped at midnight. If there is no heavy rain and it can fall smoothly and continuously, then the climate will definitely improve, all diseases will be eliminated, and agriculture will benefit greatly. It is a harbinger of a good harvest.

### Letter

Editor: According to the Shanghai Public Concession Chenghuang Temple Market representative, the Shanghai Public Concession Chenghuang Temple Market representative stated that the Shanghai Public Concession Chenghuang Temple Market representative stated that the Shanghai Public Concession Chenghuang Temple Market representative stated that the report on the Chenghuang Temple Board of Directors meeting published in your newspaper on January 6 was inconsistent with the facts. The original purpose of the market was to revitalize the city and promote business, and there was no intention to borrow any shadows. However, the Board of Directors of Chenghuang Temple mistakenly believed in rumors, which led to many speculations. Fortunately, Mr. Huang Jinrong came out to explain, and the doubts were dispelled. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the market automatically added the words "Shanghai Public Concession" to show that it was not related to the Chenghuang Temple in the city. Mr. Du Yuesheng's letter was even before the market's motives in this city. Therefore, the so-called transfer of the temple gods seems to be another matter, and it has nothing to do with the market. As for reshaping the Chenghuang God, it was not mentioned during the mediation. I would like to ask your lawyer to send a letter of correction to the law firm in order to correct the views of the audience. The lawyer Jin Yuqi, who was present at the dinner party in Huang Gongguan on October 6, agreed with the above.

Commercial News

### Finance: The Ministry of Finance Restricts Silver Shops from Buying and Selling Gold; Gold Prices Rise After Falling; Opening and Exchanging to Enter State Ownership Shows Clues; Silver Shops First Suspect and Fear, Then Smile; It Is Still Hoped That There Is No Implementation in Shanghai for a While; Moreover, Tianjin and Hong Kong's Wealthy Are Releasing Prices to Collect

On November 1 last year, the Ministry of Finance issued a method for supervising silver shops to purchase gold. It only allows silver shops to purchase or sell items made of pure gold, 90% gold, original gold, or cast into ornaments or utensils. They are not allowed to purchase gold blocks, gold bars, gold leaves, placer gold, or mine gold. If you want to purchase such gold items, you must obtain the approval of the Ministry of Finance to set up a company, and the gold items purchased must still be resold to the four central banks. In other words, the gold price of the silver shop should also be based on the central bank's pure gold purchase price standard. In other words, gold will be nationalized, and the gold that can be bought and sold in silver shops will be limited to ornaments, and it will eventually become impossible to buy. After this news was discovered in the gold market yesterday, people in the industry showed a look of panic for a while, and there were many discussions. They did not dare to take action, and there was a state of stagnation, which caused the morning market to be open for a long time. However, in Shanghai, this method is still difficult to implement. Therefore, after 10 o'clock, the silver shops were eager to get out of the cage before the market opened, and the price was as low as 1,983 yuan. Unexpectedly, those who are wealthy heard this news and thought that it would be difficult to obtain gold in the future even if there was legal currency. The idea of collecting became more intense, and they searched in money exchange companies (fighting market) and bought at high prices. Moreover, Hong Kong's gangsters started to collect, and the money exchange companies also came to replenish their goods. For a time, the chips were exhausted, and the market price suddenly rebounded, returning to 1,990 yuan, and finally saw Bu Ang approaching the 2,000 yuan level. However, the transaction volume was sparse throughout the day, with only a few hundred taels in the morning and a few hundred taels in the afternoon.

Briquette Transactions Were Quiet

Since the morning, there has been no transaction for each bar (ten taels). Most of the discussions focused on the central government's Ministry of Finance's strict prohibition of silver shops and gold shops from buying and selling gold. Both sides had no intention of supply and demand, and the guests were willing to wait and see. It was not until 9:45 that Yu Hao sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang at 1,983 yuan as the opening price. Subsequently, another silver shop gang sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at the same price. During this period, the foreign exchange reported softly, so the buyers gradually increased. At the same time, the securities gang suddenly came to absorb purchases, which caused the price to turn upstream. The securities gang entered a total of 100 taels, priced at 84 and 86 yuan, all supplied by the silver shop gang. After that, a money exchange industry also followed the search on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, but the sellers became increasingly rare, so the step rose sharply, and the price suddenly broke through the 90 yuan level. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of the silver shop gang, with a closing price of 93 yuan (I heard that it was searching on behalf of the Hong Kong gang). In the afternoon, although the foreign exchange rebounded slightly, the price rose again because the Hong Kong gang's buying intention was still strong, but the transaction volume was very small, because there was a lack of sellers. At 2:30, a money exchange industry entered 50 taels of the silver shop gang on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, with a price of 95 yuan. At 3:40, it entered 50 taels of the same industry again, with a closing price of 1,997 yuan, which was 9 yuan higher than the previous day's reduction. The spot price of the cash store was sold out at 1,000 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 15 yuan. The current bid money is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. There is no business opening.

Ornamental Gold Hangs Up for One Yuan

Silver shop jewelry gold, the initial redemption price per tael has not changed. By 3:15 in the afternoon, due to the rise in briquettes, the price increased by one yuan. Datonghang Lao Qingyun, etc., changed to the new Tonhang price of 203 yuan, and the purchase price was 195 yuan.

Pure Gold Reacts and Falls Back

London, 5th: British pure gold also reacted and fell due to the increase in British Exchange. The price dropped by 4 pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds and 10 shillings and 1 pence. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also fell to 1,225 yuan and 2 corners, and the customs gold listed also fell by 5 percent, totaling 2 yuan, 4 corners, and 2 Xia. The Shanghai Standard Standard Gold price also fell by 2 yuan and 7 corners, reaching 1,220 yuan and 05 corners.

### Discount Rate Drops Again by More Than One Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly decreased. The initial opening was still around 40 yuan per 1,000 yuan, but later the suppliers gathered and the price fell. At noon, it was 38 yuan and 7 and a half corners, and at noon it was 39 yuan. In the afternoon, it once dropped to 38 yuan and 2 and a half corners, and finally recovered slightly to 38 yuan and a half, which was 1 yuan and 2 and a half corners lower than the previous day.

### Foreign Currency Needs Are Slightly Broader

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by 4 pence, and the British and American exchange rates rose by 1 point. Foreign exchange trading was not strong, and supply and demand were very balanced. The trend was stable. There was a slight absorption of briquettes, and the transaction was also rare, and the impact was limited. The trend was slightly strong. Foreign currency needs were slightly strong, and the market was hovering and rising slightly. The exchange transaction was not strong. Hengmao sold 50 British gold pounds to Chengtai, and Yingfeng sold 25 British gold pounds to Chengtai. Xiangtai sold 500 American dollar notes to Yongtai, and Xiangyuan sold 400 Hong Kong dollar notes to Chengtai. Chengtai sold 120 Filipino notes to Yingfeng. Yesterday's market price: British gold notes rose by 5 points, American dollar notes rose by 5 percent, Hong Kong dollar notes rose by 8 percent, French franc notes rose by 1 percent, Singapore dollar notes rose by 3 points, Dutch dollar notes rose by 1 point, and Canadian dollar and Filipino dollar notes each fell by 1 point. The others did not change.

### Large Bars Continue Downstream

London, 5th: Silver market speculators sold out, lacking support, which led to a decline. The market was stable, and the market remained flat after closing. Someone bought forward at the listed price, but the transaction volume was not large. The recent shrink of large bar silver continued to be 3,125, and the forward also shrank by 25. New Silver News: The American silver price still had a market without a market, and the Cha Mengbai silver market situation was still flat. Spot prices fell by 2 anna, and recent and forward prices did not change.

### Foreign Exchange Bank Settlement Abundant, Foreign Telegrams Blocked, No Special Changes, Results: Sterling Tight, Dollar Stable

Although the foreign exchange market yesterday saw substantial settlements from foreign banks and British and American tobacco companies, there were no special changes due to the blockage and influx of foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and Luzon. However, the result was that sterling was tight while the dollar was stable, which was due to the shortening of sterling exchange rates and the lengthening of dollar exchange rates. Trading volume was particularly robust that day.

In the early morning, London's major exchange rates, both near and far, were lower, while New York's spot rate remained unchanged. Sterling exchange rate fell by half a point against the dollar, sixteen centimes against the French franc, and remained stable against Shanghai. The dollar exchange rate rose by one point against sterling, fell by twenty-five against the French franc, and rose by two against Shanghai. The central bank's official exchange rates remained the same as before. At the bank's early opening, the spot selling rate for sterling was 8 pence 546875, and for the dollar it was 16.53125 yuan, which was stable for sterling and up 0.03125 yuan for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, foreign banks had abundant settlements, but banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the underlying trend was firm. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official exchange rate announcement was unchanged, and when the silver balancing tax was announced, the price plummeted by 1.75 points. British and American tobacco companies also began purchasing and settling accounts, and the tightness suddenly intensified. Banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, and at one point, it was difficult to settle sterling at 8 and a half pence, and dollars were tight at 16.4375 yuan. Thereafter, due to the considerable influx of blocked Hong Kong telegrams, coupled with the banks' weak buying appetite and the exchange shops' continued heavy selling of Hong Kong exchange, the process gradually eased slightly. At the noon close, sterling was firm at 8 and a half pence, and dollars at 16.46875 yuan. After the close, there was still a supply of forward positions from Hong Kong telegrams, and again it was firm at 8 pence 515625 and 16.5 yuan, all of which could be settled.

In the afternoon, foreign telegrams from Luzon also came to sell off sterling and dollars in large quantities, and the exchange shops' selling interest remained unabated. Furthermore, with the banks' weak buying interest, sterling again firmed to 8 pence 53125. Later, foreign banks' settlements surged again, coupled with the banks' reluctance to supply, so the situation gradually stabilized. At the evening close, the bank's selling rates were 8 pence 53125 for sterling and 16.5 yuan for the dollar. The result was that sterling was up 0.015625 from the previous close, while the dollar was stable. The Hong Kong exchange rate, under the exchange shops' selling pressure, eased to 57.25 yuan, finally returning to 57.125 yuan, up 0.25 from the previous day. The trading record for the day is listed below:

Sterling Exchange Rate (Calculated in National Currency of 1 Yuan)

Hong Kong Exchange Rate (Calculated in National Currency of 100 Yuan)

### Yarn and Cloth: Actual Sales Continue Uninterrupted, Yarn Prices Rise Again by Four or Five Yuan, Japanese Yarn Also Lifted

The yarn market continued to be firm, with a gentle upward trend. Actual customer sales continued uninterrupted, and the buying power remained strong. The Chaoshan merchants from Southern China bought yarn and resold it to eastern and western Guangdong, while the Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants had a strong appetite for both coarse and fine yarns. As for the Zhejiang East region, our military strength was solid, and the Xiang-Gan markets were becoming increasingly prosperous, with commerce picking up. Merchants from various regions gathered in Wen, Yong, Tai, and other places to collect cotton yarn and cloth, which were then transported to the rear for use. This is the biggest factor in the recent rise in cotton yarn prices. Although the buying volume of fine yarn from the Sichuan merchants was not large, there was a sense of activity. As a result, prices have risen by more than ten yuan in the past two days, but people's minds are still calm. The market opened peacefully yesterday morning, and some thought that the customer merchants had made wholesale transactions the previous day, so it might be suspended. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose slightly by 1.5 yuan, and then the market price immediately rose by two to three yuan due to the continued strong demand from Shantou and Yunnan merchants. According to statistics, 1,255 bales were traded in the morning, compared with 608 bales in the afternoon of the previous day. As a result, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 3.5 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 4 yuan, Double Earth rose by 5 yuan, Celestial Maiden rose by 4 yuan, Shepherd rose by 4 yuan, and 10-count and 16-count medium-coarse yarns all rose by about 1-2 yuan. The Tongyi Factory offered 210 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster yarn at 285 yuan, the Chongxin Factory offered 240 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at 280 yuan, and the Dasheng Factory offered 200 bales of 10-count Red Kui yarn at prices ranging from 266 yuan to 167.5 yuan. Today, 1,310 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Shantou, 130 pieces to Hong Kong, 150 pieces to Haikou, 1,160 pieces to Haiphong, and 10 pieces to Quanzhou. The amount of yarn purchased by each merchant is listed on the left:

The following is a supplementary record of transactions in the afternoon of the previous day:

The Japanese yarn market continued to rise, mainly because Chinese yarn prices were rising step by step, which lifted people's spirits, and buyers were active. There were also considerable sales in guerrilla areas, but wholesale transactions were still lacking. Yesterday, the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 301 yuan to 301.5 yuan, and the price for this month was 301.5 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 305 yuan to 304.5 yuan, and the price for this month was 303 yuan to 304 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to the previous day.

The price of oilseed cakes has approached the 3 yuan mark, mainly because the supply of Changzhou cakes is insufficient, and the factory cakes can only supply a small amount, while the sales of various merchants are endless, so the market sentiment is excellent. The Dayouyu Factory's Sipai cake opened at 1.97 yuan the previous day, and yesterday the market rose again by 2 cents to 2.99 yuan, which was continuously purchased by the Wen-Tai merchants, and there is a tendency to break through the 3 yuan mark.

Today, the export of soybean cakes includes 1,000 pieces to Quanzhou, 1,000 pieces to Xiushan Island, and 2,000 pieces to Shantou.

### White Bales of Cotton Demand Increases Daily, Cotton Forms a Situation of Coarse Active, Fine Tired, Foreign Cotton Trading Becomes Lively Again

The business of white bales of cotton is still thriving, but fine velvet is quiet as usual. The demand for white bales of cotton from Chinese factories is increasing daily. The buying appetite of Xinyu and Yong'an is suddenly strong, mainly because the recent cotton yarn and cloth transactions in the southwest non-war zones have seen a sudden improvement, and the factories have sold a lot, so they naturally need to replenish this raw material. As a result, the market price has risen by 5 jiao due to the strong business. The trading of "Fire Machine" cotton is even more popular. The goods that arrive every day are snapped up even before they reach the pier. However, the attitude of Japanese factories is dim and weak, and fine velvet cotton feels even more depressed, because foreign cotton prices are cheaper than Chinese cotton, and it can be purchased and replenished at any time, so the transaction volume of domestic fine velvet is declining, resulting in the price gap between coarse and fine cotton becoming closer and closer. Shenxin purchased Brazilian cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 30-count and 20-count yarns, at a price of only 89 yuan when it arrives in meter, totaling 500 pieces. The source of goods from northern Jiangsu has increased, including 1,112 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 557 bales of Changyinsha cotton, 570 pieces from Cha Nian Tuo Port, 220 pieces from Beisha, and 190 pieces from Baimao. Yao cotton arrives in large quantities and sales are also smooth. Today, there are still 150 pieces of cotton transported to Shantou. The current cotton transaction volume and market prices are listed on the left.

Foreign cotton market prices, the American cotton of New York is at times uneven, with rises and falls alternating. Generally, speculators sold excessive floating positions because they read Roosevelt's telegram, which suggested tax increases, so cotton prices fell. At the close, cotton prices fell again due to pressure from large sales in the South and a weak stock market. As a result, American cotton fell 11-12 pounds, and India, including forecasts, fell more than 1 rupee, Egypt rose 3-5 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rates were very stable, and cotton prices converted into legal tender all fell, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each falling by more than 1 yuan per dan (unit of weight), Indian cotton falling by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton falling by 7-8 jiao.

Yesterday's foreign cotton trading in this city was lively again, but the only buyers were the Japanese manufacturers. As for the Chinese factories, Xinzongguo purchased 200 pieces of Indian cotton at 90 yuan cash delivered to the factory. This cotton was owned by Tongcheng Company. Other Chinese factories were quite interested in purchasing foreign cotton, but were temporarily limited by payment terms. The factories are watching each other, and if one breaks the rule and purchases first, it will be used as an excuse by other factories. It is hoped that the Chinese factories can unite and work together and not repeat the past mistakes and be calculated by foreign merchants. The transaction volume and spot prices are listed below.

### Securities: Chinese Want to Buy Foreign Debt, London Unwilling to Supply, Domestic Debt Returns to Peace

The London Chinese foreign debt market on May 5th (Thursday) seemed to have stopped falling, with only the Tianjin-Pukou Railway original loan British and German bonds each falling by 1 pound to 16 pounds. The supply of actual goods is still lacking, because the market price a month ago had already fallen a lot compared to before. Although Shanghai is quite willing to buy at low prices, the London owners are reluctant to sell at low prices. As for buying and selling prices, the British gold rehabilitation public bonds issued in British pound were bought at 54 pounds and sold at 55 pounds. French bonds with Indian bonds were bought at 50 pounds and sold at 51.5 pounds. Chinese-French American dollar bonds with Indian bonds also had hopes of being bought if the price was 76.5 pounds.

The over-the-counter market yesterday was rebounding due to the excessive gains the previous day, as the reporter predicted. Jingwei's telegram echoed Konoe's telegram, and confused speculators took it as an opportunity for peace, so there was a rise before. Yesterday, after seeing the line-up of the reorganized Japanese cabinet, the rise of fascism was even stronger than before. Speculators again believed that the hope of peace was cut off, and the market price suddenly fell back. The main reason for its instability was completely controlled by the current situation. In fact, diplomatic secrets are not something that ordinary people can understand. Speculators speculate on the atmosphere, causing the market price to fluctuate. However, according to the public bond's own environment is very good, the financial situation is very good, and the war prospects are very optimistic, so the future is very hopeful. Yesterday, Xin Fengyonghao and general retail investors took advantage of the high price to close their positions, and only Tongkanghao slightly bought, so the price could not be supported and fell back by about half a yuan. In the afternoon, Tongkanghao and No. 5 still bought, and the price seemed firm. Then, because No. 64 and Lianhe sold more aggressively, it fell a little by two or three jiao, and people's hearts were still uncertain. Because Dingzhong did not open the day before, yesterday there were 5,000 transactions, so it also rose slightly by 6.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Other types all fell back by 5 jiao to 8 jiao. However, the future decline will not be too great. The total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. The comparison table of the results of the rise and fall is listed on the left:

Stock market transactions were extremely sparse. Only 50 shares of Dasheng No. 3 Factory stock were traded at 40.8 yuan. No other transactions.

Jardine Matheson and Reinsurance to Pay Dividends

The British Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd. (i.e., Old Dockyard) has recently decided by the board of directors to pay a final dividend of 8 yuan per share in national currency for last year (i.e., 1938) (according to the company's interim dividend of 3.5 yuan per share in national currency last year, the total annual dividend is 11.5 yuan). The par value of each share is 25 taels of silver, and the market price is around 105 yuan.

In addition, the British Jardine Engineering Corporation, Ltd. has also decided by the board of directors to pay a dividend on the company's 8% cumulative preference shares (par value of 5 taels of silver per share), including 1.5% of unpaid dividends from 1935, as well as dividends for the three years of 1936, 1937, and 1938. The company's ordinary shares (par value of 25 taels of silver per share, no dividends since 1933) will also pay a dividend of 0.35 yuan in national currency per share. The dividends of both companies will be paid after the shareholders' meeting on the 16th of this month.

### Forward: Amidst the Surge in Yarn Prices, the Destination of Cotton Cloth Increases Several Times, Today There is a Large Export of National Cloth

Due to the intensified rise in yarn and cotton prices in the market, local merchants have increased their stockpiling mentality, and current demand has increased several times. Market prices are soaring. Customers from Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui are continuously placing orders for white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill. They are focusing on the products of Chinese merchants Shenxin, Yong'an, and American merchants Qiahe cotton mills, so the sales of the above-mentioned factories are strong. Shenxin Fugui and Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth rose by 1 jiao per bolt in the morning, and then the banking industry purchased 4,000 bolts of Fugui brand on behalf of Yunnan merchants, and the market price suddenly jumped by another 1.5 jiao, causing various brands to increase prices, and the market was chaotic. The difference between the asking price and the actual transaction was 2-3 jiao. Yihua Jin Santa bleached cloth continued to be hoarded by customer merchants, raising the price by 1.5 jiao per bolt. Although the sales of coarse cloth were active, the stock was still abundant. Yihua goods were priced at the same level, and Shenxin Daniaohuo and various factories' 9-pound coarse cloth rose to 5-1 jiao, and transactions were still most active in Zhejiang East, Wenzhou, Yong, and Tai. Merchants from Wenzhou bought more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, and fine twill was dyed in Shanghai and shipped. The number of orders for dyed blanks, fine twill, fine cloth, and printed cloth on this street is still large, but due to the excessive market prices, only a few are being purchased.

Dong cloth

Because the dye factories on this street are still strong in demand, the sales of fine cloth and fine twill are firm. Transactions continued throughout the day at about 1,000 pieces. Merchants from Yantai and Qingdao in the north also added purchases. The price of Longtou, Feiyu, Caiqiu and other brands of fine cloth and various brands of fine twill rose because of more than 500 pieces. The market was more expensive. The market felt a higher resolve. Fine cloth prices all require more than 11 yuan, so apart from tightening the goods in hand, the industry is in a stalemate, and no orders have been heard.

Export

Today, there are 150 pieces of cloth sent to Shantou, 44 pieces to Hong Kong, 52 pieces to Haikou, 150 pieces to Haiphong, 430 pieces to Tianjin, 400 pieces to Yantai, 50 pieces to Weihaiwei, and 88 pieces to Quanzhou.

### Food: After Flour Prices Rise, Northern Sales Are More Difficult to Calculate, 30,000 Bags Exported Today

Yesterday's flour market customer sales were inferior. After the Northern merchants traded actively the previous day, they now have new foreign flour arriving in the local area. Although there is still a need for Shanghai flour, it is more difficult to calculate the transportation after the price increase, and the factory has no accommodation because the flour reserves are insufficient. The Nanyang merchants' appetite also tended to wait and see. The customer merchants traded only 14-15,000 bags, and there were 8,000 bags of retail sales on this street. Transactions were still dominated by No. 2 flour, and only a few No. 3 and below goods were traded. The prices of various goods were stable.

Today, there is a large export of flour, including 3,000 bags to Yantai, 15,000 bags to Tianjin, 3,100 bags to Weihaiwei, 3,000 bags from Hong Kong to Yantai, 1,700 bags from Hong Kong to Tianjin, 4,000 bags to Quanzhou, 2,000 bags to Yuhua, 500 bags to Xiuyu, and 2,000 bags to Shantou.

### Rumor That Jiangsu Province Prohibits Exports, Wheat Sellers Are Very Firm

Yesterday, the supply of wheat continued to be scarce, with 1,900 bags coming from Xingang. Prices in the northern Jiangsu area rose frequently, and it was rumored that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had banned exports, which further affected the source of goods. Therefore, people's minds were moving upward, and sellers were very firm. However, the factories purchased some wheat in the past few days, and foreign wheat will arrive soon, so the demand was also more slack. The overall market traded only 3,500 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Puzhen, and Wuhu, of which 2,000 bags were purchased by the Fuxin Factory and 1,500 bags by the Fufeng Factory. The market is gradually stabilizing.

### Gao Thin Rice is Selling Well, Customers Continue to Rise Close to Jiao, Japonica Rice

The market opened flat yesterday, and later it was seen that the source of goods was scarce again. Only three or four boats of He Xia goods and two or three thousand bags of car wheels arrived. People's minds turned firm, and Gao thin rice was selling well, and the situation was even tighter. At the same time, the local street and hoarders also successively moved to buy, and the market color turned from tired to beautiful. The prices of thick japonica rice immediately recovered several cents to one jiao, while thin rice rose by half to two jiao due to the shortage of goods. Foreign pointed rice was still popular and immediately rose by two jiao. Du Bu pointed rice and Bian Yuan were all good by one jiao. Yin Yuan was out of stock and had no market.

Customer

A new boat has already unloaded and displayed samples, and the rising trend could have been contained, but this tip has already seen a rise due to the scarcity of arrivals, and the customer's Xian and Gao top goods have also been seized by the cargo owners who are unwilling to lightly unload, so the Chongbu pointed tip opened at 10.06 yuan and the Gaojing Xian at 10.04 yuan were not sold successfully, and more than 1,000 bags were sold, mostly from Wuhu Xian, Zhenjiang and Nanjing at prices below 10 yuan to 9.56 yuan, and only a slight embellishment was seen. However, the general market price rose again by 4-5 cents to nearly 1 jiao. In the afternoon, 200 bags of Gao Wuhu Xian and Chong Nanjing Xian were sold, and the price rose to 10.05 yuan. As for the import and export situation, today 3,000 bags will be transferred from Hong Kong to Yantai, and 7,800 bags will also be transferred from Hong Kong to Tianjin.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Dregs Transported to the South, Yellow Soybeans Stable as Usual

Yellow soybeans still saw a continuous stream of customer sales yesterday, and the market was stable. However, the number of transactions was one-third less than the red plate. It is estimated that the Shantou and Xiamen merchants bought more than 500 bags of Chongmingsha yellow, and the Gangyue merchants bought more than 400 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans, and 50 bags of Haiyan Du soybeans, and the inland area only inquired about 200 bags of Nanjing soybeans.

Today, 350 bags of raw kernels are transported to Hong Kong, and 1,900 bags of soybeans are transported to Shantou, 1,740 bags to Hong Kong, 440 bags to Quanzhou, 120 bags to Dianhua, and 240 bags to Xiuyu.

In addition, the export of wheat bran today is estimated to be 4,000 bags to Quanzhou, 1,100 bags to Yuhua, 1,000 bags to Xiuyu, and 1,000 sentences to Shantou.

Yesterday, 1,900 bags of raw kernels came from Weihaiwei, 950 bags from Qingdao, and 250 bags of peanuts from Weihaiwei.

### Hardware: Narrow Strip Iron Trading is Lively

The import and export of narrow strip tinplate has been minimal recently, but yesterday the Jin-Yan merchants and the can factories on this street saw lively transactions. Although the market price has not been raised, it is much firmer than before. At the moment, the market is opening at 43 yuan for sinking goods, and single-hanging prices range from 40 yuan to 46.5 yuan, depending on the size. Yesterday, the market opened with more than 400 boxes of overseas pricing, at US$5.89 per box, and US$6.50 for large sizes. It is said that very few merchants are ordering the factory in Shanghai cannot be realized.

### Paper: Increased Consumption of Tin Foil in Winter, Setting up a Factory in Shanghai Cannot Be Realized

Tin foil belongs to the peak sales season in winter, and the population of Shanghai has increased this year, so the need is even greater. Therefore, foil merchants are going to Shanghai to purchase some tin, and foil is also being continuously transported to Shanghai. At present, all the top sellers have sold the original stocks, but some producers who intend to move to Shanghai to manufacture have not been able to proceed smoothly because the raw material paper, Luming paper, has been banned from export from the place of origin.

### Letter: A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce (5) China Cement Company

To the Editors,
I am writing in response to the commercial news column in your newspaper of December 27th of last year, which published "A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce". In the section on the cement industry, it stated that the China Cement Company in Nanjing is currently operating in cooperation with the Japanese Iwaki Cement Co., Ltd. After reading this, I was greatly surprised. After the retreat of the National Army, all the employees of our company's Longtan Factory were dismissed, and it was subsequently occupied by the Japanese army and personnel sent by Iwaki Cement Factory, which belongs to Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and they started manufacturing without permission. Our company has never heard of this, nor have we cooperated with them. The facts are true and cannot be fabricated. The sections in the report are clearly translated and have lost the truth. I am writing this special letter to inform you and hope that you will investigate and correct it so as not to confuse the audience. This is my sincere hope. Sincerely, China Cement Co., Ltd.

### Tan Tai (Collapse)

— Li Shi

"Tan Tai" means failure, but in the Shanghai population, it also contains the meaning of losing face, because "Tan Tai" is only the result, not the cause.

The reason for "Tan Tai" is mostly overestimating one's own strength. The actors on the stage jump and hop very hard, very vigorously, and deliberately want to get good reviews from the audience, but they forget or ignore that the stage structure is not stable and cannot bear excessive weight, resulting in a "Tan Tai" result, which is not only a theatrical failure, but also a disgrace to the troupe.

The "Tan Tai" of the Konoe Cabinet is also because Konoe ignored the reason for "Tan Tai", which led to this "Tan Tai" result. When he came to power, the country was already in a state of poverty, famine, and panic, but he had no way to save his country's misfortune, and only followed the warlords, thus deepening the internal crisis and incurring external accusations. Recently, due to the "Tan Tai" of political conspiracy, he had no choice but to submit his resignation and declare "Tan Tai".

The friends who have been "Tan Tai" sometimes realize the reason for "Tan Tai" after "Tan Tai", whether it is here or there, but because of "Tan Tai", they often have the morbid mentality of: "Anyway, it's already 'Tan Tai', so let's just 'Tan Tai' to the end." Therefore, I don't know how many friends who have been "Tan Tai" have ended up in an irretrievable state.

Konoe has "Tan Tai", but they have put forth a Hiranuma Kiichirō. The recent cause of Konoe's "Tan Tai" was the "Tan Tai" of political conspiracy, and Hiranuma Kiichirō certainly would not dare to try again. He is a so-called fascist figure, and his future policy will inevitably collude with the warlords even more, strengthen military aggression against China, and intensify provocative actions against the United States and Britain.

However, if the reason for "Tan Tai" cannot be eliminated, it is impossible to escape the tragic and shameful fate of "Tan Tai". If Hiranuma Kiichirō really wants to implement a fascist policy of aggression, we can predict in advance that this will only accelerate his "Tan Tai" fate!

### Free Discussion: A Tentative Exploration of Action Literature by Yang Jinhao
I call creations that contain the following three characteristics "action literature": (1) the internal theme is in line with the reality of the time, and is rich in educational, inspiring, and motivating meaning; (2) the form of expression is adapted to the conversational habits of the common people, and the style is simple and natural, and the wording is appropriate to the spoken language; (3) the main tool of dissemination relies on oral transmission, or is supplemented by action performances.

Before mankind had writing, there was such a thing as action literature; after writing, some of it was recorded, and some of it was first written and then broadcast, but there was still a lot that was circulating but not recorded.  The reason why they can circulate among the people is due to the aforementioned three characteristics, which can: (1) make the common people feel the need for them; (2) be most easily accepted by the common people at that time; (3) without going through the twists and turns of writing, they can obtain a stronger and more profound impression simply by relying on direct perception—hearing the sound of speech and seeing the image—especially for the illiterate.

This is the earliest form of literature and art of mankind, and it also belonged to the masses from the very beginning. Among them, those that are more permanent have been circulating; those that are more time-sensitive are gradually adapted or eliminated after the realistic situation or habitual spoken language changes. Later, writing was invented, and classes were divided in society, and cultural education gradually became the exclusive property of the wealthy in the upper class, so another branch was separated in literature and art: the internal theme gradually tended to praise achievements and virtues, and leisurely enjoyment; the form of expression adopted the style and words of the aristocracy; and the tool of dissemination especially focused on writing. After that, some of the action literature was distorted and used by them, while most of it was considered crude by the scholar-officials and excluded from the literary and artistic circles. Therefore, the so-called literature and art after that, even the masses who knew a few words could not or did not like to accept. What the masses at this time could and liked to enjoy were still some action literature circulating in the lower classes.

At present, when there is an enthusiastic demand for the popularization of literature and art, this kind of action literature is particularly worthy of our attention. Now, in addition to practicing popular writing and using new writing, we should indeed cherish and emphasize the power of action literature. This seems to be a lowering of the literary and artistic movement, but in reality, it is for the sake of universality and further improvement.

The action literature circulating among the people in our country today can be roughly divided into: (1) songs, such as mountain songs, ballads, a cappella, drums, etc.; (2) stories, such as storytelling, folk tales, reports told by pear syrup candy sellers in the countryside, etc.; (3) drum lyrics, such as storytelling, saying yinge (speaking of cause and effect), etc.; (4) drama, such as Peking opera, Kunqu opera, civilized drama, puppet shows, etc.; (5) monologues, such as ventriloquism, etc.; (6) street performances, such as playing flower drums, costume performances in festive divine meetings, etc. Among them, many have been intentionally or unintentionally used in the new literary and artistic movement, and a lot of works with new realistic features have been created through reform. In addition to newly created songs, drums, storytelling, Peking opera, etc., other things like dramas, talk shows, street dramas, broadcasting dramas similar to ventriloquism, and stories close to oral narration can all be said to be new developments in action literature. Puppet shows were once tried by Tao Jingsun, but they have not attracted the attention of the literary and artistic circles to this day. I hope that mass writers can unite with action literature performers to jointly study the content, style, and dissemination skills of action literature circulating among the people, criticize and eliminate the anesthetic, toxic, ancient, and clichéd components, and adapt or create new revolutionary, progressive, modern, and new works to disseminate them to the people in a practical way, so that action literature can have a higher elevation.

Since the advent of shadowgraphy and broadcasting, this kind of action literature has been further improved and developed. They not only have a rich literary and artistic education effect for the illiterate, but also have the same value for cultural people, because they can attach intuitive, vivid, and profound impressions. In the future, when the gramophone, movies, and wireless broadcasting and shadowgraphy are developed to the extreme, there will also be many valuable literary and artistic works, which will mainly not rely on writing to disseminate and develop their action, so that the people in the busy can conveniently enjoy the advanced action literature; and make the development of literature and art finally complete the three stages of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis." Naturally, this can only be achieved when a new society of national equality and happiness has been established, and the general level of culture has been promoted very high.

However, under the current conditions, in order to publicize the war of resistance and to improve the people's understanding, we still have to start by creating relatively low-level action literature and spreading it. And when creating, we should not only pay attention to the action nature of the tool—easy to spread by word of mouth and performance; but also pay attention to the action nature of the expression—suitable for the conversational habits of the people; and more importantly, pay attention to the action nature of the content—in line with reality and rich in education, encouragement, and motivating meaning; so that the people's response to them can be quickly seen in action!
An Ordinary Worker by Xu Qi

Rain and snow are falling lightly, it is the season near the winter solstice.

I abandoned my peaceful family, my beautiful fireplace, and drifted to the unfamiliar Tunxi.

There were three people in total, Wei and me, and a young Wang. He was a worker from a self-ignition factory, with a pale face from phosphorus poisoning and a thin figure. He joined our group so simply. Can came to see me once and said casually:

"There is a comrade in a pitiful situation, can you help?"

"Comrade?" I hesitated for a moment. It would really tighten my belt to keep someone.

"He's a very enthusiastic person! But he's so pitiful!" Can thought my pause was a sign of refusal, and he defended.

"Since he's a comrade, how can I not?" I said with a smile.

He came the next day. He was so thin, frail, and cold, with big eyes burning with passion. We shook hands and stood on the same line. Although we were so poor, almost like wandering monks, being subsidized by local agencies everywhere. In a small restaurant, we ate meals costing five cents a serving. This young Wang never had any sorrow. His pale face sometimes flushed unnaturally. He tapped his bowl and sang... "I am a worker! A worker from a self-ignition factory!"

Gradually, I became familiar with his personality. He could draw cartoons, his hemp-like fingers holding a thick brush. We often joked with him: "Skinny monkey! Why don't you climb onto the paper and do somersaults!"

Unexpectedly, he was actually a playwright. That was after we joined a certain mobile propaganda team. Once, he played a worker, using a self-ignition factory as the background. He used a high-pitched and mournful voice to give a speech to a group of workers struggling under the devil's hands. His passionate tears were deeply imprinted in the minds of this dark group.

His success made us so happy that when he returned to the backstage, his pale face was flushed red, and his eyes were like two torches, ready to make his whole body soar for justice.

At night, we slept in an old ancestral hall, the wind howling outside. He started to gasp for breath, his face turning from white to green.

Just as we were worried, he laughed abnormally.

"Damn it! Anyway, I've been poisoned by phosphorus, and eventually he was caught. He burst forth with the strength of life to resist, he shouted loudly: "Friends! Throw away the devil's tools in your hands, for the sake of the nation, we should no longer produce for people. Raise your fists, now is the time for us to save the country!"

Below the stage, the women stopped chatting, and the playful children stopped making noise. He was powerful, his words were very straightforward. He gasped and sang his favorite song with difficulty: "I am a worker! A worker from a self-ignition factory!" Tonight, his singing made us feel even more sad and melancholy, hinting at an expectation, a terrible expectation.

Friends walking on the same line, one by one, fell hard. Little Wang was also one of them, he retained a desolate and beautiful history.

Rain mixed with snow, falling lightly, the days are like an endlessly long winter. Should I be sad? No! Without resentment or sorrow, our hearts have stepped into spring, a bright and beautiful spring.
Temptation by Yang Yanqi

It is not easy to regenerate brilliance on a faded soul; if it does, it is a color dyed by others: black, red, yellow...

The dyeing brush is temptation. Holding the dyeing brush is a group of long-haired demons.

The first, the demon of temptation, that is, the angel of temptation, appears. Like Baudelaire said: "The curves of his body have the softness of ancient Bacchus; his large, sleepy eyes have a dark and blurred luster, like violets with rain; his half-open lips are like a hot stove emitting a strong fragrance." He comes, comes to the world, unties a belt around his waist, a brilliant snake, and places it on people's skulls. He gently breathes out a hot breath, as if saying: "I am the demon of lust, quickly fall asleep in the fragrant mist I spit out!"—And so, many people fall to the ground.

Then, a golden light flashed in the distance first, and slowly rolled over. Ah, it's a fat demon! He knocks on his big belly with a hard fist, emitting a long, sonorous sound; this sound spreads out and disappears into the muffled groans of countless people; he reveals his sharp teeth and laughs wildly, like the foolish laughter after being drunk; suddenly, he knocks on his big belly, letting the sound tell people: "My money can give you anything. Do you want it? Please kneel at my feet."--And so, many people fall to the ground.

Finally, another goblin comes.

He has a big horn, he can put your name in the horn and shout it, so that everyone in every corner of the world can hear it. He has a tall body, arrogant eyes, and an invisible and intangible mouth; he has a charming charm that will make you as flat as a glass mirror. However, this glass mirror needs the light of another lamp to shine; this other lamp is in his hand.

The area of the earth is not small, yes. But the lamp in his hand has only one light. He raises it high, shakes it, teases your heart, plucks your tendons, and says: "Do you want fame? If you do, then put the mirror in front of me, and fall your whole body on the glass."--And so, many people fall to the ground.

The demon of temptation, that is, the angel of temptation, strides across every place. His floating robe brushes people's souls. He has even sweeter saliva sprinkled on people's faces; that is sprinkling, it is intoxicating wine. People are drunk, but they still pretend to be sober, arguing: "I am not drunk!" Is that so? The demon laughs, haha, people have fallen into the trap. The demon of lust plucks at the belt; the demon of money knocks on his belly; the demon of fame flashes the light; people are all obediently kneeling.

A gust of wind, a ray of light, cannot blow away the mist, cannot illuminate the darkness. The world is full of temptations. Forever, forever...
A Brief Discussion of Dogs by Rong Hongping

"You dog!"

No matter where, the most common and easiest to hear insult is this sentence. Dogs, generally speaking, seem to be extremely despicable animals, and if someone is scolded as a dog, it is indeed an extremely shameful thing.

Therefore, those who become traitors, betray their conscience and fawn on foreigners, revealing their ugly state, have the share of being called a running dog!

In fact, is the nature of dogs necessarily shameful? On the contrary, most people's views on dogs are that they are indeed the most loyal and righteous animals. As long as you see the loyalty and service of the dogs they raise to their masters, that kind of selfless dedication, regardless of other issues, is indeed worthy of everyone's admiration.

However, dogs are ultimately not as good as humans. They lack "wisdom" and don't know how to choose their masters well. As long as they receive a little kindness—in fact, this kindness is not for their sake—regardless of how fierce and evil the master who raises them is, they will faithfully and righteously work for him, run errands, and serve him.

The nature of dogs is good, but because they lack wisdom, they often go into wrong actions. Therefore, real dogs are not shameful, what is shameful are the "shameless dogs among people." They turn their "clever" minds to "profit and desire," so they imitate the character of dogs, treat the enemy who killed their parents, children, brothers and sisters as their master and fawn on them with loyalty, these are shameless dogs.

Therefore, dogs themselves are not shameful. In particular, for the motherland, every citizen should be as loyal and hardworking as a dog is to its master!

Shameless dogs, get the hell out of here!
Go by Junbo

Friends! Please forgive my rudeness, I didn't say a word to you in front of you: "Go." But I quietly left you. Maybe this is the most unthinkable thing, you will laugh at me: You say: "Madman! Who told you to abandon the lingering scenery here, but put on a body of wind and frost."

Yes, friends, I am a madman, I always have a mad heart. I don't know what "enjoyment" is, but I understand that I should go.

Needless to say, that clear stream will tell you: I will use my slender shadow to cut through the barrier of that bunch of reeds, reflecting on the verdant water surface. I walk upright, with the trembling of my shadow on the stream. You go and ask the ripples on the water, they will tell you: The huge breath in my nostrils will excite their timid jumps. If you still don't believe it, you have to listen, the oriole on a pine tree will sing the melody of my heart that night.

I remember that night there were stars, reflecting the golden light of the sand and gravel under my shoes. My heavy footsteps will also startle a cluster of dark clouds to slip past. I walk with my head raised, that large piece of black brocade is covered on my face; I open my eyes wide, I see through the secrets of heaven. I said: "Heaven has the ease of prolonging life, not the joy of striving."

Friends! You should be crazy, crazy enough to be stupid, understanding should not be your share. Friends! You have to go, I won't tell you a lie, look, the light at the end of the road is shining with the hope of you and me.

New Year's Children's Play Picture

Entertainment Circle: A Southern Daughter from the North - Visiting the Talented Musician Lin Ming
She is the First Person in China to Successfully Play the Musical Saw
Also a Popular Figure in the Social and Musical Circles of Beiping

If you have been to Beiping, or paid a little attention to the local newspapers, then Miss Lin Ming, the most active figure in the social and musical circles, must be quite familiar to you.

After the fall of Beiping, the North Xiaoguang Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications, which had been taken over, still wanted her to broadcast. One day, the "Provisional Government" forced her to sing "New Folk Songs," so the brave her suddenly disappeared under the bold resistance.

The southern girl, of medium height, is not only quite beautiful, but speaks Beiping dialect so fluently, and is very eloquent, but on the contrary, she is so quiet. She said, "In China, using a saw as a musical instrument seems to be a new thing, but it is not necessarily common abroad. Its history is only ten years. It was first invented by an American worker, and now it is popular in the Soviet Union. Because of the beautiful tone, the violin is even threatened. Moreover, the saw is a household item with a low value and is very easy to play. This is a revolution in musical instruments. If it can be promoted well, it will be very beneficial to the promotion of mass music, so that music can penetrate into the people."

She placed the foreign steel saw flat on her knees, with the back of the blade facing outward, her left hand holding the tip of the blade, and her right hand raising the violin bow, gently playing. She played a new song "My Own" by Diana Doping, and then played the record together with the gramophone, playing "Change Paryners" sung by Qin You Luojison and Fulei Yastan. The sound was so beautiful and mellow. Although I am used to listening to the performances of various famous artists in the movie, her talent and her brilliance will make that group of mediocre musicians pale in comparison.

She is only in her early twenties this year. She went to Beiping from Guangzhou when she was three years old. She has always liked music, Pixa Na, Gita, accordion, violin, harmonica, etc. When the world music giant Russian Qierping arrived in Beiping, he was very surprised by her talent. At that time, their photos were published in various newspapers, which became a beautiful story for a time.

In Beiping, after she graduated from the music department of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the "Harmony Harmonica Society," which was famous throughout the north, was the group she founded and led. Of course, her history is quite glorious. Knowing that she fled to Shanghai in order to fight for the personality of the artists, this spirit is worthy of our respect.

Now, I heard that the Youth Association has invited her to open a class to teach saw music. This is a very good news. With this talented artist in the "isolated island," perhaps the music scene will no longer be lonely from now on?

(Bing Du) Miss Lin's expression when performing in Qingdao
Recent News Record by Xin Shi

The film troupe, Bai Yang, Wang Xianzai and others, a group of thirty-eight people, left Shanghai for Sichuan at the end of last winter and performed dramas in Chongqing, Chengdu and other places for a long time. Local gentlemen and ladies often took the arrival of the Shanghai movie stars for the first time and competed to see the true face of Mount Lu; for this reason, they performed various plays and often sold out, receiving a warm welcome. The film people gained both fame and fortune, and therefore also had many happy harvests. Later, internal opinions arose, and the troupe split. Bai Yang and others were immediately hired by the Central Photography Studio to work on filming. Wang Xianzai, Jianong, Sun Min, Xie Yunqing and others then formed another troupe and continued to perform in various places, continuing their wandering life. Two months ago, the entire troupe arrived in Kunming, and the performance record was not bad at first. However, because they had been away from Shanghai for a long time, they were homesick; everyone was tired of traveling and wanted to return home, and had already made plans to return early. Now Gong Jianong and Sun Min have first taken a boat from Haiphong to Hong Kong, and arrived in Shen yesterday. The rest of the Wang Xi and others, because of contractual relations, will not be able to return together until two months later.

The Yan Sisters Return from the Island

Due to environmental reasons, Yan Yuexian, after the outbreak of the war, went the same way with actresses such as Ye Qiuxin, Yuan Shaomei, Li Hong, and Ning Xuan, and changed her career to become a dance hostess. She first belonged to the Metropolitan Dance Hall and officially entered the industry. Then she and one of her sisters went south together and were hired by the Hong Kong Guotai Dance Hall. The local dancers were shocked by the great names of the movie stars and competed to dance with them; therefore, the business was very good, enough to match the Liang sisters Sai Zhen and Sai Shan in the same dance hall. However, since the sudden outbreak of war in South China, the dance market suddenly plummeted, and it was no longer what it used to be. The Liang sisters planned to return to their hometown and go to Singapore to "dig for gold"; Yan Yuexian and her two sisters also arrived in Shanghai by boat a few days ago, and plan to take a short break.

Xiao Ying Makes a Guest Appearance in "The Film City Chronicle"

After Xiao Ying withdrew from the Mingxing Film Company, he established a candy store in Jianye Lane, Fuli Li Road, West Shanghai—named "Jianye Store." He was an old hand in this business, and had been focusing on management for many years, and the business was booming and quite profitable. Therefore, he was tired of working on the screen and had no intention of it for a long time. Recently, Yihua Pictures is producing "The Film City Chronicle," a film with a photography studio as the background, and specially invited Xiao Ying to make a guest appearance as the "Production Director"; Xiao Ying could not refuse the friendship, and it happened to be his fiftieth birthday this year, so he might as well leave a souvenir on the screen for himself. Therefore, he readily agreed and was happy to do so. And this veteran of the silver screen, who had been in retirement for several years, returned to the camera again and spent his old life under the silver lamp.
New Year's Talk on Hong Jingxi (Part 2) by Chang

The first period is when Yu Nu hears a voice outside, comes out and sees Mo Ji, and feels pity. At this time, she should make a naive and innocent little girl's expression, but it should not be too frivolous. When Jin Song returns home and learns that Mo Ji is a scholar, and has a love for him, it is the second period. At this time, the performance should be charming and clever, with the expression of a daughter admiring a young man, but it must not be made into a lewd state, and it is not flirting. From the time of marriage until Mo Ji passes the examination, it is the third period. During this period, she must be generous, dignified, and emphasize the smugness of the young couple after their wedding. In particular, she must reveal her ambition and determination to move forward.

When explaining to Father Jin that she wants to go with him to take the examination, she must make an emotional attitude. When listening to the news that her husband has passed the examination, she must make an extremely smug expression. The section from when Mo Ji changes his mind to pushing the boat can be regarded as the fourth period. This period is closely linked to the second period. From the extreme smugness at the end of the third period, it suddenly turns into great disappointment in this period. This is the time when the whole play can best grab people's hearts. The performance should slowly change, first with suspicion, then sadness, and finally realizing Mo's change of heart, before showing a disappointed expression. In this scene, both Father Jin and Mo Ji must also be very brilliant in order to make the tense atmosphere in the whole audience thicker. In particular, when Mo Ji suddenly changes his attitude, the father and daughter should make a distressed expression with different moods. Yu Nu must have a kind of spirit of pitying her old father on the one hand, and still trying to protect her husband on the other hand, so that she can completely depict the innocent and affectionate nature of a woman. In the boat pushing scene, because Mo had already had a poisonous plan, he was of course very affectionate to Yu Nu on the surface. At this time, Yu Nu should make a kind of relaxed attitude, and seeing that her husband is still affectionate, she will dispel the idea of disappointment and rekindle her pure love. Therefore, she is obedient to her husband in every way and does not doubt him at all, thus falling into his trap. From the time she is rescued until the reunion, it is the last period. In this period, this reunion scene is indispensable for a happy ending, but from the artistic standpoint, Yu Nu has nothing to do at this time. So to speak of the whole play, of course, the scenes of saving Mo, taking the examination, the sudden change, and pushing the boat are the most brilliant. The star of this play must not be careless in these four scenes. The performance in the first scene is so lively and so innocent, and never reveals a frivolous expression. And her best performance is in the two scenes of taking the examination and the sudden change. Before taking the examination, when the young couple explained to Father Jin, they wanted to say it but couldn't, and they couldn't help but say it. The energy, he really did it extremely realistically, with veins and very emotional. When Mo Ji passed the examination, he listened to the news report on the side, with a smug face and a happy heart, which could be fully conveyed. Suddenly, Mo Ji put on airs, and the old man got a nose full of ash. At that time, all kinds of feelings were mixed together, comforting the old father on the one hand, and suspecting the situation of her husband on the other hand, he was able to completely depict it thoroughly, with no gaps to take advantage of. The performance of this play can be said to be unique and unprecedented. It is a pity that his appearance is not as charming as Xun Huisheng, and the white mouth is not as sharp as Xiao Cuihua, otherwise it can be said to be a masterpiece. I have never been one to flatter people, so gentlemen, please don't suspect that I am flattering Zhu Cuixin. If we talk about art, I dare say that my is correct. If you don't believe it, wait until you have the opportunity to take a look, and you will understand.
The Art of Mrs. Cao Bingsheng by Mei Chang

Mrs. Cao Bingsheng performed "Fishing and Killing the Family," a famous play, to help the Cunde Middle School raise funds for acting. Her art is exquisite and has reached the realm of perfection. And her voice is also round and mellow, and the audience praised her. The famous painter Ma Gongyu immediately composed four poems and posted them, and I have recorded two of them below: The superb skills of the Mei family are as cheap as Jin Feng, and the Wu boat is fishing in a hazy dream; the golden elixir has washed away the laws of ordinary people, and the great salary is the first work of this man. The celestial Sanskrit music has been silent for a long time, and this is the beautiful sound of the world; a performance of the harmonica dissipates the chivalrous spirit, and the rivers and mountains still have untamed hearts.
Cao's Wife's "Si Lang Visits His Mother": A Long-term Listening Song Record by Jiu Er Ma Zi

The Shanghai theater world is competing to perform this play. Hooking up and fighting, calling on the audience. Only wanting to hear the sound of selling horses in an empty city. It is really as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Not much to see. The old drama is declining. The sorrow is very deep. I have recently enjoyed going to small theaters. Because the consumption is not much, it can send away my troubles. And there are indeed talented people in this, enough to attract people. Such as Le Di's Sheng, and Zhou Meiyan's Dan, are all leaders in this. My old friends Shu Han and Yifang and others are very praising Zhou Meiyan, spare no effort. I am happy to see this. On this day, I specially accompanied my two brothers, Fuhai and Zhendong, to buy tickets to enter. At that time, Baochan was sending wine on stage. Meiyan played Baochan. Her appearance was beautiful. Her figure was exquisite. Her smile and double dimples were intoxicating. Her eyes were expressive. It could fascinate Yangcheng and bewitch Xia Cai. When teasing Xue Ke, her kind of infatuation and honesty were portrayed very well. It was penetrating. The delicate style was full of highlights. Gai's performance is better than Bai's. Bai is good at singing, but her throat is limited by her talent. There is no need to hide it for her. But sometimes it is quite melodious and pleasant. She is especially good at performing love affairs. Such as "Hongluan Xi", "Playing the Flower Drum", "Cuiping Mountain", "Meilong Town", "Wulongyuan" and other plays. If she can not pursue false fame and devote herself to singing, and study hard in art, she will surely enjoy great fame in the future. We should wait and see. Gui Yunfeng played Xue Ke. His singing and acting were fairly stable. However, the expression on his face was too depressed, which inevitably reduced the color. Yunfeng originally practiced martial arts. Twenty years ago, he and Zhao Ziyun and Thirteen Dan sang together at the time—but now he has changed his tune. I don't know why. The main play was Le Di's full-length "Empty City Stratagem". The four sentences of the introduction when Daizhan Miu came on stage were melodious and had a long-lasting charm. The melody was clear and the tone was pleasant, resounding through the sky. If it were not for abundant talent, it would be difficult to be so competent and happy. The high notes were sharp, very similar to Gao Qingkui. The slow board of the first section of the city tower was modulated and melodious, sweet and natural. The section "Baoding Qiankun" still followed the singing method of the predecessors. The melody was sometimes clever and liked to take another path. It was full of thrills. Suddenly, he reined in at the edge of the cliff, and suddenly he was safe as if walking on smooth ground. It was unpredictable. Although it felt difficult, it was not a big faction after all. The later section of Er Liu was completed in one breath, like pearls rolling on a jade plate, each one could be counted. When he was beheading Cao, he still had enough courage to spare. When interrogating Ma Cao, he read the word (Shan) for the three cities lost by Ma Cao, which seemed to be improved. When he was promoted to the account and beheading Cao, the body movements and steps should be from slow to fast, with three different steps. He failed to fully develop it, which was not without regret. In short, as a Kunling who had just emerged, she was able to achieve such results in singing and acting. I am very gratified. How can I bear to criticize her and seek perfection? But I love her deeply, and I can't help but speak frankly. That night, the famous ticket Chen Jingtang also watched the play in the same seat. He praised Le Di's singing voice for being clear and melodious. He said that he especially liked to watch her Xipi opera, such as "Beheading the Son", "Beheading the Robe", "Visiting the Mother" and other plays. I also agree. Under the supervision of his father, Qiu Yuexiang, he will guide her step by step and make her strive for progress. If she does not take the wrong path, it will not be difficult for her to become a tool and stand on an equal footing with her sister Meng Xiaodong in the future. I have recorded my feelings to encourage her.
(Moving Rewards to Help the Disaster) The Secret History of the Palace Gates of the Old Capital by Xu Muyun

The wonderful way to eavesdrop on Uncle Yan's practice singing

Because he cherished his Faqu, he was afraid that others would eavesdrop, so he often did not start practicing singing until after 2:00 am. His usual habit was that the more he sang, the brighter his voice became. Sometimes he could not make a bright sound unless he practiced singing for a long time after a play. Therefore, there were generally Yu fans who spent money to transport the servants who looked after him to the door. Whenever it was almost time to practice singing, these people hid in the gatehouse of the Yu family and enjoyed their addiction to the play. Fortunately, the night was quiet and deep, and there was no sound in the thousands of boxes. Every word could be heard exceptionally clearly, which was more enjoyable than buying a ticket seat for a few dollars in the restaurant. But after a long time, Uncle Yan found out. Before practicing singing, he would inspect the gatehouse himself, lock the big bucket, and hand the key to the main room. He thought that no one could steal the play. Who knew that these people had a more wonderful way. This one was to take turns eavesdropping on the phone. The Yu residence's phone was installed in the gatehouse, and a branch was dialed to the outside of the main room. The servants and the old women colluded to cheat. As long as the house sang, she would hang up the branch. So the phone could still be used to eavesdrop.

The Copper Hammer in "Second Entry into the Palace" and the Wellhead in "Changbanpo"

Many relics and ruins of ancient heroes in China have been lost among the people and no one has collected and preserved them. Guo Ziyi was the first great man and strange person in our country since ancient times to be a general and a minister. Moreover, the four words "Fu Lu Shou Kao" are very complete. His only secret is that the higher the title, the smaller the courage, the more things to do, the more careful the heart, and his spirit of success and retirement is even more difficult for people to reach. Therefore, this article specially wrote about the news of the excavation of his precious sword, also in order to attract social attention. In the future, if someone can create a theater museum, they can put this kind of historical thing on display, so that people can have a feeling of cherishing the memory of the person when they see the relics of these great heroes. It not only arouses admiration and admiration, but also takes him as a model figure, which is also helpful to the guidance and promotion of social education.

Chen Yujun's Retrospect in Nanjing and Weng Hongsheng's Love of the Passionate Recollections of Qinhuai 2

A few days ago, I read in this magazine the news that Chen Yujun came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Recalling the high life of living in Xiangdao, I really have the sigh of "it is not easy to live in a big city"! Yujun has now traveled from the occupied area to the isolated island, and I believe she has the same feeling.

Yujun sings Green Shirt, is good at Chengqiang, and has performed in the Liangxia area, and has a good reputation. Later, she heard that the new capital was full of crowns and clouds, and she admired it. So she took her skills to Qinhuai and lived in the Quan'an Hotel. She sang in the Jin'an Qingchang Society and hung her head card. At that time, there were few Qinhuai singers who imitated Yu Shuang's new tone, so many people supported her, and she was particularly popular; and she won the title of Queen of the singing world. At that time, a certain hospital had a "Earsmooth" secretary who was almost "60 years old" and supported her the most. Every Saturday night, no matter the wind or rain, he would definitely come to the scene to report a huge number of Wanzis (Wanzis is the secret code for ordering plays in the singing scene). Later, Yujun said to people that this old man was her dry father.

Yujun has always performed on the red carpet, so when she comes on stage to sing Qingchang, every word and every sentence reveals expression between her eyebrows and eyes. In particular, when she

### "School Shops" Lowering Prices

— Huai

"School shop" is a new kind of industry that emerged in Shanghai after it became an isolated island. We only need to consider the literal meaning of the term to easily understand that the "school shop bosses," while nominally "engaged in learning," are actually focused on "profit-making." However, since "learning" has become a "shop" and there are many competitors in the same industry, how to attract customers (students)? They have no choice but to resort to "major price cuts" like businesses do.

But "school shops" are ultimately different from ordinary commercial establishments, and cannot openly flaunt slogans like "regardless of losses" or "small profits, large sales." Even if they want people to believe in "genuine goods at fair prices," they have to use other advertising techniques to touch people's hearts. Perhaps this is the "suffering of school shop bosses"? Now, as the end of the year approaches, each "shop" is about to enroll students, so there must be a "business competition," and strange phenomena are constantly occurring. In summary, there are the following four types:

Advertising and Promotion

Publishing huge enrollment advertisements to cater to the psychology of city dwellers, filling them with good words like "centrally located, convenient transportation," "spacious campus, fresh air," "simple academic style, serious instruction," "low tuition, caring for the poor," regardless of whether they match the facts or not. It's best to add a few "free quotas" and stipulate some "scholarships" to broadly attract students. Enrollment notices outside the school gate should be made as large as possible; enrollment leaflets on the road should be posted as densely as possible, so that everyone's mind has this "school shop" brand.

Street Canvassing

Posting a free notice in the recruitment section of various newspapers, saying that they want to recruit a certain number of staff, with generous rewards. Naturally, at a time when unemployment is rampant, many people will come to the "shop" to inquire. At that time, they will first promote their "school shop" to the applicants, explaining how fulfilling the content is, how cheap the tuition is, and finally, stating their method: "Introduce one student, reward two yuan," and instructing these canvassers to go out and collect students everywhere. Or, when recruiting teachers, adding the additional condition that they must introduce a certain number of students to broadly gather students.

Reducing Tuition Fees

Some "school shops" see that the residents in this "gilded city" are not all wealthy elders who are well-fed and clothed, and that choosing schools with cheaper fees for their children to attend is, of course, reasonable. The "school shop bosses" have accurately grasped the weaknesses of the parents, so they call for reduced tuition fees. Sure enough, the fees paid at the time of enrollment are cheaper than elsewhere. Who knew that after enrollment, one "extra tax" after another would come? What national book fee, material fee, experiment fee, entertainment fee... anything that can be named is added one by one. As a result, the cheaper tuition fees are not enough to compensate for these miscellaneous fees. Because in Shanghai, you can get rich by charging everyone a small amount. The "school shop bosses" probably hold the same view?

Buy Three, Get One Free

Some "school shops" only require students to introduce three or five new classmates to the school, and they themselves can be free of charge or enjoy other preferential treatment, such as reduced fees or exemptions. This is said to be very effective, because who doesn't want to take advantage? What's more, if you have the ability to attract new students, you will also receive a commendation from the "school shop boss" and be looked at with special regard, so once the method is launched, everyone will do their best. Some even encourage students in their own schools to lure students from nearby schools to transfer to their own "shop," resulting in conflicts that even lead to court appearances.

In short, strange things happen every year, but not as many as this year. At this time when the winter vacation is approaching, each "school shop" is of course planning novel "major price cut" methods to broadly gather students. This article is written to provide parents with reference. But what the author must solemnly declare at the end is that those who genuinely aim to run schools are not among the "school shops," otherwise I would have unfairly slandered those who put in painstaking efforts.

Editor's Note: Education on the isolated island has become chaotic, which is indeed unavoidable. However, it is undeniable that there are also good "schools." Therefore, Mr. You also stated in his article that those who genuinely run schools are not among the school shops. It is hoped that those who genuinely run schools will not be discouraged by this article.

### Amorous Ghost

— Li Zhihua

Produced by Guohua Film Company, Premiering at Jincheng Grand Theater

The premiere of "Amorous Ghost" cannot help but remind us of the "Declaration to the Shanghai Film Industry." The filming of "Amorous Ghost" was before the declaration, but the premiere of "Amorous Ghost" was after the declaration was issued. "What is past cannot be undone." From a human perspective, this "exceptional" work should be "retained in position to observe its future performance." For the first work of Guohua Film Company, which was established in the midst of difficulties, we should "deal with it leniently."

Naturally, we should not forget what kind of objective effects this film will have. This is completely unrelated to the year of production and the first product of a new company. However, what is gratifying is that since the "Declaration to the Shanghai Film Industry" was issued, the authorities of each company have very sincerely and frankly stated that they will never make such films again in the future. Even "Amorous Ghost," according to reliable information we have obtained, has been automatically revised by the company. For example, Yun Yun's suicide scene and the appearance of ghosts were said to be real before, but now they have become dreams. Revision is not the best way, and a few subtitles and lines are by no means a panacea for "resurrection," but what is admirable is the resolute and decisive courage to "accept good advice." From this point, it is also a solid guarantee for the future of new Chinese films! We regret the release of "Amorous Ghost," but we are very moved by the brave and sincere performance of the Guohua Film Company authorities and the film's staff, and we cannot help but express our respect to them.

Because of the revisions before the premiere, because of that great wisdom and courage, we have to look at "Amorous Ghost" with different eyes. Although the change from real ghosts to dreams seems to be only a hundred steps versus fifty steps, it contains absolutely different meanings. Chinese cinema is not just one "Amorous Ghost," and even Guohua's productions will never be just this one "Amorous Ghost." So, from the perspective of the entire history of Chinese film development, what a heartening phenomenon this will be!

And looking at the revised "Amorous Ghost" alone, although there is still the mistake of building the focus on ghosts and monsters, looking at the first half of the play, it still has its merits in exposing the darkness of the city and truly reflecting the step-by-step thorns of the abyss of crime in Shanghai. That kind of trap called a pleasure den, those who have lived in Shanghai for a little longer, even if they have not experienced it personally, must have heard of it. Grasping the most intimate lives around the citizens, diversifying and guiding them, the effect and merit of this is many times greater than just performing something that the citizens are not familiar with. When watching "Amorous Ghost," I heard with my own ears two or three housewives behind me sighing for Yun Yun in the play. I feel that no matter how difficult the environment is, if some dramas are formed by selecting some of their nearby lives and enlightening them correctly, it may not be a viable path for "isolated island movies" (please forgive me for coining such a term).

In terms of directing techniques, Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu (according to the "rumors" we have obtained, this play is largely the responsibility of Zheng Xiaoqiu, I don't know if it is true?) is "honest." Its advantage is that it "explains things clearly," and its weakness is that it is not flexible enough.

The actors are all very hardworking. But for an actor to make a deep impression on the audience, acting skills are of course important, but what kind of film he is acting in is even more important. In our memory, how many actors in how many dramas can we never forget? And what are the dramas that we remember? Film is a comprehensive, collective art. As an important component, actors, in addition to cultivating their acting skills, should also pay attention to things outside of acting in order to fulfill their duties.

Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, Wang Jiting, Cai Jin, Zhou Qi, and Xu Li, either have a long history on the screen, or are rising stars. They all have a bright future, and I hope they will work hard for their own future! And inevitably, the winning of this bright future must be determined by how much effort they put into film, "the most powerful weapon of education."

### Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes Freedom Village, Twin Daughters Pay Respects at Martyrs' Tomb

Because the enemy soldiers saw someone coming to attack, they blindly and randomly shook the machine guns. Zhu Laoyuan rushed up fearlessly, and several machine gun bullets pierced his body. By the time his subordinate youths rescued him, he had already become a bloody mess. Fortunately, none of the hits were vital, but his left arm was hit by two bullets. As a result, this arm had to be amputated. This is the reason why Zhu Laoyuan became one-armed. After the war was settled, the former village was long gone, so they organized a new village, which was called Freedom Village. Since Zhu Laoyuan had his arm amputated, he certainly could no longer fight, but when he came out of the hospital, he did not consider himself disabled. He said: I was originally a farmer, so I will still do the planting. But Zhu Laoyuan was injured in the War of Resistance, and everyone admired him, and his friendships were extensive, not limited to the people in the previous village. Knowing that he was originally from a farming background and that he is still engaged in agriculture, the local government and village council both came to help him, so the agricultural affairs of Freedom Village are also extremely developed. Originally, Zhu Laoyuan's family was also extremely simple. He originally had a son, who died in his thirties. Only a widow daughter-in-law and a granddaughter were left, and there were no grandsons. That daughter-in-law was also the daughter of a farming family, and was in fact Zhu Laoyuan's niece. After his son died, Zhu Laoyuan allowed her to remarry. But she refused to remarry. The more rural people are, the more they uphold the old etiquette. In fact, Zhu Laoyuan's family still has a few acres of private land, enough to make a living. She was unwilling to abandon the lonely old man, who was both her grandfather and uncle, and could not bear to let the only daughter left by her late husband suffer in another person's home. Zhu Laoyuan was naturally willing to see that his daughter-in-law was unwilling to remarry, and he also loved this precious granddaughter very much. But when the war broke out, when everyone was fleeing for their lives, Zhu Laoyuan recognized a female doctor in the church of a large town ten miles from Zacu. He said: "I'm giving this girl to you. Because I have already devoted myself to the country, and I may be shot dead with one shot. These children who can live are still alive. These children will be the future talents of China's rejuvenation. Please take them in and nurture them well. It is best to teach her a skill so that she will have a career in the future. If I don't die, I will still have an old life left. She will be considered my granddaughter. Otherwise, the child will be considered publicly raised." (6)

### The People Who Collect Scraps

"Collecting scraps" is a line of work outside of the 360 lines of work. This pitiful group mostly comes from far north of the Yangtze River. Under the pressure of the whip of life, they have no choice but to rely on this industry to maintain their lives.

When the sky is still gloomy, the scrap collectors have already started their activities; they carry a bamboo basket for holding scraps on their backs, and hold a pair of iron tongs for picking up scraps, going to the garbage cans in the alleys to find their targets, such as broken glass, rags, old tin cans, etc.; as for the disgusting garbage smell, they don't care about it in their nostrils.

It is pitiful to say that when they accidentally find a tattered piece of clothing or a broken foreign bottle at the garbage can at the same time, they will immediately fight for it. If it is not resolved satisfactorily, they will immediately grab each other and have a "full martial arts performance." As a result, they are beaten until their skin is broken and bleeding, while their targets are picked up by another companion.

It is said that there are about 12,000 people in the city who do this business. The price they get for selling a full basket to a scrap collection shop is about two or three hundred cash. Earning five or six hundred cash a day is considered lucky.

The most pitiful thing is that recently, some of the larger alleys on the isolated island have hired patrolmen to guard them, and scrap collectors are absolutely prohibited from entering. Therefore, the locations where they look for targets have been greatly reduced, and they have to risk going to several places such as Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao.

Naturally, it is very easy to pick up a large basket of scrap copper and iron in these places, but if they are not careful, they will often suffer unprovoked disasters, that is, the explosion of explosives left in the rubble fields. However, in order to have a meal that does not fill their stomachs three times a day, they have to resort to this inferior plan.

In short, this line of work outside of the 360 lines of work—the people who collect scraps—struggle in the dark circle, and few people care about their suffering!
