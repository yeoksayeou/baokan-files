### British Troops Advance to the Front, Germany Reinforces: Western Front War Imminent; British Fleet Can Ensure Maritime Hegemony; German Side Claims Continued Progress in Military Operations Against Poland

Paris - According to today's news, British troops have advanced to the front to reinforce French forces. A major battle on the Western Front is expected within 48 hours. Further news from the front indicates that French troops have penetrated seven or eight miles into German territory. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Paris - The Intelligence Office has announced that British land forces are steadily arriving in France to join our troops in combat. However, the exact number of British troops and their deployment locations will not be disclosed. "In any case, the assistance Britain can provide to our country is far more important than in 1914. At that time, German naval power was strong, and there were doubts about Britain's ability to maintain maritime hegemony. Now, that is no longer an issue." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Paris - It is reported that Germany, facing a concentration of French troops on the Western Front and preparing for a large-scale offensive, is urgently deploying reinforcements to the Western Front. According to recent French war reports, the enemy is reinforcing its lines between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, with new troops coming from the German interior. French newspapers offer little comment on the Western Front, stating that significant results should not be expected in the early stages of the war, as trench warfare has just begun. They also state that the main war is currently taking place west of Strasbourg, between the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, which are only a few kilometers apart. It is reported that the Germans have begun defensive works on the Siegfried Line. As for the Polish front, Polish troops are retreating to pre-prepared positions, preparing for a counter-offensive. Germany has not only failed to achieve a decisive victory but feels that the deeper it goes, the greater the difficulties become. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Paris - Yesterday, the French-German border saw artillery battles throughout the day. French troops advanced through the German machine-gun nests in the forests toward Saarbrucken. According to news from the front last night, the German Carlsbrunn battery between Saarbrucken and Saarlautern was the area of heaviest fighting. Six hundred French tanks charged several miles into the German lines, and French troops subsequently occupied several mountain ridges. The French then used heavy artillery to attack strategic locations on roads and railways. The roads and railways between Saarbrucken and Saarlautern are all under fire, making German resupply difficult. As German reinforcements arrived at the border, trying to stop the French from entering the Saar region, the senior commanders of the British and French forces prepared to move the majority of the British troops who had already landed in France to the front. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Paris - After six divisions of the German army were transferred to the Western Front, they were attacked by French forces today. According to reports from the front, the German army is now actively counter-attacking, while the French are defending with 70-ton tanks equipped with 75mm guns. The French aim to advance on the German city of Neunkirchen. Heavy artillery battles raged last night. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Paris - This morning, French newspapers reported that the French army was making good progress against German positions in front of the Siegfried Line. Le Journal de Paris reported that the German army is currently holding strong positions in front of the Siegfried Line, and the French army is continuing to advance and put pressure on them. At the same time, the French air force is conducting reconnaissance flights, taking photographs of all enemy defenses. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Berlin - German high command issued a war report stating that German forces are now 50 kilometers from Warsaw. German forces in the southwest have reached a point 60 kilometers from the city. German forces advancing south of Warsaw in the mountains are 30 kilometers from Radom, an important transportation hub. Capturing this town would allow a direct advance on Warsaw. To the north of Warsaw, German forces have crossed the Narew River, a tributary of the Vistula River. Before the World War, the Russians had built strong defenses along this river.

### British Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons; Air Force Bombs German Ports; At Least One German Pocket Battleship Hit; London's Air Defense Organization Strives for Perfection

London - Today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a statement to the House of Commons on the current state of the war, described in detail the British Air Force's air raid on the Wilhelmshaven naval port. He said that the British Air Force carried out a very brave attack on German ships outside the port. One of the German so-called pocket battleships was hit by at least two bombs. The British Air Force's targets were the two major naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and the Kiel estuary, both of which are heavily defended by Germany. However, despite the strong defenses, the British Air Force attacked them, and their brave spirit is highly commendable. The weather was poor that afternoon, and visibility was extremely poor. The final stage of the British Air Force's attack took place in heavy rain. Achieving the objectives of the attack in such weather required highly skilled pilots. The fact that the British Air Force was able to hit the enemy's large battleships shows its ability to attack strong enemy positions under very difficult circumstances. One more thing must be mentioned: most of those who participated in this operation had enlisted and received considerable training since the expansion of the British Air Force, including some from overseas dominions.

After the Prime Minister detailed the air raid, the leader of the two parties, Greenwood, said that if the report on the destruction of the German warship had been released that day, it would have further boosted the morale of the British people. The Prime Minister replied that he did not want to release any information until the facts had been verified, but that he would improve in the future after gaining this experience. Greenwood said that regardless of whether the news was good or bad, the Prime Minister should inform the people of the war news as soon as possible.

The Prime Minister continued that the British Air Force's bomber squadrons had carried out extensive reconnaissance flights over German skies for three consecutive nights last week, dropping more than ten million leaflets addressed to the German people throughout western and northern Germany, including the Ruhr. Although the enemy's defense equipment was fully activated each time, no enemy fighters were encountered, and the British planes returned safely to their original defenses. The British fighter squadrons and coastal patrol squadrons are also very active. The fighter squadrons have been stationed from the beginning and are always prepared. Coastal patrol squadrons are also engaged in reconnaissance in the nearby sea in order to discover and destroy German submarines.

The Prime Minister continued that we now know that in the struggle to protect freedom and make life worthwhile, we can rely on the assistance of the overseas parts of the British Empire. The dominions, of their own free will, driven by the moral force of upholding justice, have not been subjected to any coercion. They have successively declared their willingness to cooperate with the British government to defend the principles that they and the British people value equally.

After detailing the circumstances of the British ship "Athenia" being sunk by a German submarine without warning, the Prime Minister said that in addition to the "Athenia", other merchant ships had also been sunk by German submarines. In total, there have been about three ships. The British Admiralty has immediately taken measures to deal with the situation. British destroyers and other ships are now very active, and a large number of anti-submarine warships and escort ships are being rapidly deployed. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently stated to the House of Commons that he is trying to establish a merchant ship escort system as soon as possible. This type of protection method, of course, cannot be implemented before the declaration of war, and it takes time to arrange everything. However, the House of Commons can be satisfied that this measure is being actively pursued at the greatest possible speed. To date, most of the British ships attacked by German submarines had already set sail before the outbreak of the war. The British defense organization, of course, cannot immediately provide them with adequate protection. Although there will inevitably be some losses to shipping each week, we must not underestimate the threat to shipping. However, what the House of Commons and the people can take comfort in is that the British Navy, with its wartime experience in dealing with this problem, and its recent inventions to detect and destroy submarines, will be able to control this problem.

The Prime Minister concluded by saying that he must say something about the domestic defense organization, which is now being rapidly completed. Local organizations are now performing their duties, but rural areas still feel the lack of those who can serve full-time. The implementation of the blackout is quite satisfactory. Air Force reconnaissance every night can detect whether lights are leaking, and offenders can be punished. The government decided on Thursday of last week to implement the plan to evacuate schoolchildren and women and children, and it has now been completed. Not only large cities, but also other areas that may be subject to air raids, have followed suit. A total of 1,475,000 women and children have been evacuated to the countryside. Schools will be reopened in the countryside as soon as possible. Local authorities are now busy dealing with how to take care of the well-being of children and generously assist families who have taken in the evacuated women and children.

Today, more than 200,000 hospital beds have been prepared to treat those injured in air raids. Auxiliary nurses have joined the Civil Nursing Reserve to serve in hospitals and first-aid stations, now totaling more than 11,000. However, trained nurses and volunteer auxiliary nurses are still needed, and the more the better, and those who can serve full-time are in urgent need. The number of doctors who have volunteered to serve in emergency medical rescue teams has reached 2,500, and there are still volunteers every day. Auxiliary fire brigades have been rapidly mobilized. On the whole, progress is quite good. Fire brigades are always ready to go. In London alone, there are now more than 1,800 fire engine belts ready at any time, compared to only 125 fire engine belts in peacetime. (Reuters, 7th)

German Pocket Battleship

### Germany Denies Warship Sunk; British Officials Praise Air Force's First Exploit

London - The Information Department has recently released a communiqué stating that a squadron of the British Air Force flew to the German naval bases of Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel on the 4th of this month, and bombed German warships, and returned in triumph. The course of their operations is recorded in detail as follows: When the squadron of our bombers set off, although the weather was very bad, the pilots were full of courage and achieved great success. When the planes flew over Wilhelmshaven harbor at night, they flew very low in order to find clear targets. The first target was a pocket battleship anchored a few miles offshore. The enemy was obviously very panicked when attacked, and our planes were able to descend calmly and bombard them with large bombs. The planes were flying so low that even the enemy's losses could be clearly seen. The enemy's other warships and coastal batteries immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, bombarding our planes. At the same time, enemy planes also took off to engage. However, our side operated calmly and was exceptionally active, and went straight to the port of Brunsbüttel to attack another enemy ship, and then returned in triumph. The pilots were in high spirits and all were proud of their first strike against the enemy. According to naval observers, this air raid will have a great impact on future naval warfare, because the targets hit by our bombers were all the most elite warships in the German navy. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Berlin - Foreign sources have widely reported that when British bombers attacked Wilhelmshaven, the German pocket battleship "Gneisenau" was sunk. Naval authorities have officially denied this, saying that the ship was not attacked by enemy aircraft and was not damaged. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

### Famous French Journalist Discusses the Western Front War

Paris - The famous journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation of the war between France and Germany in Le Petit Parisien, saying, "The two sides have made contact between the Rhine and Moselle rivers. The evening before yesterday and all day yesterday were very active. After continuous pressure from our army, the enemy is now gathering fresh troops to strengthen their positions. Our army fought fiercely with the enemy for 24 hours, and finally advanced to a new line and consolidated it. However, because the enemy resisted stubbornly, our army was unable to make substantial progress. At the same time, the Supreme Command is reluctant to spend too much manpower and is being cautious." Recalling the beginning of the First European War in 1914, both sides were conducting mobile warfare, but now they are conducting positional warfare. This tactic may be extended for a considerable period of time. "As for defensive works, our Maginot Line is often regarded as an impregnable wall, and so is the enemy's Siegfried Line. However, Germany's western fortifications were built hastily in the shortest possible time, while we have spent years on them. As our country's famous military experts said, the Siegfried Line may not be without weaknesses. The 'work' that various units of our army have been carrying out for several days is to discover these weaknesses in order to plan for an advance. For this reason, we cannot expect the military authorities to issue war reports that are entirely the same as those at the beginning of the last European War. Our military authorities are difficult to achieve great achievements before they have investigated all the possibilities. In our view, the cornerstone of the Rhine front is the Lotbourg area, which is the 'defensive fortifications chain' to the south of that place. As for the terrain between the Rhine River and Wissembourg, the eastern bank of the river is very long, preceded by the Moses Forest, followed by the wilderness forest, and then followed by the wilderness (this wilderness is near the Lauter River, south of the French border). Furthermore, to the southwest, preceded by some small forests, followed by the wilderness. Hills, the French villages of Schebenhardt, Montel Forest, and Wissembourg Forest. Also, between Lotbourg and Wissembourg, the Lauter River is the boundary, with the western bank of the river being the French border and the eastern bank being German territory. On the German side, starting from New Lotbourg, passing through a wilderness, and reaching the extensive Bienwald Forest, it is indeed a good battlefield. It is reported that our troops have entered this forest, and the highway from Schweighofen to Schebenhardt winds outside the forest near the Lauter River (in German territory). Accordingly, the area between Lotbourg and Wissembourg will become the main battlefield in the future. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### German Military Scholar Comments on the Plan to Invade Poland; Explains the Reasons for Not Being Able to Drive Straight In; Says Preliminary Operational Objectives Have Been Achieved

Berlin - The Berlin local newspapers this morning published a detailed critique by Colonel Xylander, a military commentator, on the German military plan for the invasion of Poland. According to the report, the German army was ordered to invade Poland on September 1, but there were special circumstances on the Eastern Front. Attempting to drive straight in along the entire length of the German-Polish border was impossible, because the border between Germany and its protectorates and Poland stretched for 2,100 kilometers, more than three times the length of the Western Front in the previous war. Therefore, the German army decided to attack at important points, while taking a defensive posture in other areas to prevent Polish forces from invading German territory as a strategy. There were three starting points for the German attack: Pomerania, East Prussia, and Silesia.

The northern route naturally aimed to ensure the safety of Danzig as the main objective of the attack. The advance from Pomerania did not take the shortest route to Danzig, but advanced from the southern route, pushing towards Bromberg, Kulm, Graudenz, etc., cutting off the large Polish forces north of the corridor. On September 4, the German army crossed the river near Kulm, completing the encirclement of the Polish forces in that area, and made contact with the German forces that had invaded the Graudenz defensive circle from East Prussia.

The right wing of the German army advancing from the southern route reached the line of Neuemarik-Sukra on the first day, but subsequently encountered strong resistance from the Polish army and failed to take it in one fell swoop. It was not until September 5 that they cleared the remaining enemy forces. However, the center of the war on this route was not here, but north of the industrial area. After fierce fighting, the Polish army collapsed. Schenstochau and Silesia were occupied by the German army. Under the pursuit of the German mechanized units, the Polish army fled in disarray and collapsed. The German army was able to penetrate deep into the interior and encircle Krakow from the north.

The German army occupied an area of more than 100 kilometers. The preliminary operational objectives of the German army have been achieved. As for the further work of completely defeating Polish resistance, it has also begun. The north of the corridor has been encircled, and the German army attacking southern Poland has also won repeated victories. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

### British and French Military Authorities Discuss Strategy

Paris - British Chief of the General Staff General Ironside and Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall recently visited French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin to hold talks. French Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Vuillemin was also present. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Britain and France Plan to Implement Established Policies; Polish Resistance is Strong; German Strategy is Bound to Fail

London - The fact that France and Poland signed a military mutual assistance agreement, stipulating that neither signatory could independently make peace or cease-fire, is generally very satisfactory here. Responsible individuals also said that the strategy used by Germany was to propose the establishment of lasting peace to Britain and France after defeating Poland. The reason why Germany has not launched large-scale bombing of Britain and France is precisely because it still hopes not to expand the scope of the war, and at the same time does not want to close the door to negotiations, hoping to sacrifice Poland to reach a compromise with Britain and France. However, British officials and public opinion unanimously denounced this strategy as inconceivable, and asserted that it was bound to fail. In addition, although Poland's military strength is far less than that of Germany, its spirit of resistance is not weak, and this should not be ignored. Moreover, even if Poland is defeated and all of its territory is lost, the British government has decided to continue the war, because all attempts at compromise before Germany used force against Poland have been tried and failed. As Chamberlain said on the 3rd of this month, only when the German National Socialist government collapses can the war end. Therefore, no matter what happens in the future, people all over the UK fully support the government's established policies and persevere to the end. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Editorial

### The Theory of the Four-Power Alliance of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan

Yesterday's newspaper reported that Reuters had dispatched a telegram from the Danish capital, stating:

"The newspapers there published a news item in large print, stating that a new axis is being organized, with Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan working together, and Berlin is in charge. To achieve this goal, a Soviet military mission has been in Berlin since Sunday to discuss matters. An Italian military mission is expected to arrive in Berlin soon. And negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan to conclude a non-aggression pact are also beginning at the same time as this activity." This news is said to have been released by the German side.

Will this news shock the world even more amidst the European war and receive a strong stimulus? Indeed, the four countries of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan each have their own special personalities, very different from other countries. Germany and Japan are currently at war for aggression, the bloodstains of Italy in Abyssinia and Albania have not yet dried, and the Soviet Union has at least been regarded as a poisonous snake by Germany, Italy, and Japan. In short, all are dissatisfied with the current world situation and have ambitions to transcend their national borders. First, there was the group of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and recently, the Soviet Union and Germany understood each other and concluded a non-aggression pact. If we deduce from this, then Germany is the bridge, and it can naturally mediate between Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union, and finally make the four countries unite. The independent development of the four countries has caused cracks in world peace everywhere; if the four countries become one, wouldn't it "turn the world upside down and make the ghosts cry"? But in our view, it will never happen. The original telegram said that the source of the news was in Germany, which means that German propagandists, seeing isolated operations, may have uneasiness in their hearts, and are just trying to quench their thirst by pointing to plums?

Let us take Germany as the center and analyze the international situation. Germany and Italy are allies, and are on par with Japan, and they have been using anti-communism as a common banner. In the end, Germany itself abruptly turned enemies into friends due to its urgent needs and observed the Soviet Union. In its original intention, how could it sever Italy and Japan; but the facts show that it weighs the pros and cons and shows people that it does not care even if it severs Italy and Japan. Such a change has almost caused Italy and Japan to suffer adversely in their domestic affairs; Italy and Japan have just been fooled by it, and they are in pain and say that they will still form a new alliance with Germany? Generally speaking, anything that Germany plans will not be followed by Italy and Japan. What's more, the so-called four-power alliance has the Soviet Union as one of its allies; let alone that there are obstacles between the Soviet Union and Italy; as for Japan, there is fundamentally no room for compromise with the Soviet Union. The highest degree of friendship between the Soviet Union and Japan is to get along without conflict and to live in peace for the time being. If we say that the two countries can share weal and woe and fight on the same front, it is a hypothetical that violates human nature. What does Japan expect? The Soviet Union, from a non-aggression pact with Germany, has moved further to form a military alliance; according to the alliance, the Soviet Union and Germany will join hands to fight in Europe; then Japan has the most ideal opportunity. After Britain and France declared war on Germany, they have softened towards Japan; if the Soviet Union further assists Germany in the war, then Britain and France will definitely bow their heads to Japan even more; then Japan will be able to stand tall as a strongman in the British-French front, as a strongman in the democratic front, as a strongman in the Pacific, and as the only dominant power in the Far East! If it expects this, would it be willing to confront Britain and France, not avoiding sacrificing its navy, and ally with the Soviet Union and Germany? As for Italy: it has been displeased with Germany since Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact, and after Germany used troops in Poland, causing the European war, it resolutely abandoned its obligations to Germany and declared neutrality; if it is said that it will further join the Soviet Union and Germany to form a four-power alliance, then it will not only reverse its recent neutrality policy, but also Italy in the four-power alliance will become the first sacrifice to be 'beaten' in terms of geography and military strategy. Therefore, even if Italy's relations with the Soviet Union and Germany are harmonious, it will not ally with them. As for the Soviet Union: in its ideology, politics, economy, and military strategy, the quantities that should be regarded as gains and losses are more complex than other countries; therefore, its policy advances and retreats are the most difficult to grasp; that is to say, there are the most different possibilities in various actions and various changes. Even at present, in the European war, we dare not say what policy the Soviet Union will ultimately take regarding the victory or defeat and survival of Germany and Poland. However, there is also something that can be said simply: no country wants to engage in war, and the Soviet Union is the country that least wants war, so it is not something that the Soviet Union would do to conclude a four-power alliance at this time and jump into the vortex suddenly, this is the first reason. Even if it has other plans in Europe and participates in the war, it is not a matter for the moment; moreover, in the Far East, it has at least no needs from Japan and is not afraid of Japan, so why would it conclude a four-power alliance and be bound by Japan, this is the second reason.

In summary, it can be seen that the so-called four-power alliance of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is only propaganda from Berlin!

### Rampant German Submarines: British Fleet Searches Everywhere; Several More British and French Merchant Ships Sunk; Dozens of German Ships Flee to Neutral Ports

London, Intelligence Department's announcement today: German merchant ships are rapidly disappearing from the seas, employing all possible means to avoid capture. Many German ships are taking refuge in neutral ports; no fewer than fifty-four vessels are anchored off the port of Vigo, Spain, totaling over 180,000 tons; while eight vessels, totaling over 60,000 tons, are docked in Japanese ports. The "Innean" was captured on Tuesday, but British soldiers were unable to board her before the crew scuttled the ship. A recent British naval communiqué stated that the British Navy has no major actions to report, but continues to attack German submarines, with at least one apparent success. German submarines are attacking merchant ships everywhere. British losses include the Bosnia (2,401 tons) and the Kingsway (48,512 tons).

Lisbon, The British ship "Manees" was sunk by a German submarine at 5:30 AM on Wednesday, eighty miles from Cape Roca. The Dutch ship "Maas" arrived here yesterday, carrying rescued passengers, among others. Forty-two of the eighty-eight crew members are still missing. Also, according to official news from London, the British ship "Kingsway" was also sunk by a submarine. The British ship "Olive Grove" also sent out a distress signal, and the American ship "Washington," which was in the English Channel, has sailed to assist. Rescued passengers from the "Manees" said that the ship was attacked suddenly without warning, and the crew had no choice but to abandon ship and escape in lifeboats. The German submarine then surfaced and opened fire on the ship, sinking it. An Indian seaman was killed by a bullet. Two of the sixteen passengers rescued by the Portuguese ship "Carvalho" were also wounded by bullets. The Dutch ship "Maas" rescued passengers from three lifeboats. The "Maas" now has, in addition to the rescued passengers, the bodies of three drowned crew members and one passenger. The rescued passengers are in terrible condition, their clothes torn, and they are all hungry and thirsty. The "Manees" weighed 7,242 tons and was built in Liverpool. The British ship "Cordelia" was also attacked by a German submarine but escaped safely and arrived in British territorial waters. Reports from New York stated that the British clipper ship of Transamerica Corporation reported seeing two submarines of unknown nationality five miles from the Azores. As of today, 128 passengers from the "Athenia" are still missing, and hopes for their survival are extremely slim. The American ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, has sent his son, Joseph Kennedy, to assist American rescued passengers. The Red Cross has allocated $10,000 for rescue efforts, and the US government has sent a ship to the River Clyde to meet them. (Associated Press, 8th)

London, After the "Athenia" mail ship belonging to the Donaldson Line was sunk by a submarine, the company representative recently told the press that, according to the investigation, a total of one hundred and twenty-eight people were killed, but some of those who were late to escape may have been rescued by small boats and were unable to report their whereabouts by wireless.

Tokyo, The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his opinion to reporters who visited today, stating that if the "Scharnhorst" ship belonging to the North German Company attempts to leave Japanese territorial waters, it will likely be intercepted by British and French warships. When reporters asked about the situation of the ship, the spokesperson said that he did not have any special information about the "Scharnhorst" and said that he had heard that several German ships were docked in Japanese ports. The spokesperson also said that he had not heard of the rumors that Japanese shipowners had negotiated with the German ship owners to transfer ownership. The truth of this matter needs to be carefully considered, but he believes that there may be legitimate reasons for transferring ownership in some cases. Some reporters also asked whether it was true that the "Scharnhorst" could be converted into a warship. The spokesperson replied that he had not heard of such a step. (Reuters, 8th)

### Paris Air Defense is Extremely Perfect; German Aircraft Has Not Yet Invaded

Paris, Regarding the repeated issuance of air raid alerts in Paris, the authorities have recently issued a communiqué to explain the matter, stating that German aircraft have never flown over Paris and have not dropped bombs, which is inconsistent with rumors. The air defense equipment of the capital is extremely perfect, but various precautionary measures should still be taken. If there is an air raid in the future, the results will be fully informed to the people, and they should not easily believe rumors. According to recent experience, residents of the capital can enter shelters within half an hour after hearing the alarm. It is therefore necessary to issue the alarm fifteen minutes before the estimated arrival of enemy aircraft in Paris, so that the number of alarms can be reduced. (Le Matin, 7th)

Paris, The port of Marseille issued two alerts tonight. The first lasted from 8:37 to 10:40, and the second lasted from 8:57, only three minutes, and was then lifted. The Toulon naval port also issued an alert at 8:25 PM and immediately implemented a blackout, which was lifted at 10:00 PM. (Havas, 7th)

### United States Has Foresight to Strengthen Far East Defenses; Six Submarines Transferred to the Philippines; Military Authorities Draft Mobilization Plan

Washington, Six American submarines currently docked at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii are likely to sail to Manila in the Far East within two months, and the State Department has confirmed this news. According to American government authorities, they announced to reporters yesterday that the aircraft carrier "Langley" in Pearl Harbor has been ordered to rush to Manila to strengthen the strength of the Asian Fleet. According to the Navy Department, they had planned to send six submarines to the Far East for defense a year ago, and said that this new order aims only to replace unusable old ships, so this transfer is purely a "normal" situation, and would not have attracted attention if not for the current special international situation. However, when the order to transfer the "Langley" was announced, the Navy admitted that its purpose was to protect the harbors of the Philippines, because since President Roosevelt expressed his attitude towards Europe, the neutrality of the area needs to be ensured. (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington, It is learned that the Joint Committee of the US Army and Navy has drafted a mobilization plan, which will be able to conscript one million men within ninety days once involved in the war. According to the national census, there are 41 million men between the ages of 18 and 64, and approximately 26 million between the ages of 18 and 45. Reservists from the ages of 21 to 30 have been designated as the first batch to enlist. The second batch is from 18 to 20, and the third batch is from 31 to 40. If this plan is implemented, men from the ages of 18 to 46 must register at recruiting stations within three days of the outbreak of war. As for the personnel to be enlisted, it will be decided by lottery. The US Army and Navy are currently intensifying conscription work, because according to peacetime arrangements, the total number of army personnel should be 202,000, and the navy 80,000. In addition, officials do not attach much importance to the rumors that Congress will hold a special meeting to discuss the national defense supplementary plan. They believe that President Roosevelt may not intend to expand the military again, because the House and Senate of Congress have already passed a military expenditure bill of $2 billion. According to a naval officer, the biggest difficulty at present is the lack of skilled technical workers to manufacture new weapons, but the naval expansion plan is being accelerated. He also said that it is inconvenient to verify the rumors that the Navy is about to develop a harbor in Guam (the island is about 1,500 miles from Yokohama, Japan), and it is also inconvenient to discuss the news of developing other naval ports in the Pacific. It is reported that the US Navy will ask Congress to allocate huge sums of money to establish aviation experiment stations and increase "educational" industrial orders. (Associated Press, 8th)

### American Commercial Credit Loans Can Still Be Granted to European Warring Countries; Not Restricted by Neutrality Law

Washington, President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the payment of short-term bills of exchange by American merchants and the European warring countries is not restricted by the neutrality law. This law applies not only to countries such as Britain and France, but also to Germany. The President's decree was announced after a cabinet meeting. The cabinet meeting discussed this issue and other matters for two hours. The President then met with Federal Administrator McNutt, Economic Construction Council Chairman Jones, and Work Progress Administrator Carmody. The President is currently in contact with congressional leaders, trying to reconvene Congress to amend the Neutrality Act. Senator McNary, a Republican from Oregon, said in Shasta last night that the President told him on the phone that if Congress reconvened, it would open on September 18, and the President also told him that he wanted to amend the Neutrality Act, and he replied that he would do his best to help the President. (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington, President Roosevelt recently discussed the issue of holding a temporary meeting of Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act with the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, but no decision has been made. In addition, the President ordered that the barter agreement signed by Britain and the United States, that is, the agreement to exchange American cotton and wheat for rubber and tin produced in British territories, be implemented. He also authorized Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to prepare to grant normal commercial credit loans to European belligerent countries, but only for transactions that are considered legal in peacetime. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently hired three experts as special advisors to solicit opinions on various financial issues caused by the international situation. (Havas, 7th)

New York, According to sources from the New York Times who are closely connected to officials in Washington, President Roosevelt may convene Congress for a special meeting on September 15 to discuss amending the Neutrality Act. The newspaper also said that events such as the sinking of the British ship "Athenia" will quickly bring the American reaction to a boiling point. (Reuters, 8th)

### Britain is Still Willing to Continue Negotiations with Japan; Undersecretary Butler's Expression in the Lower House; Military Attaché to China, Spear, Regains Freedom

London, Undersecretary Butler briefly described the general situation in the Far East in the House of Commons today, saying, "Although the 'Manchukuo'-Mongolian border has appeared to have slightly important military actions taking place since May, the scope of the war in the Far East has been very limited for some time. The Japanese government sent a memorandum to the representatives of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland on September 5, stating that the Japanese government is focusing its efforts on resolving the dispute with China." As for the talks between British Ambassador Craigie to Japan and the Japanese government, they have now been suspended. The British government has stated previously that it is willing to continue negotiations so that all long-pending points can be compromised. The situation in Tianjin has not changed except for the confusion caused by the flood. (Reuters, 7th)

Beiping, British Military Attaché to China, Lieutenant Colonel Spear, who was detained by the Japanese side in Zhangjiakou for four months, has been released today. Although Lieutenant Colonel Spear was detained for a long time, he is in good health and high spirits. It is believed that the release of Lieutenant Colonel Spear is due to the efforts of Brigadier General Beckett, the British Military Attaché to Japan who recently came here from Tokyo. During Lieutenant Colonel Spear's detention, the British government made repeated efforts to rescue him and repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities. The Japanese authorities replied that the case was under investigation. It was once rumored that Lieutenant Colonel Spear would be tried by a military court, but it did not materialize. (Reuters, 8th)

Tokyo, British Military Attaché to China, Lieutenant Colonel Spear, who was accused of being a spy by the Japanese army authorities in North China, has been released today, and the case has been dismissed. This was announced by the spokesperson of the Japanese army in North China in a statement after Lieutenant Colonel Spear's release. The spokesperson said that Lieutenant Colonel Spear violated Japanese military law, but his degree of violation has mitigating reasons because it was due to carelessness and did not harbor any malicious intent. (Reuters, 8th)

Beiping, Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Spears, the military attaché of the British Embassy, who was arrested by the Japanese army on the Beijing-Baotou Railway on May 26 on suspicion of espionage, was once transferred to Zhangjiakou and the military court concluded its trial, deciding not to prosecute and released him in Beiping at 4:00 PM on the 8th. The remarks of the Japanese authorities in North China are recorded as follows: Since the incident of Lieutenant Colonel Spears' violation of military law occurred, the parties concerned have actively started the trial. As a result, Mr. Spears seemed to have acted as a spy to benefit the enemy. After several careful investigations, the documents and evidence involved the act of violating military law. However, because the Japanese authorities did not intend to impose malice, they decided not to prosecute in this case. (Domei News Agency, 8th)

### Transfer of Four Chinese Nationals from Tianjin: British Member of Parliament Expresses Opposition

London – Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler announced in the House of Commons today the transfer to the Japanese side of the four Chinese suspects wanted in connection with the assassination of Mr. Cheng in Tianjin. Members of Parliament raised objections. Butler replied that the London High Court had already ruled on the case, and the British government had notified both the Chinese and Japanese governments. Therefore, the British government had decided that the four suspects could not be further detained, and had instructed the British Consul-General in Tianjin to hand them over to the local Chinese legal authorities. Liberal MP Mander protested that the trial had not yet concluded and the four suspects should not be handed over. Butler replied that the High Court had ruled that it could not issue writs of habeas corpus for foreigners in foreign territories. Butler also mentioned the surrender of two Chinese individuals in Hong Kong, stating that all relevant facts were being considered. Conservative MP Bartlett asserted that new application procedures for the writ could be determined yesterday or today, so transferring the four suspects beforehand was inappropriate. Butler replied that he could assure Mr. Bartlett that the government had sought the best available advice, as the case involved many technical and legal matters. (Reuters, 7th)

Manila – Overseas Chinese in the Philippines are currently raising funds to assist the families of the four Chinese suspects recently handed over by the British authorities to the Chinese court in Tianjin. (Reuters, 8th)

### Japanese Attempt to Induce Britain and France to Withdraw Naval and Land Forces Stationed in China; Military Attachés and Counselors Active in Beiping and Tianjin; Japanese Sentries Again Cause Trouble for British Citizens in Tianjin, Claiming British Soldiers Assaulted Japanese Residents

Beiping – According to a Japanese military spokesperson today, Japanese Embassy Counselor Horiuchi visited the British, French, German, and Italian embassies separately today to explain Japan's intention not to interfere in the European war and to request that the warring nations withdraw their naval and land forces stationed in China to avoid unexpected incidents. (Associated Press, 8th)

Tianjin – Japanese Naval Attaché to Tianjin, Lieutenant Commander Nakatsu, visited Lieutenant Commander Billis of the British China Fleet’s Huachung at 2:30 PM on the 8th, which was anchored in the Bai River, and met with British Army Chief of Staff Major Tymeron, explaining Japan's policy of non-participation in the European situation. He also expressed his hope that the British authorities would pay attention to the inauspicious events that might arise between the warring nations in China and consider them carefully to avoid various incidents. (Domei News Agency, 8th)

Tokyo – A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, when addressing reporters today, declined to comment on a proposal published in the "Japan Times" that, as Japan is a neutral country, it has the right under international law to demand that the warring nations withdraw their troops stationed in Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese army, and that if the warring nations refuse, Japan has the right to disarm them. The spokesperson replied to a question from a British reporter that the Japanese government had not yet discussed this plan, so he could not discuss it. However, an official from the Foreign Ministry informed representatives of the warring nations on Tuesday that Japan would not interfere in the European war and asked them to pay attention to eliminating various possible causes to avoid unexpected incidents involving the warring nations in China. The warring nations have not yet responded to this friendly recommendation, nor is there any indication that they will withdraw their troops from China. A reporter asked if Japan would object if neutral country troops were to supplement their lack. The spokesperson replied that if such a development occurred, Japan would explain its attitude on the matter. (Reuters, 8th)

Chongqing – Today's Sao Dang Pao published an editorial strongly criticizing Japan's demand that Britain and France withdraw their troops from China and expressing confidence that Britain and France would reject this unreasonable demand. The newspaper stated that Japan's motives for making this request were twofold: (1) to take advantage of the current European war to eliminate British and French interests and influence in China, and (2) to create a precedent for handling China's diplomatic affairs on behalf of China. The newspaper concluded by stating that whether Britain and France should withdraw their troops stationed in China in principle is another matter, but we do not want them to withdraw their troops to facilitate Japan's aggression against China. (Reuters, 8th)

Tianjin – According to news from here today, Japanese sentries again caused trouble for British citizens at the barricades. British citizens at the entrances and exits of the British concession often have to wait for several hours for Japanese sentries to inspect their passes. Sometimes, after the passes are presented, the Japanese soldiers still do not allow them to pass. Furthermore, the Japanese consul protested to the British consul here yesterday about the incident on Wednesday in which four British soldiers assaulted Japanese nationals Inoue and his wife, and claimed that the four British soldiers had taken a Japanese sampan without permission, crossed the barricades, and fled into the British concession. It is reported that the British consul has agreed to investigate the matter. (Associated Press, 8th)

Chongqing – Foreign merchants here, due to Japan's demand that British naval and land forces withdraw from China, are preparing to rely on Manila instead of Hong Kong for future business. China is preparing to increase the number of express air services and postal services to Hanoi and Yangon when Hong Kong is isolated. The Telecommunications Bureau has also increased the number of telegraph offices to maintain close contact with Manila. Although the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has cancelled its Hong Kong flights due to German investment, the Xi'an flights have now resumed. (Associated Press, 8th)

Tianjin – Yesterday, the Japanese authorities protested to the British side that on Wednesday evening, a Japanese couple, Mr. and Mrs. Inoue, were sailing in a sampan within the boundaries of Special District One when four drunken British soldiers forcibly boarded the sampan and insulted them. Mr. and Mrs. Inoue left the boat and went elsewhere, and the sampan was driven by the British soldiers to the British concession. After receiving this protest, the British authorities are currently investigating the matter. (Reuters, 8th)

### Labor Unrest Erupts Repeatedly in Japan

### Japan Increases Production, Attempting to Profit from the Opportunity

Tokyo – The Japan Packaging Association is preparing to increase production by 50% starting next month due to the increased demand for canned food from Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It is reported that this is due to the outbreak of war in Europe. It is reported that the Packaging Association plans to package 22,065,000 items starting next month, worth 312,900,000 Japanese Yen. Of these, 2,991,000 items, worth 37,761,000 Japanese Yen, will be shipped to countries within the Japanese Yen Bloc such as "Manchukuo" and China, while 12,744,000 items, worth 197,152,000 Japanese Yen, will be shipped to foreign countries. It is reported that there are also hopes for active exports of other commodities. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Governor General of Canada Declares State of War with Germany; Prepares to Actively Assist Britain with Material Resources; Takes Various Measures to Defend Coastline

Ottawa – When Governor General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, addressed the emergency session of Parliament yesterday, he announced that a state of war now exists between Canada and Germany. His speech did not include a formal declaration of war against Germany. Lord Tweedsmuir declared that the Canadian militia, air force, and navy had already been placed on active duty, and the government had taken other measures to defend the Canadian coast. "Other recommendations for taking active action will be presented to you." It is widely believed that Canada will not formally declare war on Germany, hoping to use this as a "back door" for Britain, so that US military materials can be continuously imported into Britain. It is generally recalled that when President Roosevelt invoked the Neutrality Act this week to prohibit the export of munitions, he did not include Canada among the belligerent nations. (Associated Press, 8th)

Ottawa – The Canadian Federal Senate and House of Commons convened a joint session at 3:00 PM to discuss various necessary defense measures and the issue of Canada's cooperation with Britain in resisting aggression. Governor General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, then read out the Royal Decree, which stated: "As members of Parliament are aware, our efforts to maintain peace in Europe have all failed. The United Kingdom has entered into war with Germany in order to uphold the obligations it accepted to prevent war. The purpose of this decision by the Federal Government to convene a temporary meeting of members of Parliament is to request that Parliament authorize the government to take all necessary measures to defend Canada and to cooperate with Britain in the struggle against aggression, so as to establish the principle internationally that disputes should be resolved peacefully rather than by force in the future. To date, reservists for the army, navy, and air force have been called up, and the Federal Government has taken various measures in accordance with existing laws to defend the coastline and ensure domestic security. We further request that members of Parliament discuss the temporary budget so that the Federal Government can adequately meet the various expenses necessary for the current war or those that may be necessary in the future. The current situation is extremely serious, and the spirit demonstrated by the people of Canada in responding to events is no different from that of other subjects of the United Kingdom and the people of the various Dominions. The British government believes that Canada will support our efforts to defend the principles of freedom that we all share." It is not yet officially known what measures the Canadian Federal Government intends to take to assist Britain. According to informed sources, the total amount of the temporary budget to be passed by Parliament will be between 50 million and 100 million Canadian dollars (this year's regular budget totals 63 million Canadian dollars). The duration of this temporary session will not be too long, and it is expected to close after a few days of meetings. (Havas, 7th)

Ottawa – The speech delivered by the Governor General of Canada at the joint session of the Senate and House of Commons has been commented on by political figures, who stated that the phrase "expenses necessary for the current war or those that may be necessary in the future" almost implies that a state of war has been established between the Canadian Federation and Germany. However, the right to declare a state of war rests with Parliament, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King may not formally request it from Parliament. On the contrary, due to various political reasons, he would rather maintain an ambiguous situation. In short, Canada's assistance to Britain is not in question, but formally declaring war on Germany, which would cause the current US Neutrality Act to be applied to this country, would be inconvenient. (Havas, 8th)

Ottawa – The Canadian Federal Government is currently planning to establish a national monopoly system for wheat throughout the country during the European war. This is one way to stabilize wheat prices, but it is reported that it will not be implemented immediately. It is generally said that wheat prices have recently risen sharply, and as the government is requesting Parliament to pass a temporary budget and urgently needs to open up sources of revenue, the burden on the national treasury can be greatly reduced. (Havas, 7th)

### Sir Frederick Leith-Ross Appointed Supervisor of British War Economy Department

London – Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, has been appointed supervisor of the Economic Welfare Department. Sir Frederick is a member of the League of Nations Economic Committee. In 1935, he led an economic mission to China to assist the Chinese government in reorganizing its currency and financial affairs. Sir Frederick also served as the chief British financial expert at the Hague Conference of 1929-30. (Reuters, 7th)

London – The Ministry of Commerce has controlled the import and export of 500 items, including oil, coal, various metals, iron ore, scrap iron, fats, animal fats, machinery, cotton yarn, flax, hemp, wool, fleece, and chemical pigments. Items banned from import include glass, automobiles, cotton, wool, silk, rayon, linen, and ramie, etc. (Reuters, 8th)

### US Navy Reinforces Defense of West Indies, German Submarine Spotted near Puerto Rico

Washington – Secretary of the Army Woodring has ordered the deployment of a total of 1,500 infantry, anti-aircraft artillery, and engineer units to Puerto Rico (one of the West Indies) next month to strengthen defenses. In addition, the Navy Department announced that it will build a submarine base in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, east of Puerto Rico. The entire project will cost $350,000. (Havas, 7th)

San Juan, Puerto Rico – According to passengers on the American mail ship "Iroquois," they spotted a German submarine and a giant freighter about 300 miles north of Puerto Rico. The ship was painted black and the name was difficult to identify. (Havas, 7th)

### The Toho Newspaper's Observation: The European War Situation

Tokyo – The Japan Times commented on the progress of the European war, stating that the strategies of Britain and France are the opposite of Germany's. Britain and France clearly want to prolong the war. If the two countries are fighting with the firm determination to defeat Nazism, then the war may be more serious than initially expected, and the war will become increasingly tragic. No one denies that Germany is strong, but its economic power is insufficient, and the United States may participate in the war. Therefore, Germany may use its entire air force, which is rich in destructive power, to try to bomb London and Paris in a timely manner. At this time, it seems too early to talk about the non-expansion of the war and the political solution of this issue. (Reuters, 8th)

### Japanese Plan Two-Pronged Offensive in Hubei Province; Main Force Distributed North of the Yangtze River; Battle Has Begun on Yuezhou Front

Chongqing – According to observations by military experts here, Japan seems to be planning a final offensive in Hubei Province in September or October, attempting to end the war as soon as possible. The offensive routes can be divided into two: First, along the Han River through Fancheng to Laohekou, then westward to spy on Hanzhong, and after reaching Hanzhong, advance north to reach Xi'an, while simultaneously threatening the highway traffic to Chengdu. The second offensive route is to cross the Han River to spy on Yichang, control navigation on the Yangtze River, and simultaneously subject Chongqing to incessant air raids by Japanese aircraft. Another offensive route is to land from the Beihai area to cut off China's land transportation in the southwest. However, the current Japanese army in China is not strong enough to speak of a final offensive. If it wants to implement the final offensive plan, the Japanese side will have to increase its troop strength by 500,000 from Japan to maintain the rear transportation lines. (Associated Press, 8th)

Chongqing – Reports received here of the Japanese army concentrating naval and land forces in Central and South China are quite encouraging. It is reported that a large number of fresh troops transferred from various places, as well as 18 gunboats and warships, have arrived in Hankou. The main force of the Japanese army is distributed north of the Yangtze River, with only a small number of troops dispatched to the Yuezhou area. Japanese cavalry patrols the area along the Han River in central Hubei, apparently as a preparatory step for a general offensive. Fighting has already begun on the Yuezhou front. It is reported that several thousand Japanese soldiers have begun to attack Chinese guerrilla forces.

### Evolution of the European Situation Does Not Harm China's War of Resistance - China is a Self-Sufficient Country, Impact is Smaller - New Inland Industries Gain Development Opportunities

The impact of the European war on China's war of resistance is a matter of great international concern, and especially cherished by patriotic Chinese. According to an observer: (1) China is a vast country with abundant resources. Two or three hundred years ago, it was a closed-off country. Its people are hardworking and simple, and their material lives are extremely simple. This state is still maintained in remote areas of the interior.

According to historical examples, the influence of the external environment on agricultural countries is necessarily lighter than that on industrial countries, because they are accustomed to a simple life. (2) China is currently engaged in a war of resistance, and the supply of armaments and military supplies is the first priority. This was foreseen by the wise Chinese authorities.

After two years of effort in the war of resistance, in addition to heavy weapons, ordinary armaments have already been able to reach the point of self-sufficiency. Many of the larger pharmaceutical factories operated by Chinese in the coastal ports have also moved inland, which will be of great help to rescue work. (3) Exports of domestic products may be somewhat affected by the European war, but on the other hand, the

reduced import of foreign goods is sufficient to offset part of it. China's new industries have made considerable achievements in the interior over the past two years, and will certainly have more opportunities for full development in the future. Therefore, no matter how the European war situation evolves, it will not hinder China's war of resistance. Moreover, China's current international routes, such as those to the Soviet Union and the United States, have not undergone any fundamental changes.

### Floods Inundate Land, Boats Sail Inland - Tianjin and Daghu Become a Marsh

Residents of Japanese Concessions Suffer Even More

The Zi Lin Bao reports that a foreigner from Tianjin, who is now in Shanghai, described the shocking situation of the great flood in Tianjin to a reporter yesterday, saying that he had experienced the earthquake in Messina, Italy, but the Tianjin flood was even more tragic. The situation there is almost "hopeless". On the morning of August 20, the flood quickly flowed eastward into Tianjin. By the afternoon of that day, the people of Tianjin

were cut off by the water, which reached depths of fifteen feet in several places. As the flood flowed eastward, it gradually increased, streets were flooded, and residents were trapped in their homes. The situation in the Japanese Concession was appalling, and the residents there suffered even more than the other people of Tianjin. Diseases immediately followed. The authorities are carrying out sanitation work throughout the area. The British Army, the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, stationed in Tianjin, has moved its barracks into the Jardine Matheson warehouse due to the flood. The military hospital has also been moved into the Astor Hotel. The water and electricity, which had been cut off by the flood, were restored on Tuesday, and the British Concession was re-illuminated at night. However, there is a risk of electrocution when standing in the accumulated water near the power connections. Many people have died as a result. One of the most serious consequences of the flood is that the dead cannot be buried, but can only be

the corpses are abandoned in the river. There is also a danger to health, namely that cesspools have broken open and the city's sewage pipes are becoming increasingly dangerous. The situation in Tianjin will be even worse when the water recedes. The number of deaths caused by the flood cannot be estimated at present, but on the first day of the flood, there were more than a thousand deaths. Sampans, small boats, or rafts made of soap boxes are used to navigate the streets. Foreigners can get about one pint of water in the morning and evening for washing. Because the accumulated water is dirty, various skin diseases are prevalent after wading. Between Tianjin and Daghu,

has become a marsh. Although food is not currently in short supply, it may run out in the future. Rice is still being distributed on a rationing system. 95% of Tianjin's businesses have been shut down. Dysentery and cholera are expected to occur after the water recedes. Many foreign women and children, including military dependents, have retreated to Qinhuangdao, but there are still a small number of foreign women living in the British Concession. The railway between Tianjin and Daghu has been cut off. The Daghu sandbar has also been blocked, preventing navigation, which is another consequence of the flood. The British Concession's labor bureau, especially the police, and volunteer helpers are carrying out rescue work, which is very admirable.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Regulates Rural Areas - Establishes Agricultural Product Control Council

### Japanese Army Covets Jiufeng Mountain Stone

Forces Laborers to Mine

Qingpu Correspondence: The Qingpu-Songjiang Japanese army, coveting the stones of Jiufeng Mountain, forced thousands of laborers to mine on the mountain at the end of last month.

### Wuxi Autumn Cocoon Prices - Affected by the European War

Silk Cocoon Merchants Wait and See

Wuxi Correspondence: In this autumn sericulture season, the villagers sold the spring cocoons for high prices, and also heard that silk sales were smooth and silk prices were rising, so all of them over-bred silk worms. The supply of autumn mulberry leaves could not meet the demand. Currently, the silk worms in Xin'an, Kaihua, Nanyan, Qingcheng and other townships are in good condition, and the majority have already entered the cocooning stage, but the supply of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and the price of leaves is about ten yuan. Small silk factories in rural areas, because the number of spring cocoons collected was not large, pre-ordered autumn cocoons at 150 to 200 yuan per load, and paid almost all of the deposit. After the silkworms entered the cocooning stage, they were sold to small silk factories, and the deposit was deducted. Because silkworm farmers did not have money to buy more mulberry leaves, they were happy to accept this. However, since the outbreak of the European war, silk prices have plummeted, and silk cocoon merchants have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Small silk factories that paid the deposit are also feeling worried.

### Puppet Army - Cheng Wannian's Troops Rob

Cheng Has Been Dismissed by the Japanese

Wuxi Correspondence: In the past half month, banditry has been rampant inside and outside Wuxi city. Four plainclothes bandits, armed with short guns, went to the Chongsou Temple Dongji Tongyin Bank in the bustling city center the day before yesterday. After entering, they forbade anyone from making a sound, and robbed 16,400 yuan in cash before fleeing in different directions. It is reported that these bandits were soldiers of the puppet army Cheng Wannian stationed in Wuxi. Recently, the robbery cases in Wuxi have all been committed by Cheng's troops. As for Cheng Wannian himself, he has been dismissed by the Japanese army, and Su Yaoxin has been appointed as the acting puppet pacification commander. It can be seen that those who act as accomplices will not end well.

### Subsidies for Puppet County Offices in Occupied Areas are Not Available

The Puppet Side has Exhausted its Resources

Nanjing Correspondence: The counties in the occupied areas, under the wing of the Japanese, have organized puppet county offices. Although they have tried their best to search and seize, the expenses are huge, and the income cannot cover the expenses. The local budget for the second half of the 28th year of the puppet provincial government in the counties of Jiangnan is 3 million yuan less than the first half, so that the subsidies allocated to the puppet offices have not been available.

Hao Peng, the head of the puppet finance department, proposed at the puppet finance ministry meeting a few days ago to distribute 1,235 points of counterfeit copper auxiliary coins in Suzhou and circulate them in the counties. It will be issued six weeks later. Regarding the subsidy funds, the puppet finance ministry only allowed it to be distributed by the special agent class in the same amount as before. Moreover, because the puppet side forced the use of Huaxing counterfeit banknotes, the people in various places generally believed in legal tender, and the use of counterfeit banknotes was greatly hindered. At present, paying the puppet tax still uses both legal tender and counterfeit banknotes. Under the above circumstances, the economic situation of the puppet agencies has been stretched.

Education News

### Two Years of Eliminating Illiteracy for 20 Million People Nationwide

Implementing Remedial Education for Out-of-School People - Provinces in the Rear Start Civil Schools Ahead of Schedule

(Chongqing News) There are approximately 220 million young men and women out of school beyond compulsory education in China, accounting for half of the country's population. Most of these people are over 16 years old, and they are in their prime and are the backbone of social labor and production. In order to remedy this, the Ministry of Education formulated and implemented measures for supplementary education for out-of-school people in the autumn of the 25th year, and ordered all provinces and cities to complete the plan within six years and eliminate illiteracy. The method of promotion is that each county and city should add 20 to 40 civil schools each year. Each school should run at least two sessions each year, and each session should run two classes, with 50 people in each class. Each session lasts about three to six months. First implement the plan for men and women aged 16 to 30, and continue to promote it to people who are older or younger. People may also be forced to attend school. This work has been going on for two years and has been quite effective. Although this war has been slightly affected, it has not been fully implemented according to the original plan, but the difference is not very far. According to the regulations of the six-year plan for supplementary education for out-of-school people, 12 million people should be eliminated from illiteracy in the 25th year, and 20 million people should be eliminated from illiteracy in the 26th year. However, according to the reports submitted by various provinces and cities, the number of people eliminated from illiteracy in the 25th year has reached more than 16 million, exceeding the original plan by more than 4 million. Among them, a part still needs to be verified. However, based on the original planned number, it must be more than that, not less. Although the war in the 26th year has affected the war zone provinces to a considerable extent, out-of-school people are mostly the most powerful members directly or indirectly in the war of resistance, and the need for this supplementary education is even more urgent. Therefore, in the provinces behind the battlefield, most of them are implementing it more and starting it earlier. Checking the total number, it can still reach the scheduled number. The numbers listed in the war zone provinces may have a difference, but taking half of them into account, it should be more than 10 million. Therefore, the total number of people eliminated from illiteracy in the past two years is at least 20 million or more.

### Guangdong Province Establishes Joint Middle Schools - The Education Department Formulates Various Measures

(Qujiang Correspondence) The Guangdong Provincial Education Department, in view of the fact that public and private secondary schools need to be jointly established due to various relationships such as environment, funding, and personnel, should formulate measures to have a basis for them.

The main points are as follows: (1) Secondary schools, regardless of senior, junior, male, female, middle schools, normal schools, or vocational schools, can be jointly established, but the limit is two to three schools. (2) Public schools shall not be combined with private schools, and registered schools shall not be combined with unregistered schools. (3) Joint middle schools belonging to the public shall be prefixed with the place name of the original affiliation, and joint middle schools belonging to private schools shall be prefixed with a special name. (4) The expenses of public joint middle schools shall be borne by the original school's directly affiliated agency, and the expenses of private joint middle schools shall be borne separately by the original school's board of directors through consultation. (5) The principal of the public joint middle school shall be designated by the competent educational administrative agency, and the principal of the private joint school shall be jointly promoted by the original school's board of directors. (6) Joint middle schools shall give priority to hiring the faculty and staff of the original schools. (7) Joint middle schools should give priority to admitting students from the original schools.

### Recent Situation of National Northwest Institute of Technology

The Internal Organization is Divided into Eight Departments - 143 Graduates

Since Lai Lian took over as the president of the National Northwest Institute of Technology, he has actively reorganized the interior and raised curriculum standards. All faculty, staff, students, instruments and machines have been completely concentrated in one place within the past six months. The first graduates of this year include 65 in civil engineering, 12 in mechanical engineering, 21 in mining and metallurgy, 20 in electrical engineering, 6 in chemical engineering, 12 in aeronautical engineering, and 7 in textile engineering, totaling 143 people. They have all been hired by various military and political agencies, highways, railway factories. The four departments of mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgy, aeronautical engineering and textile engineering have four or five positions available for each person to choose from, and the supply cannot meet the demand. More than 150 students from the third grade of each department of the college were also sent to factories in various places for internships during this summer vacation. By the time school starts in November, there will be more than a thousand new and old students. The college has the mission of cultivating engineering talents and developing the Northwest. It is divided in eight departments: civil, mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, mining, chemical, water conservancy, and textile engineering. It has gathered talents and equipment from the four major engineering colleges and has become the largest engineering school with the most departments in the country.

### Guangxi - Old Woman in Guiping Studies Hard

Scores Above 80

(Guiping Correspondence) The first phase of adult education in Guiping County has been held in 23 townships, 592 classes, with 26,467 students and 310 teachers. 23,991 people who passed the exams this summer vacation graduated, and the adult classes in Shizui Township Dajie Houchi Street, Nanjin Township Dongta Village, Chengxi Town Ximen Street, Yonghe Township Peixin Village, and Xiawan Township Xiawan Market are the best. An old woman surnamed Ma from the North Street of Jiangkou Town, who is over 50 years old, knew the suffering of unemployment well. When it started, she took the initiative to ask the supervisor to allow her to enroll in the class. By the time she graduated, her scores in all subjects were above 80. It can be seen from this that the adult education in the county has achieved good results.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Report - School Medical Affairs Set up by the Bureau

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department reported on the medical affairs of the schools set up by the Bureau last month, stating that all the schools set up by the Bureau were on summer vacation this month, so the main work of the medical affairs of the schools set up by the Bureau was only to inject preventive cold shots and to carry out the movement to treat trachoma in various Chinese children's primary schools. A total of 1,295 students who were willing to inject preventive cold shots had their names registered, but only 61 received the first injection, only 491 received the second injection, and only 347 received the third injection. The result is very disappointing. It is truly unsatisfactory that parents and students are so easily negligent in such an important method of disease prevention. The majority of residents still lack hygiene knowledge. During this summer vacation, a total of 445 students went to various trachoma treatment centers for medical treatment due to bad weather, with a total of 1,790 visits. In addition, there were two teachers, graduates, and school servants who volunteered to go for treatment on time. Various schools have set up summer tutoring classes, so the work of the school inspection team was very busy this month. Most of the boarding students of the schools still stayed in the schools during the summer vacation. A total of 181 inspections were made to various subsidized Chinese private schools this month.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Stable with a Slight Tendency to Loosen

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. Due to the lack of significant news to influence the market, most operators in the unofficial British and American exchange markets adopted a wait-and-see approach. As a result, the sudden situation turned calm, and the trend also became stable. The morning opening was slightly weaker, but later, Hong Kong's increased selling pressure, coupled with some sales from small traders, caused the market to drop to as low as 3 pence and 9375 for British gold and 6.625 yuan for the US dollar. However, Sassoon, a Western firm, suddenly intervened with purchases, and the Bank of England also absorbed some on behalf of another party, so the market rebounded to 3 pence and 8125 for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar. In the afternoon, Hong Kong again increased selling pressure, and Sassoon also re-emerged with sales, so British gold ultimately ended weaker by 0.03125 and the US dollar also slightly stronger by 0.0625. The current month's futures prices were comparable to spot prices, and the overall volume of transactions was not as high as in the previous days.

Selling Pressure from Hong Kong

The morning began with London's large bars at 25 for the near-term and 3125 up for the long-term. New York silver prices rose by half a point. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British against American remained unchanged, against Shanghai down by a small half a penny, against France up by a large 100 francs. Exchange rates for American against other currencies were not received. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 3 pence and 8125 for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which were slightly tighter by 0.03125 for British gold and slightly softer by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the previous closing. After the opening, the situation was stable, with no significant changes. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes. And the silver parity tax was revealed, up by a large 1.25. After that, Hong Kong suddenly increased selling pressure, selling spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 906115, and spot US dollars at 6.5625 and 625 to foreign banks such as HSBC and a certain American bank. Subsequently, some Shanghai merchants also slightly sold spot British gold at 3 pence 90625 and 9375 to HSBC. As a result, the process was somewhat firmer. Afterwards, Sassoon, a Western firm, suddenly intervened with purchases, and the Bank of England also absorbed some, causing the market to immediately stabilize. Sassoon favorably absorbed spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 8125, and spot US dollars at 6.5625 and 4375 from foreign banks such as HSBC. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 84375 for British gold and 6.5 yuan for the US dollar.

Sassoon Re-emerges After Entering the Market

The market situation was extremely stable in the early afternoon. However, after 2:30 PM, due to renewed selling pressure from Hong Kong, Sassoon also re-emerged with sales, causing the situation to be stable with a slight tendency to firm. Hong Kong and Sassoon consecutively sold spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 90625, and spot US dollars at 6.525 and 625 to foreign banks such as HSBC. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 875 for British gold and 6.5625 yuan for the US dollar. This month's British gold was 3 pence 84375 and the US dollar was 6.5 yuan. As a result, British gold and the US dollar were weaker by 0.03125 and firmer by 0.06215, respectively, compared to the previous day.

### Hong Kong Speculators Emerge, Gold Prices Slightly Decline - Bidding Opens at 3,800 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold market was weak and unstable. Trading activity was small and the trend was generally flat. Overall it fluctuated throughout the day. Ultimately, due to the weakening of foreign exchange and the re-emergence of Hong Kong speculators, prices fell by 105 yuan. Initially, strong buying interest from a certain money exchange dealer, combined with slightly weaker foreign exchange rates, caused the morning opening to surge to a peak of 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, the sudden weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered a wave of selling. Silver shops and a certain bank competed to sell, causing prices to plummet to 3,820 yuan. Later, with the rebound of foreign exchange rates, securities firms and gold dealers took the opportunity to aggressively bid, briefly reaching 3,950 yuan again. Afterwards, money exchange dealers, acting on behalf of Hong Kong speculators, increased selling pressure, causing the afternoon closing price to fall to 3,870 yuan. In the afternoon, money exchange dealers continued to sell for Hong Kong speculators, and due to a lack of buyers, the opening price was lowered to 3,800 yuan. Soon, securities firms suddenly increased buying interest, pushing prices up to 3,900 yuan. Ultimately, due to strong foreign exchange rates, prices retreated to 3,855 yuan at the closing. However, daily trading volume remained high, at over 1,700 taels. Ornamental gold was priced 10 yuan lower. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Plunges by Over 100 Yuan

Since the morning opening, each bar (10 taels) saw a high opening of 90 yuan due to strong buying interest from a certain money exchange dealer and slightly weaker foreign exchange rates, with few sellers. A certain money exchange dealer bought from a gold shop at 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, the sudden weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered a wave of selling. Silver shops frequently offered to sell, and retail investors sold more than they bought, causing prices to plummet by 150 yuan. A certain stockbroker sold 30 taels for 3,900 yuan. Later, a certain broker absorbed 50 taels on behalf of clients, briefly pulling prices up to 3,950 yuan. However, due to the rush of sellers, certain banks aggressively sold on behalf of clients, causing prices to fall sharply again, plunging by 130 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to a money exchange dealer at 3,820 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver shop suddenly increased buying interest and urgently reversed its position. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from a gold shop, and another 10 taels from a peer, at 3,900 yuan. Later, due to the aggressive sale of over 100 taels by a cash shop, prices fell back to 3,850 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange rates suddenly strengthened, and securities firms and gold dealers scrambled to absorb the supply. Although money exchange dealers sold more than they bought, continuous buying from a certain silver shop caused prices to soar by 100 yuan. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange dealer for 3,950 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange dealer became increasingly eager to sell, and a certain gold dealer also followed suit, causing prices to weaken again, eventually falling by 110 yuan. Gold dealers traded 10 taels among themselves for 3,840 yuan. At noon, prices rebounded slightly, with a money exchange dealer buying 20 taels from a silver shop for 3,870 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The afternoon opening saw a steep decline of 70 yuan due to strong selling interest from a certain money exchange dealer and a lack of forward-looking purchases. A certain gold dealer bought 20 taels from a money exchange dealer for 3,800 yuan. Later, the buying power of a certain gold dealer and securities firms was still strong. Although a certain money exchange dealer continued to sell, demand still exceeded supply, causing prices to soar by 100 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a silver shop for 3,900 yuan. Afterwards, hearing that foreign exchange rates were weakening, buying interest subsided, and money exchange dealers and silver shops scrambled to sell, causing prices to fall by 45 yuan. A money exchange dealer sold 30 taels to a certain bank for 3,855 yuan, setting the evening closing price. Compared to the previous day, spot gold fell by 105 yuan. It was reported that after the closing, a money exchange dealer sold three portions to a gold shop for 3,850 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 250 yuan. The selling price of cash shops was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, while the actual price of gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed price. Transactions were rare.

Ornamental Gold Also Lowered by 10 Yuan

### Discount Rate Continues to Decline

It weakened further in the afternoon, hitting a low of 135 yuan, and then 137.5 yuan, which was 7 yuan lower than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Exchange Association's interbank lending rate was still at 20%, it was said, for both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Foreign Currencies Mostly Fall, Few Rise

Yesterday's foreign currency market gradually stabilized. Consequently, businesses have reverted to their old ways before the German-Polish conflict. Apart from German gold bills, which are still not being traded, all other currencies are being bought and sold as usual. Prices have generally fallen compared to September 1st. Singapore and rupee notes each fell by 10 cents, Dutch notes fell by 20 cents, and Swiss notes fell by 30 cents. Only Philippine notes rose by 20 cents. Other currencies are generally soft. British notes fell by 50 cents, British pounds fell by 3 yuan, American notes and Hong Kong dollars both fell by 5 cents, French franc notes rebounded by 3 cents, and Annam notes also rose by 20 cents. Japanese gold notes rose sharply but then fell back, once reaching 1.3 yuan, eventually settling at 1.272 yuan, resulting in a continued increase of 2.4 cents. Korean notes also showed a strong trend, rising by 2 cents to a price of 1.105 yuan.

### British and American Silver Prices Continue to Rise

London, 7th. In the silver market, Indian imports and exports are operating concurrently, while short sellers are covering positions. The market is generally flat. Few transactions are being made at the listed price. Large silver bars are at 25 for the near-term and 3125 up for the long-term. New York silver report, American spot has increased by half a point.

### Cotton Yarn: New Changyin Cotton Arrives on the Market - Opening Price at 127 Yuan

The trading of spot cotton between Chinese and foreign merchants is bustling and the trend is unusually lively. This situation is entirely due to the outbreak of the World War, with various countries collecting and storing cotton as a military necessity. Consequently, the three major cotton markets in Europe and America have soared in unison. Telegrams from American cotton markets suddenly jumped by 70-80 points, and spot middling has risen to 10 cents. This has startled the market and boosted the buying intentions of businesses, leading to increased transactions in the market. The merchant group purchased 1,000 bales of white low middling cotton, with prices starting at 141.5 yuan and reaching 150 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. At the same time, Chinese factories, recognizing this trend, have also changed their approach and actively sourced materials. Yesterday, Shui'an, Rongfeng, and other British and Unity, Chongxin factories purchased a total of 800 bales of Indian cotton. 200 bales of 10-count coarse yarn raw material Pingguo'er were transacted, with prices up by 6.75 yuan compared to the previous day. Brazilian cotton rose by 8 yuan, and new Tonghua cotton rose by 8-9 yuan. However, Japanese factories have not yet taken action. Under these market conditions, factory activity should lead to continued price increases in the market. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is abundant, with 621 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving at the docks. The current spot cotton situation is recorded below:

Special News: Since its arrival on the market, the selling price of new Tonghua cotton has been steadily increasing. New Changyin sand cotton also opened at 127.5 yuan. According to industry sources, Yiyang, Zhejiang, had favorable weather conditions from the time of sowing, with suitable temperature and humidity, resulting in healthy growth and early sales. Prices there are 55-60 yuan per sima catty. Shanghai is not expected to receive shipments in the near future.

Additional News: In Shanghai, overseas cotton transactions have seen soaring prices in overseas cotton markets in recent days. The exchange rate in this city is also tight, making the converted cotton prices particularly high. Furthermore, since the Customs Revenue Department's tariff adjustment, customs duties are now subject to manipulation. At present, each bale of raw cotton requires an import tax of 10.71 yuan, an increase of over 5 yuan compared to the past. Therefore, overseas cotton transactions have been particularly active. All parties are purchasing as much as possible, but there is a shortage of goods to meet demand. Brazilian cotton of 32 count has reached a high price of 190 yuan, and raw cotton of 42 count is priced at over 230 yuan. However, the Song'an bank still quotes 3 yuan lower. Moreover, the shipment of cotton to Shanghai is difficult and the risk of war has greatly increased. Therefore, all parties are willing to purchase spot goods. This is the reason.

Overseas Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, the initial market yesterday was particularly firm due to speculative purchases. Later, due to the soaring prices of stock cotton, sentiment was particularly strong. The market suddenly jumped by 50 points at the close due to enthusiastic buyers. The Indian cotton market was relatively quiet and is expected to rise by 2-3 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by 50 points. In the Liverpool cotton market, the government ordered restrictions on trading, so the cotton market was particularly calm.

### Sudden Increase in Demand for Single Yarn

The yarn market is increasingly stable. Although actual demand is weak, continuous purchases from Hong Kong merchants mean the demand for 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd brands is comparatively higher, and selling prices have risen. As for 20-count Inu-Onna and Double Globe brands, due to their lower prices compared to Double Horse, businesses generally use them as tools, buying and selling at will, causing market prices to fluctuate. Transactions of 10-count coarse yarn have been largely stagnant. Due to the off-season, inquiries are rare, and the market is sluggish. Cloth factories have slightly increased demand for 32-count single yarn, and the market has become more active. Coupled with expensive raw materials, there has been a recent significant upturn. Yesterday, the Xie Ma warehouse order price was uniquely discounted because the 3,000 bales issued the day before were required to be paid in full by tomorrow. If the warehouse order is not cashed, the contract will be canceled. However, factories that had close contact can have them transferred.

At the current yarn market opening, the weakness from the previous day's afternoon market continued. 40 bales of 20-count Double Globe were transacted at 620-623 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. Shortly after, news of a weaker foreign exchange opening boosted buying interest and market prices gradually increased. Double Globe rose to 642 yuan, the Double Horse warehouse order price was 635-642 yuan, and the spot price was 690-692 yuan. There was a slight setback midway, but ultimately the warehouse order price for Xie was slightly lower. It is estimated that 1,625 bales were transacted in half a day. Market conditions showed an increase of 6 yuan for Double, 10 yuan for Shepherd, and 10 yuan for Double Globe. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:

Afternoon News: Sentiment in the cotton yarn market is good. Due to soaring raw cotton prices, buyers are quite active. It is said that the closing market price will increase, but no one is willing to sell and waiting to see what will happen tomorrow.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Increase - Demand from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Southeast Asia

Domestic Cloth

Cloth prices continue to rise due to changing market conditions, attracting buyers from various regions. Demand for white cloth and coarse cloth from Ningbo, Wenzhou, Southeast Asian merchants, foreign merchants, and local merchants remains strong. Factories are slow to release goods and spot prices have increased by 1-2.5 cents per piece. Fine cloth and fine twill, purchased by merchants from Shandong, and dyeing factories have also become more active with the price of each bolt bolt rising by 10-20 cents.

Fine twill sales were stable. The merchants on this street all unanimously believe in an increase, the therefore the number of purchases exceeded the number of sales. However, a total of around four to five hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill are traded daily.

### Grains: Early and Late Rice Initially Rises, Then Falls

Du Early Rice: There were still no shipments arriving from He Xia yesterday. And only over two thousand bales of Che Lun Bao Zi arrived. As a result, the early market saw a renewed sense of optimism, and prices for all goods were raised by 2-3 yuan. Later, due to insufficient actual demand, the situation weakened, and the market quickly retreated. As a result, the best new early rice saw initial gains followed by declines, while the price of thick early rice remained high due to a lack of inventory. It is estimated that excellent tin early rice sold for 40-38.9 yuan, medium grade 37 yuan, Wu Kun white early rice 38 yuan, medium/secondary 37 yuan, He Xia early/late rice 33.45 yuan, original bale 37-36.5 yuan, old Du glutinous sharp rice dropped from 30 yuan to 28 yuan, new sharp rice dropped from 30 yuan to 27-28 yuan, Jiangbei new sharp rice opened at 30 yuan, then closed at only 28-27.5 yuan, Jiaxing and Jiashan new Chuan sharp rice 27 yuan, Yang Tuan sharp rice 27-28 yuan, Bian Yuan 30 yuan. It is estimated that the entire city only traded 4-5 thousand bales.

Regular Early Rice: Both shop and warehouse trading was active in the morning, and market prices rose by around 2 yuan. Subsequently, news came that foreign rice shipments had arrived and more were scheduled to arrive, as well as 4-5 thousand bales of Jiangbei new early rice arriving, and Jiangbei early rice that was en route or had been confiscated would arrive to Shanghai tomorrow or the day after. Sentiment weakened, and buying interest fell off. The seller, unable to sell at high prices, quickly sold to recover as much as they could. Market prices quickly fell by as much as 2-3 yuan, and were lower than the previous day's market prices by over 1 yuan. The price of Jiangbei new early rice, which initially opened at 29.5 yuan, fell back to 27-28 yuan, while medium grade was only 25-26 yuan.

### Flour Sales to the North Increase - Factory Prices Increase by Another 1 Cent - Wheat Prices are High for Superior Quality, Secondary Quality Also Rises

Flour: Yesterday, the factory price increased by another cent, now being sold for 6.7 yuan in cash. Ever since the international situation changed, it has been difficult to suppress future grain prices. And the launch of flour sales to the north, led by northern merchants, has boosted sentiment, and domestic and foreign warehouse holders have absorbed even more of the recirculated goods. Selling prices have increased to 6.85-6.9 yuan. Yesterday, active purchases continued from this street. Fragmentary purchases were also made by northern merchants. Total transactions were estimated at over 50,000 bags.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market also rose. Shipments from various routes continue to be received. Factories also continue to actively purchase and warehouses also continue to absorb. However, high prices for quality goods and high demand have resulted in an increase, secondary goods were particularly popular. As a result, the market continues to show high prices for superior goods and slightly increased prices for secondary goods. Throughout the city, the joint venture of the Shan Zui, Feng Fu, and Xin two factories sold 6-7 thousand bags, and warehouses received over 30 truckloads of wheat, with the highest price still being 10.008 yuan, and 9.9-8.9 yuan, secondary goods rose by around 1 cent compared to before.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Beans Become Stable

In the market for miscellaneous grains and oil beans, the market was in a state of flux yesterday. Containerized bean oil was inquired about by Hong Kong merchants, and prices rose by 0.1-0.5 yuan. Other barrel oil continued to fall by 0.5-0.6 yuan. Total transactions were 400 barrels, 300 pieces, and 200 of various oils. There was a sense that the supply of peanut oil could not meet demand, and prices have not yet been set.

In unofficial trading the day before, Class C debt had been traded at over 44 yuan, but it did not continue to rise yesterday. As a result, there was little trading activity, and buying was not enthusiastic. Total transactions were estimated at four to five tens of thousands, with most purchases by Lianyi, Lianhe, and No. 25 companies, and sales by No. 8, No. 60, and Hengfu.

### Britain Denies Withdrawing Troops, Determined to Maintain Status Quo of Concessions; Shanghai Rumors Abound, None Verified; Foreign Nationals Have All Resumed Normal Work

On the second day after the Japanese government formally declared war on the cowardly British regarding Guangzhou (the 5th), it used the excuse of advising the warring nations of England, France, Germany, and Poland to avoid unfortunate incidents in China, and demanded that England and France withdraw their troops from Japanese-occupied areas. Currently, the Japanese side is conducting parallel diplomatic actions from both Tokyo and Shanghai. We have no way of speculating on the attitudes of London and Paris. However, according to the opinions of British officials, Germany and Poland have no troops stationed in China, which is not enough to constitute a factor that would cause unfortunate incidents, and all believe that there is no need to withdraw troops. Rumors about troop withdrawal in Shanghai are rampant, mostly based on hearsay and speculation, and none have been verified. Currently, foreign nationals have resumed normal life and are carrying out their respective duties. Here is a compilation of news obtained yesterday, detailed below:

### Britain Has Not Considered Withdrawing Far East Troops

The Japanese Navy Officer Dāng Xún requested on the 6th to the naval commanders of England and Italy to accept other proposals from the Japanese side, to avoid unfortunate incidents in China due to the European war. The day before yesterday, Vice Admiral Rū Chuān, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, sent his chief of staff, Cǎo Lù, as his representative to visit the commanders of the American Asian Fleet, Hè Wǎn, and Italian naval commander, Lieutenant Commander Lā Mò Suǒ, to explain the request that the Japanese side had made to the cowardly and flustered nations, and asked for their understanding. It is also heard that Japanese naval auxiliary officer, Guāng Yán, visited the German consul in Shanghai, Fèi Xī, mistakenly calling it tomorrow. Regarding the intention of this move,

Japanese Consul Visited Polish Consul

According to diplomatic sources, Chief Consul Èr Yóu Yì Qiū, the day before yesterday afternoon, visited the Polish Consul in Shanghai, Bào Hè Mò Lǐ Zhī, to make the same request as to England, France, and Germany, asking all warring nations to avoid unfortunate incidents in China, and to explain Prime Minister Ān Bù Xìn Xíng's declaration of a policy of non-interference in the European war.

British Embassy Denies Withdrawal of Troops

Confirmed news: the British Embassy officially denied yesterday that it had received instructions from the British government to order the withdrawal of British army and navy from Japanese-occupied areas. The embassy spokesperson stated that the Japanese side's suggestion to withdraw British troops had been forwarded to the British government, but London has not yet issued instructions. To the best of his knowledge, the "Japan Times", a Japanese Foreign Ministry mouthpiece newspaper published in Beijing, stated that the British army and navy were about to leave Shanghai, which is absolutely impossible.

Reportedly Has Not Considered This

A reporter from the Dà Zhōng News Agency visited an important official at the British Consulate yesterday at 3 p.m. to inquire about the British side's view of the Japanese diplomatic move. He said that the consul had visited the English and Italian consuls on the 6th, and the Polish consul had also been met. Sān Pǔ's request was clear, but since Germany and Poland have no troops stationed in Shanghai, how can conflict occur? As of now, I have not heard that Britain has considered withdrawing troops. Britain is determined to maintain the position of the concessions as in the past, knowing full well that once the British troops leave, other countries' troops will soon follow.

Japanese Newspaper Promotion Has Another Purpose

According to the Tokyo English "Japan Times" the day before yesterday (the 7th) there was the following comment: "Japan has now declared neutrality, according to international law, Japan has the right to demand that the warring countries withdraw their troops from the occupied areas. Japan has not yet formally made the request, but British troops and warships have withdrawn from Chinese territory, such as warships sailing to Singapore, troops sailing to Hong Kong, leaving only a few British and French gunboats in the Yangtze River that cannot sail in the ocean." Now that the content of this comment has been denied by the British ambassador and the British Consulate, it can be seen that it is another Japanese propaganda effort.

### Shanghai Foreign Community Gradually Returning to Normal

The Shanghai Times reported that the people of the warring and neutral countries residing in Shanghai are focusing all their attention on the latest European telegrams and wireless news. However, not much has been seen so far of the developments arising from the European crisis in Shanghai. Rumors spread throughout the city all day long, such as the British and French troops withdrawing from Shanghai, Polish expatriates leaving Shanghai to return to their countries to join the army, and German property being seized, none of which can be verified.

Generally speaking, the excitement caused in this city by the news of the outbreak of war on Sunday night has gradually stabilized and returned to normal life.

British Merchant Ships Sail as Usual

Although the ocean merchants' ships in this city have resumed sailing, the schedules cannot be predetermined due to the small number of ships.

### Customs Forced to Accept Huáxīng Notes; Britain Protests to Japan; US and France to Submit Similar Notes; Britain Seeks to Protect Integrity of Shanghai Customs

Associated Press London, 8th: The British government protested to the Japanese government yesterday about the use of "Huáxīng Bank" banknotes that were moved by the Japanese side in Shanghai, making it clear to the Japanese side that Britain was not concentrating all its attention on the European war. Diplomatic circles here predict that the United States and France will submit the same protests to the Japanese side. The increased circulation of "Huáxīng" banknotes in Shanghai is a Japanese attempt to control Shanghai's import and export trade. The purpose of the British note is to protect the integrity of the administrative power of the Shanghai Customs. The British protest was submitted to the Tokyo government yesterday by the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Kè Lái Yīng.

### Two More People Assassinated Last Night; Wáng Zhòng Yuán and Liú Liáng Both Died After Being Shot

In the past two days, the shooting cases in the Public Concession of this city can be described as frequent and shocking. Just as the cases of Xǔ Yě Fū and Niè Hǎi Fān were submitted to the General Court for examination yesterday morning, unexpectedly, at 8:15 last night, another shooting case occurred on Fúzhōu Road, Dàxīn Street, with two people being shot, both of whom died successively. The details of the situation are described below:

Wáng Hosts Banquet Upstairs at Zhì Měi Building

Fúzhōu Road near Húběi Road (i.e., Dàxīn Street) has always been a concentration point for food and accommodation. Restaurants are lined up and hotels are close together, so every time the lights come on, it becomes lively, bustling, and crowded. The sound of calling for wine and playing finger-guessing games can often be heard on the road. The Beijing-Sichuan Restaurant Zhì Měi Building, because things are gathered by type, is also located at No. 519 Fúzhōu Road. On weekdays, because the dishes of the restaurant are well prepared and delicious, the business is quite good and it is loved by the general northern relatives. The day before yesterday, the accounting room of the restaurant received a phone call from a Wáng surname to order dishes. According to the information, it was agreed to come to eat last night. At that time, the restaurant designated room No. 1 upstairs as its reserved seat, and prepared a table of 14 yuan Beijing cuisine according to Wáng's instructions.

Encountering Violent Guests While Going Downstairs in Droves

Until about 6:30 last night, the Wáng surname person who ordered the dishes arrived on time. Observing his speech, he was a relative from Yanbei. After the bellboy greeted him and served tea, other guests also arrived one after another, totaling eight or nine people. They sat around a round table, and the host greeted them to order dishes and pour wine to eat together. They talked to each other and the words were joyful. They drank until about 8:15 in the afternoon, when they finished their meals, drank some tea, tidied their clothes, and were about to leave. As the eight or nine guests were walking down the half-staircase, two men in long-sleeved shirts suddenly broke into the restaurant from outside the door, each taking out a pistol and firing at the host Wáng and another guest, totaling more than ten shots.

Host Wáng Died on the Spot

At that time, other guests and servants in the restaurant were shocked by the sudden and terrifying act, and they ran and hid. However, the Wáng surname person and another guest had already been shot one after another and fell on the stairs. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the murderer immediately turned around, went out, and fled. At this moment, the nearby guards had already arrived due to hearing the gunfire. Seeing that the injured were barely breathing, they immediately reported to the police station, and a car was dispatched to take the two to Rénjì Hospital for treatment. However, the Wáng surname host had already died on the spot due to serious injuries, with a total of two shots in the body, one bullet entering from the back of the head and exiting from the left limit, and one bullet hitting the right waist. According to the guests, his name was Wáng Shēn Yuán, wearing a gray silk shirt and a white silk short bridge. However, his age and position are still under investigation.

Liú Liáng Died at the Hospital

Another guest who was shot was wounded in the abdomen, with a total of four bullets. When he was sent to the hospital, it was learned that his spirit was still performing. When the hospital asked him for his name and origin, he could barely answer that his surname was Liú and his name was Liáng, from Tiānjīn, 38 years old. When asked again, he was already slurring. Therefore, his address was not obtained. He was wearing a gray western-style suit. After the hospital administered emergency treatment, he ultimately succumbed to his injuries and died at 9:15 that night. All two corpses are still in the hospital's morgue, and will be sent to the morgue tomorrow morning for court examination. On one side, they are trying to find the family of the deceased and investigate the case.

Whether a Lawyer Has Not Yet Been Ascertained

After the case occurred, there were many rumors about the Liú surname person, and one saying claimed that his name was Liú Yǒng. At the same time, there is still one thing to mention: Attorney Liú Liáng from the legal profession in this city had not returned to his office as of midnight last night. The reporter went to visit, but there was no one in his residence, only a clerk who had just been hired. It is said that Attorney Liú Liáng received a phone call from a friend at 4 p.m. yesterday, inviting him out for a late dinner. The clothes he wore were also a gray suit. Although his origin is Yánchéng, it is also related to Tiānjīn. It is also learned that after learning of the case from the outside world, he had already sent out urgent messengers to explore the whereabouts of Attorney Liú Liáng. However, as of midnight, no news had been received, nor had the urgent messenger returned to the residence to report.

### New Auxiliary Coin Notes to Be Issued Soon; Amount of Change Undecided; Public Cars Issue Five-Cent Tokens; Salted Fish Industry Token Notes to Be Recalled by Deadline

The branch of the Central Bank of this city, under the order of the head office, printed the new auxiliary coin notes in Hong Kong and transported them to Shanghai for raising. Originally scheduled to be officially issued on the 21st of last month, the issuance was temporarily suspended due to the discovery of counterfeit notes with reproduced samples in the market. All industries are eagerly awaiting the issuance of the new notes due to the need for change. The Central Bank is extremely cautious in issuing scattered loyal notes. Although this new note is a cent and five cents, its credit is equal to that of the French Concession, and because sample copies were found to be misused in advance, it is necessary to consider the matter carefully to avoid causing unnecessary losses to the common people. Now the Central Bank is very concerned about the need for auxiliary coin notes in the market and has decided to officially issue them as soon as possible, hoping that all industries will not have any doubts. As for the amount of issuance, whether it is still 500,000 yuan, it is intended to wait for the order of the head office to decide.

Counterfeit Tokens Endanger the Common People

The blue token notes jointly issued by the salted fish industry in this port have been recalled as scheduled in order to establish credit, due to the discovery of counterfeit notes in the market. As for the one-cent, two-cent, and three-cent token notes issued by the public concession tram company, the company has also announced that it will recall them at the face value of the notes in cash within the deadline, and will refuse to use them after the deadline due to the discovery of counterfeit notes. The effective period of the newly issued notes has also been specified. As for the token notes printed by other stores themselves, there are thousands of varieties and styles. It is estimated that there are more than a thousand kinds, and counterfeit notes also occur continuously. Because the printing paper is mostly inferior, and there is fundamentally no way to distinguish the true from the false, so general villains take the opportunity to mix and print them, and even forge the names of stores and issue them, resulting in the flooding of counterfeit tokens in the market, which is very harmful to the common people.

Public Buses Issue New Tokens

The British public bus company in this city usually has an aluminum four-cent token, commonly known as a "coupon," circulating on the bus. Since the shortage of copper auxiliary money, the token has been insufficient, so a two-cent coin has been issued. However, because the auxiliary money panic has become more and more serious in recent days, the company's tokens have flowed into the market for wide circulation, and it is still difficult to make change for bus fares. Therefore, the company issued a zinc round five-cent token yesterday. The size is equal to a one-cent copper auxiliary coin. It is rumored that although the value of the coin is five cents, the casting price is seven cents, with the intention of preventing counterfeiting.

Due to his injuries, he passed away at 4:50 p.m. His body was sent to the Jiao Zhou Road morgue by the police, and after being examined by the inspecting officer of the first special zone at 10 a.m. yesterday, it was claimed by Xǔ's nephew and carried to the World Funeral Home on Kang Nǎo Tuō Road. The coffin is scheduled to be sealed at 2 p.m. today. Xǔ is survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters, all in his hometown of Tiāntái, Zhejiang. Now, his relatives and friends in Shanghai have formed Xǔ's Funeral Committee to handle everything. It is heard that Xǔ served the Shanghai municipal organs for many years and made many achievements. His handling of social events was fair and upright, and he was especially respected by all circles. After August 13th, he went to the mainland. He came to Shanghai for treatment due to illness, and unexpectedly this happened. Xǔ was not good at accumulating wealth, and although he served society for many years, his family is still very poor.

### Niè Hǎi Fān Was Dressed for Burial Yesterday

Because the management was quite successful, it was approved by the Ministry of Education within half a year. Only because after the August 13th Incident, Mr. Niè strictly adhered to his position and was unyielding, he was poisoned by thugs. Mr. Niè's family members are all in Húnán.

Extremely desolate

The funeral expenses were also allocated by the relief society for 500 yuan for use. Mr. Niè usually lived in a small room in the school, and his life was simple. The school affairs of Dà Hǎi Middle School are still being maintained in accordance with Mr. Niè's original intention.

At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Public Concession Police Department dispatched two red police vehicles to park at the intersection of Àiduōyà Road and Tóng Chuān Road for guard. There were also five teams of eight British, Indian, and Chinese patrolmen, each holding rifles and pistols, set up posts to inspect passing pedestrians, which was quite strict. On the French Concession side, a gray armored vehicle was originally stationed there at the intersection of the Catholic Church Street. At this time, the French police station also sent an armored vehicle loaded with French, Russian, Chinese, and Vietnamese armed patrolmen to the area. The patrolmen got off the vehicle and set up posts, also inspecting pedestrians. For a time, the situation was quite tense. After about an hour, the police vehicles and patrolmen of the Public Concession first withdrew.

The location must be a public place in order to gain the trust of the society. It must be close to the poor areas to facilitate the poor. At that time, a cashier will be set up to collect the money from those who buy the rice and hand it over to that place, and a steel essence token will be issued (divided into two yuan, one yuan, five cents, etc.). With this token, they can collect the rice. Every day, the rice number will distribute 50 or 100 bags of foreign rice to each flat sales point.

### West China Students Plagued by Poverty and Illness, Mentally Abnormally Excited, Many Suffering from Malaria, Typhus, and Typhoid Fever, Hoping for Donations from All Sectors of Shanghai—High Cost of Living, Everything is Difficult—

According to the Continental Press, tens of thousands of college and university students in western China are suffering from diseases and economic hardship, urgently needing relief. This news was revealed to reporters by Jiang Wenhan (transliteration), the executive secretary of the National Student Relief Committee and student affairs officer of the National Committee of the YMCA, upon his return to Shanghai. Mr. Jiang left Shanghai in early April to go to the inland areas.

He travelled through eight provinces, covering eight thousand miles, and returned to Shanghai at the beginning of this week. According to Mr. Jiang's account, while he was staying at the National Northwest University in Shaanxi, four students at the school died of malaria. The school had to raise funds to purchase coffins for them. Because the supply of quinine and other medicines was insufficient and the prices were very high, it was extremely difficult to provide students with adequate medical treatment to relieve malaria. Typhus and typhoid fever

are not uncommon, and in general, they cannot be properly cared for. The National Student Relief Committee is doing its best to help these students, but engaging in such work requires a lot of funds. Donations from all sectors are welcome, and please send them to the committee's office at 135 Museum Road. In addition to lacking medical care, students are also in financial straits.

In the inland areas, cloth shoes sell for foreign currency and Japanese yen, and leather shoes have even risen to thirty yuan. When Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University was about to fall, it moved to Weijiang, Yunnan. There are students from Guangdong at the school who need to be rescued. However, although the students are suffering hardships, their spirits are excellent. Despite the lack of necessary facilities and equipment, they are still diligently working satisfactorily. Mr. Jiang described the new location of Sun Yat-sen University, saying that the school authorities decided on the location because the area had many

temples. When Sun Yat-sen University moved in, it only needed to use the temples as classrooms. National Northwest University, formerly Northwest Associated University located in Xi'an? Divided into four colleges: Arts and Sciences, Teacher Training, Law and Commerce, and Medicine. However, the School of Agriculture is holding classes in Yucheng, Shaanxi.

### Koreans Trafficking Drugs, Two Locations Cracked in the Concessions

He then dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, who arrested Chen Shuibiao (from Wenzhou), Li Qingjian (from Tianjin), Yuan Chenglin (from Zhenjiang), and two Russians, and confiscated a large quantity of morphine. However, the main culprit, Zhang Ren, had fled after hearing the news. The arrested criminals were taken to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court yesterday. After Judge Jiang questioned them, he scheduled another hearing for the 16th of this month. The defendants were sent back to prison. Peng Zhengguan helped Wei Ren set up a private house at No. 45, Lane 201, Zhoujiazui Road, to provide people with heroin, from which he profited. The anti-narcotics department learned of this and raided the location the day before yesterday, arresting the Korean and Peng, as well as drug addicts Xian Benwu from Songjiang, Zhao Weishi, Sun Zhiyue, Li San Liuzi, Zhang Wensheng, Chen Dayou, and Li Guoshi, Li Changming and other eight people, fifteen packets of heroin, and more than a dozen drug-smoking guns. Yesterday morning, in addition to sending the Korean to the Japanese consulate for interrogation, the remaining criminals were transported along with the evidence to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court for trial. Because the defendants mostly admitted to smoking drugs, the court ordered them to be detained for examination.

### Falling to Death from a Building, Affecting the Owner of a Prostitution Den

Ni Liwen from Fujian, thirty years old this year, was formerly a foreign goods merchant and now resides at 366 Kangti Road in the Peng Concession. He currently works at a camphor factory, earning a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Because he is addicted to gambling and mahjong, his income is not enough to cover his expenses. He entrusted his wife and children to his mother-in-law to raise, and he himself recently became addicted to opium. At 7:00 PM on the 7th, he went to the prostitution den set up by Yang Lu, a woman from Tongzhou, in the front room on the third floor of An Yu Gong Piao Guan Xing at No. 27 Zilai Street to satisfy his addiction. While lying on the bed, smoking and exhaling smoke, a stranger suddenly arrived. Ni saw three burly men and suspected that they were detectives from the police station coming to arrest him. He quickly put down the opium pipe and tried to escape by jumping out of the window, resulting in a fall from a high place that injured his head. He was taken by ambulance to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After learning about the details of Ni's fall, the hospital, as usual, reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to arrest Yang Lu, the woman in the prostitution den, for investigation. Ni died of his injuries at 11:00 PM that night. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body to the morgue. Yesterday, an autopsy was performed. Yang Lu's opening of a prostitution den is being investigated by the police station and will be sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution today.

### Corruption Case Occurs in the Puppet "General Anti-Smoking Bureau," "Squad Leader" from Wuxi Embezzles and Flees, "Director" Zhu Yao Suspected of Involvement

After the establishment of the "Central China General Anti-Smoking Bureau," two months have passed, and branch bureaus in various counties have also been established one after another. "Director General" Zhu Yao (style name Xuchu) was reprimanded earlier for poor management and corruption in the bureau. Unexpectedly, misfortune did not come singly. Recently, a squad leader of the investigation team of the "Wuxi Branch Bureau," Xu Shaoyi, was originally a well-known local gangster who had been recruiting followers and receiving bribes for a living. He was a cousin of Zhu and was appointed to his current position. After taking office, he extorted money from smokers, collecting everything he could. He already possessed a huge fortune. A month ago, he was reported by local influential figures, and his corruption was exposed. He took his wives and concubines and fled to Shanghai, hiding in Qi Jia, Xinmin Lane, Airag Road. Since this case occurred, the higher authorities have been strictly pursuing the matter. It has been found that Zhu is suspected of colluding with Xu and engaging in corruption together. He will be dismissed and investigated.

### Yao Ruilian Sentenced to Imprisonment for Fraud, His Father Appears in Court to Defend Him, a Story Widely Praised in the Legal Community, Appeals to Overturn the Original Judgment, and the Police Lawyer Requests Dismissal

Yao Ruilian, the son of the famous lawyer Yao Jian, was found to have instructed Chen Lingmei, a bank clerk from Wu County, to use fraudulent methods to collect US dollars and defraud the Baotai Qianzhuang at 407 Sichuan Road of 1,500 US dollars due to the financial difficulties of the Yongan Bank he founded on November 19 last year. He went into hiding. In early June this year, he was arrested by Hua Shangpei, the deputy chief detective of the Old Gate Police Station.

Based on his confession, related criminals Zhang Chaohan, Chen's concubine Yang Zaili, Liu Gengsun, and Yang, who was instructed by the instigator Yao Ruilian, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Meng Tingke conducted the trial. Yao Ruilian and Chen Lingxiang were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for using fraudulent means to make people hand over property. Zhang Chaohan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for concealing stolen goods. Liu Gengsun was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. Shen Lili was acquitted. Yao appealed against the sentence and commissioned lawyer Fan Gang to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, President Yu Huating, accompanied by Judges Zhou and Shi,

opened a collegial panel to hear the case. Yao Jian (62 years old), the father of the appellant Yao Ruilian, who is also a lawyer, also appeared in court on time to defend him. After President Yu took his seat, he ordered Yao to be brought to the court before questioning him. He claimed that the original court sentenced him to imprisonment based on Chen Lingmei's confession, which was really unjust. He did not know Chen Lingmei at first, but because he often came to his office, he and Zhang Chaohan got to know each other. Later, he did not know how, but the bank deposit slip (500 yuan) in the writing room was stolen by him and used to purchase a draft from Xinfeng Bank to defraud Baotai Qianzhuang. He only found out about it after the case was exposed, and so on. Subsequently, Hua Shangpei, the deputy chief detective in charge of the case, reported that during the appeal period, he had investigated the relevant Jiufeng Bank (manager Xiao Qinfang) based on Chen's confession, but the bank had already closed down. According to the manager, Chen asked Xinfeng for a guarantor for the draft, and Chen commissioned Jiufeng Bank to provide a guarantee. No accidents occurred, but Xinfeng did not accept it, so the Yongan Bank manager (namely Zhuang Xiren Yao Ruilian) came forward to provide a guarantee, and Xinfeng issued the draft to Chenzhou. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. First, the police lawyer Gan argued that the appellant's purpose in this case was not to seek a reduction in the sentence, but to overturn the original confession in the hope of being declared innocent. The unfavorable confession of the co-offender Chen Lingmei in this case is completely consistent with the facts, and there is no injustice to the appellant. Furthermore, the evidence from Jiufeng Bank has also been verified. The court should dismiss the appeal and maintain the original judgment. Finally, defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yao Jian successively stood up and argued the case. The court was adjourned and the judgment was scheduled for the 5th of this month.

### Drug Dealer Stabs a Fellow Inmate During His Sentence, Animosity Due to Selling Drugs for the Prison Guard

Wang Fubao, a local from Shanghai, 28 years old this year, was arrested and prosecuted by the French police and sentenced to 12 years in prison for selling the drug morphine. He is currently serving his sentence in the Second Special Prison on Maxinnan Road. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month at noon, Wang used a knife to seriously injure a fellow inmate, Huang Shuncai, in prison. The guard reported this to the management department, which first sent Huang to Guangci Hospital for treatment and then shackled Wang and sent him to the French police station for investigation. Yesterday, the police sent the principal offender to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer, Yao Zongdi, explained the case, saying that the defendant used a knife to stab a fellow inmate, and the victim is currently being treated in the hospital and cannot be present in court today. He requested a postponement. Wang confessed that he had previously sold morphine for the prison guard Ren Guo Xiaoxun, and Huang Shuncai revealed that it was he who introduced him, causing him and Huang to become enemies. If he did not stab Huang, Huang would also harm him. Therefore, he sharpened the tin sheet and took the opportunity to stab him during mealtime on the 3rd to vent his anger, and so on. After verifying the confession, Judge Wu Kechou scheduled another hearing for the 12th and ordered the defendant to be detained.

Since the Battle of Shanghai, the Hongkou area has been in a special environment, and gambling dens have been active, colluding with Japanese rogues and using the excuse of establishing amusement parks to obtain licenses from the Japanese side and openly open gambling dens. The locations are mostly on Qizhou Street and Linping Road. Derun Road. All take the name of Yongyan Lu Liyuan Lu Theatre facade. Inside there is Pai Gow, Yaobo, Big and Small Gambling, which is extremely harmful to society.

The gamblers had good sources of information and escaped beforehand upon hearing the news, so only various gambling tools and two Cantonese gamblers were captured and taken to the police station for detention pending trial in the First Special Court.

### Nanshi Refugee Supervisory Committee Distributes Half the Relief Rice, With a One-Week Time Limit, and Will No Longer Distribute After That

The Nanshi Refugee Relief Supervisory Committee has recently been affected by the European War, making it difficult to raise relief funds, and the prices of all goods have soared, making it difficult to obtain supplies. Therefore, starting from the 8th, the committee has had to stop providing each resident civilian in the district with five taels of relief rice per day. There are as many as 19,000 people who have been receiving this relief rice, and they are all in a state of panic. At 8:00 AM yesterday, they gathered at the general office of the Supervisory Committee to petition, demanding that relief be provided as usual to maintain their lives. At the time, Gu Lun, the supervisor, came out to explain, expressing his sympathy for the sudden loss of relief to the civilians and apologizing. However, due to the increasingly difficult financial situation of the committee's international organization, it was even more difficult recently. Therefore, he had to tell them of this difficult situation. He felt unbearable for the civilians whose lives were at risk, so he made every effort to discuss the matter with the highest authorities of the Supervisory Committee. As a result, it was approved that the original amount of relief rice per person would continue to be distributed at half the amount for one week from the 9th to the 15th. After that, the relief would be stopped. Civilians who are truly impoverished may request to enter the shelters run by the committee to maintain their lives. Currently, the committee's shelters are continuing to provide relief and shelter, and there are approximately 19,000 refugees. The petitioning civilians could only helplessly accept the above measures and dispersed temporarily.

The owner reported the robbery and requested the police to investigate.

### Director of Dongtai China Bank Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement, Failure to Pay 5,000 Yuan in Remittances

According to the Yaowen News Agency, Yuan Xuting (33 years old, from Zhenhai), the owner of Yongshuang Rice Store at 277 Elida Road, recently hired lawyer Tang Huaicai to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Hua Shinian (currently the manager of the China Bank branch in Shanghai), the director of the Dongtai China Bank, of breach of trust and embezzlement. He also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to summon the defendant to court and investigate the matter according to law. According to his complaint, on August 21, 1938, the plaintiff sent Wei Baozuo to Tai County China Bank to remit 5,000 yuan to Shanghai. At that time, Hua Shinian, the director of Dongtai China Bank, was in the countryside and needed funds. After consulting with Wei Baozuo's consent, the money was handed over to Beitai with the agreement that it would be paid on time in Shanghai. The defendant issued a formal receipt, clearly stating that the money was handed over to the plaintiff. At that time, due to Jia's introduction, he knew that the defendant was a senior official of Dongtai Bank. Because Dongtai was occupied, he moved to Shanghai to work. There was nothing wrong with this arrangement. Unexpectedly, the defendant has not paid the money to this day. He has repeatedly sent people to urge him with the receipt, but he has repeatedly used various excuses to delay payment. His intentions are sinister, and he intends to embezzle the money. He has violated Article 335 and Article 342 of the Criminal Code and requests that he be punished according to law and ordered to repay 5,000 yuan and interest. The General Court approved the complaint, and Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Tribunal yesterday. The plaintiff stated the above process. The defendant was not present, but only submitted a defense statement, requesting a postponement and searching for evidence. Judge Sun verified the statements and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 10th for another hearing.

### On Deception

— Ci Kai

People in general particularly like to do good deeds: when they see a beggar, they give him pennies; when they see a fight, they break it up; and in terms of language, "deception" is also a good example. Old gentlemen say with stern faces, "Do not blame others, but blame oneself," "A gentleman helps others achieve good, not evil." In the well-known Zhu Zi's Family Instructions, there also seems to be a saying against mentioning others' faults; even as far back as the Spring and Autumn period, Confucius once pointed out the son's fault of "his father stealing a sheep, and the son testifying against him" very seriously, saying "The father conceals for the son, and the son conceals for the father, and uprightness is within it!" It can be seen that the origin of deception is very ancient. Now "deception" has evolved even further! It can even be added to the four basic human needs to become the five basic needs of "clothing," "food," "housing," "transportation," and "deception"; after all, there are those who gain face through deception, those who gain a "promotion" through deception, and those who rely solely on deception to eat fancy food, live in Western-style houses, and ride in cars. In short, those who deceive can at least have food to eat and won't starve to death. If Boyi and Shuqi saw this, wouldn't they be envious to death?

Although, we also occasionally encounter one or two first-class simpletons, who, because their son is a thief, or their brother a robber, steals a ring from the neighbor's wife or a few pennies from the neighbor, publicly declare a separation from them; but such simpletons are very rare in the world, and because there are so few of them, they can also be classified as "super-sages." As for the average person, they generally know some of the ABCs of deception, so they won't do such foolish things, because if your family member is a thief, many people are willing to "righteously conceal" it for him, and if you add your own silent concealment, you can settle the matter peacefully without spending a single soldier or weapon. If the good deeds of the victim's family are limited while the desires of the thief are endless, there will eventually be a time when even your family members will be implicated, then you might as well use money and power, and in this way, not only will the family scandal not be spread, but people will see that you have money to spend and power to exert, and they will be generous like you, and even praise and extol you!

Similarly, since we want to do good deeds, of course, we can't just conceal things for our close relatives and call it a day, but we can go even further and conceal things for the ancients as well. This way, they can rest in peace under the Yellow Springs, and as a result, there are those who leave behind a good reputation, but not even one who leaves behind a bad name. If you write a history, then you can publish it chapter by chapter outside the Earth: truly glorious! Indeed, the matter of "deceptive history" is of course an urgent task—"Yao and Shun ruled the country, while Zhi the Robber handled official business"; "Jiguang and San Gui are equally famous, Kou Zhun and Zhang Song are of the same ilk"; although it may seem a bit nonsensical, as long as the money is in hand, you can let the nonsense be nonsense!

### Banana Fortress

— Tang Naichang

From the Man Line of Wu Ya Yan to Xiao Tianba in the plains of Bhamo, Burma, the journey takes three days, all in the Savage Mountains.

After bidding farewell to the chieftain, we quickened our pace and left Man Line Street. It was about eight o'clock in the morning, and the rainy season in Wu Ya Dam had just passed, and the sun, which had been absent in February, was hanging in the sky again. The rotten leaves along the road faintly emitted an unpleasant smell. Everyone seemed to feel in their hearts that traveling there was somewhat of an adventure.

But soon we entered the mountain path.

The chaotic peaks lay horizontally between the Yunnan-Burma border, and the climate was exactly the same as the Indian peninsula. We walked slowly in the mountains, and the abundant trees and strong sunlight dressed up this winding mountain path in both brightness and emerald green. The long vines wrapped around the big trees, hanging with soft leaves, caressed our hair. The fragrance of unknown grasses and trees, along with the gentle mountain breeze, diligently swept the long road between the peaks for us. From the sparse places in the trees, we looked out and saw distant peaks embracing the dark green layers of trees, painting various graceful postures on the light blue sky; nearby, we could occasionally see one or two peacocks with their colorful coats opened, floating out of the green jade-like sea of leaves, and then quickly sinking back down. After we finished walking through the Gurkha area, we climbed another mountain peak and saw the Bhamo River, but because the ridges undulated, sometimes we could see the river water spraying white foam in the gorge, and we could also see wild elephants bathing in the water, but sometimes we were so far away that we couldn't even hear the roaring sound at all. The section of road within Chinese territory seemed a bit desolate, with wild grasses secretly clinging to people's trouser legs.

All day long, we walked, and the mountain scenery along the way had long chased away the fear in our hearts. Everyone walked silently, sometimes thinking of the peacock floating along in the green leaves just now, and the white foam spraying in the gorge seen from the mountain peak, and it always seemed like a five-colored illusion was being stirred before our eyes. Although our feet were moving, we couldn't see a single house with smoke rising from its chimneys. Sometimes, the sound of bells swayed far away, and when the peak turned and the road twisted, a caravan of horses carrying foreign goods, sweating and panting, appeared one by one, and then carried the sound of bells to the distant mountains. We all seemed to be traveling alone on this Savage Mountain road, feeling the loneliness of the empty mountains and the sorrow of travel.

Dusk enveloped the mountain road, and the god of night began to pull up the black curtain on the distant mountain over there, and we also arrived at this small mountain valley, and saw several grass roofs covered with banana and mango leaves, and the fresh blue cooking smoke that stirred up hunger was also rising in strands in the dim twilight sky, and the impatient evening breeze was also spinning on the roof.

Everyone shouted happily, and without asking, this was of course Banana Fortress. Walking to the bamboo fence gate, we encountered two savages with long knives hanging on their waists and chewing betel nuts. Their blood-like mouths and slippery eyes startled us greatly; however, the owner, who had the same face as us, had already greeted us. And the savage's lithe figure had already climbed down the hillside and disappeared into the dark and dense forest.

We stayed here, Banana Fortress was indeed the most suitable lodging place in this Savage Mountain valley.

Entering the house, everyone collapsed, ... after washing our feet in a wooden basin, eating mangoes and the dry food we had brought with us, and lighting a cigarette, we closed our eyes to rest for a while, but the several talkative Yunnan guests kept saying "Old fellow villager" and kept trying to chat with you, so I impatiently walked out; in the horse farm outside the house, there were horses of Han people carrying foreign goods, and yellow cattle of Bai people carrying rice. They were all staying in this fortress overnight as well, and several managers and inviters of horses were making wild fires in the open space. Now, it was pitch black outside, and the surrounding mountains stood dark and silent, and the monkeys' cries were also gradually becoming faint. However, the Bhamo River, which was very far away from this valley, was roaring with magnificent waves.

We fell asleep groggily, and faintly still heard the Bai people singing... In the middle of the night, someone set off, carrying a flashlight, and a beam of snow-white light moved towards the hillside. The horses and cattle in the horse farm, heavily loaded, came out of the wooden shed one by one. It was very dazzling, and we looked outside the house; there were Yunnan people, Bai people, and several soldiers carrying box cannons.

When we woke up early the next morning, the sunny and beautiful sunlight was once again covering the mountain valley, and red-bottomed monkeys were scurrying about in the forest. We were about to leave again. The owner, with a smile on his face, saw us out of the store. I suddenly remembered what had happened in the middle of the night, so I asked him:

"Are there also soldiers with weapons staying overnight here?" "Oh! There have been many lately," the owner said, "They are all transport teams, with horses and cattle carrying good things." The owner laughed happily.

So, I understood: those cattle and horses were no longer carrying foreign goods and rice; and Banana Valley in this Savage Mountain valley also contained the meaning of resisting the war.

### Neutral Stance

— Xue Sheng

### Tourist

— Zhu Manzhang

The birch bark cart rumbles across the snow,

The colorful flags flutter by the river,

That "suburban cold and island thin" landscape lies in the Xing'an Mountains,

Does that fishing net mourn the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River?

The old spring dream lingers in the ninth month sky,

The remnants of the old city are like interdependent lips and teeth,

Don't you have that kind of ticket,

Wandering alone year after year.

Why do you drift in the smoky southern suburbs?

And secretly shed tears for thoughts of your homeland?

But haven't worn your sable hat for many years?

I once saw you return happily from Yaksa,

Why don't you summon your courage to return to your hometown?

As long as you raise your hand to wipe away your tears—Hey!

Your laughter is enough to symbolize great light.

### Tide and Helmsman

— Ding Di

Several feet higher than during the day, the mountains seem shorter, the river seems wider, the sound of waves tearing silk rings deep into the night, the whirlpool is more turbulent, the water also flows east and west, people stand on the riverbank, the opposite bank is vast, a hazy black shadow, at this time you feel that your life is unbounded.

Life on the water easily makes people feel lonely, and river and sea travel is definitely not as connected as on land. As Owen seems to have said, the tide will add a distance to the journey on the water. The heart floats without boundaries. The violent waves hit the stones, and the small boats docked on the shore rock like cradles. The swaying and isolation of life is often a threat to a coward. Afraid of wind, afraid of rain, afraid of waves, afraid of tides, many boatmen love to sing the praises of calm and clear weather, the infantile disease of navigation needs good weather. Only seasoned old helmsmen are willing to fight against the terrible tides.

Happiness is the hope of people, and everyone is willing to always enjoy a piece of clear weather. On the sea of ​​life, there is never wind, no rain, no waves, no tides. But the road of life is always uneven; there is clear weather, there are tides; there is ordinariness. There are also strange dangers. Adventure is painful at the time, but becomes joy afterward. Life is the sea, like clear weather and tides, sorrow and joy are often mixed. If you can't hold the helm firmly, the boat will encounter a tragedy. Heavy rain and strong winds, a small boat, this explains the fate of many people who drowned.

The haze obscures everything, gradually moving towards the near sea. The mountain rain is about to come, and we must not forget the arrival of the tide. Ten thousand people are like the sea, and the sea is full of illusions, rich in imagination and exaggeration. It can swallow life, but there is also courage and calmness that can overcome it. Don't panic, that is just the tragic fate of a coward.

It is a huge tide that has never been seen before, and everyone is worried that they will be buried by the滔滔 sea water. Just imagine the terror of the tide, people bumping into each other, fingers scratching their hair, hearts hanging in mid-air, whispers intersecting in the streets, and no one can escape the terror. Those who avoid the tide are just making a layer of leather to wrap their bodies with an outer shell. Only the knowledgeable old helmsman is silent, repairs the helm, inspects the whole body of the ship, and prepares strength to deal with future dangers.

I have lived in Jiangcheng, and I am currently living in a coastal city; I know the tides. Sooner or later, it will come, and when it comes, it will definitely swallow many weak people. Hiding in a leather bag is naturally foolish, and panic is in vain.

The air pressure is low, the air is stuffy, and the tide brings news. On the islands by the sea, who sees the commanding old helmsman. What is woven by profit and loss is decadence, rouge, and luck.

We should know about the coming tide, this raging tide in the sea of ​​people, brings a recent message: the hurricane around the Ghost Festival. It seems that there will be a bigger tide soon, and we need to be good helmsmen.

The Artistic World

### A Brief Review of Modern Young Male Performers

— (Zheng Zi)

The role of young male performer in Peking opera is very important from an artistic standpoint, but today there is an unusual lack of young male performers, and critics are sighing. Here are my humble opinions, giving a brief review of the current young male performers.

(1) Jiang Miaoxiang—Excellent in singing, acting, and recitation. His voice may not be as sweet and mellow as it used to be due to his age. Miaoxiang cannot perform many martial arts plays, and can only perform civil young male roles, which is a slight deficiency.

(2) Yu Zhenfei—Has always been well-versed in Kunqu opera, and is respected as a master of the genre. He is slightly inferior in Peking opera. His collaboration with Yanqiu in the Qiusheng Society was quite effective in playing the green leaves to the peony flower. Since leaving the Qiusheng Society, he has not performed publicly for a long time!

(3) Ye Shenglan—His stage presence is rare among today's young male performers, and he can be called "second to none." He is skilled in both civil and martial arts, and possesses all the qualities that a young male performer should have. His martial arts are proficient, and his movements are clean and neat, not inferior to martial arts performers. In civil roles, he is romantic and suave, and stands out from the crowd. His singing is clear and mellow, and he is proficient in both Kunqu and Peking opera. It is no exaggeration to call him the leading young male performer of today.

(4) Ru Fulan—He switched from martial arts performer to young male performer, so his martial arts plays are better than his civil plays. His voice and recitation are both lacking, and he has not shed the tone of a martial arts performer, which should be changed.

(5) Gu Jiesun—His recitation, singing, and acting are all quite standard. Because he is a amateur who went professional, his martial arts are lacking. His appearance is plain and simple, suitable for playing impoverished students. He does not look imposing with pheasant feathers.

(6) Jin Zhongren—Although this old man is still dedicated to the stage, his voice is non-existent due to his age. Recently, he has become fat, and his appearance is bloated and unsightly. He cannot perform any of the standard singing and acting plays for young male performers.

(7) Gao Weilian—His voice is clear and his singing is quite pleasant to listen to. His appearance is also beautiful. Because he is also an amateur who went professional, his martial arts are also lacking. He is currently performing with Li Shaochun.

(8) Shang Fuxia—Her body is too fat and her appearance is not good. Although she came from the Fuliancheng Society, she is not good at martial arts plays. She is better at playing female roles in addition to young male roles.

(9) Jiang Shiyu—Shiyu is acceptable in civil roles, but I have not seen any merits in his martial young male roles. He has unexpectedly become very popular this time in Shanghai, and should work harder in the future.

(10) Li Debin—His pheasant feather plays have a unique quality, and he is proficient in both civil and martial arts.

Written off the top of my head, just enough for ten people. Others, such as Cheng Jixian, Wang Youquan, and Zhou Weijun, are not included because they have either stopped performing or I have not seen them.

Son of a Flute Player Becomes Mayor

The Zhao, Wang, and Yuan that I mentioned above really knew how to spend money when they were popular. Let's just take Li Wanchun in the opera troupe as an example. At that time, he was only a teenager, and everyone thought he was smart and clever. These people all scrambled to take him as their godson, and the gift for kowtowing was a thousand or two thousand taels. When they were playing Pai Gow with the dog meat general (i.e., playing Pai Gow), no matter who was the dealer, if they won three or five hundred thousand, they would just grab a handful of banknotes and bank drafts and stuff them into the hands of the idle actors behind them, and this would be several thousand or several hundred in one go. So I often say that the rise in the status of actors and the origin of their development of bad habits such as extravagance and debauchery began in the Zhilu era. Later, when Long-Legged Jinan was killed, most of the famous actors shed a tear of sympathy, because they had earned too much of his money.

In that period, it was so easy to become an official, so the son of a flute player actually became the mayor of a city in North China. This person had graduated from a university in Beijing. Because he had a fairly handsome face and had studied female roles with Wang Laogong, he and Shen became the young marshal's playmates. When Chen Twelve (Yanchong) was alive, he went to Guanwai one year and witnessed many of their pranks. At that time, the Yantang Conference was being held, and the old actor Qian Jinfu also went to Guanwai from Ping. At that time, he was suddenly summoned by the young marshal, who said that your facial makeup is said to be the best in the world, so please draw a big face for me. As he spoke, he ordered Hu to take off his pants and expose his snow-white, extremely fat buttocks for Jinfu to draw on. Hu was unwilling at first, but because he wanted to become an official, he had no choice but to hide his face and show his buttocks. (96)

### Star Six Star Chronicle Ten Zhao Meili

Most of the actors in the past had stage names, such as Little Calling Heaven, White Peony, Little Cuihua, etc., which had absolutely no characters in common with their real names. There is also a type that retains their surname but changes their given name, such as Mei Lan, whose courtesy name is Wanhua and stage name is Lanfang, I need not say more.

The names used by dancers in dance halls are also mostly taken separately. If we analyze the origin of their naming using a classification method, it probably falls into three categories: the first is to use common names, such as Sister, Brother, Yuanyuan, Baobao, and the like. The second is to copy the names of other established artists, such as Yanyan, Ying, Lanfang, and the like. The third is to adopt Westernized names, such as Anna, Manly, Lily, and the like, which are simply homophones. As for names like Xu Hong and Mi Lin, they can be regarded as special cases, and probably only people with some literacy can come up with them.

Zhao Meili's name, of course, belongs to the Westernized homophone category. I know three people who use the name Meili or Manly: one surnamed Chen, one surnamed Yu, and one surnamed Zhao, all of whom can be called red stars. There may be others, but I don't know. Chen Manly has already become famous in the dance world, Yu Meili is also like the rising sun in the sky, and Zhao Meili is like a tender bud about to bloom, and now is the time when it is blooming vigorously. Little girl, go forward well.

Zhao Meili has two older sisters, the eldest named Suqin and the second named Suyan, both of whom are quiet and gentle. But Meili is innocent and lively, and can talk well. Once, she suddenly asked me: When the British and Germans fight, who is wrong? Then she said she wanted to eat gummy candies.

### "Girls' Apartment" Aground

— Taibai

When Chen Keng was producing "Girls' Apartment," he originally planned to invite all the "honorary cast" to the screen. This plan was quite ambitious. But things didn't go as planned. For example, Xia Xia was an actor from Xinhua, and the procedures for borrowing actors were very troublesome. Wu Mei was busy with the charity performance of "Working Women" at the time, and didn't have time either. Only Lan Lan, Chuan William, and Yelu participated in the performance. However, it has already had a great effect in publicity. Plus Lu Ming and Xu Qinfang playing Guanying and Liu Lizhu, the cast of "Girls' Apartment" is also quite neat.

The authorities of Yihua Company also attached great importance to this film, and had already decided to release it on the Mid-Autumn Festival. But with time running out today, it is said that "Girls' Apartment" still has two very important scenes that have not been started, and the photography studio is busy with the work of "Wang Baochuan" instead. Originally, "Wang Baochuan" was also a mega-production that Yihua invested heavily in. For Zhang Cuihong's Wang Baochuan, Yan Youxiang traveled between Shanghai and Hong Kong, and there was also a rumor that Li Qinian was hired at a high price. Therefore, according to general speculation, perhaps because Xinhua is releasing Chen Yunshang's "One Night Empress" on Mid-Autumn Festival, Yihua also wants to use "Wang Baochuan" to counter "ancient costume" with "ancient costume." This speculation is indeed very reasonable, but friends close to Wu Cun say that the scripts for the two scenes of "Driving the Barrier" and "Great Ascension Hall" in "Wang Baochuan" are still being rushed to write. From this point of view, it is not very certain that "Wang Baochuan" will be released on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

And Yihua's completed new film, "The Swallow Thief," is being released today, and there is also a "Hong Kong Singing Girl." During this lucrative Mid-Autumn Festival, which film will be released ultimately depends on the final decision in the next two days.
